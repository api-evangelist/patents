title: Techniques for developing portal snippets using an integrated development environment (IDE)
abstract: Techniques for developing applications for various frameworks. An IDE is provided comprising user-selectable options for building applications for a first framework and also for building applications for a portal based upon a second framework different from the first framework. The portal applications for the portal based upon the second framework may be developed using a language supported by the first framework. User-selectable options provided by the IDE also enable deployment of the portal applications to the portal. A single IDE can be used to develop applications for different frameworks. For example, Visual Studio .NET may be used to develop applications for the .NET framework and also to develop and deploy portal applications (e.g., portal snippets) for a portal based upon a Java-based framework such as J2EE. The portal snippets may be developed using a .NET language.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCES TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The present application incorporates herein by reference for all purposes the entire contents of the following applications:","(1) U.S. Non-Provisional patent application Ser. No. 10\/853,0244 (pending) entitled \u201cPORTAL RUNTIME FRAMEWORK\u201d filed concurrently with the present application;","(2) U.S. Non-Provisional patent application Ser. No. 10\/851,462 (pending) entitled \u201cDISPLAYING PORTALS INFORMATION\u201d filed concurrently with the present application; and","(3) U.S. Non-Provisional patent application Ser. No. 10\/851,469 (pending) entitled \u201cTECHNIQUES FOR ACCESSING PORTAL COMPONENTS\u201d filed concurrently with the present application.","The present invention relates to tools for developing applications for different frameworks, and more specifically to techniques that enable a developer to use an integrated development environment to build and deploy portal applications for different frameworks.","Various computing frameworks or platforms have evolved over the years in the computer industry. Examples of such computing frameworks include the .NET computing framework (.NET platform) from Microsoft Corporation, Java-based frameworks such as the Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE) framework from Sun Microsystems, Inc., and others. Each framework can be considered a group (sometime called a \u201cstack\u201d) of common services that each framework provides to applications that are built with or run on the framework.","The .NET framework is a framework provided by Microsoft for programming support for web services that provide a user the ability to use the Web rather than the user's computer for various services. The .NET framework provides users with a Web-enabled interface for applications and computing devices and makes computing activities increasingly Web browser-oriented. The .NET framework includes servers; building-block services, such as Web-based data storage, and device software. The .NET framework also enables developers to create reusable modules that can be used in the .NET framework. Common Language Runtime (CLR) provides a foundation for building applications and components for the .NET framework.","The J2EE framework is a Java-based application server framework from Sun Microsystems, Inc. for the development of distributed applications. The J2EE framework is designed for simplifying application development in a multi-tiered environment by enabling users to create standardized, reusable modular components. The J2EE framework includes many components of the Java 2 Framework, Standard Edition (J2SE) framework. The J2EE framework consists of a set of services, application programming interfaces (APIs), and protocols that provide the functionality for developing multi-tiered, Web-based applications.","Each framework generally supports its own set of programming languages, design environments, programming conventions, programming methodologies, programming APIs, messaging services, security services, etc. that may be used to build applications for the specific framework. For example, the Java language is used to build applications for the J2EE framework. A Java Development Kit (JDK) is provided for building applications for the J2EE framework. Languages that can be used to build applications for the .NET framework include the C++ programming language, the C# programming language, VISUAL BASIC language, JScript, etc (referred to as the \u201c.NET languages\u201d).","The runtime environment that is needed to support and execute applications written for a particular framework also differs from the runtime environment for other frameworks. For example, a Java stack or Java Virtual Machine (JVM) running on a UNIX machine is generally needed for running applications that are built for a Java-based framework such as the J2EE framework. An Internet Information Services (IIS) Server running on a Microsoft Windows machine and CLR compilers are generally needed for running applications developed for the .NET framework.","Due to the differences in programming languages and runtime environments associated with various disparate frameworks, the design environments that are used for designing applications for the various frameworks are also different. Examples of applications and IDEs that may be used for designing applications for the Java platform include the JDK, Eclipse provided by IBM, and others. A popular IDE that is used for building applications for the .NET framework is Visual Studio .NET IDE from Microsoft Corporation.","Due to the differences in the frameworks, when an application designer desires to design applications for a particular framework (e.g., .NET framework), the designer has to select a particular language that is supported by the particular framework and also select a particular IDE that is configured for building applications for the particular framework. Since each IDE has its own specific user-selectable options (e.g., protocols, commands, APIs, menus, etc.) for designing applications, the designer has to learn the user-selectable options of the selected IDE. Now, if the designer wants to develop an application for another framework (e.g., Java-based framework), the designer has select another language that is supported by the second framework and another IDE that is configured to facilitate development of applications for the second framework.","Accordingly, if a designer wishes to build applications for separate framework, the designer is often forced to learn programming languages for each of the frameworks and also learn to use an IDE for each framework. This process of learning multiple languages and use of multiple IDEs reduces the effectiveness and efficiency of the designer in designing applications. As a result, application designers for a particular framework tend not to develop applications for some other framework.","As a specific example, enterprise portal products developed by SAP AG are built based upon a Java framework such as the J2EE framework. Consequently, applications (e.g., SAP iViews) that are developed for a SAP portal are built using Java and using a Java-based IDE such as the JDK or the ECLIPSE development environments. However, this is a major impediment for .NET developers who wish to write application components for SAP portals as the .NET developers are used to building applications using a .NET language and a .NET IDE.","In light of the above, techniques are desired that simplify the process of designing applications for different frameworks.","Embodiments of the present invention provide techniques for developing\/designing applications for various frameworks. An IDE is provided comprising user-selectable options for building applications for a first framework and also for building applications for a portal based upon a second framework different from the first framework. The portal applications for the portal based upon the second framework may be developed using a language supported by the first framework. User-selectable options provided by the IDE also enable deployment of the portal applications to the portal. As a result, a single IDE can be used to develop applications for different frameworks. The user may be a programmer or developer, a designer, or any other user of the IDE.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, techniques are provided for enabling development of portal snippets using an integrated development environment (IDE), the IDE comprising user-selectable options for developing an application for a first framework. The IDE provides a first set of user-selectable options for developing a portal snippet for a portal based upon a second framework different from the first framework. The IDE also provides a second set of user-selectable options for deploying the portal snippet to the portal.","According to another embodiment of the present invention, techniques are provided for developing a portal snippet using an integrated development environment (IDE) executing on a computer system, the IDE comprising a plurality user-selectable options, the plurality of user-selectable options including a set of user-selectable options for developing an application for a first framework. A portal snippet is developed for a portal using at least one user-selectable option from the plurality of user-selectable options, wherein the portal is configured to operate based upon a second framework different from the first framework. The portal snippet is deployed to the portal using at least one user-selectable option from the plurality of user-selectable options.","The foregoing, together with other features, embodiments, and advantages of the present invention, will become more apparent when referring to the following specification, claims, and accompanying drawings.","In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the invention. However, it will be apparent that the invention may be practiced without these specific details.","An integrated development environment (IDE) is a set of integrated tools for developing software. The tools generally run from a user interface and may comprise a compiler, an editor, a debugger, among others. An IDE may be a standalone application or may be included as part of one or more existing and compatible applications. An example of an IDE is Visual Studio .NET from Microsoft Corporation","Embodiments of the present invention provide techniques for developing applications for various frameworks. An IDE is provided that can be used to develop applications for different frameworks. An IDE configured according to the teachings of the present invention comprises user-selectable options for building applications for a first framework (e.g., the .NET framework) and also for building applications for a portal based upon a second framework (e.g., Java) different from the first framework. The user-selectable options may include menus, commands, application programming interfaces (APIs), etc. The portal applications for the portal based upon the second framework may be developed using a language supported by the first framework. User-selectable options provided by the IDE also enable deployment of the portal applications to the portal. As a result, a single IDE can be used to develop applications for different frameworks. The user may be a programmer or developer, a designer, or any other user of the IDE.","For example, according to an embodiment of the present invention, a .NET IDE such as Visual Studio .NET may be used to develop applications for the .NET framework. The capabilities of the .NET IDE are extended by providing user-selectable options that enable development of portal applications (e.g., portal snippets) that can use services provided by a portal based upon a Java-based framework (e.g., J2EE). For example, a user or designer can use a Visual Studio .NET IDE configured according to the teachings of the present invention to develop iViews (or portal snippets in general) that can be executed by a J2EE-based SAP enterprise portal. The portal snippets may be developed using a .NET language. In this manner, .NET developers may use an IDE configured according to the teachings of the present invention to develop not only .NET applications but also to develop portal snippets (e.g., SAP iViews) for a Java-based portal such as a SAP AG enterprise portal. This enables .NET developers to develop content for Java-based portals. Portal applications may also be deployed to the appropriate portals using user-selectable options provided by the IDE. Embodiments of the present invention thus facilitate creation and deployment of portal snippets to portals.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":"100"},"As depicted in , a computer system  is coupled to one or more portals -, -, and - via communication network . Communication network  may be a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), a wireless network, an Intranet, the Internet, a private network, a public network, a switched network, or any other suitable communication network. Communication network  may comprise many interconnected computer systems and communication links such as hardwire links, optical links, satellite or other wireless communications links, wave propagation links, or any other mechanisms for communication of information. Various communication protocols may be used to facilitate communication of information via communication network , including TCP\/IP, HTTP protocols, extensible markup language (XML), wireless application protocol (WAP), protocols under development by industry standard organizations, vendor-specific protocols, customized protocols, and others.","Portals  are configured to provide portal services. A portal provides a central gateway through which users can access various information sources and services\/applications. The information sources may include various applications (either internal or external to the portals), documents, sources from the Web, various databases, etc. The portals may be configured to execute on different frameworks such as Java-based frameworks (e.g., the J2EE framework), .NET framework, and others.","A portal may include several components including one or more portal pages, portal snippets, etc. A portal page may comprise one or more portal snippets that enable data to be retrieved and displayed on the portal page. Portal snippets are generally programs that retrieve data from an information resource and display it on a portal page. Accordingly, a portal snippet is a mechanism for displaying content on a portal page. Examples of portal snippets include portlets, SAP's iViews, Plumtree's gadgets, Microsoft's web parts, etc. Portals generally allow a user to select and customize portal snippets that are included in the user's portal page or pages. In this manner, the user can customize the content that is retrieved and displayed on the user's portal page.","Two characteristics are generally associated with a portal snippet: the content retrieved by the portal snippet and the manner in which the content is displayed on a portal page. With respect to the content that is retrieved, a portal snippet can be considered as an information query (or multiple queries) having one or more input parameters that is executed to retrieve information from one or more information sources. The parameters to the query and their values may be set by the portal administrator, the portal snippet designer, the user, or may be set by default. With respect to the presentation aspect, each portal snippet is typically allocated a location on a page or screen where the retrieved information is to be displayed.","When a user logs into a portal and views a portal page comprising a portal snippet, the portal snippet is automatically invoked. As a result of the invocation, the one or more parameterized queries corresponding to the portal snippet are executed to obtain the relevant information from one or more information resources. Examples of queries include a query accessing stock information, a query accessing weather information, a query to access company news, query to access a particular set of documents, etc. The retrieved information is then displayed on the section of the page allocated to the portal snippet.","Computer system  may be a personal computer (PC), a PDA, a mobile phone, or any other computing device or data processing system. According to the teachings of the present invention, computer system  is configured to execute an IDE  configured according to the teachings of the present invention. According to an embodiment of the present invention, computer system  executes an IDE that is configured to facilitate development of applications for multiple applications. For example, according to an embodiment of the present invention, computer system  may execute a Visual Studio .NET IDE that enables development of applications for .NET framework and also enables development and deployment of portal snippets for Java-based portals such as a SAP enterprise portal. According to the teachings of the present invention, IDE  is configured to provide user-selectable options (interfaces, commands, APIs, menus, etc.) that also enable development of applications for the different frameworks.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, IDE  comprises user-selectable options that enable portal snippets to be developed for a Java framework-based portal using a programming language supported by the .NET framework. For example, .NET languages such as C#, VB.NET, J#, C++, ASP.NET, etc. may be used to develop portal snippets for Java-based portals. Further details related to the user-selectable options provided by IDE  are described below.","Software modules (e.g., software code, instructions) executed by computer system  and\/or hardware modules of computer system  may provide the IDE functionality according to the teachings of the present invention. It should be apparent that in a distributed environment IDE  may also be executed by a plurality of computers and the interfaces of the IDE may be displayed on computer system .

The user may then add a portal component to the SAP project created in step  (step ). According to an embodiment of the present invention, the portal component is a portal snippet that can use the services of a Java framework based portal such as the SAP portal.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, the services provided by the Java framework-based portal (that are implemented in Java language) are exposed through a NET type API. For examples, in one embodiment, .NET compatible API wrappers are provided for the Java language APIs. As a result, as part of step , the user may program the portal snippet for a Java-based portal using a .NET programming language such as the C# programming language, the VB.NET programming language, etc using .NET APIs. This enables .NET programmers who are not well-versed with Java programming to be able to develop content and applications for Java-framework-based portals.","The user may then add a SAP portal server to which the portal snippet developed in step  is to be deployed (step ). Alternatively, if one or more portals have already been added to the IDE, as part of step , the user may select a particular portal for deployment. In one embodiment, this may be done by selecting the portal and marking\/designating the selection as the \u201ccurrent\u201d portal.","The user may then add one or more systems for the portal server added in step  (step ).

For example, as depicted in , the user may add a portal system by checking a checkbox  corresponding to the portal system to be added. The checked systems are then added upon selecting \u201cOK\u201d button . Graphical user interface  depicted in  displays the information in a tree view format. Graphical user interface  depicted in  displays the information in a list view format.","An IDE configured according to the teachings of the present invention also provides several user-selectable options for deploying a portal snippet to a SAP portal. During deployment, files related to a project including the portal snippet are packaged as a portal archive (PAR) and the PAR is then communicated to the portal for subsequent use. According to one technique, the user or designer may deploy a portal component or portal snippet by selecting a portal project and then selecting \u201cDeploy\u201d option  from menu , as depicted in . Alternatively, the user may select a project in Solution Explorer window , invoke menu  by right clicking the mouse, and then select \u201cDeploy\u201d option  from menu . The deployment operations may also be performed using an SAP toolbar.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, as part of the deployment process, a portal archive (PAR) is created and then deployed to the portal.  depicts a graphical user interface  for creating a PAR according to an embodiment of the present invention. As depicted in , the user can identify the project for which a PAR is to be created in field . A name for the PAR may be specified in field . The user can specify whether the PAR is to be saved in the current project directory or a custom directory by selecting an appropriate option . The custom directory, if selected, may be specified in field . The user may use option  to specify whether the PAR to be created is to overwrite an existing PAR. The user may also specify the files to be included in a PAR. The user may use option  to specify whether source files are to be included in the PAR. The user may select option  to indicate whether or not debug files and symbols are to be included in the PAR.","Information identifying the portal to which the PAR is to be deployed may be specified in section  of graphical user interface . The user may specify the name  of the portal instance corresponding to the portal, host  of the portal, port number  for the portal, user access role , and password  for the portal. Selection of \u201cOK\u201d button  creates a PAR per the user-specified information.","Properties set for a project may also influence the manner in which a PAR is created.  depicts a graphical user interface  that may be used for setting properties for a project that affect (or are used for) PAR creation according to an embodiment of the present invention. As depicted in , a plurality of project properties and their values are displayed. The user may set\/change the property values to suit the user's needs. For example, the user may specify the name of the PAR in field . A user may specify if source files and debug files\/symbols are to be included in the PAR by selecting options  and  respectively. The user can specify whether the PAR is to be saved in the current project directory or a custom directory by selecting an appropriate option . The custom directory, if selected, may be specified in field . The user may use option  to specify whether the PAR to be created is to overwrite an existing PAR. Selection of \u201cOK\u201d button  sets the user-specified values for the project properties. Selection of \u201cReset\u201d button  resets the values of the displayed properties to their default options.","As part of the deployment process for a project, all relevant files for the project are copied from the project storage location to a temporary directory and a PAR is created based upon the files. The relevant files may include source files, debug files, etc. Properties associated with the project and other user-specified configurations may be used to determine the relevant files to be included in a PAR.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, an XML file (e.g., a PortalApp.xml file) is also automatically created as part of the deployment process. The XML file holds the configurable properties for a project and a portal snippet that is being deployed. According to an embodiment of the present invention, the XML describes the portal components that are in the PAR (it is a part of the output of the project and not the project itself).","The PAR (from the specified location) is then deployed to the specified portal. For example, the PAR may be deployed to a Java-based portal such as a SAP AG enterprise portal server. According to an embodiment of the present invention, HTTP protocol is used to communicate with the portal. For example, an HTTPWebRequest is use to communicate with the portal and the binary PAR file is sent on the request stream. The XML file may also be communicated to the portal as part of the PAR. Other communication protocols may also be used in alternative embodiments.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, the status of the deployment process may be output to the user.  depicts a status window  that outputs deployment status information according to an embodiment of the present invention. As depicted in , the status window may display details of the portal to which the PAR is deployed, status information of the deployment process, and other deployment-related information.","An IDE configured according to the teachings of the present invention also provides user-selectable options for debugging and launching a portal component.

The IDE also provides user-selectable options that enable a user to launch a portal component and preview it without having to launch the whole portal to which the portal component is deployed. For example, a \u201cView in Browser\u201d menu item may be provided in the project context menu.","As described above, embodiments of the present invention extend the capabilities of an IDE by providing user-selectable options that enable a user to use the IDE to develop applications for a first framework (e.g., .NET) and to develop portal snippets for a portal based upon a second framework such as a Java-based framework (e.g., J2EE). The portal snippets may be developed using a language supported by the first framework. For example, .NET developers may use an IDE configured according to the teachings of the present invention to develop not only .NET applications but also to develop portal snippets (e.g., SAP iViews) for a Java-based portal such as a SAP AG enterprise portal. The portal snippet may be programmed using a .NET language instead of Java language. This enables .NET developers to create content for SAP portals. According to the teachings of the present invention, user-selectable options provided by the IDE may also be used to deploy portal snippets to portals. Embodiments of the present invention thus facilitate creation and deployment of portal snippets to portals.","Although specific embodiments of the invention have been described, various modifications, alterations, alternative constructions, and equivalents are also encompassed within the scope of the invention. The described invention is not restricted to operation within certain specific data processing environments, but is free to operate within a plurality of data processing environments.
