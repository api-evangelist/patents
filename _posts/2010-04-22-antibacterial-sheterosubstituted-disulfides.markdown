Antibiotic resistance refers to the ability of a microorganism to avoid the harmful effects of an antibiotic by destroying the antibiotic, transporting it out of the cell, or undergoing changes that block its effects. Frequent exposure of a microorganism to an antibiotic provides conditions favorable to the evolution of antibiotic resistance.","MRSA is a type of resistant to certain antibiotics including methicillin and the more common antibiotics such as oxacillin, penicillin, and amoxicillin. MRSA incidence is on the rise in the U.S. and it has now become recognized as a major community-acquired pathogen.","This invention addresses the severe need for new classes of antibacterial antibiotics for treatment of methicillin-resistant infections of (MRSA) which is of epidemic concern due to their lethality and difficulty in treating in hospitals and in the open community.","The present invention provides compounds, methods and compositions effective to treat bacterial infections, and, especially, infections arising from bacteria which have developed resistance to conventional antibiotics. These S-heterosubstituted disulfide compounds, synthetically-derived substances prepared in our laboratory, have novel chemical structures and potent in vitro antibacterial activity against MRSA. The mechanism of action of these compounds is thought to be similar, based on the structural and chemical similarities, to that of previously reported N-thiolated beta-lactams (N-alkylthio beta-lactams), which have been shown to create alkyl-CoA disulfides through a thiol-disulfide exchange within the cytoplasm ultimately inhibiting type II fatty acid synthesis. Given this mode of action in inhibiting fatty acid biosynthesis, the antibacterial activity of the compounds, as observed against and methicillin-resistant , would extend to a wide cross-section of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, including , as well as serving as an antimicrobial against microbes such as fungi.","In accordance with the present invention there is provided a compound having the formula (I):\n\nRXSSXR\u2003\u2003(I)\n","Each of Xand Xof compound (I) can be O, N, NH, or S, with Xand Xnot necessarily the same as one-another.

The compounds may or may not be symmetrical in their substitution, so by way of example, CHO\u2014S\u2014S\u2014OCHcould be one version of a symmetrical compound, while additional compounds can be of the form CHO\u2014S\u2014S\u2014OCHCHor CHO\u2014S\u2014S\u2014NHCH, thus adopting asymmetric hetero substituted groups.","The evidence indicates that the compounds block bacterial growth and replication by inhibiting fatty acid biosynthesis in the microorganism, though the details of the mode of action remains to be fully elucidated. The compounds of the present invention may therefore be used to prevent, alleviate, or cure diseases caused by pathogens whose growth is inhibited by these compounds. The instant compounds are particularly active against bacteria and bacteria-like microorganisms. They are therefore proposed for use in human and veterinary medicine, for the prophylaxis and chemotherapy of local and systemic infections caused by these pathogens. As used herein, the terms \u201ctreat\u201d, \u201ctreating\u201d, and \u201ctreatment\u201d include therapy that alleviates one or more symptoms caused by the infection, or that cures the underlying infection. As used herein, the terms \u201cprevent\u201d, \u201cpreventing\u201d, and \u201cprevention\u201d include prophylaxis, complete prevention, or delaying onset of the infection or delaying onset of one or more symptoms caused by the infection. Optionally, the method further comprises identifying the human or non-human subject as one suffering from a specific or non-specific bacterial infection. The presence of bacterial infection can be determined using methods known to those of ordinary skill in the art of clinical diagnosis of disease (e.g., infectious disease).","The invention further encompasses methods for inhibiting the growth of bacteria by contacting the bacteria with an effective amount of the compounds of the invention in vitro or in vivo, or by applying the compound to a substrate (surface) likely to come in contact with the bacteria, such as a work surface, table, surgical instrument, implant or other device to be placed in or on the body (i.e., foreign object to be inserted into a subject, such as a stent, catheter, access port, intravenous delivery tube, heart valve, dental implant, electro-mechanical device, prosthetic device, glucose sensor, or stabilizing device such as orthopedic nails and pins), eating or cooking utensil, etc. Because of their powerful antibacterial properties, the present compounds may also be used to supplement feed for animals.","In addition, the compounds of the present invention that exhibit antibacterial activity may also be used as medicaments, and also as substances for preserving inorganic and organic materials, especially organic materials of all kinds, for example, polymers, lubricants, paints, fibers, leather, paper, timber, foodstuffs, and water. For example, these compounds can be covalently bonded to the polymer.","The term \u201cadministration\u201d and variants thereof (e.g., \u201cadministering\u201d a compound) in reference to a compound of the invention means introducing the compound or a prodrug of the compound into the system of the animal in need of treatment. When a compound of the invention or prodrug thereof is provided in combination with one or more other active agents, \u201cadministration\u201d and its variants are each understood to include concurrent and sequential introduction of the compound or prodrug thereof and other agents.","The term \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d as used herein means that amount of active compound or pharmaceutical agent that elicits the biological or medicinal response in a tissue, system, animal or human that is being sought by a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician. In reference to a microbial infection, an effective amount comprises an amount sufficient to kill or inhibit the growth and replication of the microbe. In some embodiments, an effective amount is an amount sufficient to delay development. In some embodiments, an effective amount is an amount sufficient to prevent or delay occurrence and\/or recurrence. An effective amount can be administered in one or more doses.","As used herein, \u201ctreatment\u201d refers to obtaining beneficial or desired clinical results. Beneficial or desired clinical results include, but are not limited to, any one or more of: alleviation of one or more symptoms, diminishment of extent of infection, stabilization (i.e., not worsening) of the state of infection, preventing or delaying spread of the disease (such as pathogen growth or replication), preventing or delaying occurrence or recurrence of the disease, delay or slowing of disease progression and amelioration of the disease state. The methods of the invention contemplate any one or more of these aspects of treatment.","A \u201csubject in need of treatment\u201d is a mammal with a microbial infection that is life-threatening or that impairs health or shortens the lifespan of the mammal.","A \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable\u201d component is one that is suitable for use with humans and\/or animals without undue adverse side effects (such as toxicity, irritation, and allergic response) commensurate with a reasonable benefit\/risk ratio.","A \u201csafe and effective amount\u201d refers to the quantity of a component that is sufficient to yield a desired therapeutic response without undue adverse side effects (such as toxicity, irritation, or allergic response) commensurate with a reasonable benefit\/risk ratio when used in the manner of this invention.","A \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable carrier\u201d is a carrier, such as a solvent, suspending agent or vehicle, for delivering the compound or compounds in question to the animal or human. The carrier may be liquid or solid and is selected with the planned manner of administration in mind. Liposomes are also a pharmaceutical carrier. As used herein, \u201ccarrier\u201d includes any and all solvents, dispersion media, vehicles, coatings, diluents, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents, buffers, carrier solutions, suspensions, colloids, and the like. The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutical active substances is well known in the art. Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible with the active ingredient, its use in the therapeutic compositions is contemplated.","The compounds of the present invention include all hydrates and salts of the S-heterosubstituted disulfides that can be prepared by those of skill in the art. Under conditions where the compounds of the present invention are sufficiently basic or acidic to form stable nontoxic acid or base salts, administration of the compounds as salts may be appropriate. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts are organic acid addition salts formed with acids which form a physiological acceptable anion, for example, tosylate, methanesulfonate, acetate, citrate, malonate, tartarate, succinate, benzoate, ascorbate, alpha-ketoglutarate, and alpha-glycerophosphate. Suitable inorganic salts may also be formed, including hydrochloride, sulfate, nitrate, bicarbonate, and carbonate salts. When reference is made to a compound or administering a compound, the recitation of the compound includes a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.","Pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be obtained using standard procedures well known in the art, for example by reacting a sufficiently basic compound such as an amine with a suitable acid affording a physiologically acceptable anion. Alkali metal (for example, sodium, potassium or lithium) or alkaline earth metal (for example calcium) salts of carboxylic acids can also be made.","The compounds of the present invention can be formulated as pharmaceutical compositions and administered to a patient, such as a human patient, in a variety of forms adapted to the chosen route of administration, e.g., orally or parenterally, by intravenous, intramuscular, topical, or subcutaneous routes.","Thus, the present compounds may be systemically administered, e.g., orally, in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle such as an inert diluent or an assimilable edible carrier. They may be enclosed in hard or soft shell gelatin capsules, may be compressed into tablets, or may be incorporated directly with the food of the patient's diet. For oral therapeutic administration, the active compound may be combined with one or more excipients and used in the form of ingestible tablets, buccal tablets, troches, capsules, elixirs, suspensions, syrups, wafers, and the like. The amount of active compound in such therapeutically useful compositions is such that an effective dosage level will be obtained.","The tablets, troches, pills, capsules, and the like may also contain the following: binders such as gum tragacanth, acacia, corn starch or gelatin; excipients such as dicalcium phosphate; a disintegrating agent such as corn starch, potato starch, alginic acid and the like; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate; and a sweetening agent such as sucrose, fructose, lactose or aspartame or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen, or cherry flavoring may be added. When the unit dosage form is a capsule, it may contain, in addition to materials of the above type, a liquid carrier, such as a vegetable oil or a polyethylene glycol. Various other materials may be present as coatings or to otherwise modify the physical form of the solid unit dosage form. For instance, tablets, pills, or capsules may be coated with gelatin, wax, shellac or sugar and the like. A syrup or elixir may contain the active compound, sucrose or fructose as a sweetening agent, methyl and propylparabens as preservatives, a dye and flavoring such as cherry or orange flavor. Of course, any material used in preparing any unit dosage form should be pharmaceutically acceptable and substantially non-toxic in the amounts employed. In addition, the active compound may be incorporated into sustained-release preparations and devices.","The active compound may also be administered intravenously or intraperitoneally by infusion or injection. Solutions of the active compound or its salts can be prepared in water or other suitable solvent, optionally mixed with a nontoxic surfactant. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols, triacetin, and mixtures thereof and in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use, these preparations contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms.","The pharmaceutical dosage forms suitable for injection or infusion can include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions or sterile powders comprising the active ingredient which are adapted for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable or infusible solutions or dispersions, optionally encapsulated in liposomes. In all cases, the ultimate dosage form must be sterile, fluid and stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage. The liquid carrier or vehicle can be a solvent or liquid dispersion medium comprising, for example, water, ethanol, a polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, liquid polyethylene glycols, and the like), vegetable oils, nontoxic glyceryl esters, and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the formation of liposomes, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions or by the use of surfactants. The prevention of the action of microorganisms can be brought about by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, buffers or sodium chloride. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by the use in the compositions of agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin.","Sterile injectable solutions are prepared by incorporating the active compound in the required amount in the appropriate solvent with several of the other ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filter sterilization. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and the freeze drying techniques, which yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient presenting the previously sterile-filtered solutions.","For topical administration, the present compounds may be applied in pure-form, i.e., when they are liquids. However, it will generally be desirable to administer them to the skin as compositions or formulations, in combination with a dermatologically acceptable carrier, which may be a solid or a liquid.","Useful solid carriers include finely divided solids such as talc, clay, microcrystalline cellulose, silica, alumina and the like. Useful liquid carriers include water, alcohols or glycols or water-alcohol\/glycol blends, in which the present compounds can be dissolved or dispersed at effective levels, optionally with the aid of non-toxic surfactants. Adjuvants such as fragrances and additional antimicrobial agents can be added to optimize the properties for a given use. The resultant liquid compositions can be applied from adsorbent pads, used to impregnate bandages and other dressings, or sprayed onto the affected area using pump-type or aerosol sprayers.","Thickeners such as synthetic polymers, fatty acids, fatty acid salts and esters, fatty alcohols, modified celluloses or modified mineral materials can also be employed with liquid carriers to form spreadable pastes, gels, ointments, soaps, and the like, for application directly to the skin of the user. Examples of useful dermatological compositions which can be used to deliver the compounds of the invention to the skin are disclosed in Jacquet et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,608,392), Geria (U.S. Pat. No. 4,992,478), Smith et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,559,157) and Wortzman (U.S. Pat. No. 4,820,508).","Useful dosages of the compounds of the present invention can be determined by comparing their in vitro activity, and in vivo activity in animal models. Methods for the extrapolation of effective dosages in mice, and other animals, to humans are known to the art (U.S. Pat. No. 4,938,949 (Borch et al.)).","Accordingly, the invention includes a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the present invention as described above, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Pharmaceutical compositions adapted for oral, topical or parenteral administration, comprising an amount of one or more compounds effective to treat a bacterial infection, are a preferred embodiment of the invention.","The following definitions are used, unless otherwise described.

The compounds of the invention were evaluated against and methicillin-resistant bacteria strains (i.e. strains ATCC-849 and ATCC-919, respectively) by determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC, \u03bcg\/ml) of each compound with respect to each strain. The MIC, or minimum inhibitory concentration, is the lowest concentration of antibiotic which inhibits growth of the test organism, and was determined for the synthesized compounds by the agar dilution method. A control plate with a reference drug, penicillin G, was used as the control.","As can be seen in the table, many of the synthesized compounds were as effective, or more effective, against MRSA than the Penicillin G control, even if they were not as effective as the control against ","While not intending to be bound to a particular theory, the mechanism of action of these compounds is thought to be similar, based on the structural and chemical similarities, to that of previously reported N-thiolated beta-lactams (N-alkylthio beta-lactams), which have been shown to create alkyl-CoA disulfides through a thiol-disulfide exchange within the cytoplasm ultimately inhibiting type II fatty acid synthesis. These compounds may also be characterized as essentially \u201cstable\u201d analogues of natural disulfides obtained from garlic and onions, which are fatty acid biosynthesis inhibitors. Given this mode of action in inhibiting fatty acid biosynthesis, the antibacterial activity of the compounds, as observed against and methicillin-resistant , would extend to a wide cross-section of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, including , as well as fungi.","These structurally-simple disulfides serve as effective antibacterials for drug-resistant staph infections.","Bioactivity was tested by agar dilution assay against the live vaccine strain of using a broth dilution technique. The results of the test are presented in Table 3. As can be seen from the table, most of the twenty synthesized compounds were effective against the strain at dilutions lower than the ciprofloxacin
