title: System and unified setting interface for configuring network manageable devices
abstract: A unified setting interface that enables a management application to configure network manageable devices, regardless of their type or manufacturer. Configuration of a network manageable device requires that certain information be provided to the network manageable device. For different types of devices from different manufacturers, this information and its format can vary. A management application using the unified setting interface does not require the individual interfaces for configuring network manageable devices from different manufacturers.

No. 10\/986,831, filed on Nov. 15, 2004, which claims priority to the Provisional Application Ser. No. 60\/545,935 filed on Feb. 20, 2004, pursuant to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7111(b). The Provisional Application Ser. No. 60\/545,935 and the U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/986,831 is herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.","1. Technical Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to computer network maintenance tools, and more particularly, to a maintenance tool for configuring network manageable devices of a computer network.","2. Description of the Related Art","Recent market research has shown that consumer demand for local networking is driven by the rapid growth of the Internet, high-speed Internet connections and multiple household personal computers (PCs). Local networks are designed to allow PCs, peripheral devices, and other consumer electronic devices to share voice and data over a single network. Local networks may be a local area network (LAN) or wireless LAN (WLAN).","Setting up a local network requires users to provide information about how to configure the computers, firewalls, Ethernet settings and addresses, file sharing, printer sharing, Internet connection sharing, wireless addresses and other parameters specific to a particular local network. The setup of a network requires configuring the network manageable devices properly, and the configuration of the manageable devices is managed through user interface software. The user interface software (hereinafter the \u201csetting interface\u201d) allows a network administrator or user to configure and manage a single network manageable device. Network administrators or users expect the setting interface to be navigable, quick and safe. The setting interface should enable a novice network administrator or novice user to perform routine operations, to permit a user to tackle a network problem with a timely response, to enforce privilege levels and reconfirm commands that impact service.","Conventional setting interfaces comprise monitor prompts for setting registers, form-based dialogs, menu-based systems, command languages and natural-language parsers. Typically, for the purpose of configuring a network manageable device, the access to the network manageable device is through a Telnet connection, a hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) connection or a simple network management protocol (SNMP) connection. The setting interface and the access to a network manageable device are generally controlled by a management application installed in each of the computing devices that communicates with the network manageable device.","Presently, setting interfaces are not standardized by the networking industry, thus each vendor provides a different set of device specific commands to set the network manageable device and a different form of connection to access the network manageable device. In many instances, the same set of device-specific commands cannot be used on all of the network manageable devices.","To date, a large number of setting interfaces are provided allowing the configuration and management of different types of network manageable devices. The lack of a standardized setting interface requires the users (e.g., system administrators or technical support personnel) to be familiar with the various setting interfaces. Furthermore, the lack of a standardized setting interface limits the ability to develop a generic application programming interface (API) for management applications to manage and configure the various types of network manageable devices.","Therefore, in the view of the foregoing discussion, it would be advantageous to provide a generic solution that would allow management applications to configure, through a single interface, network manageable devices regardless their type and manufacture.","The invention has been made in view of the above circumstances and to overcome the above problems and limitations of the prior art, and to provide methods, software and apparatuses for the management of network manageable devices that use a plurality of different management applications to manage one or more network devices that are connected to a hard-wired or wireless network.","Additional aspects and advantages of the invention will be set forth in part in the description that follows and in part will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention.

The method embodied in the computer executable code is utilized for the purpose of a first time setup of the network manageable devices, detecting malfunctions in the network manageable devices and providing a unified environment for configuring a plurality of network manageable devices.","The above and other aspects and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following detailed description and with reference to the accompanying drawing figures.","The present invention provides unified setting interface (USI) that enables a management application to configure network manageable devices through a single interface, without regard to their type or manufacturer. Configuration of a network manageable device requires that certain information be provided to that device. For different types and manufacturers of devices, this information and the format of the information can vary. A management application requires only an implementation of the unified setting interface, not the individual interfaces for the various network manageable devices, to configure one or more network manageable devices of different types and\/or from different manufacturers. The network manageable devices include, but are not limited to, wired or wireless bridges, routers, hubs, gateways, switches, printers, DVD players, MP3 players or any other manageable device that is connected to a network, either through a physical connection (Ethernet, optical fiber, twisted pair, etc.) or through a wireless connection (IEEE 802.11 standard, WiFi, Bluetooth, etc.).","Referring to , a non-limiting local network  that illustrates an embodiment of the present invention is shown. In this configuration network  is composed of a local area network (LAN) and a wireless LAN (WLAN). The WLAN may be based on the IEEE 802.11 standard, WiFi, Bluetooth, infrared or other suitable networking standards and methodologies. Network  comprises a wireless router -, a network switch -, a plurality of terminals -, -, -that are connected to the network switch - by a wire connection, and a plurality of wireless terminals -, -, -that are connected to the wireless router - by a wireless connection. The terminals  and the wireless terminals  may be, but are not limited to, personal computers (PCs), personal digital assistants (PDAs), handheld computers, tablet computers, notebook computers and any other type of handheld or personal wireless electronic device. Network  further includes access to the Internet. In the illustrative network , modem  is a broadband modem (xDSL, cable, optical, satellite, etc.) that provides access to the Internet, but other types of linkages could be used as well to provide Internet access.","In network , different manufacturers manufacture the wireless router - and the network switch -. For example, wireless network - might be a Linksys\u2122 router, while network switch - might be a Belkin\u00ae switch. Each network manageable device has a different set of configurable parameters and a different type of interface. Therefore, in order to communicate with the wireless router - and the network switch -, a management application would have to implement at least two different interfaces. Furthermore, user intervention is required in order to determine the type of the accessed manageable device and its respective interface.","The unified setting interface provides a single interface through which a management application accesses and configures a plurality of network manageable devices, i.e., the wireless router - and the network switch -. The unified setting interface is utilized through a setting diagnostic agent (SDA)  installed in one or more of the terminals  and wireless terminals . The setting diagnostic agent can be installed in any terminal that can execute the management applications. The setting diagnostic agent  automatically identifies a network manageable device (wireless router - and network switch -) and detects its type, firmware version, vendor, manufacture name and other attributes that uniquely identify the network manageable device. The setting diagnostic agent  further retrieves the configurable parameters of the network manageable device and generates the unified setting interface for the management application.","The generation of the unified setting interface is performed by: a) accessing a network manageable device; b) retrieving the description and the configuration parameters of the network manageable device; c) giving each configuration parameter a unique name regardless of the type of network manageable device; and d) providing a common set of commands through which the management applications configure the plurality of network manageable devices. For the generation of the unified setting interface, the present invention uses regular expressions and manageable device scripts as will be described in greater detailed below. The setting diagnostic agent  stores the regular expressions, the manageable device scripts and configuration data required to manage the network manageable devices in memory, or more preferably, in a database. The regular expressions and the manageable device scripts are not provided by the vendors of the network manageable devices or the vendors of the management applications, but instead are created by the network user or network administrator. It is foreseen, however, that the vendors of the network manageable devices or the vendors of the management applications could provide the regular expressions, manageable device scripts and configuration data required for managing the network manageable devices to network users. The regular expressions, manageable device scripts and configuration data could be provided on a variety of different computer-readable media to the network user or network administrator, or could be available for downloading to the setting diagnostic agent  via a hard-wired or wireless connection.","In exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the unified setting interface is similar to an application programming interface (API) through which all management applications use for the purpose of interacting with the network manageable devices. Specifically, the unified setting interface allows the management application to retrieve and modify configurable parameters in a network manageable device. The setting diagnostic agent  communicates with the network manageable devices (wireless router - and network switch -, the printer ) using the connection format utilized by the network manageable devices. The connection formats include, but are not limited to, Telnet, HTTP, SNMP, universal plug and play (UPnP) protocol and others. For example, the printer  is a networked printer that may be configured through the UPnP protocol","The unified setting interface is automatically modified if a network manageable device is added or removed from the network For example, once the setting diagnostic agent detects a new connection with a network manageable device, the configuration information of the device is added to the unified setting interface. If a connection is broken, the configuration information of the network manageable device is removed from the unified setting interface.","One skilled in the art will appreciate that the components of setting diagnostic agent  described herein may be hardware components, firmware components, software components or combinations thereof","Referring to , a non-limiting functional diagram of the setting diagnostic agent  in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention is shown. Preferably, the setting diagnostic agent  comprises a unified setting interface , a database (DB) , a request generator , a response processor  and a device interface . The response processor  comprises a regular expression engine (REE)  and a parser . The response processor  and the database  support the provision of network device parameters to the unified setting interface . The request generator  and the database  support the modification of network device parameters through the unified setting interface . The management applications -, - and -access a plurality of manageable devices -, -, - and -through the unified setting interface . The plurality of network manageable devices -, -, - and -is connected to the device interface .","The request generator  generates a submission request (e.g., HTTP requests) to modify the network manageable device's parameters. Specifically, the request generator  executes manageable device scripts that are used to create the submission requests in a format compliant with a specific network manageable device. A management application sends a device request to the unified setting interface , which in turn forwards the device request to the request generator . The database  is searched for the manageable device script(s) associated with the particular network manageable device identified by the unified setting interface . A manageable device script is designed to generate a submission request for a specific type of network manageable device. For example, a manageable device script can generate a string buffer based on previously obtained router parameters or parameters requested to be modified. The parameters are inserted to the resulting string buffer using the commands \u201c%VAR_NAME%\u201d or \u201c$PARAM_NAME$\u201d, where the \u201cVAR_NAME\u201d refers to the previously obtained parameter and \u201cPARAM_NAME\u201d refers to the modified parameter. For example, the manageable device script \u201cabc%PARAM1%def\u201d results a string buffer \u201cabc123def\u201d where the value of PARAM1 is \u201c123\u201d. The manageable device scripts may further include a set of predefined conditions and functions. The parameters to be modified and their new values are received through unified setting interface , while the manageable device script to be executed is obtained from database . Preferably, the request generator  only generates submission requests for the purpose of modifying a parameter (or parameters) of a network manageable device.","As discussed above, the response processor  can be comprised of a parser  and a regular expression engine . The parser  parses the responses sent from the network manageable device. For example, if the network manageable device - responds to a submission request with a hypertext markup language (HTML) page, then the parser  parses the HTML page to extract the HTML tags, which are then passed to regular expression engine . The parser  sends a request to get the HTML page by sending the universal resource locator (URL) of the page to the network manageable device. The URL to be sent is retrieved from database . The regular expression engine  may be a state machine that supports data extraction. The regular expression engine  detects the network manageable device type, identifies its configurable parameters and extracts their values using a plurality of regular expressions. For example, if the response processor were commanded to retrieve a specific HTML page that contains a vendor name, the parser  would request the HTML page (through a URL retrieved from the database ). The network manageable device sends the requested HTML page back to the parser , which parses it and extracts the name of the vendor using the regular expression engine .","A regular expression allows the detection of a single network manageable device or the extraction of the value of a single configurable parameter. As an example, the following regular expression is used to find the value of an \u201cINPUT\u201d HTML tag:\n\n<input[^>]*name=\u201c?username[^>]*value=\u201d(?<WAN Username>[^\u2033]*)[^>]*>\n","This regular expression extracts the value of an \u201cINPUT\u201d HTML tag with the name \u201cusername\u201d, e.g., <input name=\u201cusername\u201d length=4 value=\u201cabcd\u201d>. The value of this HTML tag (i.e., \u201cabcd\u201d) is saved in the variable \u201cWAN_Username\u201d. The extracted parameters and their values are passed to the unified setting interface . The specific regular expression to be used is obtained from database .","The device interface  allows the communication with the network manageable devices  using the respective communication protocol used to access each of the network manageable devices . The manageable device scripts generated by the request generator  are sent to the device interface  for distribution to the intended network manageable device. Responses from the network manageable devices are sent through the device interface  to the response processor , which is discussed in more detail below. As mentioned above, the device interface  communicates with the network manageable devices using at least one of the following protocols, i.e., Telnet, HTTP, SNMP and UPnP. In a Telnet connection, text commands are submitted through a command line interface (CLI). In a HTTP connection, the device interface  submits and retrieves the device parameters from multiple web pages (e.g., HTML pages), where each web page typically includes a group of configurable parameters having the same functionality. Each such web page is accessed through a different URL. The SNMP connection is utilized through a SN1v1P agent installed in the network manageable device. A SNMP agent mediates access to the configurable parameters of a device through management information base (MIB) messages. That is, the device interface  interacts with the SNMP agent by exchanging MIB messages. The UPnP protocol allows controlling and configuring manageable devices though a submission of XML messages. It should be noted that these connection formats are exemplary only and should not be viewed as limiting the scope of the disclosed invention.","As described in greater detail above, the unified setting interface  provides a single and common interface for all management applications that interact with the network manageable devices  via setting diagnostic agent . The unified setting interface  maintains at least the configurable parameters and the description (e.g., type, vendor, version, etc.) of each of network manageable devices - through -. In the unified setting interface , the configurable parameters are grouped according to their functionality, e.g., a group of security parameters, a group of Internet connection parameters, etc. For each configurable parameter, the unified setting interface  assigns for each configurable parameter a unique name regardless of the network manageable device's type. The parameter name given by unified setting interface  is associated with the original parameter name.","In an embodiment of the present invention, the manageable applications  interface with the unified setting interface  through function calls. For example, to modify the value of a specific parameter the function call \u201cmodify (devicelD, parameter_name, new_value)\u201d is used, and to retrieve the value of a specific parameter, the function call \u201cget (devicelD, parameter_name)\u201d is used. It should be emphasized that all management applications  use the function calls provided by the unified setting interface . It should be further emphasized that the parameter_name designated in a function call is the parameter name give by a management application . The database  contains the data related to the network manageable devices supported by setting diagnostic agent  and is described in greater detail below.","Preferably, the database  storing the regular expressions and manageable device scripts comprises an element of the setting diagnostic agent . However, in other embodiments of the present invention, the database  does not have to be part of the setting diagnostic agent . Furthermore, the regular expressions and scripts are retrieved from memory or other forms of storage, and do not have to be stored within a structured database.","Referring to , an exemplary non-limiting schematic diagram of the database  is shown. The database  is organized in a hierarchical structure with at least two levels of hierarchy. The higher level includes entries  and the lower level includes sub-entries  of a respective entry . Each entry  is related to a single type of network manageable device. The sub-entries  include a list of identification parameters, such as vendor, model name and number, serial number, manufacturer name, a list of authorization parameters (i.e., username and password), a list of configurable parameters and a list of manageable device scripts for generating the submission requests. Each configurable parameter is associated with a regular expression used for the purpose of extraction of the parameter's value. Sub-entries  further include the location of each configurable parameter. For example, the parameters' locations of a network manageable device with a HTTP interface are expressed by URLs. Typically, each URL designates the source of a web page that contains a group of configurable parameters having a common functionality (e.g., wireless connection parameters). The regular expressions and the manageable device scripts are pre-programmed and stored in the database . An operator (e.g., system administrator, network user, etc.) loads the manageable device scripts, the regular expressions and other configuration information into the database from a computer medium such as a CD-ROM. Alternatively, an operator can create his or her own specialized manageable device scripts and regular expressions if interface information for a particular manageable device is available.","Referring to , an exemplary portion of a database  file used by the present invention is illustrated.  shows a single entry  (line ) that includes information about an exemplary and non-limiting Linksys\u02dcrouter with two router parameters: \u201cfirmware version\u201d and \u201cWAN connection type\u201d. Sub-entries  (shown in lines  through ) includes the router identification parameters, the URLs and the regular expressions used to extract the configurable parameters found in each page accessed by each URL. The router identification parameters (shown in lines  through ) include the HTTPID parameter, and the authorization variables that include the username and password required for accessing the router. As shown in line , the URL \u201c\/index.html\u201d includes a web page that contains the \u201cWAN connection type\u201d parameter. This parameter defines the type of connection to an Internet service provider (ISP). The regular expression, shown in line , extracts the value of the \u201cWAN connection type\u201d parameter and save it in the \u201cWan_Connection_Type\u201d variable. This is performed by parsing the web page and using the regular expression to search for a \u201cWANConnectionType\u201d string. Once found, the value of \u201cWANConnectionType\u201d parameter is extracted. The name of the \u201cWan_Connection_Type\u201d variable is a unique name given by the unified setting interface to all parameters that represent the type of the WAN connection. The parameter section (shown in lines  through ) contains a list of router parameters that is provided to the unified setting interface , as well as the corresponding manageable device scripts. The \u201cSubmit\u201d section (lines  through ) includes a manageable device script that generates the HTTP requests to be sent to the router in order to configure the router with the new value of the \u201cWan_Connection_Type\u201d variable. The scripts are used to generate data buffers using the previously obtained router settings. For example, the setting of the \u201cWan_Connection_Type\u201d variable is obtained using the command \u201c%Wan_Connection_Type%\u201d (as shown in line ) and its new value is submitted using the command \u201c$Wan_Connection_Type$\u201d (as shown in line ).","Referring to , a non-limiting flowchart  describing the method for creating the unified setting interface  in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention is shown. At S, the setting diagnostic agent  tries to establish a connection to a network manageable device using a default IP address. The default IP address is provided by the vendor of the manageable device. A message is sent to the network manageable device using HTTP. At S, a check is performed to determine if the accessed network manageable device responds, and if so, at S, the response sent from the network manageable device is analyzed to detect the type of the network manageable device. If the network manageable device does not respond, the execution is ended. At S, an entry in the database  associated with the detected network manageable device is identified. At S, the network manageable device is accessed to retrieve more information on the manageable device. The setting diagnostic agent  retrieves the network manageable device's description from a URL provided by the device in the response message. The network manageable device's description includes the vendor, manufacturer model name and number, serial number, manufacturer name, firmware version, URLs for control, evening and presentation, and URLs of the configurable parameters.","In some cases, an authorization process is required (i.e., submission of the username and the password of the manageable device) to retrieve the manageable device's description. In such cases, the default authorization variables are used, if the authorization variables are not provided, the user is prompted to enter them. At S, the configurable parameters are identified and then passed to the unified setting interface . The unified setting interface  maintains the configurable parameters and the description (e.g., type, vendor, version, etc.) of each of manageable devices - through -. In the unified setting interface , the configurable parameters are grouped according to their functionality, i.e., a group of security parameters, a group of Internet connection parameters, etc. For each configurable parameter, the unified setting interface  assigns a unique name regardless of the manageable device's type. For example, the name of WAN connection type in a Linksys router is \u201cWANConnectionType\u201d, while the name for the same parameters in a Belkin router is \u201cWAN_port\u201d. The name of this parameter given by the unified setting interface  is \u201cWAN_Connection_Type\u201d. Furthermore, the unified setting interface  provides to all management applications  a unique set of commands (e.g., function calls) through which the management applications  interact with the limited setting interface .","Referring to , a non-limiting flowchart  describing the method for retrieving the value of a configurable parameter is shown. At S, a management application  requests the unified setting interface  to retrieve the value of a configurable parameter from a specific manageable device  using, for example, the \u201cget\u201d function call. For instance, to retrieve the value of the WAN connection type parameter in a Linksys router, the function call get (Linksys BEFSR41, WAN_Connection_Type) is sent to the unified setting interface . At S, the database  is searched for the URL that includes the parameter designated in the function call. Specifically, the unified setting interface  looks for a URL that includes the original parameter name. For example, for the \u201cget\u201d function call shown above the WANConnectionType parameter name is searched (instead of WAN_Connection_Type). At S, the URL that includes the requested parameter is retrieved from the database  and is sent to the response processor . At S, the response processor  accesses the network manageable device  through the IJRL to get the page that includes this parameter. At S, the response processor  receives a response sent (e.g., a HTML page) from the network manageable device  through the device interface . At S, the response processor  (using the parser ) parses the received response and the parsed information is sent to regular the expression engine . At S, the regular expression engine  extracts the desired information, e.g., the value of the requested configurable parameter using a regular expression designed to extract this particular value. The regular expression to be used is obtained from the database . For example, to extract the value of WANConnectionType the regular expression provided in  line  is used. At S, the extracted information is sent to the unified setting interface , which subsequently sends it to the management application  that requested this information.","Referring to , an exemplary non-limiting flowchart describing a method for modifying a value of a configurable parameter is illustrated. At S, a management application  sends to the unified setting interface , the identification of a manageable device, the parameter name, and the new value to be reconfigured, for example, using the \u201cmodify\u201d function call. For instance, in order to modify the WAN connection type parameter in a Linksys router, the function call modify (Linksys BEFSR41, WAN_Connection_Type, dhcp) is sent to the unified setting interface . At S, the unified setting interface  searches in the database  for the manageable device script used to generate the HTTP requests for submitting the new value to the targeted network manageable device. At S, the manageable device script to be used is obtained from the database  and sent to the request generator . For example, the manageable device script shown in  line  is used to modify the WAN_Connection_Type of the Linksys router. At , the HTTP requests required to reconfigure the parameter designated in the \u201cmodify\u201d function call are generated and sent to the network manageable device. As described above, the creation of the HTTP requests comprises substituting the parameters of the HTTP requests (i.e., the data to be submitted, the HTTP method to be used, etc.) in a string buffer. The string buffer is in a format compliant with the interface of the network manageable device. It should be noted that if the network manageable device generates a response indicating that the parameter has been successfully configured, this response is handled by the response processor .","The methods have now been described with reference to a specific embodiment where a HTTP connection is used to access the manageable device. Other embodiments will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art. For example, the method can be adapted for the use with manageable devices utilizing connection formats, such as SNMP, Telnet, UPnP, and other connection formats.","The present invention can be implemented in software, hardware, firmware or various combinations thereof. In an embodiment of the present invention, the elements are implemented in software that is stored in a memory and that configures and drives a digital processor situated in the respective wireless device. The software can be stored on any computer-readable media for use by or in connection with any suitable computer-related system or method. It will be appreciated that the term \u201cpredetermined operations\u201d and the term \u201ccomputer system software\u201d mean substantially the same thing for the purposes of this description. It is not necessary to the practice of the present invention that the memory and the processor be physically located in the same place. That is to say, it is foreseen that the processor and the memory might be in different physical pieces of equipment or even in geographically distinct locations.","As used herein, one of skill in the art will appreciate that \u201cmedia\u201d or \u201ccomputer-readable media\u201d may include a diskette, a tape, a compact disc, an integrated circuit, a cartridge, a remote transmission via a communications circuit, or any other similar media useable by computers. For example, to distribute computer system software, the supplier might provide a diskette or might transmit the instructions for performing predetermined operations in some form via satellite transmission, via a direct telephone link, or via the Internet. More specific examples of computer-readable media would include an electrical connection (electronic) having one or more wires, a portable computer diskette (magnetic), a random access memory (RAM) (magnetic), a read-only memory (ROM) (magnetic), an erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM or Flash memory) (magnetic), an optical fiber (optical), and a portable compact disc read-only memory (CD-ROM) (optical). The computer readable media could even be paper or another suitable media upon which the program is printed, as the program can be electronically captured, via for instance optical scanning of the paper or other media, then compiled, interpreted or otherwise processed in a suitable manner if necessary, and then stored in a computer memory.","Although computer system software might be \u201cwritten on\u201d a diskette, \u201cstored in\u201d an integrated circuit, or \u201ccarried over\u201d a communications circuit, it will be appreciated that, for the purposes of this discussion, the computer usable media will be referred to as \u201cbearing\u201d the instructions for performing the predetermined operations. Thus, the term \u201cbearing\u201d is intended to encompass the above and all equivalent ways in which instructions for performing predetermined operations are associated with a computer usable media.","Therefore, for the sake of simplicity, the term \u201cprogram product\u201d is hereafter used to refer to a computer useable media, as defined above, which bears instructions for performing predetermined operations in any form.","In one embodiment, the present invention can operate in conjunction with diagnostic tools that are capable of automatically repairing and detecting malfunctions in local networks, such as LANs and WLANs. Furthermore, the present invention can operate in conjunction with diagnostic tools capable of automatically setting local networks. An example for such diagnostic tool is disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/885,017 entitled \u201cMETHOD AND APPARATUS FOR AUTOMATIC DIAGNOSIS AND RESOLUTION OF WIRELESS NETWORK MALFUNCTIONS\u201d, assigned to the common assignee and which is hereby incorporated by reference for all that it contains.","Furthermore, the setting diagnostic agent disclosed herein can be utilized in several applications targeted to ease the management and configuration of networks, such as home digital networks. These applications may be, but are not limited to, a first time setup of network manageable devices and a management interface allows configuring different devices in the same environment.","The foregoing description of the preferred embodiments of the invention has been presented for purposes of illustration and description. It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed, and modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teachings or may be acquired from practice of the invention. The embodiments were chosen and described in order to explain the principles of the invention and its practical application to enable one skilled in the art to utilize the invention in various embodiments and with various modifications as are suited to the particular use contemplated.","Thus, while only certain embodiments of the invention have been specifically described herein, it will be apparent that numerous modifications may be made thereto without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Further, acronyms are used merely to enhance the readability of the specification and claims.
