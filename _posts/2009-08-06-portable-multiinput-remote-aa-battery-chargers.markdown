{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured, used, imported, sold, and licensed by or for the Government of the United States of America without the payment to us of any royalty thereon.","The present invention relates generally to the field of battery charging devices and apparatus. More particularly, the present invention relates to a portable multi-input AA battery charger.","Each year millions of dollars are spent on rechargeable batteries for use in portable electronics equipment. Due to their low life-cycle costs, rechargeable batteries are the power source of choice for numerous equipment applications, both civilian and military. There is currently no convenient and cost-effective way for recharging such batteries during remote military tactical maneuvers because currently available battery chargers are not generally portable. Currently available battery chargers also require logistical support such as a generator, military vehicle, or other equipment that would usually be available at a typical military installation, but would not be available during tactical field operations in a remote, dangerous and hostile location. Because of the unavailability of battery charging equipment in remote, dangerous, and hostile locations, our military forces typically do not take full advantage of the battery energy that would be available from a recharged battery. This practice results in the waste of millions of dollars in battery life or energy every year, and aids in the degradation of rechargeable batteries.","Not only does the military user refrain from recharging the battery because of field conditions, the troops tend to carry multiple spare batteries to ensure that their communications and other equipment are constantly available. Although redundant spare batteries by themselves are not excessively heavy, carrying redundant spare batteries on field maneuvers along with other required equipment can create a difficult weight problem for the individual soldier in the field with a fully loaded back-pack. In those cases, the extra weight could make the soldier more susceptible to fatigue and have a detrimental impact on his survivability in remote, dangerous, and hostile locations. Another undesirable result from carrying redundant spare batteries is that the soldier may choose to discard other equipment from the fully-loaded backpack to make room for redundant spare batteries, and depending upon what equipment is left behind, e.g. extra ammunition or a signaling flare, such an omission might have a disastrous impact on the mission, and more importantly, troop survivability.","Similarly, the non-military battery user can often be in remote, dangerous, and hostile locations where the ability to charge a rechargeable battery could increase both comfort and survivability. For example, a recreational camper or boater might be lost or stranded with inoperable battery-operated communications equipment suffering from a low state of charge due to the absence of a portable battery charger for a remote location.","Thus there has been a long-felt need for a portable battery charger that will allow the soldier or recreational camper to have portable battery recharging capacity in remote, dangerous, and hostile locations that alleviates the shortcomings, limitations, and disadvantages of currently available battery charging techniques.","In order to satisfy the long-felt need for a portable battery charger that will allow the soldier or recreational user to have portable battery recharging capability in remote, dangerous, and hostile locations without the shortcomings, limitations, and disadvantages of currently available battery charging equipment, the present invention provides a portable electrochemical charger for rechargeable AA batteries. This invention's portable multi-input remote AA battery charger can recharge as many as eight (8) AA batteries at once within 100 minutes. This invention's battery charger for rechargeable batteries can also be powered by a number of the currently available military batteries such as the BA-8180, BA-8140, BA-5590, BA-5390, BB-390, BB-2590, and SP4 batteries.","It is an object of the present invention to provide a portable electrochemical charger for rechargeable AA batteries.","Another object of the present invention is to provide a portable multi-input charger for rechargeable AA batteries.","It is still another object of the present invention to provide a portable multi-input 100 minute charger for rechargeable AA batteries.","It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a method for charging AA rechargeable batteries with a portable battery charger.","These and other objects are advantageously accomplished with this invention's portable multi-input remote AA battery charger, which comprises at least two (2) battery chambers, slots for the AA batteries, a charging circuit, a housing, and a connector. In accordance with this invention, the remotely located military or civilian user can now recharge as many as eight (8) AA batteries at one time within 100 minutes. Other embodiments of this invention provide a portable multi-input remote AA battery charger apparatus and a method for charging AA rechargeable batteries with a portable battery charger.","This invention's portable multi-input remote AA battery charger provides an innovative charging application for AA batteries and, in particular, for rechargeable AA nickel metal hydride batteries which are being used to a greater extent to power military communications and electronic equipment that has been fielded to remote, hostile, and dangerous locations without any of the disadvantages, shortcomings, and limitations of prior art battery chargers. This invention can be used by soldiers in the field or civilians who operate electrical equipment in remote locations such as recreational campers or boaters. This invention's portable multi-input remote AA battery chargers can also be powered with numerous different military portable power sources such as the BA-8180, BA-8140, BA-5590, BA-5390, BB-390, BB-2590, and SP4 batteries.","Referring now to , there is depicted a top view of this invention's portable multi-input remote AA battery charger , comprising a first battery chamber , first slots  for the AA batteries, and a first charging circuit represented by a broken line rectangle  positioned underneath the first battery chamber . The first slots  are dimensioned to accept AA batteries and include the necessary contact points  and . The first chamber , first slots  and first charging circuit  are installed in a housing  having a male power source connector  for external electrical power. Similar structures would also be found in a bottom view of this invention, which is not shown in this drawing.  also includes several representative dimensions such as the first battery chamber  measuring 2.40\u2033 wide, the housing  being 3.25\u2033 wide and 4.35\u2033 long, and the power source connector  with a total length of 0.65.\u2033 Of course, other dimensions are also possible in accordance with this invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["10","11","12","13","10","21","22","23","13","16","11","21","17"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":"10"},"In operation, the present invention provides a portable 8-AA charging capability for the dismounted soldier in the field or another remote location, as well as the recreational camper or boater.
