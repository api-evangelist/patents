{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENTAL INTEREST","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured, used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government.","This invention relates generally to a system for providing electrical power distribution for use in a field environment.","Mobile or transportable power supply and distribution systems are needed for various types of work that require electrical power for use in a field or outdoor environment. By way of example, construction and environmental remediation projects often require such a system to power tools, lights, and other devices. For many projects this need is met by either running a power line from the nearest available power source (referred to herein as \u201cshore power\u201d) or through the use of a generator. Various generators are commercially available for this purpose and range in size from small units that can be lifted by a single person and carried to a work site to trailer or skid-mounted generators that can power a large prdject site with multiple loads or power uses running off of the electrical power so provided.","While generators provide a source of electrical power in a field environment, the limited number and type of electrical outlets on the generator and the preset configuration of a given generator are in some applications insufficient for the operation. In addition, some applications require redundancy in power supply sources for safety purposes or other reasons. That is, at least two independent sources of electrical power are needed for these types of projects or operations. This requirement could be met through a combination of a generator and shore power, or the use of two generators. An automatic transfer switch is preferably used between the two power sources to automatically transfer loads from the primary power supply to the second power supply in the event that the former shuts down for any reason. Given these operational requirements, a power distribution system is needed to link the two power sources and provide the desired arrangement of outlets, switches, and the like.","Prior art power distribution systems are available for use in conjunction with a generator to provide a plurality of electrical outlets, switches, and the automatic transfer function described above. These systems, however, are generally designed for a particular type of application and are not as versatile and mobile as needed for other applications. Accordingly, what is needed is a mobile power distribution system that can be used for automatic switching between a primary and secondary power source, where at least one of the power sources is a generator, and the entire system can be transported fully assembled within a standard 20-foot intermodal (ISO) shipping container.","The present invention provides a mobile power distribution system for use in field operations requiring primary and secondary power sources wherein at least one of the power sources is a generator. The system includes primary and secondary power connections, an automatic transfer switch, a transformer, and a plurality of high and low voltage outlets. The entire system is mounted on a trailer or skid platform and fits within a standard 20-foot ISO container. The system of the present invention can be used with a variety of commercially available components suitable for field applications. One aspect of the present invention is its configuration, which provides for ease of access and safe operation. The details of one or more embodiments of the invention are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, objects, and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.","Like reference symbols in the drawings indicate like elements.","An exemplary mobile power distribution system  according to the teachings of the present invention is illustrated in the perspective view of . System  includes a platform , which in this exemplary embodiment is a trailer. A skid-type base could also be used as platform . The trailer platform  in this embodiment includes wheels ,  and a trailer hitch (not visible). Platform  in this embodiment is approximately 10 feet in length and 5 feet in width, thus easily fitting within the floor space of a standard 20-foot ISO container. The height of the overall system, which includes the wheel-mounted platform  along with the components mounted to the top of platform , is approximately 6 feet in overall height. This overall height easily fits within the overhead clearance of a standard 20-foot ISO container. A skid-type base, when used as an alternative to the trailer as illustrated here for platform , would take even less vertical distance. Platform  includes decking for ease of access to the electrical components and lifting points (not shown).","Connector  is provided for connecting the system  of the present invention to a first or primary power source, which is fed into disconnect switch . Connector  is rated for the range of power sources expected to be encountered. This could include an AC or DC power source. The primary power source as connected to connector  could be shore power from an available electrical distribution system near the site of the field work, or this primary power source could be a generator. Disconnect switch  is provided in this embodiment as a means to manually disconnect this first or primary power source from the rest of the electrical components of system . In this way, the power supply as provided by system  can be manually switched from the primary power source to the generator or secondary power source as supplied through generator connector . This manual operation of switching from primary to secondary power source can be performed at any time by the user of system .","Generator connector  is provided for connecting system  to a secondary power source, which is typically a generator. Power from generator connector  is fed into automatic transfer switch . Connector  is rated for the range of power sources expected to be encountered from the generators used with the system.","Automatic transfer switch  receives electrical power from both the primary power source as connected to system  using connector  and the secondary power source as connected to system  using generator connector . In the event that power is dropped from the primary power source, automatic transfer switch  automatically transfers it outlet power to the secondary power source. As used herein, \u201cdropped\u201d means to lose power completely or partially such that the switching action of automatic transfer switch  is activated. As noted above, the primary and secondary power sources may both be generators. In the alternative, one of the power sources may be shore power. Other power sources and combinations are possible. For example, wind power, solar arrays, fuel cells and the like can be used with system  when power generation and storage capacity of such power sources are adequate for the anticipated demand load. Automatic transfer switches having proper ratings for use as switch  in system  are readily available and well known in the art to which the invention pertains.","The electrical output from automatic transfer switch  is fed to transformer  (shown in ), which is housed within an interior space of system . Transformer  may be a large general purpose transformer having appropriate ratings to match the anticipated power supply specifications and the desired outlet specifications. By way of example, transformer  may be rated for primary volts 480 delta W\/FC type, providing secondary volts 208Y\/120, 112.5 KVA 60 HZ 3phase.","Turning to , breaker panel  receives power from transformer  (shown in ) from the secondary volt output of the transformer and supplies the electrical power to a series of outlets , , , ,  and switches ,  via conduit  and . In this way, outlets connectors , , , ,  can be used to power various equipment and other electrical loads as need on a given project.
