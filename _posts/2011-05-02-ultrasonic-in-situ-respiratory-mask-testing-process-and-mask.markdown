{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This U.S. utility patent application claims priority from U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 61\/329,846, filed Apr. 30, 2010, the entire content of which is incorporated herein in its entirety.","This invention was made by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an agency of the United States Government. Therefore, the United States Government has certain rights in this invention.","This invention relates to an apparatus and a process for testing seal integrity in situ of a subject wearing a respiratory mask and in particular to the use of ultrasonics in such testing.","A negative pressure respirator mask typically is leak tested by covering the air inlet and inhaling until the mask is slightly collapsed. A positive pressure respirator is similarly leak tested by covering the air outlet and exhaling until the mask bulges. These tests of time holding pressure are both subjective and static in that the quality of the mask seal (and other potential leak paths including valves) as a function of time is not measured. Quantitative testing estimates fit (the inverse of leakage) for a specific model of mask and individual wearer. While of considerable advantage in mask selection and design, the usage of aerosol flow, and other conventional techniques, renders quantitative leak testing techniques incompatible with in situ field use.","Thus, there exists a need for an in situ apparatus and process for testing a respiratory mask seal during actual usage. Such an apparatus and process could continuously monitor fit (leakage) and be used to alert the wearer to mask failure.","The present invention provides a respiratory mask to be used on the face of the user such that the mask covers at least the mouth and nose of the user. The mask includes a mask body with a perimeter. The mask has a use position wherein the mask body covers at least the mouth and nose on the face of the user and the perimeter (face seal) of the mask body is in contact with the face surrounding at least the mouth and nose. At least one ultrasonic sensor is supported on the mask body in detecting proximity to the perimeter. The ultrasonic sensor is operable to detect ultrasound. The ultrasonic sensor allows leakage around the perimeter of the mask body to be detected. In some versions, the respiratory mask further includes a power source for powering at least one ultrasonic sensor and a microprocessor in electrical communication with the at least one ultrasonic sensor. The microprocessor is operable to process the signal from the ultrasonic sensor.","In some embodiments, the mask body further comprises a flexible perimeter face seal defining the perimeter of the mask body.","In some versions, the ultrasonic sensor is a microphone. In further versions, the at least one ultrasonic sensor is a plurality of ultrasonic sensors, each sensor being disposed adjacent the perimeter of the mask body. These ultrasonic sensors may be supported so as to extend outwardly beyond the perimeter.","In some embodiments, the mask body is an elastomeric body with a seal at the perimeter and the mask further comprises at least one filter element attached to the mask body. In other embodiments, the mask body is a body of filtration material. In further versions, the mask body is a full face mask configured to cover the mouth, nose and eyes of the user.","In some embodiments, at least one ultrasonic sensor is a first ultrasonic sensor and the mask further includes a second ultrasonic sensor supported on an innerface of the mask body. The second ultrasonic sensor is a reference sensor. A microprocessor is in electrical communication with the first and second sensors and is operable to compare a signal from the first and second sensors and to determine a parameter corresponding to leakage around the perimeter.","In some embodiments, mask further includes an ultrasound source disposed on an innerface of the mask body.","Some embodiments of the present invention include a microprocessor in electrical communication with at least one ultrasonic sensor. The microprocessor is operable to process a signal from the sensor and to determine a parameter corresponding to leakage around the perimeter. The microprocessor is further operable to produce an alarm signal if the ultrasound corresponds to leakage exceeding a predetermined level.","A method in accordance with the present invention includes providing a respiratory mask as described above. The mask is positioned on the face of the user such that the mask body covers at least the mouth and nose of the user and the perimeter of the mask body is in contact with the face surrounding at least the mouth and nose. A signal is received from the at least one ultrasonic sensor. In further versions, the signal is correlated with the measured level of leakage. In yet further versions, an alarm signal is provided if the signal from the ultrasonic sensor corresponds to leakage exceeding a predetermined level. In some embodiments of the method, nasal respiration of the user produces ultrasonic waves for detection by the ultrasonic sensors.","The present invention has utility in the testing and improved operation of respiratory masks (respirators). Such masks are commonly used in settings as diverse as chemical handling, firefighting, chemical and biological weapon defense, surgery, and biohazard handling. Based on the specifics of the user's face, the operating environment, age and composition of the mask, and user actions, a mask seal and other potential leak paths can fail in an unpredictable manner, thereby exposing a subject wearing the mask to the very conditions the mask was intended to preclude. To address the limitations of prior art mask testing, the presenting invention relies on ultrasonic wave detection to assess face seal quality and other potential leak paths as needed. In a preferred embodiment, the present invention relies on the surprising discovery that sinusoidal respiration through the nose of a subject operates as a source of ultrasonic waves that can be detected by at least one microphone or sensor in detecting proximity to the mask's perimeter. Alternatively, an ultrasound source is positioned internal to the mask seal and at least one microphone or sensor is positioned in detecting proximity to the mask seal or other potential leak path. As a result of small size, low energy consumption, and the omission of field use incompatible seal testing substances, the present invention is operative in situ during actual field usage of the mask by a subject to provide greater safety to the subject wearing the mask and also to facilitate further mask design with improved seal properties. It is appreciated that microphone or sensor data can be stored and correlated with subject activity to provide dynamic seal properties and can further be manipulated to provide integrated values of seal comprise. These integrated values are particular helpful in mask seal design and when coupled with a subject alarm can alert a subject when a threshold of environmental exposure has been reached.","A subject that benefits from the present invention illustratively includes a human; non-human primate; and domesticated animals such as a dog, cat, horse, sheep, cow, rat, mouse, and rabbit.","Referring to , a mask  in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention is shown on the face of a user. The mask  has a mask body  with the central area  and a perimeter . The mask may be said to have a use position wherein the mask body  covers the mouth and nose on the face of a user and the perimeter  is in contact with the face surrounding at least the mouth and nose. The mask  is illustrated in such a use position in . As known to those of skill in the art, it is preferred that the perimeter  be sealingly engaged with the skin of the user so that substantially all of the respiration of the user passes through the mask itself rather than leaking between the perimeter and the face.","In the illustrated embodiment, the mask  further includes a plurality of ultrasonic sensors each disposed in detecting proximity to the perimeter  of the mask. In the illustrated embodiment, the ultrasonic sensors  are supported adjacent the perimeter. The sensors are supported on support tabs  that extend outward of the perimeter so as to be in position for sensing ultrasound that passes between the perimeter and the face.","As known to those of skill in the art, the ultrasonic sensors  may take a variety of forms, including ultrasonic microphones or other types of ultrasonic sensors. In alternative embodiments, the sensors may be positioned differently than shown. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, the sensors are on the inner surface of the tabs . They may instead be on an outer surface, or may be supported in other ways. Further, the sensors may be inboard of the perimeter edge, such as in the central area  if such positioning allows sensing of ultrasound past the perimeter. The illustrated embodiment of the mask  includes six ultrasonic sensors , though alternative embodiments may include fewer or more ultrasonic sensors. In the illustrated embodiment, a sensor  is positioned at the bridge of the nose of the user, two sensors are positioned to the sides of the nose on the upper cheek, one sensor is positioned below the chin, and two sensors are positioned to the sides of the mouth of the user on the lower cheek. This positioning is preferred for some embodiments, but may be altered in other embodiments.","As shown in , the mask may further include a retaining strap  for holding the mask in the use position. The retaining strap may take other forms.","Experiments by the inventors have demonstrated that inhalation and exhalation through the nasal passages of a user creates an ultrasonic signal that may be utilized with the present invention. As discussed above, the present invention is configured to sense ultrasound as an indication of leakage between the perimeter of a mask and the face of a user. In embodiments of the present invention utilizing an ultrasonic signal produced by inhalation and exhalation of the user, an additional ultrasound source may not be required. However, the amount of ultrasound produced by inhalation and exhalation may vary depending on the breathing conditions and characteristics of the user. As such, in some embodiments, it is desirable to provide a reference sensor for measuring the ultrasound produced within the mask. Such an optional ultrasonic sensor is illustrated at  in . This reference sensor  may be an ultrasonic sensor positioned on an inner surface of the mask. By comparing the signal received by the reference sensor  and the sensors , relative leakage may be determined. Though not illustrated in , the sensors , and optional reference sensor , are in electrical communication with a microprocessor and the microprocessor is operable to process a signal from the sensors. In some embodiments, the microprocessor is operable to compare a signal from the sensors  and the reference sensor  to determine a parameter corresponding to leakage around the perimeter of the mask.","In further embodiments, it may be desirable to provide an ultrasonic source such that the mask is not reliant on ultrasound produced by inhalation and exhalation of the user. In such an embodiment, the element  may indicate such an ultrasound source. Further, the element  may indicate both an ultrasound source and a reference sensor in embodiments where both are desirable. In embodiments where element  is an ultrasound source, the source  creates a known level of ultrasound in the interior of the mask body . A microprocessor may be in electrical communication with both the source  and the sensors  and operable to determine a parameter corresponding to leakage around the perimeter by comparing the known level of ultrasound from the source  to the amount of ultrasound sensed by the sensors .","As known to those of skill in the art, depending on the configuration of the mask body , some ultrasound may pass through the body  without leaking past the perimeter. For this reason, some embodiments may include an optional reference sensor  disposed exterior to the mask and operable to sense ultrasound that passes through the mask body. In the illustrated embodiment, this optional reference sensor  is positioned in the central area  of the mask body. By comparing the amount of ultrasound sensed by the reference sensor  with the amount of ultrasound sensed by the sensors , the microprocessor may determine a parameter corresponding to leakage at the perimeter. In some embodiments, the sensor  may be provided in combination with the element , which may be a source and\/or a sensor.","While the illustrated embodiment assumes sensing of ultrasound produced inside the mask by sensors exterior to the mask, the configuration may be reversed such that a source is provided exterior to the mask and sensing of ultrasound leaking past the perimeter is sensed interior to the mask. For example, element  may be an ultrasound source. Alternatively, the sensors  may represent sources with ultrasound being sensed interior to the mask, such as by a sensor .","It is desirable to inform a user if leakage is detected and\/or if such leakage is above a predetermined safe level. As such, the mask  may optionally include an alarm such as indicated by element . The alarm may be an audible and\/or visual indicator that the microprocessor has determined that the level of ultrasound sensed by the perimeter sensors is above a predetermined level. Optionally, the alarm may indicate which sensor is sensing the excessive level so as to assist in adjusting of the mask for better fit. Multiple indicators may be provided.","Referring now to , an alternative embodiment of a mask  is shown on the face of a user. The mask  may be known as a half-mask and is designed to cover the mouth and nose of a user. It typically includes an elastomeric mask body  with a flexible perimeter seal  for sealing to the face of the user. The mask  may include one or more filter elements  attached to the mask body for filtering inhalations. An exhalation valve  may also be provided. The mask  may otherwise be constructed in accordance with the discussion of .","Referring now to , a further embodiment of the mask  is illustrated. This mask is a full face type mask designed to cover the entire face of the user. It may be otherwise constructed in accordance with the discussion of .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["70","72","76","78","80","82"]},"The present invention also includes a method of using a mask as described above. Such a mask is disposed on the face of the user, or on a testing form, and a signal is received from at least one ultrasonic sensor. The system may be used to correlate an ultrasonic signal with a level of leakage determined using any other method. For example, the ultrasonic signal may be correlated with leakage determined using an aerosol flow test. In some embodiments of the method, respiration of the user produces the ultrasonic waves for detection by the ultrasonic sensors.","As will be clear to those of skill in the art, the herein described embodiments of the present invention may be altered in various ways without departing from the scope or teaching of the present invention. It is the following claims, including all equivalents, which define the scope of the present invention."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["2","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 5"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
