title: Method of multi-dimensional moment analysis for the characterization of signal peaks
abstract: A method of multi-dimensional moment analysis for the characterization of signal peaks can be used to optimize the operation of an analytical system. With a two-dimensional PÃ©clet analysis, the quality and signal fidelity of peaks in a two-dimensional experimental space can be analyzed and scored. This method is particularly useful in determining optimum operational parameters for an analytical system which requires the automated analysis of large numbers of analyte data peaks. For example, the method can be used to optimize analytical systems including an ion mobility spectrometer that uses a temperature stepped desorption technique for the detection of explosive mixtures.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION","Multi-Dimensional Moment Analysis","Experimental Results"],"p":["This invention was made with Government support under contract no. DE-AC04-94AL85000 awarded by the U.S. Department of Energy to Sandia Corporation. The Government has certain rights in the invention.","The present invention relates to the analysis of multi-component mixtures and, in particular, to a method of multi-dimensional moment analysis for the characterization of signal peaks that can be used to optimize the operation of an analytical system.","Analysis of multi-component mixtures using various analytical techniques often results in data that can be represented as a signal that is a function of two or more dimensions (or variables). An example is gas chromatography coupled with ion mobility spectrometry (GC-IMS) where one dimension is ion drift-time (t) in the IMS and the other dimension is real-time elution (t) from the GC. Thus, the signal can be mathematically represented as C(t, t). Such complexity has recently become relevant for IMS techniques that have responses in both the drift-time and the real-time dimensions.","A brief survey of the literature reveals a myriad of statistical two-dimensional techniques that have application for such data sets. Among these techniques are factor analysis techniques such as principle component analysis (PCA), evolving factor analysis (EFA), classical least-squares methods (CLS), inverse least-squares methods (ILS), and a number of techniques derived from these approaches (see A. de Juan and R. Tauler, 1158, 184 (2007); E. V. Thomas and D. M. Haaland, 62(10), 1091 (1990); K. P. Pleibner et al., 20, 755 (1999); D. M. Haaland and D. K. Melgaard, 54(9), 1303 (2000); and N. D. Sidiropoulos et al., 48(8), 2377 (2000)). These approaches are generally designed to identify and quantify the concentration of a multi-component mixture measured using an analytical tool.","However, a need remains for a method to optimize the performance of an analytical system to provide a measurement with high quality and high fidelity. Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a method to quantify for comparison the quality and fidelity of signal response peaks. The method will be referred to herein as two-dimensional P\u00e9clet analysis.","The present invention is directed to a method of multi-dimensional moment analysis for the characterization of signal peaks, comprising measuring two or more signal peaks having at least two different dimensions of an analytical system; calculating a zero moment for each of the signal peaks; calculating a first moment in each dimension for each of the signal peaks; calculating a second moment in each dimension for each of the signal peaks; and selecting an operating parameter of the analytical system based upon a ratio of the first and second moments of each signal peak. The ratio can comprise a P\u00e9clet number. The operation of the analytical system can be optimized by selecting the operating parameter that corresponds to the signal peak having the highest P\u00e9clet number. The analytical system can comprise an ion mobility spectrometer with a preconcentrator in which the signal peak is a two-dimensional signal with drift time in the ion mobility spectrometer as a first dimension and real time desorption from that preconcentrator as a second dimension. Preferably, the preconcentrator enables temperature stepped desorption using two or more heating steps.","With a two-dimensional P\u00e9clet analysis, the quality and signal fidelity of peaks in a two-dimensional experimental space can be analyzed and scored. This method is particularly useful in determining optimum operational parameters for an analytical system which requires the automated analysis of large numbers of analyte data peaks. The technique is developed from moment analysis of the peaks and single dimensional P\u00e9clet theory. The two-dimensional P\u00e9clet analysis allows automated comparison of response peaks with differing shapes and amplitudes to be compared simultaneously in multicomponent mixtures. The method allows a direct, automated comparison between the quality of the peaks in-terms of peak shape and signal-to-noise ratio rather than to return a concentration and species analysis. It therefore provides a figure-of-merit in the form of a 2-D P\u00e9clet number that allows direct comparison of the signal fidelity of two or more peaks that have neither the same amplitude nor the same general shape and allows the system to be tuned to optimize its performance.","The method is applicable to any similar data occurring in a multi-dimensional space. The method can be used to optimize analytical systems, including an ion mobility spectrometer that uses a temperature stepped desorption technique for the detection of explosive mixtures as described herein. However, the method has more general applicability and can be used with the two-dimensional gel analysis in biological systems, \u201chyphenated\u201d techniques such as gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS), time-frequency surface acoustic wave (SAW) tag data, geophysical analysis instruments for geophysical terrain mapping, navigation systems in mountainous areas, and effluent plume monitoring systems, for example.","The method of the present invention is directed to a multi-dimensional moment analysis for the characterization of signal peaks, comprising measuring two or more signal peaks having at least two different dimensions of an analytical system; calculating a zero moment for each of the signal peaks; calculating a first moment in each dimension for each of the signal peaks; calculating a second moment in each dimension for each of the signal peaks; and selecting an operating parameter of the analytical system based upon a ratio of the first and second moments of each signal peak. The first moment is related to the distance from the origin of the peak. The second moment is related to the statistical variance or sharpness of the peak. The ratio can comprise a two-dimensional P\u00e9clet number; the ratio of the first moment squared divided by half the second moment squared.","The method of the present invention can be applied generally to the analysis of multi-component mixtures using various analytical techniques. However, the method will be described herein as applied to the characterization of signal peaks from an ion mobility spectrometer. Ion mobility spectroscopy is based on the atmospheric pressure ionization of a sample vapor and the subsequent separation of the individual ionized components, or analytes, of the sample mixture via electrophoresis as they are accelerated by an external electric field gradient and transit a time-of-flight drift tube against a neutral, counter-flowing gas stream. See G. A. Eiceman and Z. Karpas, 2Ed., Chapter 4, (2004).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","20","20","15","12","21","22","23","26","14","15","21","17","18","15","24","16","26","27","15","27","21","27"]},"The drift-time of an explosive ion or any ion is a complex function of its ionization, mass, collision cross-section, and ion stability (see G. A. Eiceman and Z. Karpas, 2nd Ed., pp. 1-9 (2005)). Ions with different mobilities will reach a different terminal speed when an electric field is applied in the tube. Since there is a background gas in the tube, molecular collisions occur as the ion moves under the influence of the electric field resulting in a constant speed of the ion that is proportional to the electric field magnitude. The proportionality constant is known as the ion mobility and leads to separation in the transit time through the IMS drift tube.","Most IMS explosives detection systems that incorporate preconcentrators heat the preconcentrator to between 180\u00b0 C. and 200\u00b0 C. in a single pulse, which thermally desorbs the explosives that have been collected during sampling. This technique adequately desorbs the explosives; however, when multiple explosives are present in the sorbed sample, they are introduced into the IMS at the same time as a single sample plug with no real-time separation between them. By stepping the temperature of the preconcentrator up as a function of time, from below the boiling point of the most volatile of the analytes to above the boiling point of the least volatile analyte, the desorbed analytes can be separated as a function of time. Therefore, the use of a preconcentrator with temperature stepping enables real-time separation of analytes in a multicomponent mixture. The spectrum of ion arrival times at the ion collector is then a function of the desorption component of separation from the preconcentrator (i.e., real-time separation) and the relative ion mobility of each ion through the drift region (i.e., drift-time separation).","As shown in , temperature stepped desorption (TSD) is a technique that pulses the preconcentrator with increasing heating steps. The four heating steps shown in this example raise the temperature starting at 100\u00b0 C. and reach a final temperature of 220\u00b0 C. Explosives with higher vapor pressures tend to desorb at the lower temperatures and explosives with lower vapor pressures often desorb at the higher temperatures. This technique is helpful for several reasons. TSD reduces the packet size of explosives entering the IMS at one time, which helps conserve the amount of reactant ion available to assist in the ionization process of the explosives and avoids saturating the detector, and separates the analytes in real time by heat of vaporization.","Separation in a real-time domain can be manipulated using TSD. With single thermal pulses, there is little separation in the real-time domain. However, if multiple thermal pulses exist, materials can be selectively desorbed into the IMS at varying temperatures, providing separation in the real-time domain. Therefore, TSD provides an additional dimension to differentiate between compounds when multiple component mixtures are present.","TSD is especially favorable to materials such as explosives that are thermally labile. Thermally labile compounds, such as pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN), will decompose at a high temperature between 180\u00b0 C. and 200\u00b0 C. TSD provides these explosives with the opportunity to desorb before the temperature reaches its decomposition point. Reduced decomposition will result in more effective detection and possibly improve the quantification ability of IMS for thermally labile compounds. Also, some explosives such as octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocane (also known as HMX) do not thermally desorb from the preconcentrator until the temperature exceeds 200\u00b0 C. With TSD, it is possible to detect mixtures containing PETN and HMX without significantly decomposing explosives such as PETN. In the past, this was not possible with a single, high-temperature pulse.","A P\u00e9clet number in one dimension is defined, to first order, by the following equation for a plug flow experiment in a pipe.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":"Pe","mo":"=","mfrac":{"mrow":{"mn":"2","mo":"\u2062","msup":{"mi":"t","mn":"2"}},"msup":{"mi":"\u03c3","mn":"2"}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}]}}}},"br":{},"i":["Chem.

moment analysis can be done in each individual data window by calculating the \u201czero\u201d moment of the peak, according to Eq. (2). Here, the units are volts\u00b7sec, representing the concentration multiplied by the time variables (see L. Leithold, 4ed, pp. 595-609 (1981)). The centroid of the peak in two dimensions can then be calculated, according to Eq. (3). This is mathematically equivalent to determining the point of balance of a peak or first moment in the contour map analogy for each of the dimensions where  and  are the first moments represented as time-domains for the peak. Next, the peak width can be determined by calculating the second moment in both dimensions, according to Eq. (4). This is equivalent to determining the standard deviation of the peak (see L. C.

Phillips, , pp. 650-651 (2003)).","If the location of the peak is defined as a vector where {right arrow over (t)}= \u00ee+ \u0135 is the centroid of the peak in time space, where  is the average drift time and  is the average real-time of the first moments in both dimensions, and {right arrow over (\u03c3)}=\u03c3\u00ee+\u03c3\u0135, where \u03c3and \u03c3are the standard deviation (second moment) for both real-time and drift time domains, (the symbols \u00ee and \u0135 denote unit vectors in the x- and y-dimension respectively), then an ellipse at the 1\/e point of the two-dimensional peak can be fitted.  is a plot illustrating the relationships of the two-dimensional first moment (centroid) and second moment (standard deviation) for an IMS peak drawn as a contour plot.

This is represented by the value of \u03c3. The width of the detected peak (\u03c3) in IMS is a function of several distinct phenomena that are time dependent. Namely, these are the initial pulse width, diffusion (dependent on gas temperature and transit time), electrostatic space charge effects, capacitive coupling between approaching ions and the collector, electric-field gradients, temperature gradients, gate depletion\/dynamic leakage, pressure fluctuations, and ion-molecule reactions in the drift space (see J.

A total of 1028 different runs, with 21 distinct concentration profiles and 48 distinct temperature profiles, provided over 8000 separate signal peaks. The system consisted of a preconcentrator, comprising a stainless steel felt that could be electrically heated, coupled to a PCP IMS operating as a detector. In actual application, large volumes of room air that potentially contain particles of explosives are drawn through the felt and then desorbed by heating into the IMS input. In this experiment, in order to maintain consistency, dissolved samples of explosives were deposited using a micro-liter syringe onto the center of the felt and then heated to desorb them. After the limiting ranges were chosen, a Hardin-Sloane I-optimal design was used to determine sets of values of the operating parameters for which experimental measurements were made (see R. H. Hardin and N. J. A. Sloane, 37(3), 339 (1993)). The run order for the parameter sets was randomized to minimize systematic bias due to unknown factors.","A subset of the data is shown in , which illustrates the application of the P\u00e9clet technique.

The P\u00e9clet number for experiment number  for TNT is much larger for window  than for windows -. In addition, other tests with different delay times and temperature steps do not produce the high P\u00e9clet number. Thus, the \u201crecipe\u201d represented by run  is optimized to produce a high fidelity TNT peak for this IMS measurement system. By employing this two-dimensional P\u00e9clet method, the peaks can be automatically scored and the operational parameters of the IMS system can thus be optimized.","The present invention has been described as a method of multi-dimensional moment analysis for the characterization of signal peaks.
