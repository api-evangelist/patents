{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The present invention relates generally to virtual reality systems, and more particularly, to virtual reality systems capable of allowing mobile and wireless access to real-time sights and sounds of complex environments.","Conventional virtual reality systems use computers and peripheral devices to enable users to perceive and interact with computer generated worlds. In a typical virtual reality system, a user wears garments outfitted with devices which provide information about the position and orientation of the user relative to a fixed reference point. The information is used by the computer system to create a virtual being, where the virtual being emulates the position, orientation, and movements of the user. The database also includes a virtual environment in which the virtual being exists, and the virtual being may act upon virtual objects in the virtual world in a manner which emulates the actions of the user. For example, the virtual being may pick up a virtual ball and throw it, or the virtual being may drive a virtual car.","To allow the user to perceive the virtual world and the actions his or her virtual being within it, the computer animates the virtual world together with the virtual being and projects the virtual world from the viewpoint of the virtual being on a head mounted display. As the user moves around, his or her actions are sensed by the instrumented garment and used by the computer to alter the position and orientation of the virtual being within the virtual world. The displayed image is also modified to follow the viewpoint of the virtual being so that the user is led to believe he or she actually exists in the virtual world. Thus, a user may lower his or her head and look underneath a virtual object, or the user may walk over to a virtual light switch and, by appropriate movements of the user's hand, turn the switch on and off.","Presently, the availability of virtual reality services is limited to fixed and non-real-time phenomena such as entertainment machines and flight simulators. In conventional virtual reality systems, the \u201cenvironment\u201d that a person experiences is manufactured and contained in computer memory. For instance, flight simulators used for training professional pilots and astronauts are a type of virtual reality system commonly in use today, where computer animation is used to create the user environment. Although most user interactive, three dimensional virtual reality systems use computer graphics to model an environment, some limited fixed real-time services requiring low data transmission rate, such as video conferencing and net-meetings, are also offered in which a user can view a real-life environment rather than a computer generated one. Unfortunately, these services do not allow three-dimensional user-controlled involvement of the remote environment and are generally limited to viewing images on a television screen rather than viewing a three dimensional representation of a remote real-life environment. However, the applications for \u201cvirtual reality\u201d will continue to grow and are anticipated as being increasingly common to remotely model and allow participation in an environment. For instance, in the future doctors will be able to participate in medical procedures although located geographically distant from the patient, and businesses will be able to conduct a conference session depicting, to every participant, the presence of others in a virtual conference.","There are a few major obstacles and bottlenecks to the achievement of such an ambitious goal, including the creation of Virtual Reality Environment (VRE) capable user terminal equipment, high speed data transmission over, and controlling network elements for initiating, establishing, maintaining and terminating VRE events. Because high speed data transmission networks and user terminal equipment exist and are continuously being improved, what is needed is a controlling network containing elements to implement the real-time virtual reality environment. The development of the software platform for the control and management of VRE services is considered to be a major challenge for each VRE application in terms of its control logic and its application programming interface (API).","The present invention is a virtual reality system and method which allows physical environments to have a virtual presence everywhere in real time. The concept of the VRE or Virtual Presence Environment (VPE) makes the presentation and presence of the sounds and sights of an actual and complex physical environment virtually available everywhere in real-time through the use of VRE capable networks and devices, including mobile telecommunications devices and networks.","As referred to herein, a virtual reality episode is the presentation of virtual reality data to a user via VRE user equipment, where virtual reality data includes audio, video, textual, and like data representing an environment, such as an actual physical environment. The virtual reality system of the present invention facilitates the setup of the virtual reality episode by receiving virtual reality data captured by VRE user equipment and\/or generated by a computer, and transmitting the virtual reality data via a network, such as a packet-switched network, to other components capable of presenting the virtual reality data. According to one aspect of the invention, the setup and conduction of the virtual reality episode occurs in real-time, such that a user can participate in an episode that represents events presently occurring in an environment. Therefore, the system of the present invention allows a first user at a first geographical location to participate in a virtual reality episode with a second user at a second geographical location that is remote from the first geographical location. Virtual reality episodes enabled by the present invention may comprise one or more users experiencing a remote and\/or computer generated environment as is they were actually in the environment. Users experience the episode through VRE User Equipment, which comprises one or more virtual reality components that are known in the art for displaying the virtual reality episode. According to one aspect of the invention, the VRE User Equipment of the present invention comprises wireless devices such that one or more mobile users at a plurality of locations may simultaneously participate in a virtual reality episode.","According to another aspect of the present invention, the VRE User Equipment also captures images, video, audio, textual and like data associated with an actual environment (also referred to herein as an actual physical environment). This virtual reality data is then received by one or more components of the virtual reality system and distributed to other users that are participating in the virtual reality episode and in communication with the virtual reality system via a wireless or hard-wired connection. For instance, audio and video representing the actual environment a first user experiences may be transmitted to a second user so that the second user may experience the actual environment as if he were actually in that environment. Because the VRE User Equipment may present images and audio to a user in three-dimensions, a user's experience in the virtual environment will be lifelike.","The system of the present invention includes an Episode Management Entity that identifies the one or more users and associated user equipment involved in a virtual reality episode, transmits requisite virtual reality data to each user's respective user equipment via one or more channels and\/or systems, and conducts the virtual reality episode. Using the system of the present invention, one or more users may immerse themselves in an actual physical environment in which another user actually resides. Similarly, using the present invention, one or more users can immerse themselves in a computer-generated environment in which none of them resides.","Examples of VRE services (virtual reality episodes) facilitated by the present invention include (1) a conference session depicting, to every participant, the presence of others in a virtual conference room with a projector screen, drawing board, and so on; (2) a virtual movie theater where the user can view movies in real size and sound; (3) a hospital operation room where a surgeon can perform a real operation remotely or train interns by showing the procedure in a virtual operating room; (4) a virtual concert hall where a conductor can have the virtual presence of all or a selective number of players participating from all over the globe for rehearsals; (5) a house, a shop, or a storage facility where a user can do security checks, identify product availability or determine inventory levels of various items; and (6) navigating an aircraft, conducting a train, or driving a motor vehicle where the virtual environment is created for the cockpit, the locomotive and the driver seat, respectively. A VRE service could be for terminal mobility as well as personal mobility. It could also be set up in a limousine, hotel, airport, or at a home or office.","According to one embodiment of the present invention, there is disclosed a virtual reality system that includes at least one virtual reality environment user equipment, and at least one virtual reality environment core system in wireless communication with the at least one virtual reality environment user equipment. The system also includes a virtual reality environment episode management entity, in communication with the at least one virtual reality environment core system, where the virtual reality environment episode management entity is operative to forward virtual reality data representing an environment to the at least one virtual reality environment user equipment, thereby facilitating a virtual reality episode.","According to one aspect of the present invention, the at least one virtual reality environment user equipment is operative to capture the virtual reality data in real-time. According to another aspect of the present invention, the at least one virtual reality environment user equipment is operative to display the virtual reality data in real-time According to yet another aspect of the present invention, the environment is an actual physical environment. Additionally, the virtual reality episode may be conducted between a plurality of virtual reality environment user equipment. Further, the system can comprise a virtual reality environment access system, where the virtual reality environment access system facilitates the wireless communication of the at least one virtual reality environment user equipment with the at least one virtual reality environment core system.","According to another aspect of the invention, one of the at least one virtual reality core systems includes a virtual reality entity subscription database. Moreover, the virtual reality environment episode management entity may be located within one of the at least one virtual reality environment core system.","According to another embodiment of the present invention, there is disclosed a method of enabling the real-time conduction of a real-time virtual reality episode. The method includes the steps of receiving real time virtual reality data at a virtual reality environment (VRE) episode management entity, where the virtual reality data is representative of an actual physical environment, determining, at the VRE episode management entity, that the virtual reality data is associated with a virtual reality episode, and forwarding at least a portion of the virtual reality data to a VRE user equipment participating in the virtual reality episode, where the VRE user equipment is in wireless communication with the VRE episode management entity.","According to one aspect of the present invention, the method includes capturing in real time virtual reality data representative of an actual physical environment prior to receiving the real time virtual reality data at a virtual reality environment (VRE) episode management entity. According to another aspect of the invention, capturing in real time virtual reality data includes capturing real time audio associated with the actual physical environment. Additionally, capturing in real time virtual reality data may include capturing in real time virtual reality data representative of an actual physical environment located geographically distant from the VRE user equipment.","According to yet another aspect of the present invention, the method further includes identifying the VRE user equipment as participating in the virtual reality episode prior to forwarding at least a portion of the virtual reality data to the VRE user equipment. The method may also include the step of determining the location of the VRE user equipment prior to forwarding at least a portion of the virtual reality data to the VRE user equipment. Moreover, according to another aspect of the invention, determining the location of the VRE user equipment comprises querying a database for the location of the VRE user equipment.","According to yet another embodiment of the present invention, there is disclosed a virtual reality system that enables the real-time conducting of a real-time virtual reality episode. The system includes at least one virtual reality environment user equipment (VUE), associated with at least one user, at least one virtual reality environment core system (VCS), where the at least one VCS has a pre-existing relationship with one of the at least one VUE and the at least one user; and a virtual reality environment episode management entity (VEME), in communication with the at least one user and the VCS, where the VEME forwards real-time virtual reality data representative of an actual physical environment to the at least one VUE associated with the at least one user.","According to yet another embodiment of the present invention, there is disclosed a method of participating in a real-time virtual reality episode. The method includes the steps of providing a virtual reality environment (VRE) user equipment, where the VRE user equipment captures virtual reality data representing an actual physical environment associated with a first user; and wirelessly transmitting the virtual reality data to a second user participating in the virtual reality episode, where the second user is geographically remote from the first user.","According to one aspect of the invention, the method further includes receiving, from the second user, data representing one or more actions performed by the second user. According to another aspect of the invention, the step of wirelessly transmitting occurs automatically after the VRE user equipment captures the virtual reality data.","The present invention now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which preferred embodiments of the invention are shown. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.","The present invention is described below with reference to block diagrams and flowchart illustrations of systems, methods, apparatuses and computer program products according to an embodiment of the invention. It will be understood that each block of the block diagrams and flowchart illustrations, and combinations of blocks in the block diagrams and flowchart illustrations, respectively, can be implemented by computer program instructions. These computer program instructions may be loaded onto a general purpose computer, special purpose computer, or other programmable data processing apparatus to produce a machine, such that the instructions which execute on the computer or other programmable data processing apparatus create means for implementing the functions specified in the flowchart block or blocks.","These computer program instructions may also be stored in a computer-readable memory that can direct a computer or other programmable data processing apparatus to function in a particular manner, such that the instructions stored in the computer-readable memory produce an article of manufacture including instruction means that implement the function specified in the flowchart block or blocks. The computer program instructions may also be loaded onto a computer or other programmable data processing apparatus to cause a series of operational steps to be performed on the computer or other programmable apparatus to produce a computer implemented process such that the instructions that execute on the computer or other programmable apparatus provide steps for implementing the functions specified in the flowchart block or blocks.","Accordingly, blocks of the block diagrams and flowchart illustrations support combinations of means for performing the specified functions, combinations of steps for performing the specified functions and program instruction means for performing the specified functions. It will also be understood that each block of the block diagrams and flowchart illustrations, and combinations of blocks in the block diagrams and flowchart illustrations, can be implemented by special purpose hardware-based computer systems that perform the specified functions or steps, or combinations of special purpose hardware and computer instructions.","Referring now to , a virtual reality system  of the present invention is illustrated that facilitates the establishment and conduction of a real-time virtual reality episode. The virtual reality system  includes three primary components: VRE User Equipment, VRE Access Systems, and VRE Core Systems. VRE User Equipment (VUE)  represents one or more end point devices used by one or more users to transmit virtual reality data describing an Actual Physical Environment (APE) and\/or to receive data for establishing a VRE episode. The VUE  may comprise hardware, software, or a combination thereof. The VUE  may be a handset, headset, helmet, gloves, bodysuit, desk, chair, keyboard, mouse, screen, video camera, recording device, mechanical armature, ultrasonic sensor, magnetic tracker, optical position tracking system, or similar equipment well known in the art for displaying, transmitting and\/or receiving information representative of an APE. It should also be appreciated by those of skill in the art that the VUE  may also comprise any combination of such tools. The VUE  is preferably capable of both capturing and displaying virtual reality data, which includes audio and video data that represents an environment, such as an actual physical environment. The virtual reality data also includes data used by the system to identify the VUE and the virtual reality episode associated with video and audio data, as well as data necessary for the reconstruction and\/or transmission of the video and audio data across a network, as will be explained in greater detail below. According to one preferred embodiment of the present invention, the VUE  is primarily a software driven device which is controlled and\/or manned by one or more users and\/or networks, and is used as an end point in the creation and provisioning of desired VRE services related to various applications (e.g., education, entertainment).","Referring again to , the VUE  is in communication with a VRE Access System (VAS) , which is an intermediate component of the VRE system linking the VUE  to a VRE Core Network System (VCS) , which is described in greater detail below. The VAS  may be in direct communication with the VUE  via a hardwired or network connection, or can be in communication with the VUE  via a wireless connection, such as a fixed terrestrial or satellite radio access system. Although it is preferred that the VAS  communicate with the VUE  via a wireless connection, thereby enabling the mobility of the VUE , it should be appreciated that conducting a virtual reality episode requires substantial bandwidth. As a result, it is preferred that the VUE  and VAS  be connected by a wireless transmission path that provides high transmission and reception speed for both the VUE  and VAS . Such high speed transmission paths are well known in the art. However, it should be appreciated that as higher bandwidths become available for conventional wireless systems and devices, these systems and devices may be used to facilitate the communication between the VUE  and VAS , as well as between other components within the system  of the present invention.","The VAS  provides the VUE  access to the VCS , which is a backbone system that, in conjunction with the VUE  and VAS , forms the VRE system  and facilitates the establishment of VRE episodes between diverse users and APEs that may be geographically distant. Therefore, each VCS includes one or more network communication elements facilitating the communication between VUEs and other elements of the system . As is illustrated in , there can be more than one VCS system involved in establishing a VRE episode. The system  of  includes four VCS components, V-VCS , H-VCS , VCS, and VCS. It should be appreciated that VCS and VCS are intended to illustrate that additional VCS components may also be included in the system . As an illustrative example, using the VCSs in the system  of , a physician associated with VUE  may participate in a virtual reality episode with physicians having respective VUEs at two remote locations, such as at Actual Physical Environment B (APE-B)  and Actual Physical Environment Z (APE-Z) . Therefore, virtual reality data (e.g., video and audio data) is transmitted in between each VCS, and forwarded to each respective VUE to conduct the virtual reality episode. To determine where to transmit the virtual reality data, each VCS contains a number of functional elements, discussed next with reference to .","According to one aspect of the invention, a user and\/or VUE has a subscription with at least one VCS in the system , and each VCS is be a home and\/or visitor VCS. Where the user and\/or the user's VUE  has a pre-established subscription affiliation with a VCS, the VCS is labeled as a home VCS. For instance, in  H-VCS  represents a home VCS because the user and\/or VUE  has a pre-established relationship with the H-VCS , such that the H-VCS  recognizes the user and\/or VUE  and maintains rules that govern the user's or VUE's  activities in the system . For instance, the H-VCS  maintains rules that indicate whether a user or VUE  is authorized to participate in or establish a virtual reality episode, and if so, to what extent the user or VUE  may be involved. The H-VCS  also maintains rules indicating the type of information that may be sent to the VUE  based upon the capability of the VUE  to receive certain types of information. Therefore, it will be appreciated that the H-VCS will include a processor, in communication with at least one look-up table or database, for storing and retrieving rules associated with a user or VUE that has a relationship with the H-VCS. Furthermore, the H-VCS includes a database that contains all the VRE service subscription information data related to the user and\/or the VUE . This VRE Subscriber Database (VSD)  is described in greater detail below and is similar to a home location register in wireless communication systems (and to a HSS in a 3G system).","A visitor VCS (V-VCS)  is the network system which the VUE  is presently visiting and in communication (e.g., wirelessly) with via a VAS. It is a VCS with which the user and\/or the user's VUE  does not have a subscription affiliation. For instance, where the VUE  is a wireless device, a visitor VCS is comparable to a wireless visitor network that does not include a home location register for the wireless device. It will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that a wireless VUE can move in between multiple visitor VCSs when the wireless device is in motion. Therefore, a handoff function is performed when the user and\/or VUE switches visitor systems, where the handoff function is similar to that handoff performed when a cellular or wireless telephone moves between cells. The home VCS, however, remains the same for a given user and\/or VUE  regardless of its location in the system . Additionally, because a VCS may be in communication with multiple users' VUEs, a VCS can simultaneously act as a home VCS for one user and a visitor VCS for another user, where the prior user has a subscription with the VCS and the latter user does not. Because the system  allows a user to participate in a virtual reality episode regardless of each persons location (including while in motion), virtual reality episodes are available for virtually every person for whom there is VUE.","According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, within each VCS of  is a Gateway Entity (GE) , , which is a boundary functional entity within each VCS that facilitates the communication of messages between each VCS. The GWE is also the connecting point of all VECEs in a VCS network to the GWE of another VCS, and is the point of entry and exit for all VRE episode control signaling messages to and from a VCS. The GWE functions as a firewall, hides the structure of its underlying network, and facilitates the flow and routing of the VRE signaling traffic. For instance, because each VCS may format or transmit virtual reality data differently, the GWE may be used to translate the virtual reality data into virtual reality data useful to the VCS and components (e.g., VUE) downstream from the VCS. The functions of each GWE is well known to those of skill in the art. However, because the GWE's role as a security and performance enhancing element is non-essential, it will be appreciated that the VRE systems may be constructed without a GWE (e.g., VCSand VCS) to reduce system costs.","As illustrated in , a VCS includes three primary elements, including a Serving VRE Episode Control Entity (S-VECE), a Proxy VRE Episode Control Entity (P-VECE), and a VRE Subscription Database (VSD). It should be appreciated that although each of the elements are not illustrated in each of the VCS blocks , ,  and  of , and are not necessary to every virtual reality episode (as in the episode illustrated in ), each of these elements resides in each VCS of . A VRE Episode Management Entity (VEME)  is a fourth and additional element that may be located within H-VCS . The function of each of these elements are described in detail below.","According to one aspect of the present invention, there is a 1-to-n correspondence between the VECE (either P-VECE or S-VECE) and VUEs, such that one VECE may be located within a VCS for communicating with a plurality of VUEs. Principally, the S-VECE is in charge of controlling a virtual reality episode associated with a VUE, such as VUE , and a P-VECE, acting on behalf of the S-VECE, is the first point of VRE service control signaling in the V-VCS. As illustrated in , at the time of the VUE's  registration with the V-VCS , a P-VECE  is assigned to attend and monitor, on behalf of the S-VECE , all requests received from and transmitted to the VUE . These requests include requests to join a virtual reality episode, requests for virtual reality data, and similar requests associated with participation in a virtual reality episode. The P-VECE performs this function because the VUE  does not have a pre-established relationship with the VCS . Therefore, although V-VCS  may be a H-VCS for other VUE's with which the V-VCS  has a pre-established relationship, the S-VECE (not illustrated) within the V-VCS  is not used to facilitate communication between the VUE  and other elements of the system  because the V-VCS  is not the home VCS of the VUE .","More specifically, the function of the S-VECE  is to control the virtual reality episode by keeping track of the VUE's  status, such as the VUE's  location, connectivity, and the like. The S-VECE  authenticates the VUE  and queries VUE's VSD  for the services that can be offered to the VUE  during a VRE episode. Furthermore, during a virtual reality episode, the S-VECE  maintains the current P-VECE to which the VUE  is in communication (in , P-VECE ), such that the S-VECE  can forward messages to the VUE via GWEs  and . Therefore, it will be appreciated that unlike the S-VECE , which remains the same during the time that a VRE service episode is in progress, the P-VECE  does not necessarily remain the same, as the VUE  may move within the V-VCS  or from the V-VCS  to another, depending upon the mobility range of the VUE . As noted above, where the VUE  is a mobile device VUE movement may require a hand-off, as is well known to those of ordinary skill in the art of wireless communications. Therefore, each time the device changes from one visitor VCS to another visitor VCS, the S-VECE  is updated according to well-known hand-off procedures such that the S-VECE  can maintain the status of the VUE  and forward information to the VUE .","As illustrated in , for a single VRE episode, there may be more than one VCS. Depending on the number of end points (e.g., VUEs) participating in the episode, their geographical distribution, and their mobility, each end point or each VUE may be connected to a separate VCS through a separate P-VECE and S-VECE. A VUE, either fixed or mobile, at any given point in time is located in an APE. This APE is the physical environment, system or location from which the actual sounds and sights are taken by a VUE device. The APE is converted to a virtual reality data stream of virtual reality data and is transmitted to another VUE device.  presents a few examples of the APE\/VUE such as APE-A , APE-B , and APE-Z  and also shows an example of creating the virtual reality environment at the VUE  by establishing a VRE episode within the VRE system .","As illustrated in , VCS and VCS represent VCSs, containing both S-VECEs and P-VECEs. Therefore, where VUE, such as VUE , wishes to participate in a virtual reality episode with a VUE at APE-B , the S-VECE  communicates with serving VECE  to determine the location of the VUE, and thereafter, the S-VECE  communicates (via GWEs, not illustrated) with the requisite P-VECE  to establish communications with the VAS  and VUEs located at APE-B . A similar scenario occurs for establishing communication with a VUE at APE-Z , where S-VECE  communicates with a VUE and APE-Z  via a P-VECE  and a VAS . Therefore, it will be appreciated that VCSand VCSeach, is both host and home to APE-B\/VUE  and APE-Z\/VUE , respectively. As such each represents blocks similar to the combined V-VCS  and H-VCS .","Also illustrated in the H-VCS  of  is a VRE Episode Management Entity (VEME) that manages, coordinates, synchronizes, and maintains all the events and VRE users' links within a VRE episode. As such, the VEME  is a multimedia management, control and operations center interfacing with the S-VECE of each VUE and the S-VECE of each actual physical environment (APE) that is involved in the virtual reality episode. The VEME  may reside in either the VUE's H-VCS  or on an independent external platform operated by a third party service provider with which the VUE user has VRE service subscription. The VEME's  various functions are performed by a one or more components within the VEME . The functions includes initiation of a VRE episode, negotiations for the type and class of VRE services, maintaining the procession of the episode, adding and\/or dropping a VUE to\/from an established episode, terminating the episode, and finally collecting charging data (from participating S-VECEs) and preparing a single charging record for the originating party(ies) as well as other participants. Each or any combination of these functions may be performed by a functional entity housed in one or more physical entities.","It should be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that the list of aforementioned VEME functions is not exhaustive. Additionally, in performing these functions, the VEME may leverage the use of well-known externally existing programs in compatibility with network operators\/service providers' embedded systems (e.g., charging and accounting). In such cases, all functions will be performed in coordination and conjunction with the execution of the internal entities under the control of a virtual episode service logic program (not illustrated) within the VEME . Furthermore, as the need for customization and enhancements arises, more functions may be added to the VEME .","Next, the process flow of communications in the virtual reality system  of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to , which shows communications transmitted in the system shown in , according to one illustrative embodiment of the present invention. First, after the VUE 's attachment to and registration with the V-VCS , a VRE set-up procedure is initiated when an episode request is transmitted  from the VUE  to the VAS , and from the VAS  to  the P-VECE . Upon recognizing the request for establishing a VRE episode, the P-VECE  forwards the request  to the GWE . The GWE  then forwards the request  to the GWE  at the VUE 's H-VCS  for transmission  to the serving VRE service control attendant, or S-VECE .","Upon recognizing the request for establishing a VRE Episode and obtaining VUE 's service subscription information data from the VSD  (via messages  and ), the S-VECE  sends  a request for VRE episode set-up to the VEME . Based on the information and request received from the S-VECE , the VEME  identifies all end points and their serving VECEs involved in the VRE, and dispatches requests for the VRE episode set-up to various serving VECEs  and  which communicate with APE endpoints  and  via P-VECE  and VAS  and via P-VECE  and VAS , respectively. The request for the VRE episode set-up is also transmitted ,  to endpoints within the VUE 's own home network (e.g., APE-A ) via a VAS .","Based on the request received from the VEME , each of the APE\/VUEs then sends a response to inform their corresponding P-VECEs (forwarded to the S-VECEs) of their readiness to join in the VRE episode. Once all of the participants in the VRE episode have been notified of the VRE episode, and have agreed or responded with a request to join the episode, the S-VECEs ,  and  notify the VEME  that the participants have agreed to participate in the episode. The VEME  then responds  with a confirmation, or Episode Response message, to the S-VECE  in the H-VCS . The S-VECE  then forwards , , and  the episode response message to the P-VECE  in the VUE 's visitor network, V-VCS . The P-VECE , in turn, forwards the response message to the VUE . After all necessary protocol acknowledgements and notifications are completed, as is well known in the art, all necessary bearers are established (at a desired\/requested level of quality of service) and the VRE episode is set-up for the VRE service delivery. The content of the VRE episode request message contains information on requester or originator of the episode, VRE service type, parties involved, service quality level, tariff information, and the like. It should be appreciated that some parameters in the message may be optional. The actual bearer establishment for the VRE episode is carried out in a different plane within the VRE system . This process includes the establishment of the bearers according to the negotiated\/agreed level for the quality of service (e.g., speed and bandwidth) between the end points under the monitoring and control of their corresponding S-VECEs.","It should be appreciated that the communication process flow described in detail herein may also include a protocol response to each action request, acknowledging the request or sending an error response. It should also be appreciated that the procedure described here is generic, and the example above is protocol independent. A VRE episode control may be developed based on a number of existing and well known protocols, such as Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).","Many modifications and other embodiments of the invention will come to mind to one skilled in the art to which this invention pertains having the benefit of the teachings presented in the foregoing descriptions and the associated drawings. Therefore, it is to be understood that the invention is not to be limited to the specific embodiments disclosed and that modifications and other embodiments are intended to be included within the scope of the appended claims.
