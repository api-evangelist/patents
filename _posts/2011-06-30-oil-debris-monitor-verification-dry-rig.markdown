For example, gas turbine engines typically have gears and bearings that require a lubricating liquid, such as oil, to lubricate and cool those gears and bearings during operation. During operation, debris accumulates in the lubricating liquid. Because of this, lubrication systems typically include an oil debris monitor system to sense metal debris in the oil. An oil debris monitor system is normally used to flag the initiation or progression of mechanical failures in the lubricated mechanical machinery.","It is extremely difficult to validate the accuracy of an oil debris monitor system while it is installed in a lubrication system. Thus, it is important to validate the accuracy of an oil debris monitor prior to it being installed in the lubrication system. It can also be difficult to reliably validate accuracy of an oil debris monitor in a lab with known validation methods, especially in a lab that does not allow oil to be present.","According to the present invention, an assembly includes a debris monitor mount, a motor, and a particle belt. The particle belt carries one or more metallic particles. The particle belt is driven by the motor. The particle belt extends proximate the debris monitor mount when driven by the motor.","Another embodiment of the present invention is a method for testing an oil debris monitor. The method includes positioning a belt containing particles detectable by the oil debris monitor in an oil flow passage of the oil debris monitor, moving the belt through the oil flow passage so as to pass the particles through the oil flow passage, and operating the oil debris monitor to test whether the oil debris monitor can detect the particles on the belt.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","12","14","16","18","20","22","24","26","28","26","30","30","32"]},"Pump  pumps a lubricating liquid, such as oil through oil debris monitor , filter , and valves  and  to components . The oil cools components , lubricates components , and carries debris from lubricated components  as it is returned to pump . Oil tank  is connected between valve  and pump . Oil tank  is used to store extra oil during times that it is not needed by lubrication system  for load requirements and to compensate for consumed oil. In one embodiment, lubrication system  can be a gas turbine engine lubrication system for lubricating gears and bearings on a gas turbine engine. In other embodiments, oil debris monitor  can be used in other lubrication systems that benefit from an accurate oil debris monitor, such as a Diesel engine or other machinery. Oil debris monitor  includes one or more coils , and also includes flow passage  extending through coils . Coils  detect ferrous and non-ferrous metallic particles passing through flow passage . Particle debris detected by oil debris monitor  can be indicative of mechanical failure of components .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["40","16","40","42","44","46","48","50","52","54","56","58","59","59","59","59","52","16","48","60","60","48","60","60","48","44","46","52","36","16","50","62","60","50","44","46","50","48","42","44","64","44","46","50","46","42","44","48","60","16","42","60","16","16"]},"Controller A is connected to and controls motor , vibrator , and heater . Computer B is connected to and receives data from optical sensor system  and oil debris monitor console C. Oil debris monitor console C is connected to oil debris monitor , and performs data acquisition and signal processing on data received from oil debris monitor . The resulting data is then sent by oil debris monitor console C to computer B. Communication connections can be wired or wireless connections.","Data is collected by computer B from both oil debris monitor console C and optical system  for post processing and comparison. Optical sensor system  is positioned with respect to belt  so as to sense optical marks  on belt . Optical sensor system  sends a position signal to computer B so that computer B can record when one or more particles  pass through oil debris monitor , and consequently determine whether computer B receives a correct debris signal from oil debris monitor console C. Each optical mark  can include a code for various information relating to its corresponding particle , such as position, size, and type (e.g. ferrous or other material) of particle . This allows optical sensor system  to send particle information relating to particles  in addition to particle position. Use of optical sensor system  allows for more automated verification, thus increasing the reliability of verification performed using verification rig .","Alternatively, a user can analyze data on computer B without use of optical sensor system . For example, by knowing the speed of motor  and spacing of particles  on belt , one can analyze data received from oil debris monitor console C to determine whether oil debris monitor  is properly detecting particles .","Vibrator  is connected to mount  for vibrating oil debris monitor , which is also mounted to mount  during verification. This simulates engine vibration, allowing for more accurate simulated engine conditions when verifying oil debris monitor . Heater  is connected to mount  for heating oil debris monitor  during verification. This simulates elevated oil temperature, also allowing for more accurate simulated engine conditions when verifying oil debris monitor . In alternative embodiments, heater  need not be directly mounted to mount  so long as heater  is positioned proximate mount  so as to allow heater  to heat oil debris monitor . Heater  can be virtually any suitable heater, such as a coil wrapped around oil debris monitor  or a heating chamber within which oil debris monitor  is placed.","Verification rig  can be operated by first mounting oil debris monitor  to mount  and positioning belt  in oil flow passage . Next, motor  rotates wheel , which causes belt  to rotate wheel , and moves belt  through flow passage  so as to pass particles  through flow passage . Belt  moves at a rate corresponding to that of belt . Oil debris monitor  can then be operated to verify the ability of oil debris monitor  to detect particles . While operating oil debris monitor , vibrator  can vibrate oil debris monitor  and heater  can heat oil debris monitor  so as to more accurately simulate conditions of operation, such as those of a gas turbine engine. Speed of motor  can be varied so as to vary the speed of particles  passing through oil debris monitor . The speed of motor  can simulate a minimum expected flow speed and a maximum expected flow speed, and speeds in-between. Vibrator  and heater  can create vibration and heat conditions that correspond to the simulated flow speeds to ensure oil debris monitor  can detect particles during all relevant flow speeds and their associated operating conditions. Together, motor , vibrator , and heather  can simulate various engine running conditions such as engine start, ground idle, snap acceleration, ramp acceleration, and others. While sensing with oil debris monitor , optical sensor system  detects optical marks  that correspond with positioning of particles . Oil debris monitor  can send debris signals to computer B via oil debris monitor console C, and optical sensor system  can send position signals and\/or other particle information to computer B. Based upon the debris signals and the particle information signals, computer B can be used to compare both data and then determine whether oil debris monitor  is operating correctly.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2","FIG. 4"],"b":["48","3","3","48","48","48","48","48","60","60","48","48","60","48","48","60","60","60","48","60"],"sub":["L ","L"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3","FIGS. 1 and 2","FIG. 3","FIGS. 3 and 4"],"b":["48","4","4","60","60","60","48","60","16","60","60","60","48","60","48","16"],"sub":"L "},"The features of verification rig  have numerous benefits and advantages. First, verification rig  is a \u201cdry\u201d rig, in that it does not require the use of oil to validate oil debris monitor . This allows verification rig  to be operated in a clean laboratory that does not allow the presence of oil, such as an Electronic Verification Bench. Second, verification rig  allows for more accurate simulation of operating conditions such as heat, vibration, and flow speed. Third, verification rig  allows for particles  to be positioned and spaced as desired for testing. This all allows a user to more accurately test and verify accuracy of an oil debris monitor's ability to detect debris particles.","While the invention has been described with reference to exemplary embodiments, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes may be made and equivalents may be substituted for elements thereof without departing from the scope of the invention.
