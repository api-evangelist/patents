Field","This invention relates to the field of location services for mobile devices, and more paritcularly to enhanced user control of privacy policy for responses to location requests.","2. Description of Related Art","Location services (abbreviated as LCS, for \u201cLoCation Services\u201d) for mobile telephones and wireless digital communication devices (collectively referred to hereinafter as Mobile Stations) are an increasingly important business area for wireless communication providers. This importance is reflected in the establishment of standards and functional specifications for LCS. Three exemplary LCS references are: 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), Technical Specification Group (TSG) Services and System Aspects, Functional stage 2 (SA2) description of LCS, Release 6, (3GPP TS 23.271 V6.0.0), June, 2002; Technical Document (TD) S2-022360, 3GPP TSG-SA2 Meeting #26, Toronto, Canada, August 19-23, 2002; and 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), Technical Specification Group (TSG) Services and System Aspects, Functional stage 2 (SA2) description of LCS, Release 6, (3GPP TS 23.271 V6.3.0), March, 2003. The references are referred to hereinafter as 3GPP-R1, 3GPP-R2, and 3GPP-R3 respectively.","References 3GPP-R1 and 3GPP-R3 describe a functional model of an entire LCS system, including sections relating to user privacy. Reference 3GPP-R2 describes a network element, referred to as a Privacy Profile Register (PPR), that maintains the LCS privacy information of subscribers and that facilitates corresponding privacy functions. These incorporated references provide an overview of recent technology and standards relating to LCS and related LCS privacy operations. Numerous methods and apparatus for providing LCS to subscribers in accordance with these references are known to persons with ordinary skill in the communications arts.","One known advantageous method for determining the location of a Mobile Station in a wireless communication system employs the Global Positioning System (GPS). Including a GPS device (or more generally, a Position Determination module, or \u201cPDM\u201d) in the Mobile Station provides very accurate position determination capability. When a PDM is used as the primary means for providing accurate location information within a Mobile Station, the service provider network must contact the Mobile Station when requests for accurate location are received. Methods and apparatus for implementing the location service function using a PDM, such as using GPS in a Mobile Station, are well known to persons of ordinary skill in the wireless communications arts. Handsets implementing LCS functions using GPS are currently available. An exemplary GPS system for mobile stations is described the reference \u201cAn Introduction to SnapTrack\u2122 Server-Aided GPS Technology,\u201d M. Moeglein and N. F. Krasner, Institute of Navigation (ION) GPS 1998 Proceedings, Sep. 15\u201318, 1998, pp. 333\u2013344. A recent patent application that describes a GPS system suitable for mobile stations is \u201cMethod and Apparatus for Measurement Processing of Satellite Positioning System (SPS) Signals,\u201d L. Sheynblat and N. F. Krasner, U.S. Patent Application , May 2, 2002.","Disadvantageously, user control of privacy policy information is very limited and inflexible using existing LCS privacy methods wherein user privacy is managed by a service provided network. For example, in some exemplary prior art LCS privacy methods, various classes of requestor clients are defined by the service provider, and a user privacy profile, such as the PPR referred to above, based on these classes is established when the user initiates service. In accordance with these LCS privacy methods, the privacy profile designates certain requestor classes that have unrestricted access to the user location, and other requestor classes that have restricted access. Such restrictions may, for example, include an automatic denial of LCS information to specific restricted classes. The restrictions may also include a requirement that the user be notified and (optionally) approve LCS access requests by requestors from specified restricted classes. In these exemplary prior art systems, privacy profile modifications may only be effected by modifying the service agreement between the provider and the user. In cases where user location is primarily determined by a PDM resident within the Mobile Station, an additional modification option is effected by disabling the PDM. Although this option enhances privacy by enabling the user to prevent the retrieval of accurate position information, the usefulness of this approach is extremely limited because it prevents accurate location retrieval for all requestor classes until the PDM is once again enabled.","The present disclosure is directed to a method and apparatus for LCS privacy management within a Mobile Station. The present disclosure enables convenient and flexible LCS control by a Mobile Station user.","The present disclosure relates to a method and apparatus for providing the geographical location of a wireless mobile station, and more particularly to methods and apparatus for providing enhanced user control of privacy policies that supervise responses to requests for location information. These requests are hereinafter referred to as location requests or, equivalently, as position requests.","In one exemplary embodiment, a privacy control system for a Mobile Station comprises a Privacy Engine, a Position Determination Module (PDM), and a User Interface. The Privacy Engine is a software module that controls the responses of the Mobile Station to location requests.","The Privacy Engine further includes a Privacy Policy. The Privacy Policy includes Privacy Classes for classifying location requestors and their associated location requests, and Privacy Rules for determining the response to location requests for each Privacy Class.","A Privacy Class is defined by a list of location requesters and applications. The location requestors and applications may be individually specified, or grouped into categories or types, based on identifying information such as a URL, an Internet domain, or other data that may be supplied with a position request. A location request is classified according to the location requestor. Location requests can thereby be assigned to a Privacy Class based on information provided with the location request. Examples of Privacy Classes include, without limitaion: a default Privacy Class for unknown or undeclared location request applications and requestor identities not specifically included in any other class; a default Privacy Class for trusted location request applications and requestor identities not specifically included in any other class; and user specified classes including location request applications and requestor identities identified by a URL or other identification data that may be provided with position request data.","Each Privacy Class has an associated set of Privacy Rules for determining the response of the Privacy Engine to location requests. Examples include, without limitation: a rule specifying unrestricted access; a rule for default denial of access; a rule for access contingent on user notification and required approval; a rule for access with user notification but without required approval; a rule for access denial during user-selected time periods; a rule for access only for a defined approximation of location; etc. The Privacy Policy, the Privacy Classes, and the Privacy Rules determine how the Privacy Engine responds to each and all location requests.","Advantageously, using the present inventive enhanced user privacy methods and apparatus, the Privacy Policy for a specific Mobile Station may be controlled or modified by the user via the User Interface in the Mobile Station. In one exemplary embodiment, the User Interface comprises a user interface having suitable input means such as a stylus, pointing device or keypad. In another embodiment of the present inventive concept, the Privacy Policy is controlled via a network application that connects to the Mobile Station through a wireless data network. In a further embodiment of the present inventive method, Privacy Policy may be controlled by an application residing in a local device, such as a laptop computer or personal digital assistant, wherein the device is operatively connected to the Mobile Station.","Advantageously, the Mobile Station's Privacy Engine, including an initial Privacy Policy, may be received by (i.e., downloaded to) the Mobile Station via a wireless data network.","Like reference numbers and designations in the various drawings indicate like elements.","Throughout this description, embodiments and variations are described for the purpose of illustrating uses and implementations of the inventive concept. The illustrative description should be understood as presenting examples of the inventive concept, rather than as limiting the scope of the concept as disclosed herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["102","106","112","114","118","120","122","124"]},"As shown in , in one embodiment of the present inventive concept, the Wireless Network Communication Module  provides a wireless data connectivity between the Mobile Station  and external data networks . The external data networks  may comprise a variety of network systems. For example, in one embodiment an external data network may comprise wireless service provider network. As another example, an external data network may be an Internet Service Provider that provides a connection to receive and transmit data between the Mobile Station and the Internet. In general, the external data networks  comprise any data system capable of transmitting and receiving data to and from a Mobile Station using wireless communication. As shown in , the Wireless Network Communication Module  is also operatively coupled to the Applications block  and the Privacy Engine . The Wireless Communication Module  receives and transmits data from the Application block  and the Privacy Engine .","In one embodiment, the Applications block  comprises location applications that may require a position estimate of the Mobile Station. These location applications may be MS resident, which do not need interaction with the network, or may involve interaction with a location server in the network (e.g. module ) and therefore act as a location client. For this exemplary embodiment the Applications block  also comprises other applications relating to network data communications and other functions of Mobile Station. Examples of such applications include, without limitation: email clients, web browsers, ftp clients, and other software applications for receiving or downloading data, data files and software instructions to the Mobile Station . The Applications block  is coupled to the Wireless Communication Module  to receive and transmit data and thereby communicate with the external data networks . The Applications block  is also operatively coupled to the User Interface  to receive and transmit data for user operation and communication with various applications. The Applications block  is further operatively coupled to the Privacy Engine  to receive and transmit data. Such data may comprise location request and response data. Such data may also comprise received or downloaded software instructions to create, modify, and implement functions and capabilities of the Privacy Engine . Alternatively, data to create, modify or implement functions of the Privacy Engine may be received directly from the Wireless Communication Module , which is also operatively coupled to the Privacy Engine  to receive and transmit data. As a further alternative, data to create, modify or implement functions of the Privacy Engine may be received and executed by components of the Mobile Station not shown in . Such components are well known to those skilled in the communications arts, and may, for example, comprise Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), Application Programming Interfaces (API), Random Access Memory (RAM), Read Only Memory (ROM), etc. Exemplary methods and systems for downloading and executing applications in Mobile Stations via wireless networks are described by Lundblade, et al., \u201cSafe Application Distribution and Execution in a Wireless Environment,\u201d U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US 2002\/0183056 A1, Dec. 5, 2002.","The Local Communication Module  provides a means for optionally receiving and transmitting data between the Mobile Station  and an external local applications module . In one embodiment, the external local applications module  resides on a locally connected device such a personal computer, laptop, or personal digital assistant. The Module  provides connectivity to the locally connected device. The Local Communication Module  is also operatively coupled to the Privacy Engine  to receive and transit data. Such data may include software instructions that create, modify, and implement the functions and capabilities of the Privacy Engine . Additionally, these data may include input and output data for location applications (applications requiring location data) that are running on a separate device such as a laptop that is connected to the MS via infrared, Bluetooth, USB cable, or other means that are distinct from the network connectivity provided by the Wireless Communication module . Routing these location data to the Privacy Engine  facilitates privacy management for location requests by local applications as described hereinbelow.","As described above, the Privacy Engine  is coupled to the elements , , and  to receive and transmit data. The Privacy Engine  is also coupled to receive and transmit data with the User Interface , the Position Determination Module , and the Other Modules . The functions and operation of the Privacy Engine  are specified hereinbelow.","The User Interface  provides a means for a Mobile Station user to receive information from, provide instructions to, and operate the applications and functions embodied in the Applications block  and the Privacy Engine . The User Interface  may, for example, comprise a graphical user interface and suitable input means such as a touch screen, pointing device or keypad. The User Interface  may also comprise means to transmit and receive sounds, voice commands, or any other means for receiving information from, providing instructions to, and operating the software modules, applications and digital devices coupled to the Mobile Station .","The Position Determination Module (PDM)  generates data that represents the location of the Mobile Station . One well known example of a suitable PDM employs a Global Positioning System (GPS) device or method. However, the current teachings comprehend the utilization of any PDM having a capability for providing position or location data to the Mobile Station . For example, the PDM may employ such well known positioning methods as assisted GPS (AGPS), Advanced Forward Link Trilateration (AFLT), Time of Arrival (TOA), Enhanced Observed Time Difference (E-OTD), positioning based on identifying the wireless communication cells within which the MS is operating (cell-based positioning), etc. These methods are well known to persons skilled in the communication arts and do not require description herein.","The Other Modules block  represents software modules and hardware components for implementing or augmenting functions of the Mobile Station. These software modules and hardware components may, for example, include Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), Application Programming Interfaces (API), Random Access Memory (RAM), Read Only Memory (ROM), a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) or Universal Subscriber Identity Module (USIM), a camera, etc. Although the connections for the Other Modules block  are not shown in , persons skilled in the art will readily understand how the modules and components in the Other Modules block  are operably coupled within the Mobile Station as required for functionality.","Referring still to , in one exemplary embodiment, a Privacy Management Server  comprises a software application that is connected to the external data networks  to receive and transmit data. The Privacy Management Server  is coupled to the external data networks  to exchange data with the Wireless Network Communication Module . The Privacy Management Server  communicates with the Privacy Engine  via the external data networks  and the Wireless Network Communication Module .

These requests are herein referred to as location requests or, equivalently, as position requests.","The Privacy Engine further includes a Privacy Policy. The Privacy Policy is a component of the Privacy Engine that includes Privacy Classes for classifying location requestors and their associated location requests, and Privacy Rules for determining the response to location requests for each Privacy Class.","A Privacy Class is defined by a list of location requestors and applications. The location requestors and applications may be individually specified, or grouped into categories or types, based on identifying information such as a URL, an Internet domain, or other data which may be supplied with a position request.

Examples include, without limitation: a rule specifying unrestricted access; a rule specifying default denial of access; a rule specifying access contingent on user notification and required approval; a rule specifying access with user notification but without required approval; a rule specifying access denial during user-selected time periods; a rule specifying access only for a defined approximation of location; etc. The Privacy Policy, the included Privacy Classes, and the included Privacy Rules determine how the Privacy Engine responds to each and all location requests.","Exemplary Initialization and Software Upgrade Method","In one exemplary embodiment of the present inventive concept, a Mobile Station without user privacy control can be initially provided with software modules to implement Enhanced User Privacy for Mobile Station LCS by receiving or downloading data from a network server. The software data and instructions for installing and operatively implementing the Privacy Engine  (), including an initial Privacy Policy, can be received or downloaded to the Mobile Station  from a network server (for example, the Privacy Management Server  of , or other network servers not shown) via the Wireless Communication Module . Receiving and installing the received or downloaded data may be performed by a browser or other component in the Network Applications module  or by components included in the Other Modules . Methods for receiving or downloading applications and software modules to Mobile Stations via a wireless network connection are well known to persons of ordinary skill in the wireless communications arts. As noted hereinabove, exemplary methods and systems for downloading and executing applications in Mobile Stations via wireless networks are described by the Lundblade reference. In one embodiment, the Mobile Station includes a software platform to assist interfacing applications to the Mobile Station, such as the Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless\u2122 (BREW) software developed by QUALCOMM Incorporated, headquartered in San Diego, Calif.","Software upgrades and modifications of the Privacy Engine  (still referring to ), the Privacy Policy and other Mobile Station software modules and components can also be received or downloaded from a network server as described above. In particular, the user (or other entity having permission to do so), may update the Privacy Policy using the wireless network connection. Alternatively, the user may also update the Privacy Policy using the User Interface . In another alternative, the user may update the Privacy Policy by inputting data using an external local application (as represented by External Local Applications block ) connected via the Local Communication Module . In yet another alternative, the user may input user-specific Privacy Policy data using an removable data storage device (not shown in ). User-specific Privacy Policy data include Privacy Classes and Privacy Rules that may be selected, modified or created according to the requirements or preferences of the mobile station user. In one advantageous embodiment of the present inventive concept, the Mobile Station  is provided by the manufacturer or service provider with an initial or default Privacy Engine that includes a generic Privacy Policy. The generic Privacy Policy is then customized by the user to include user-specific Privacy Classes and Privacy Rules by one or more of the following methods: 1) downloading user-specific Privacy Policy data from a network; 2) inputting user-specific Privacy Policy data using the User Interface; 3) using an external local application in a locally connected device to input user-specific Privacy Policy data; or 4) using a removable data storage device to input previously stored user-specific Privacy Policy data. An exemplary implementation of removable data storage devices, such as Subscriber Identity Modules, Universal Subscriber Identity Modules or Removable Identity Modules, is described hereinbelow.","Exemplary Method of Operation for Enhanced User Privacy Control",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIGS. 2(","FIGS. 2(","FIGS. 2(","FIGS. 2(","FIGS. 2(","FIGS. 2("],"i":["a","d","a","b","a","c","b","c","b","d","c","d"],"b":["2","2","214","220","230","232","2","202","208","223","2","258","2","214","246","2","246"]},"The element  in ) represents a state during which the Privacy Engine  ( awaits reception of a request for location data information (i.e., a position request). At the STEP  the Privacy Engine  receives a position request via the data connections described hereinabove with reference to . In reference to the present exemplary implementation, the Position Request data may comprise any of the following information: 1) network address and type of Location Request Application; 2) requestor category (e.g., emergency service, commercial service, individual person); 3) requestor identity, if applicable; 4) code word or digital certificate for verification of requestor identity; 5) requested Quality of Service (QoS). It shall be obvious to those of ordinary skill in the communications arts that the scope of the present teachings comprehends use of other types of Position Request data such as, for example, geographical area information, user information, requestor information, coordinate system, etc., as may be required to implement other embodiments.","Referring again to ), at the STEP , a Position Request Counter is initialized to a value of zero. The value zero represents the case where only one Position Request has been received. If subsequent Position Requests are received while a first Position Request is being processed, the Position Request Counter is incremented and decremented as described hereinbelow. The purpose of the Position Request Counter is for management of multiple concurrent position requests.","The element  represents a flow connection from ). As described below, position Request data will be processed by the inventive method subsequent to a STEP  of ) via the flow connection  only if a subsequent Position Request is received while a prior Position Request is being processed.","At the STEP , the Privacy Engine  () invokes a selected Privacy Policy that assigns a Privacy Class to the Position Request received during STEP  (or via the element ). As described above, the Privacy Policy comprises a list for assigning Privacy Classes to Position Requests, and Privacy Rules for decisions based on the assigned Privacy Classes.","Referring again to , the Privacy Engine  may optionally invoke the Applications module  the Other Modules , or Mobile Station modules and components not shown in the Figure, to perform classification of the Position Request data. For example, a network application may be invoked to verify digital certificate data.","Referring again to ), at a STEP  the Position Request data are evaluated to determine whether the Position Request is an Emergency Service Request. In accordance with usual statutory requirements, an Emergency Service Request shall override the Privacy Policy, and position data shall be returned to the requester as expeditiously as possible. For an Emergency Service Request the method proceeds via the flow connection  to a Step  ()) to bypass the Privacy Policy and the expedite response. For a non-emergency request, the method proceeds to a STEP .","At the STEP  the Position Request data are evaluated to determine if there are other requirements that necessitate overriding the Privacy Policy. For example, certain coutries may require an override for requests originating from law enforcement or other government agencies. If an override is required, the method proceeds via the flow connection  to the STEP  to expedite processing. If an override is not required, the method proceeds to a STEP .","Referring again to ), at the STEP , the Privacy Engine   invokes the Privacy Policy to determine whether the Position Request should be denied based on the rules associated with the Privacy Class assigned to the request. Denial of a request position information may be determined based upon a plurality of criteria. In a first example, the request may be denied because the requestor is a commercial entity, and the assigned Privacy Class for commercial entities specifies automatic denial. In a second example, the request may be denied because the requester identity is a private individual who has been placed in a Privacy Class with a rule specifying automatic denial. In a third example, the request may be denial because the Position Request data does not include a digital certificate or password that verifies identify of the requester, and the default Privacy Class for this category includes a rule specifying automatic denial. In a fourth example, the user may have chosen to designate that all Position Requests, other than those related to emergency services, be placed in a Privacy Class specifying automatic denial during specified time periods. It will be obvious to those skilled in the wireless communications art that many other examples are comprehended within the scope of the present teachings.","If a decision is made at the STEP  to deny the Position Request, then no position will be computed and the method proceeds to a STEP  whereat a denial of service message is transmitted to a Location Request Application. As described below in more detail in reference to the description of the flow diagram of ), the STEP  may also be implemented via flow connection  following STEPS  or  of ). Following the STEP , the inventive method proceeds to a STEP  of ) via the process flow connection . As will be explained more fully hereinbelow, at the STEP  the method checks the Position Request Counter to determine whether additional position requests are queued before either returning to the idle state process STEP , or executing further process steps.","Returning to ), if a determination is made at the decision STEP  that the request should not be denied, a Privacy Policy is invoked at a STEP  to determine whether user notification is required. If user notification is determined not to be required at the STEP , the inventive method proceeds via the flow connection  to a STEP  of ) for further processing. This is described in more detail below in regard to the description of ).","If user notification is determined at the STEP  to be required, then at a STEP  notification is conveyed to the user via the User Interface  (). The User Interface  may employ a sound, image, vibration, or other means to alert the user that a Position Request has been granted, and graphical, text, or audible display or other presentation may be used to convey information relating to the Position Request, such as requestor category, requestor identity, and\/or requested QoS.","At a STEP  the Privacy Engine  invokes the Privacy Policy to determine if the Position Request requires user response in addition to user notification.

If an absence of user response requires denial, then the inventive method proceeds via the flow connection  to the STEP  (shown in )). If absence of user response does not require denial, then the method proceeds to the STEP  for further processing.","If the timed wait for user response of the STEP  is terminated by the event represented at the STEP  (User Denies Request), then the inventive method proceeds via the flow connection  to the STEP , shown in ).","As shown in ), if a new Position Request is received during the timed wait of the STEP , i.e., the event represented at the STEP  (Possible Arrival of New Position Request During Wait) occurs prior to the termination of the timed wait for user response, then the new Position Request data received by the Privacy Engine  ( are transferred, and the method proceeds to a STEP .","Still in reference to ), at the STEP  the new Position Request is evaluated to determine whether the request is an Emergency Service Request. For an Emergency Service Request the method proceeds via the flow connection  to a STEP  ()). At the STEP  the Position Request Counter is incremented and the method proceeds to a STEP . At the STEP  the processing for the prior Position Request is suspended and placed in a queue for subsequent processing, as explained hereinbelow. In another embodiment (not shown) the method may instead abort processing of the prior Position Request at the STEP . In yet another embodiment (not shown), means are provided to enable the PD module  ( to process a plurality of simultaneous requests. Following the STEP , the method proceeds to the STEP  ()) via the flow connection  for expedited processing of the Emergency Service Request.

In alternative embodiments additional steps may be inserted and implemented prior to the STEP  for the purpose of deciding whether the new. Position Request should be denied instead of queued. In these embodiments it may be advantageous to deny unacceptable requests if the added steps result in an overall improvement in efficiency. In one example, a request that stipulates an unacceptable QoS may be denied at once rather than placed in queue.","As shown in ), the STEP  may be entered from any of the STEPS , , or (via flow connection ) the STEP  ()). At the STEP , Position Request data designating QoS are compared with Privacy Rules that apply for the current Position Request. For the purpose of describing the exemplary implementation, QoS may represent the accuracy of position data to be returned to the Location Request Application. The position data may comprise latitude and longitude coordinate data in conjunction with QoS data representing the accuracy of the position estimate. If the QoS specified by the Position Request data complies with limits specified by the Privacy Rules applicable for the present Position Request, the method proceeds to a STEP . If the QoS specified by the Position Request data do not comply with Privacy Policy limits, the QoS data are modified for compliance in a STEP  before further processing at the STEP . Further discussion to clarify the purpose and use of QoS specifications will be given in the Exemplary Applications section described hereinbelow.","At the STEP , the method activates the PD module  () in order to retrieve position data in accordance with Position Request data and current Privacy Policy specifications.

For the purpose of describing the exemplary implementation, QoS may represent an estimated accuracy of PDM position coordinate data to be returned to the Location Request Application. The PDM data, for example, may comprise latitude and longitude data in conjunction with QoS data representing the accuracy of the position estimate. If the QoS of the PDM data complies with limits specified by the Privacy Rules relating to the Privacy Class of the current Position Request, the methods proceeds to a STEP  for further processing. If the QoS specified by the PDM data do not comply with Privacy Policy limits for the present instance, then the QoS data are modified for compliance at a STEP . After the position estimate is reformatted at the STEP , the method proceeds to the STEP . More detailed description of the purpose and use of QoS specifications is provided below in the Exemplary Applications section.","The PDM data are transmitted to the Location Request Application at the STEP . The method then proceeds to the STEP , whereat the Position Request Counter is interrogated to determine if new Position Requests are pending. If the counter value is determined to be zero, indicating that no pending requests are present, then the method returns to the wait state  ()). If the counter value is an integer greater than zero, then the method proceeds to a STEP . At the STEP , new Position Request data are retrieved from the new Position Request data queue.","The method then proceeds to a STEP , whereat the Position Request Counter is decremented. The method then proceeds (via the flow connection ) to the STEP  ()) to further process new Position Request data.","Exemplary Applications","In a typical application of the present teachings, several user-configurable Privacy Classes, and properties or rules appertaining thereto, can be defined. As described above in reference to , user configurability may be effected via data connections between the Privacy Engine  and the User Interface , the Privacy Management Server  (or other network servers not shown in the Figures), or the External Local Applications . It is desirable to permit configuration and modification of the Privacy Engine  and Privacy Policy by secure means only. By way of example, secure means may comprise methods and means for providing secure digital communication, use of passwords, digital certificates, and other well known identity verification and authentication methods.","Privacy Classes may include, without limitation, the following types:\n\n","Each Privacy Class may include, without limitation, the following Privacy Rules:\n\n","In one embodiment of the present inventive concept, the Mobile Station  () may include a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM), a Universal Subscriber Identity Module (USIM) or a Removable User Identity Module (RUIM). SIM, USIM and RUIM devices are removable storage components for Mobile Stations that enable secure storage of user-specific information. As previously described in reference to , the SIM, USIM or RUIM device may be included in the Other Modules block . In this exemplary embodiment, user-specific Privacy Policy data are stored in the SIM, USIM or RUIN device. The devices are operatively coupled to the Privacy Engine  (connection not shown in ), and the user-specific Privacy Policy data are transmitted to the Privacy Engine  for implementation of the Privacy Engine  operations described hereinabove. User-specific Privacy Policy data are also received from the Privacy Engine for storage. This occurs when the Privacy Policy data are initially received for storage by the SIM, USIM or RUIM device, and when the data are changed or updated. When the SIM, USIM or RUIN is removed from the Mobile Station , the user-specific Privacy Policy information may then be advantageously deleted automatically from the Privacy Engine . The use of SIM, USIM or RUIN devices for removable storage of user-specific data in Mobile Stations is well known to persons skilled in the communication arts. Standards for implementation of SIM devices are described in the reference 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), Technical Specification (TS) Group Terminals, Subscriber Identity Module Application Programming Interface (SIM API), Stage 1, Release 1999, (3GPP TS 02.19 V8.0.0), June, 2001. This reference is hereby fully incorporated by reference herein as though set forth in full, for teachings relating to implementation of SIM devices. It will also be obvious to persons skilled in the art that the present teachings encompass embodiments wherein other removable storage devices (such as smart cards or memory sticks) are included in a Mobile Station and used in conjunction with the Privacy Engine for storage of user-specific Privacy Policy data.","In light of the examples provided in the description above, those of ordinary skill in the communications art shall recognize that the teachings herein can be broadly and generally applied to user control and management of personal privacy information relating to LCS.","Those of ordinary skill in the communications and computer arts shall also recognize that computer readable medium which tangibly embodies the method steps of any of the embodiments herein may be used in accordance with the present teachings. For example, the method steps described above with reference to )\u2013() may be embodied as a series of computer executable instructions stored on a the computer readable medium. Such a medium may include, without limitation, RAM, ROM, EPROM, EEPROM, floppy disk, hard disk, CD-ROM, etc. The disclosure also includes the method STEPS of any of the foregoing embodiments synthesized as digital logic in an integrated circuit, such as a Field Programmable Gate Array, or Programmable Logic Array, or other integrated circuits that can be fabricated or modified to embody computer program instructions.","The Mobile Station  in accordance with the present teachings may include, without limitation: wireless telephone, a personal digital assistant with wireless communication capability, a laptop with wireless communication capability, and any other mobile digital device for personal communication via wireless connection.","A number of embodiments of the present inventive concept have been described. Nevertheless, it will be understood that various modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the concept as disclosed herein. For example, the methods can be executed in software or hardware, or a combination of hardware and software embodiments.
