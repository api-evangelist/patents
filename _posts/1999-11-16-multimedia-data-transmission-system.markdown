Usually, they consist simply of an application that runs on a computer equipped with interface cards to the telephone network.","In its most widely distributed form, a host server is capable of finding data on external data servers accessible through the same LAN, using RPC (Remote Procedure Call) or ODBC (Open DataBase Connectivity) type protocols.","This type of structure is suitable for the accommodation of simple multimedia servers in which there is no dynamic information. A company that would like to have a server accommodated describes the required service logic (if the user types #1, \u201c you typed 1\u201d . . . should be displayed) statically, and this logic runs on the service supplier accommodation platform independently.","On the other hand, it becomes impossible to accommodate an application that requests information that necessitates close integration with one of the company's vital databases (booking statements, etc.), and the company must equip itself with its own infrastructure.","More and more companies would like to integrate this type of multimedia service more closely with internal data in their industrial process. The objective is to inform the customer in real time if the ticket that he has just purchased is available, the value of his share portfolio, etc. These are dynamic data that are only available within the company.","Conventional multimedia accommodation services are not capable of satisfying these requirements, such that requesting companies are obliged to install their own server with the associated investments (private telephone exchange, telephone lines, etc.).","In order to overcome the disadvantages of this type of server, the invention proposes a multimedia data transmission system, the purpose of which is to provide a dynamic multimedia service for companies who would like it, without obliging the company to purchase any hardware and while making a server accessible to the company using several technologies (particularly from the telephone network and from the Internet network), with fully transparent service logic.","The system according to the invention relates to a multimedia data transmission system characterized in that it comprises a WAN, in which the confidentiality and security are not controlled from end to end, onto which a shared voice and\/or video resources host server designed to provide a dynamic service to at least one user, and at least one customer server located at each service supplier are connected.","Advantageously, the host server connected to the network through an interface is composed of five subsystems:\n\n","Thus, a new generation \u201caccommodation\u201d service can be provided in which all expensive resources (voice synthesis cards, etc.) are shared, while the customer maintains control over the application and can interface it with whatever resources he wishes.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0006","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0006-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0007","list-style":"none"},"li":"The invention relates to a multimedia data transmission system that comprises a WAN, which may or may not be public, on which the confidentiality and security are not controlled from end to end, and onto which a shared voice and\/or video resources host server is connected and provides a dynamic service to at least one customer, and onto which at least one customer server located at each customer is also connected."}}}},"The invention consists of placing a voice resource in the WAN (capable of reproducing audio files, recording them, performing synthesis or voice recognition, detecting DTMF (Dual Tone MultiFrequency) tones from two sounds, equipped with a protected protocol that can remote control it from a wide area network (such as the Internet network).","The application that controls this voice resource may be located anywhere on the network. Thus, the server is a distributed platform in which expensive resources are located in the network, and in which the service (software only) is located at the customer.","Therefore, the invention can be used to share the voice resource host server located in the network of an operator between several customers that execute the service logic in their premises. The companies simply need to have a connection with the data network. The host server is accessible either from multimedia stations connected to the data network, or from any telephone through a gateway.\n\n","The voice resource can be made above the H.323 protocol so that users can be connected through the switched telephone network (through an STN\/IP gateway), or through the Internet network, indifferently.","In one advantageous embodiment, the host server is connected to the WAN through an Ethernet or other interface, and is composed of five subsystems:\n\n","The action of these subsystems is coordinated by a fifth subsystem which is essentially a command interpreter capable of:\n\n","Calls from the switched telephone network are translated by an STN network\/H.232 gateway for processing by the host server. The gateway function may possibly be integrated in the host server.","Other subsystems (voice recognition, fax generation\/reception, etc.) may be added to increase the functional richness of the complete assembly.","In one advantageous embodiment, the customer server is simple software (for example \u201cWindow NT\u201d service) that receives events signaled by the host server and sends commands in reaction to these events. This software may run on a computer provided with two network interfaces, one connected to the Internet network to communicate with the host server, and the other connected to a company private network to dialog with databases and other industrial processes within the company.","The host computer is configured so as to not transmit IP packets from the Internet network to the internal network.","The customer can configure the service logic itself using a script language (for example Java Script, VisualBasic), or a graphic interface.","The dialog protocol may be any secure dialog protocol with short waiting times. In one embodiment, a protocol is used on a standard UDP in which each information block sent is in the following form:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0071"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":"<block><random><64 random bits><\/random><cipherblock>"}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"right"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"encrypted data<\/cipherblock> <\/block>"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0072"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"175pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"<clearinfo>"]},{"entry":[{},"<serial>serial number<\/serial>"]},{"entry":[{},"<other information> . . . <other information>"]},{"entry":[{},"<\/clearinfo>"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"Information encrypted in the \u201ccipherblock\u201d block is obtained by encrypting the \u201cclearinfo\u201d structure using the DES (Data Encryption Standard) standard in CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) mode, using the 64 random bits for the initial exclusive OR.

Company A's customer server  then begins to play the \u201cDoyouwanttoorder\u201d file which contains a recording of this phrase.","Company A's customer server  decides to use the voice command, to order the host server  to start recognition on the \u201cyes, no\u201d vocabulary. As soon as the user says \u201cyes\u201d, the customer server  is informed by a \u201cWordrecognition\u201d message.","Customer server  then asks how many parts the customer wants to order and records this number by voice recognition. It then stops the voice recognition procedure by a \u201cStoprecognition\u201d command.","Finally, the customer server  repeats the amount of the order to the customer asking the host server  to synthesize the \u201cYou have ordered three parts\u201d character string. The user then hangs up.\n\n","Voice recognition procedures usually comprise two parts as illustrated in :\n\n","The scheme illustrated in  shows how the different modules of a voice recognition procedure communicate with each other.","There are two ways of creating a voice recognition procedure in the IP interactive server:\n\n","For example, if the user is an IP telephony software, the significant components extraction module may appear like a new speech encoder. The host server then negotiates with the user for use of this encoder during the connection.","Another possible embodiment is to put a software component in a specialized displayed HTML page (ActiveX or Java) that interfaces with voice resources on the user station and only sends significant components of the voice data stream to the host server. Thus, a specialized page can be created which reacts to voice, as in the example in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0096"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},"In this example embodiment, the user is a software object (\u201cActiveX or Java\u201d) integrated in a specialized page. This object sends significant voice data stream components input on the user station computer to the host server. It can do this using the RTP protocol on the IP network, or simply the TCP protocol if the reaction time is not a major constraint.","The host server recognize words in this data stream and informs the customer server of recognized words.\n\n","The following protocol is used:\n\n","We will now describe several other example embodiments.","Call from the Telephone Network","A person who would like to book a journey calls 0836011234. This number actually connects to an STN\/H.323 network gateway that converts the call into IP data and sends it to the host voice resources server.\n\n","Therefore, it sends a new call message to the travel agent's customer server. This customer server asks it to play a musical background quickly presenting the company and asking the caller to press \u201c1\u201d to book a voyage, or \u201c2\u201d to leave a message.\n\n","Call from the Internet Network","An H.323 terminal clicks on a link starting from a travel agent's Internet site, provoking a call from the H.323 terminal to the H.323 host server. The host server analyzes the called number and sends an indication for the new call to the travel agent's customer server.","The travel agent's call control server does not need to be modified, and can execute the same scenario as in the previous case.","But it can also choose to offer more services, since a protocol element informs it at the time of the indication of the new call that the call is incoming from the Internet network, it can suggest that a specific page should be viewed, or even give the order to the host server to play a video sequence describing a particular voyage.","The call is free for the Internet network user.","Call from Another Country","If the operator has installed another host voice resources server in another country, the travel agent may be accessible from this country. The operator simply reserves a number that is forwarded to the local host voice resources server, the host server continues to contact the company's customer server. The source of the call is indicated when a new call indication is received so that the customer server can dynamically adapt to the most suitable language when it is helpful to do so.","This solution is much less expensive than a conventional solution, since no international voice communication is necessary."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 4"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
