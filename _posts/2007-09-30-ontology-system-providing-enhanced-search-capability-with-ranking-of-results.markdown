Technical Field","The present disclosure relates to ontology management systems and more specifically to an ontology system providing enhanced search capability.","2. Related Art","Information refers to knowledge presented in the form of data, text, images, sounds, codes, and computer programs individually or in combination. One challenge in the management of information is the organization of the information to enable inference of conclusions (or in general reason about the information) based on the knowledge represented in the organized form. Different approaches can be used for organizing information and for inferring conclusions.","In one approach, information is organized in the form of a database, wherein the information is provided in the form of tables, columns, constraints (specifying primary\/foreign keys, restriction on each type of data, etc.), etc. The manner in which the information is modeled in the database is referred to as a schema. Thus, a schema provides a conceptual and\/or physical view of the information in the database, enabling inference of conclusions from the information.","In another approach, information is organized in the form of an ontology system. An ontology system organizes information in the form of objects, concepts (or classes) and relations existing among the objects\/concepts (portions of which are referred to as a ontology). In general, an ontology may be viewed as a graph containing nodes (representing concepts\/objects, etc.) and edges representing links\/relations between the nodes. For further details of ontology systems, the reader is referred to the book entitled \u201cOntological Engineering: with examples from the areas of Knowledge Management, e-Commerce and the Semantic Web\u201d by Asuncion Gomez-Perez et al with ISBN number 1-8523-3551-3.","An ontology system generally provides such conceptualization of information while hiding the details of implementation (which can be based on flat files such as XML or based on data stored in databases). As such, for inference of conclusions (or reasoning) about information, an ontology system is often considered to be more desirable compared to a database.","It is often required that a user be provided a facility to search for information of interest in ontology systems. In one prior approach, the search was conducted based on keywords (or text) provided by a user. Such a search capability may not be adequate in several scenarios.","In the drawings, like reference numbers generally indicate identical, functionally similar, and\/or structurally similar elements. The drawing in which an element first appears is indicated by the leftmost digit(s) in the corresponding reference number.","An aspect of the present invention enables an ontology system to provide enhanced search capability. In an embodiment, the ontology system receives a search request specifying nodes and edges (existing between nodes) of interest and determines a set of matching ontologies stored in a knowledge store. Data indicating the matching ontologies is sent as a response to the search request.","Another aspect of the present invention generates a ranking for each of the matching ontologies. The ranking is generated based on the extent of matching of the nodes and edges of interest specified in the search request. Data indicating rank of the matching ontologies is also included in the response to the search request.","Thus, by accepting edges of interest in a search request and generating a ranking based on the extent of matching of the edges of interest, an ontology system provides enhanced search capability, enabling a user to find desired ontologies more accurately.","Several aspects of the invention are described below with reference to examples for illustration. It should be understood that numerous specific details, relationships, and methods are set forth to provide a full understanding of the invention. One skilled in the relevant art, however, will readily recognize that the invention can be practiced without one or more of the specific details, or with other methods, etc. In other instances, well-known structures or operations are not shown in detail to avoid obscuring the features of the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["110","110","120","150","180"]},"Merely for illustration, only representative number\/type of systems is shown in the Figure. Many environments often contain many more systems, both in number and type, depending on the purpose for which the environment is designed. Each system\/device of  is described below in further detail.","Network  provides connectivity between various client systems A-C and ontology server . Network  may be implemented using protocols such as Internet Protocol (IP) well known in the relevant arts.","Each of client systems A-C represents a system such as a personal computer, workstation, mobile station, etc., and is used by a user to generate requests to ontology server . The requests may be generated according to a suitable interface.","Knowledge store  facilitates storage and retrieval of information and may be implemented as a file server or as database server. In one embodiment, knowledge store  represents a file server storing each of the ontologies in a corresponding separate file encoded as XML data. However, alternative approaches (such as using database technologies, permitting structured queries) can also be used in implementing knowledge store .","Ontology server  represents a server system, such as an ontology management server, which is capable of performing searches requested by client systems A-C. The results of the search are sent as corresponding responses to the requesting client systems. The ontology server and knowledge store together constitute an ontology system. The manner in which ontology server  performs searches requested by client systems is described below with examples.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},"In addition, some of the steps may be performed in a different sequence than that depicted below, as suited in the specific environment, as will be apparent to one skilled in the relevant arts. Many of such implementations are contemplated to be covered by several aspects of the present invention. The flow chart begins in step , in which control immediately passes to step .","In step , ontology server  maintains information in the form of ontologies, with each of the ontologies containing nodes and edges linking the nodes. The information may be maintained in knowledge store . The nodes may represent concepts\/classes, objects\/instances, attributes\/properties and\/or events (and\/or the like) based on the manner in which the information is organized. Edges may represent links\/relations that exist between the nodes.","In step , ontology server  receives a search request specifying a set of (one or more) nodes and a set of edges of interest. The search request may be received from one of client systems A-C. It may be appreciated that the nodes in the search request may represent concepts, instances, properties and\/or events (and\/or the like) contained in the maintained information. The edges on the other hand define links\/relations existing between the nodes.","In step , ontology server  determines ontologies matching the search request. The determination may be performed based on both the nodes and edges of interest specified in the search request. Thus, an ontology (in knowledge store ) containing the nodes and edges of interest (either completely or partially) may be determined to be a matching ontology.","In step , ontology server  generates a ranking for each of the matching ontologies. The ranking of each of the matching ontologies may be generated based on the extent to which the matching ontology matches the nodes and edges of interest specified in the search request. The ranking may be specified as an absolute value indicating the extent of match or may be a relative value indicating the extent of matching in comparison to the other ontologies.","In step , ontology server  sends data indicating the matching ontologies and corresponding ranking as a search result. The search result may be sent to the requesting client system. The flow chart ends in step .","It may be appreciated that ontology server  provides an enhanced search capability by enabling a user to search for ontologies using concepts, relations, instances, properties and\/or events existing in the information. The manner in which an ontology system enables a user to perform a search is illustrated below with examples.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIGS. 3A","b":["3","4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 3A","b":["310","320","330","315","325"]},"Node  represents a concept \u201cBLevel\u201d of interest that is to be searched in a knowledge store. The label \u201cBLevel\u201d indicates a name that uniquely identifies each node (representing a concept\/instance\/property) in the knowledge store. Similarly, node  (labeled \u201cDevMgr\u201d) represents another concept of interest. Node  (labeled \u201cMonty\u201d) represents an instance (and thereby shown in a dotted line in the Figure) of interest.","Edge  between nodes  and  represents a link that exists between the concepts \u201cBLevel\u201d and \u201cDevMgr\u201d. Edge  between nodes  and  represents another link that exists between concepts \u201cDevMgr\u201d and \u201cMonty\u201d. Edge  is shown in a dotted line indicating that a relation \u201cinstance\u201d exists between the concepts, that is, \u201cMonty\u201d is an instance of \u201cDevMgr\u201d.","Thus, the above search request specifies that the search be performed for a concept \u201cBLevel\u201d which is related to another concept \u201cDevMgr\u201d having an instance \u201cMonty\u201d. It may be observed that the search request may also be viewed as an ontology (or as an ontology fragment).","On receiving such a search request, ontology server  determines ontologies matching the search request and generates a ranking for each of the matching ontologies. Data indicating the matching ontologies and corresponding rankings are then sent as the search result to the user.","In one embodiment, the search result contains the identifier of each of the matching ontologies, a numerical value indicating a corresponding rank and another numerical value indicating the extent of match with the search request. The manner in which the search results are sent to a user is described with examples below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 3B","FIG. 3A"]},"Table  depicts a portion of a search result sent in response to a search request received from a user. The search result contains data indicating the ontologies matching the search request and also indicating a ranking of each of the matching ontologies. Though the search result is depicted as being presented in a tabular format, it may be appreciated that in alternative embodiments, the search result may be provided in any convenient\/desired format.","Column  (labeled \u201cRank\u201d) indicates a ranking of each of the matching ontologies. Column  contains a numerical value (1, 2, 3 etc.) with a lower value indicating a higher rank. Thus, a matching ontology with rank \u201c1\u201d is determined to have a better match than another matching ontology with rank \u201c2\u201d.","Column  (labeled \u201cSearch Result\u201d) specifies an identifier identifying each of the matching ontologies. Column  (labeled \u201cMatch\u201d) specifies a numerical value (hereafter referred to as match score) indicating the extent of matching of each of the ontologies with the search request. A higher numerical value in column  indicates a better match with the search request (as such, will have a higher rank).","Each of rows - specifies an ontology determined to be matching the search request. In particular, row  specifies an ontology identified by the identifier \u201contology13\u201d (as specified in row ) having a rank of \u201c1\u201d (as specified in row ) and having a match score of \u201c4.0\u201d (as specified in row ). Similarly row  specifies an ontology identified by the identifier \u201contology03\u201d having a rank of \u201c2\u201d and a match score of \u201c3.5\u201d. It may be observed that \u201contology13\u201d is ranked higher than \u201contology03\u201d since the corresponding match score \u201c4.0\u201d is greater than the match score \u201c3.5\u201d corresponding to \u201contology03\u201d.","It may be appreciated that multiple ontologies may have the same match score and may therefore be given the same rank. The other rankings may then be appropriately changed according a pre-defined convention (for example, by starting the next ranking with a numerical value more than the number of ontologies tied for a current rank). It may further be appreciated that in a scenario when no matching ontologies are determined, the data in the search result may be modified to indicate the failure of the search.","Thus, a user may send a search request (as depicted in ) specifying nodes and edges of interest to ontology server  and receive in response a search result (as depicted in ). The description is continued describing the manner in which ontology server  determines ontologies matching a search request in an embodiment.","Ontology server , on receiving a search request, inspects the ontologies stored in knowledge store  to determine the ontologies that match the search request. In an embodiment, an ontology is considered to be matching the search request, only if the ontology contains at least one node (representing a concept, instance, or property) specified in the search request. In the scenario that an ontology does not match any of the nodes specified in the search request, the ontology is considered to be not matching the search request.","In one embodiment, each node is associated with a corresponding name\/URI (uniform resource identifier) and matching is performed based on the name\/URI of the nodes in an ontology and the search request. As such, a node in the ontology is determined to be matching a node in the search request if the name\/URI and the type (concept\/instance\/property) of the nodes in the ontology and the search request are the same.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3A"]},"Each of ontologies  (labeled \u201contology03\u201d),  (labeled \u201contology06\u201d),  (labeled \u201contology13\u201d) and  (labeled \u201contology16\u201d) represents an ontology matching the nodes and edges of interest specified in the search request depicted in . The labels associated with the ontologies may be used to identify each of the ontologies stored in knowledge store .","It may be observed that in ontology , node  matches node  of the search request depicted in  since both the nodes have the same name (\u201cBLevel\u201d) and are of the same type (\u201cconcept\u201d). As such ontology  is included in the set of ontologies matching the search request.","Similarly ontologies ,  and  are also included in the set of matching ontologies since node  in ontology , node  in ontology  and node  in ontology  matches node  in the search request. It may be observed that ontology  also contains node  and edge  matching node  and edge  specified in the search request.","It may be appreciated that labels of the ontologies matching the search request may be used as identifiers in the search result (as depicted in ) sent as a response to a search request (as depicted in ). As such, the ontologies , ,  and  correspond to the ontologies specified in respective rows , ,  and  (in ).","Ontology server  after determining the set of matching ontologies generates a ranking for each of the matching ontologies. The manner in which ontology server  generates a ranking for ontologies matching a search request is described in detail below.","In one embodiment, the ranking of the matching ontologies is generated based on the match score calculated for each of the matching ontologies. To facilitate calculation of the match scores, ontology server  first determines a numerical value (indicating the importance) for each node specified in the search request.","The importance of a node (IMP) in the search request is calculated using the formula given below:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mi":"IMP","mo":"=","mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":["+","+","+"],"mrow":[{"munder":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":["i","\u025bD"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}}},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msub":{"mi":["IMP","i"]}},{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"mi":"I"},{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"mi":"P"}]}}}}},"Wherein,","\u03a3 is the summation operator,","| | is the cardinality operator (returns the number of elements in a set),","D is the set of direct subclasses\/sub-concepts related to the node,","IMPis the importance of a subclass directly related to the node,","I is the set of instances\/objects directly associated with the node, and","P is the set of properties\/attributes directly associated with the node.","Thus, the weight of a node is related to the various concepts, instances and properties associated with the node and also the importance of the concepts related to the node.","Referring to the search request depicted in , node  is associated with a importance of 1 since node  is an instance and does not have subclasses or instances or properties associated to it, that is, the sets D, I and P are empty. As such the cardinality of each of the sets is 0, and the importance of subclasses is also 0. Substituting in the above equation (1+0+0+0), the importance of node  is determined to be 1.","Node  is associated with a weight of 2 since node  has one instance (node ) associated with it, that is, I={330}. As such the cardinality of set I is 1, while for the other sets, the cardinality is 0 (since they are empty). Substituting in the above equation (1+0+1+0), the importance of node  is determined to be 2.","For node , the set D contains node  since node  is a subclass of node . The sets P and I are empty, as node  does not have any instances or properties associated with it. Further, the subclass node  is associated with a importance of 2. Substituting in the above equation (1+2+0+0), the importance of node  is determined to be 3.","From the above, it may be readily observed that the input ontology of  is received as a set of nodes in a hierarchy, with node Blevel  being at the highest level and instance Monty  being at the lowest level. The nodes at the higher level are assigned higher importance, compared to nodes at the lower level. As described below, ontologies of  matching nodes of higher importance are computed to have a higher match score and thus ranked higher (e.g., 1).","After determining the importance of each node in the search request, ontology server  generates for each of the matching ontologies a match score indicating the structural similarity of the matching ontology to the search request based on the importance. The manner in which match scores of ontologies matching a search request are calculated is described in detail below.","In one embodiment, the calculation of a match score is divided into calculation of two scores\u2014a node score and an edge score.
