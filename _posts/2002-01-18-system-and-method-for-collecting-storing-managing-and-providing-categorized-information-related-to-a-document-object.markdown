title: System and method for collecting, storing, managing and providing categorized information related to a document object
abstract: A method and system for enabling users of a network to create, store, and provide access to relationships between document objects stored on the network. The method may include the steps for allowing a user of the network to create a link relationship between a first document object and a second document object; for storing the link relationship in one or more link directories; and for providing all users of the network access to the link relationships stored in the one or more link directories based upon the document object currently accessed by the users. The system may include one or more client devices that access document objects stored on the network and create link relationships between the first document object and the second document object; and one or more servers that store and filter the link relationships created by the client devices and transmit one or more link relationships and link references to the client devices.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of, and incorporates by reference, U.S. Provisional Application Nos. 60\/273,520 and 60\/282,470, filed Mar. 7, 2001 and Apr. 10, 2001 respectively.","The technical field is relating documents on computer networks and storing, indexing and presenting those relationships to network users.","Networks connecting many computers offer users access to a wide variety of information. Computers are exceptional devices for storing, sorting and relating large amounts of information. Information is stored on computers and networked computing and storage devices as documents or objects, together referred to as document objects. Such document objects may contain any form of information, from text documents and articles, financial data, statistical information, electronic mail, images and photos, music, animation, and even motion pictures.","The Internet, as a network of interconnected networks, offers users access to an even broader collection of information\u2014the Worldwide Web (the \u201cWeb\u201d). On the Web, publishers offer information for educational, recreational, and commercial purposes. The Internet, and it's predominant Web form, is organized and accessed by assigning document objects an address, or Uniform Resource Locater (\u201cURL\u201d). These URLs define the transfer protocol for and location of each individual document object on the Internet, or other network, including the Internetworking Protocol (\u201cIP\u201d) address of the host computer system of the document object.","Users accessing computer networks and the Internet are generally required to perform their own searches across the networks for the information, stored as document objects, that they desire or need. As the amount of information available on computer networks, and on the Internet in particular, grows exponentially, existing search and information location techniques become increasingly less effective. Existing Internet search techniques often yield too many seemingly related references which are not, in fact, truly useful to the user. The usefulness of traditional Internet search and indexing systems is actually decreasing as the number of documents on the Internet explodes.","Existing search, categorization, and retrieval techniques for document objects stored on computer networks, while generally executed at the high speeds of modern computer systems, are increasingly imprecise and often much too broad, as well as time and labor intensive, owing to the explosion of information being added to those networks.","A need exists to enhance the network user's information browsing experience. A need exists to provide network users with information relevant to the individual document object they are accessing and provide that information in a context of value to them by relating the document object they are accessing to link references to other document objects within a specific context. Such other document objects may or may not be offered by the publisher of the document object currently accessed. A need exists to provide network users with information relevant to the specific information the user may be searching for and relevant to the user's immediate personal, professional, geographic and other interests.","A need exists for entities or groups to be able to communicate information to their employees or members as those employees or members access document objects on a network, and to enable those employees or members to view content deemed important to the entities or groups. A need further exists for publishers of content on the Internet to be able to personalize content presented to Internet users without requiring the establishment of a personal relationship between the user and the content publisher. A need exists to enable the collection of the search experiences of a group of users and share that experience with other users of networked information devices.","The systems, apparatus and methods of the present invention (hereinafter \u201cLinkspace\u201d) incorporate and provide many improvements on existing methods for publishing, distributing, relating and searching document objects on computer networks, including the Internet.","Linkspace operates to provide many beneficial improvements in searching, identifying and publishing information over computer networks.","Linkspace permits a user of a computer network or the Internet to establish relationships between document objects located on the network or the Internet. Those relationships may comprise link relationships and link references and are maintained by Linkspace in one or more link directories. The contents of link directories may be organized, categorized, sorted and filtered in groupings based on various criteria relating to, among other things, user interests and attributes, the types of document objects and the nature of the content of those document objects. Linkspace allows a network user to be presented with a selection of links to document objects related to the document object the user is currently accessing based upon the URL of the current document object, and link relationships created by the user and other users of the network stored in the link directories.","When a network user equipped with Linkspace identifies and locates a first document object on the network that is of interest to her, she may initiate one method of the present invention to mark the location, through its URL, as a start point of a link relationship. When she accesses a second document object on the network that she considers relevant to the first document object, she initiates another step of one method of the invention to mark the second document object as an end point of the link relationship. Upon marking the second document object as the end point, the link relationship is created and stored on a link directory selected to store similar link relationships. When a second network user equipped with Linkspace, and with access to the link directory, accesses the first document object, he is then presented with a link to the second document object as a relevant document object that may be of interest to him. Likewise, if the second network user accesses the second document object, he may then be presented with a link to the first document object as a relevant document object that may be of interest to him.","Linkspace consists primarily of a system and method for creating and publishing link relationships, a system and method for storing and managing link relationships in link directories, and a system and method for presenting a network user with links related by link relationships to the document object the user is currently accessing.","In one respect what is described is a method for enabling users of a network to create, store, and provide access to relationships between document objects stored on the network. The method may include the steps for allowing a user of the network to create a link relationship between a first document object and a second document object; for storing the link relationship in one or more link directories; and for providing all users of the network access to the link relationships stored in the one or more link directories based upon the document object currently accessed by the users.","In another respect what is described is a system for establishing and providing access to relationships between document objects stored on a network wherein the relationship between a first document object and a second document object may be created by an individual user of the network and provided to other users of the network. The system may include one or more client devices that access document objects stored on the network and create link relationships between a first document object and a second document object; and one or more servers that store and filter the link relationships created by the client devices and transmit one or more link relationships and link references to the client devices.","In yet another respect, what is described is a computer readable medium on which is embedded a program. The embedded program comprises modules that execute the above method.","Those skilled in the art will appreciate these and other advantages and benefits of various embodiments of the invention upon reading the following detailed description of a preferred embodiment with reference to the below-listed drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","10","20","30","40","50","42","52","40","50","45","100","41","51","40","50","20","30","20","42","52","45","30","42","52","45","20","30","35","45","42","52","20","40","50"]},"The link reference ,  comprises a pointer to one document object ,  on the network  and attributes associated with that document object , . The link relationship  comprises two pointers, one each to the first document object  and to the second document object , and attributes describing characteristics of the relationship between the two document objects ,  related by the link relationship . The pointers included in a link relationship  may be comprised of pointers to a link reference , . The link relationship  establishes a meaningful relationship between two document objects , , whereas the locations of the document objects ,  may be maintained within the Linkspace system  by means of the link references , .","The system  shown in  operates to create and store link relationships . The system  creates and stores link relationships  between a first document object  and a second document object , preferably on one or more servers  in one or more link directories  in the manner described as follows. The client device  is enabled by means of software or other devices to request, access and display document objects on the network . When the user of a client device  identifies one first document object  of interest to her that she wishes to associate with a second document object , she utilizes the software running on the Linkspace-enabled client device  to create a link relationship  between the first document object  and the second document object . This link relationship  is then stored on the server  in a link directory .","In an alternate embodiment, the system  may operate to perform the functions described above, including the creation of link relationships  and link references , , the storing of link relationships  and link references , , and providing access to and retrieval of link relationships  and link references , , by means of automated procedures requiring little or no user interaction.","When a client device  later requests and accesses a first document object  for which the server  has stored an associated link relationship  in one or more link directories , the server  delivers to the client device  the link references  and the link relationships , along with contextual information, or attributes, associated with the link references  and the link relationships . The client device  then displays to the user of the client device  the existence of a link relationship  between the first document object  being accessed by the client device  and the second document object . This enables the user of the client device  to be made aware of the second document object , the context of the second document object , and the context of the relationship between the second document object  and the first document object  as that relationship may be of interest to the user of the client device  while viewing the first document object .","Each link relationship  may also operate in the reverse direction. In this manner, when a user of the client device  is accessing the second document object  for which an associated link relationship  is stored in the one or more link directories  on the server , the server  then transmits the link references  and the link relationships , with contextual information, to the client device . This enables display of the availability of the related first document object  to the user of the client device  with the context of the first document object , and within the context of its relationship to the displayed second document object .","While the system  is generally described as having enabling software resident on the client device  and on the server , various other software configurations are possible, including having all of the software resident at either the server  (making the client device  essentially a \u201cdumb terminal\u201d) or at the client device  (making the client device  essentially perform server functions), or various software sharing arrangements. For example, the client device  may include the one or more link directories , a communications module (described later in reference to ), and a user data store that may maintain information regarding authorized users of the client device  (described later in reference to , , and ).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["20","20","210","10","20","220","20","45","240","20","10","20","45"]},"The rendering tool  may store a document object URL address  for referring to the document object currently being accessed and rendered by the rendering tool . The rendering tool  may also include a Graphic User Interface (\u201cGUI\u201d) display , or other type of display, for displaying the document objects accessed and rendered by the rendering tool . In alternate embodiments of the invention, the client device  may include more than one rendering tool  enabling the user of the client device  to access multiple document objects.","The client tool  may include a client GUI display , or other display software and hardware, for displaying link references ,  and link relationships  to the user of the client device . Typically, the displayed link references ,  and link relationships  would be those link references ,  and link relationships  relevant to the document object currently being rendered and displayed by the rendering tool  (as determined by the document object URL address  in the rendering tool ). The client tool  may also include Linkspace user profile data  for storing information about the user of the client device , the link directories  the user may have access to, and the attributes of link references , , and attributes of link relationships  that the user may be interested in. The Linkspace user profile data  may also or alternatively be stored on the one or more servers , along with the Linkspace user profile data  of all other users of the system .","An example of how the client device  operates to create and present link relationships  to users of the client device  follows. While the network access tool  is active and placing the client device  in communication with the network , the user enables the rendering tool  and the client tool . The user may then request and access document objects stored on the network  by means of the rendering tool . Through the GUI display , the users enters or otherwise selects a document object URL address  associated with the first document object  of interest to the user. The client tool  connects to and uses the rendering tool  and accesses the document object URL address  associated with the first document object . The client tool  then establishes contact with the server  and passes to the server  the stored document object URL address  associated with the first document object , along with any relevant information that may come from the Linkspace user profile data . The connection to the server  may be initiated through the network access tool  or by other means not utilizing the network access tool .","The Linkspace-enabled server  searches the link directories  for any URLs in the link references ,  matching, or similar to, the document object URL address . After searching, the server  retrieves the one or more link relationships  that include the document object URL address . Prior to searching, the URLs may be stripped of any information not relevant to the location of the document object ,  on the network . Such information not relevant to the location of the document object ,  may include query strings or other data attached to URLs for tracking or other purposes.","The server  then determines the link references ,  which may be of interest to the user of the client device  by filtering the retrieved link references ,  using the Linkspace user profile data  and the attributes assigned to the link references ,  and to the link relationships . The filtering of link references ,  and link relationships  may be accomplished by one of several methods of filtering data including matching, character and Boolean comparing, and other data comparison and filtering methods. The server  then transmits to the client tool  the filtered link references ,  included in the one or more link relationships . The client tool  presents the transmitted link references ,  within the context established by the link relationships  by means of the client GUI display .","To create a new link relationship , the user of the client device  must select a first document object  to begin the link relationship, a second document object  to complete the link relationship , and assign attributes to the link references ,  and the link relationship  between the two document objects , . To select a first document object  to begin the new link relationship , the user interacts with the client GUI display  to activate a function of the client tool  to capture the document object URL address  associated with the first document object . To select a second document object  to complete the new link relationship , the user may interact with the GUI display  of the rendering tool  to request, access and display the second document object . The user may then interact with the client GUI display  again to activate a further function of the client tool  to capture the document object URL address  associated with the second document object , completing the selection of document objects ,  participating in the new link relationship . Once the two document objects ,  are established, attributes of the link references ,  and the new link relationship  may be assigned.","The user may select or otherwise specify attributes associated with the link references ,  and link relationship . These attributes aid in categorizing, sorting or filtering the link references ,  and the link relationship  in the link directories  for delivery to other client devices . The attributes may be, for example, descriptive, temporal, spatial, or quantitative in nature, i.e., describe the link reference in terms of who or what, when, where, or how much. One such attribute (not shown) may be a plain language name for the link reference , , determined and entered by the user to describe the link reference in terms more useful to users of the system  than the document object URL address . Other examples of attributes may include description of the content of either of the document objects ,  related by the link relationship , wherein that content may be described to include a product review, news article, product information page, competitor's product information, or product order forms, among other types of content.","Normally, upon completion of the endpoint capturing and attribute assignment functions, the client tool  connects to the server  to store the link references and the new link relationship  in the appropriate link directory . Generally, the new link relationship  is then made available to other users. Typically, other client devices  who have access to the server  and are assigned access privileges on the link directory  in which the new link relationship  has been stored are given access to the new link relationship .","Furthermore, if the user of the client device  determines that there is a relationship that is not already described by the transmitted link relationships  between the currently accessed document object  and a second document object , the user may proceed to create and publish a new link relationship  between the first document object  (currently accessed and displayed by the rendering tool ) and the second document object . This may be accomplished without displaying the second document object .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 3","i":"a ","b":["30","30","35","370","380","30","310","320","380","30","380","20","380","35","310","320","20","20","380","35","310","320","100","35","310","320","230","20","370","30","35","310","320","35","310","320","370","35","310","320"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 3","i":"a ","b":["350","10","350","10","20","30","360","350","350","380","370","310","320","350","20","100"]},"Each of the several link directories , ,  or  may be associated with and store link references ,  and link relationships .
