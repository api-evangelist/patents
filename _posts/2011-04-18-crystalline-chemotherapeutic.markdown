No. 7,297,709.","The following examples are presented to provide what is believed to be the most useful and readily understood description of procedures and conceptual aspects of this invention.","A mixture of ABT-869 hydrochloride in ethyl acetate and ethanol, in which the ABT-869 hydrochloride was completely soluble, was mixed with dibasic sodium phosphate. The organic layer was separated, treated with decolorizing carbon, and filtered. A small quantity of L-ascorbic acid was added, and the solution was concentrated. The ethyl acetate was removed by azeotropic distillation with ethanol. Additional ethanol may be added and the solution heated to dissolve any solid that forms. The solution was cooled to 25\u00b0 C. and diluted with water, causing ABT-869\u00b7\u00bc Ethanolate Crystalline Form 1 to crystallize. The product was isolated, washed with water, and dried under reduced pressure, while monitoring residual ethyl acetate and ethanol (by gas chromatography (GC)) and water (by Karl Fischer (KF)). A yield of 92% is typical.","Following the neutralization with dibasic sodium phosphate, decolorizing carbon treatment and the removal of ethyl acetate as described in EXAMPLE 1, the mixture of ABT-869 in ethanol was gradually mixed with water at 25\u00b0 C., with vigorous agitation. ABT-869.HO Crystalline Form 1 was isolated, washed with water, and dried under reduced pressure while monitoring residual ethyl acetate and ethanol (by GC) and water (by KF). The dried material may be delumped\/milled to control particle size. A yield of 76% is typical.","This process was modified from the current process by adding a cosolvent to reduce the volume of the crystallization process.","Currently, the process uses a solution of ABT-869 dissolved in ethanol. This solution is slowly added to water. The current process requires a final volume of \u02dc220 ml solvent\/g ABT-869.","By adding acetic acid to the ethanol\/ABT-869 solution, a more concentrated solution of ABT-869 can be made, reducing the final solvent volume to \u02dc60-80 ml solvent\/g ABT-869. Because of equipment constraints, the more concentrated solution of ABT-869 allows for better mixing as well which helps to ensure the desired crystal formation.","100 g of ABT-869 was dissolved in a mixture of 590 g ethanol (200 proof) and 771 g of glacial acetic acid. 575 mg of ascorbic acid was added to avoid degradation of the product. The solution was stirred until all the solids dissolve. (If necessary, slight heating (not more than 30\u00b0 C. for 30 min) can be used to assist dissolution.) The solution was cooled to 25\u00b0 C.","4430 g of water was added to a glass lined jacketed reactor fitted with a retreat curve impeller. (Additional baffling can be used to help mixing efficiency.) The reactor was fitted with an addition tube with an outlet located above the surface of the liquid. The addition tube was situated so liquid will freely fall to the surface of the water (and not drip down the sides of the reactor or the shaft of the impeller). The tip of the addition tube should not be subsurface at any point during the addition. Reactor temperature was maintained at 25\u00b0 C.+\/\u22125\u00b0 C.","A diaphragm pump or syringe pump was used to slowly add the solution of ABT-869 to the reactor. The solution was added through an inline filter to prevent addition of undissolved solids. The addition was completed at a constant addition rate over the course of not less than two hours. (It is critical that the agitation in the reactor be high (>500 rpm in a 250 ml to be safe) reactor. If the agitation is too low or the rate of addition is too high it is possible to nucleate a different crystal form.)","White solid appeared as soon as the ABT-869 solution contacts the water. Through the course of addition, the slurry thickens During the addition, samples can be taken to check the crystal form by x-ray.","To ensure desupersaturation, the mixture was stirred for not less than 1 hr. Samples can be taken to ensure the concentration in the liquors is correct.","The mixture was filtered through a pot filter fitted with a <10 \u03bcm pore size filter cloth (or filter paper). Some breakthrough of the solid occurred initially. After approximately one third of the sample is filtered, the liquors were recirculated to recover any solid that passed through the filter.","After filtration, the wetcake was washed with water (three times w\/75 ml).","Typical yield at the lab scale in this process is >94%.","The solid was dried at 50\u00b0 C. for NLT 12 hrs.","Final water content was <5.0 wt %. Final acetic acid content was <0.05 wt %. Crystal form was confirmed by x-ray and DSC.","Different solvents (or solvent mixtures) can be used to make the ABT-896 solution, including ethanol, N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), dimethylformamide (DMF), ethanol\/NMP, ethanol\/acetic acid, ethanol\/ethyl acetate, and ethanol\/DMF, as are commercially available through Sigma Aldrich. Suitable solvents used in the process are any that do not phase separate with water and does not degrade ABT-869. Depending on the solvent used, the amount of water used in the process may have to be adjusted. Currently the process requires that the final solvent composition be >75% water in order to ensure that the correct crystal form be nucleated.","This process started with a solid ABT-869 sample. If ABT-869 is coming from a solution, then a solvent switch into ethanol\/acetic acid is necessary.","Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) analysis of samples was conducted in the following manner. Samples were prepared by spreading the sample powder in a thin layer on an aluminum sample holder and gently flattening the sample with a microscope slide. Diffraction patterns were collected at ambient temperature and environmental conditions using an Inel G3000 diffractometer equipped with an incident beam germanium monochromator to provide Cu\u2014Kradiation. The X-ray generator was operated at a voltage of 40 kV and a current of 30 mA. The Inel G3000 is equipped with a position sensitive detector that monitors all diffraction data simultaneously. The detector was calibrated by collecting the attenuated direct beam for seven seconds in 1 degree intervals across a 90 degree two theta range. The calibration was checked against a silicon line position reference standard (NIST 640c).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0101","num":"0100"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"It is meant to be understood that relative intensities of peak heights and\/or peak positions in a PXRD pattern may vary and will be dependent on variables such as the temperature, size of crystal size or morphology, sample preparation, or sample height in the analysis well of the X-ray diffractometer.","It is also meant to be understood that peak positions may vary when measured with different radiation sources. For example, Cu\u2014K\u03b1, Mo\u2014K\u03b1, Co\u2014K\u03b1 and Fe\u2014K\u03b1 radiation, having wavelengths of 1.54060 \u212b, 0.7107 \u212b, 1.7902 \u212b and 1.9373 \u212b, respectively, may provide peak positions which differ from those measured with Cu\u2014K\u03b1 radiation, which has a wavelength of 1.5478 \u212b.","The term \u201cabout\u201d preceding a series of peak positions means that all of the peaks of the group which it precedes are reported in terms of angular positions (two theta) with an allowable variability of \u00b10.1\u00b0 as specified by the U.S. Pharmacopeia, pages 1843-1884 (1995). The variability of \u00b10.1\u00b0 is intended to be used when comparing two powder X-ray diffraction patterns. In practice, if a diffraction pattern peak from one pattern is assigned a range of angular positions (two theta) which is the measured peak position \u00b10.1\u00b0 and if those ranges of peak positions overlap, then the two peaks are considered to have the same angular position. For example, if a peak from one pattern is determined to have a position of 11.0\u00b0, for comparison purposes the allowable variability allows the peak to be assigned a position in the range of 10.9.\u00b0-11.1\u00b0.","Accordingly, for example, the phrase \u201cabout 6.2\u00b0, 12.0\u00b0, 12.4\u00b0, 12.8\u00b0, 13.4\u00b0, 14.2\u00b0, 15.2\u00b0, 15.6\u00b0, 16.2\u00b0 and 19.7\u00b0,\u201d as used herein, means about 6.2\u00b0, about 12.0\u00b0, about 12.4\u00b0, about 12.8\u00b0, about 13.4\u00b0, about 14.2\u00b0, about 15.2\u00b0, about 15.6\u00b0, about 16.2\u00b0 and about 19.7, which, in turn, means 6.2\u00b0\u00b10.1\u00b0, 12.0\u00b0\u00b10.1\u00b0, 12.4\u00b0\u00b10.1\u00b0, 12.8\u00b0\u00b10.1\u00b0, 13.4\u00b0\u00b10.1\u00b0, 14.2\u00b0\u00b10.1\u00b0, 15.2\u00b0\u00b10.1\u00b0, 15.6\u00b0\u00b10.1\u00b0, 16.2\u00b0\u00b10.1\u00b0 and 19.7\u00b0\u00b10.1\u00b0.","The term \u201cabout\u201d preceding a temperature means the given temperature \u00b12\u00b0 C.
