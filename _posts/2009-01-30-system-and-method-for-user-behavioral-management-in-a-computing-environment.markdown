Zimmerman; which is a continuation of application Ser. No. 09\/605,124, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,795,856, entitled \u201cSystem and Method for Monitoring the Internet Access of a Computer\u201d and filed on Jun. 28, 2000 in the name of Clinton D. Bunch; all of which are hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes.","This invention relates, in general to applications and software programs and, in particular, to a system and method that provide for user behavioral management in a computing environment to enable behavioral modification with respect to computing resource management.","Businesses rely on information technology (IT), including applications, software programs, hardware, and bandwidth, for example, to provide the infrastructure required to support performance and productivity. As IT has become more integrated into business operations and the dependency on IT has increased, productivity tools have been developed and deployed to evaluate and report user interactions with IT. The reporting options furnished by existing productivity tools, however, have failed to fully meet industry needs by providing reports that are \u201cone off\u201d or one step removed from the administrator's needs as a result of not fully being customizable while maintaining a minimum production and build time. Moreover, existing productivity tools make user behavior modification laborious for administrators and managers.","A system and method are disclosed that provide for user behavioral management in a computing environment in order to address the aforementioned limitations of existing productivity tools. In one embodiment, the system includes a computer having computing resources including, for example, a plurality of applications installed thereon. A monitoring module is associated with the computer in order to monitor a plurality of utilization parametrics to determine the utilization of the computing resources by a user and provide to the user a visible indication of the utilization of the computing resources at any desired frequency including in substantially realtime or daily, for example. The data captured relative to the utilization parametrics enables, at the management level, enterprise-wide administration of the computing resources and, at the user level, self-directed behavioral modification with respect to computing resource management.","The systems and methods presented herein not only provide for the enablement of self-directed behavioral modification but employer-directed behavioral modification as well. In one embodiment, all applications and computing resources used by a user may be observed. Management or an administrator may have the client module running invisibly to establish a baseline and provide reporting including enterprise activity reporting, department comparisons (e.g., IT, H\/R, Financing, etc.), website usage, time of day usage, and application usage, for example. Management may assign individuals to different groups within a hierarchy such as enterprise, department, group, individual and individual managers may manage their own team members by assigning minimum and\/or maximum targets for applications and computing resources. The reports generated by the system allow management to address a problem through limits, discussion, or user self-directed behavior management through the indicator tool. Also, management may encourage behavior trough setting targets, discussion, and self-directed behavior management. This visibility has additional benefits including analyzing the manner in which new applications are being deployed and extending across Internet and non-Internet computing resources.","While the making and using of various embodiments of the present invention are discussed in detail below, it should be appreciated that the present invention provides many applicable inventive concepts which can be embodied in a wide variety of specific contexts. The specific embodiments discussed herein are merely illustrative of specific ways to make and use the invention, and do not delimit the scope of the present invention.","Referring initially to , therein is depicted a network-based IT infrastructure  wherein one embodiment of a system for user behavioral management is being implemented. In the illustrated computing environment, computers , , and  are connected to each other via an intranet . Each of the computers , , and  may comprise any combination of hardware, software, and firmware that accepts structured input, processes the input and produces the results of the processing as output. In one embodiment, computers , , and  are personal computers that are designated for a single user or small group of users. In another embodiment, the computers , , and  may comprise personal computers, cellular telephones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), kiosks, televisions, electronic game consoles, MP3 players, or other electronic devices. Particularly, handheld computers, palmtop computers, mobile phones, smartphones and other types of PDAs are contemplated. In other embodiments, computer includes televisions and monitors as well as various text messaging, tweeter interfacing, and IM devices.","Additionally, each of the computers , , and  may include any number of peripheral devices such as monitors or keyboards, for example. A router or other device may provide the routing and switching interface for the intranet . Each of the computers , , and  may be connected to the intranet  by a physical connection, such as a Category 5 (CAT5) cable, or a wireless connection. For example, the wireless connection may be based on an Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802-based standard such as 802.11, 802.11a, 802.11b (Wi-Fi), or 802.1G, for example.","Servers , , and  are also connected to intranet  such that, in one embodiment, computers , , and  and servers , , and  may communicate within a local area network (LAN) provided by the computing environment. The servers , , and  may have a structure and functionality that is similar to the aforementioned computers , , and . In one implementation, the servers , , and  provide services to the computers , , and  via the intranet . The servers , , and  may store and administer software applications, data, security measures, or provide access to peripherals or external systems, for example. As illustrated, the server  includes a module that provides mail service and access to the Internet  for the computers , , and  and the servers  and . The Internet  includes a distributed network of many computers, illustrated as servers , , and , linked together by way of numerous communications providers.","With respect to the computer , in operation, an application is installed thereon. A monitoring module having guidelines, which govern the utilization of applications and management of computing resources, is also associated with the computer . By way of example, the guidelines may prescribe a limit of three hours of Internet browsing with an Internet browser per week. The monitoring module monitors a utilization parametric that is indicative of a user utilizing or interacting with the application or managing an element of the computing resources. The status of the Internet browser, i.e., inactive or active, may be monitored to determine the time a user consumes on the Internet. By way of another example, the guidelines may prescribe a limit of 5 MB of bandwidth for streaming audio and video content per day. The bandwidth of the content associated with a streaming media application may be monitored to determine the bandwidth a user consumes with respect to streaming content.","The monitoring module may provide visibility into application utilization to a user and\/or to an administrator. In one embodiment, the monitoring module may provide an indication or visual indicator to the user of the utilization of the application. The indication may take the form of a timer or meter or indicator on the desktop that displays the amount of time consumed or time remaining. Accordingly, in this embodiment, the monitoring module provides the user visibility into the application utilization.","In another embodiment, the monitoring module may provide a substantially realtime, visible indication to the user of the utilization of the application. Additionally, in an in-house embodiment, the monitoring module may transfer data relative to the utilization parametric over the intranet  to the server  which has a processing module installed thereon. The processing module generates, based upon the utilization parametric, a report relative to the utilization of the application or management of computing resources, or one or more computing elements thereof. As will be explained in further detail hereinbelow, the report may be a user profile report, a resource evaluation report, or a productivity evaluation report, for example. Accordingly, in this embodiment, the monitoring module provides the user and administrators visibility into the utilization of the application as well as a baseline profile of the user management of computing resources.","In a further embodiment, the monitoring module operates in a stealth mode or benchmark establishing mode wherein no indication is provided to the user regarding the utilization of the application. In this embodiment, the monitoring module, however, does transfer data relative to the utilization parametric over the intranet  to the server  which has a processing module which may generate one of the aforementioned reports. Hence, in this embodiment, the monitoring module provides administrators visibility into the utilization of the application and computing resource management at an enterprise, department, group, or individual user level, for example. After the stealth mode is utilized to establish baseline behavior, the aforementioned guidelines and visual indicator furnish a tool for self-directed behavior management with respect to the use of computing resources during a transparent mode of operation. Monitoring and reporting may continue in this transparent mode of operation to measure the success of the user self-directed behavioral management with the visual indicator tool. It should be appreciated that although the processing module has been described as being installed on the server , the processing module may be installed on any computer. For example, in a stand alone embodiment or a single computer environment, the processing module may be installed on computer . By way of another example, in an application service provider (ASP) embodiment, the processing module is installed on a remote server, such as server , that is accessible via the Internet . More generally, the systems and methods presented herein furnish an employer with an understanding of behavior at various levels, for example, enterprise, department, group, or user. This understanding empowers the employer to discuss, institute limits or provide tools for self-directed behavior modification.","Further, it should be appreciated that although an office environment having a particular architecture is depicted in , the system and method for monitoring application utilization may be utilized in any environment having any architecture. For example, the system and method presented herein may be utilized in a home wherein the monitoring module is installed on a home computer that is in communication with a processing module installed on a remote server that is accessible via the Internet.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["40","40","42","44","46","42","48","49","50","42","44","52","54","56","58","60","62","64","58"]},"As previously alluded to, the monitoring module monitors utilization parametrics that are indicative of the user's utilization of applications and\/or management of computing resources. The utilization parametrics are stored in the history log  and the guidelines , which may vary between applications, indicate which utilization parametrics and applications are to be monitored. For example, with respect to the Internet application  and browsing the world wide web, the guidelines  may indicate that the monitoring module  monitor parametrics relative to the (i) the number of permitted minutes\/week, (ii) the number of minutes already consumed this week, (iii) the monitored and restricted start and end times (i.e., unrestricted Internet access may be permitted during certain periods of the day), (iv) the website destinations of the application, (v) the consumed time, (vi) the remaining time, (vii) the consumed bandwidth, and (viii) the remaining bandwidth. Collectively, the consumed bandwidth and the remaining bandwidth may be referred to as the amount of authorized bandwidth. The guidelines  may further indicate that if the user exceeds the permitted time during the monitored period, the monitoring module  may notify the user and request that the user terminate the Internet application . If the user fails to terminate the Internet application , then a violation notification may be sent to the processing module. In one implementation, certain time periods (by way of further examples: individuals with respect to IM applications, websites with respect to browsers) are considered un-metered and are monitored by the monitoring module , but not charged against the user's permitted Internet time.","By way of another example, the guidelines  may indicate that the IM application  should be monitored with respect to (i) the number of IM sessions permitted each day, week, month, etc. (ii) the number of IMs sent and received each week, (iii) the amount of time spent using the IM application , (iv) the individuals contacted by the IM application , and (v) the number of individuals contacted by the IM application . The guidelines  may indicate that if the user violates any of the guidelines, then monitoring module  notifies the user. Further, if the user fails to terminate the violating activities, then the monitoring module  may notify the processing module which, in turn, may notify a supervisor and\/or another designated individual.","By way of further example, the guidelines  may indicate that the word processing application  requires monitoring with respect to utilization parametrics including (i) the number of keystrokes, (ii) the number of pages created, (iii) the number of documents created, (iv) the amount of time spent interacting with the word processing application , and (v) the amount of time remaining to interact with the word processing application . The utilization parametrics for the amount of time spent and the amount of time remaining may collectively be refereed to as the amount of authorized time. In one embodiment, regardless of whether or not the user violates the guidelines, the monitoring module does not block the user's request. In this respect, the systems and methods presented herein do not act as filter. Rather, as will be described in more detail hereinbelow, the systems and methods presented herein rely on the indications provided to the user by the meters and reports generated to create accountability that positively impacts behavior and results in increased human performance. By way of another example, the guidelines  may indicate that voice-related or speech recognition applications or devices require monitoring with respect to utilization parametrics including (i) words per minute, (ii) amount of speech time, or (iii) the amount of time listening, for example.","The kernel space  provides the layer of an operating system that contains the system-level commands, such as device drivers, memory management routines and system calls, hidden from the application space  that are utilized to control the hardware space . An application programming interface (API)  provides the set of standard interrupts, calls, and data formats, collectively commonly referred to as \u201chooks,\u201d that the applications - use to initiate contact with the underlying kernel space  and hardware space . The Internet application , the IM application , and the word processing application  as well as the other applications discussed in  permit many of their function calls to the API  to be monitored by the monitoring module . More particularly, the monitoring module  monitors the function calls that are related to the utilization parametrics to determine how each application - is being utilized.","The hardware space  includes the actual physical computing machinery. For example, if platform  is a computer or notebook computer, the physical computing machinery may include components such as a liquid crystal display (LCD) panels, video adapters, integrated drive electronics (IDEs), CD-ROMs, and hard disk controllers, for example. As depicted, the hardware space  includes universal serial bus (USB) interfaces , , and  which allow multiple peripheral devices in a daisy-chain or star topology to be attached through a single interface to the platform . An IEEE 1394 or Firewire interface  is also included to provide a digital interface for consumer video electronics, hard disk drives, and related electronics. A Bluetooth interface  permits standardized wireless transmission between a wide variety of devices including personal computers, cordless telephones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), televisions, electronic game consoles, and MP3 players.","A wireless interface , which may be based on of the aforementioned IEEE 802.11, 802.11a, 802.11b (Wi-Fi), or 802.1G interfaces, provides a standardized networking architecture for a variety of devices that are similar to those listed with respect to the Bluetooth interface . A network interface card (NIC)  provides a physical and logical connection to a network, such as an intranet or an Internet. A keyboard interface  provides for a connection to a keyboard. An IEEE 1284 interface  provides for a connection to a printer.","The monitoring module  monitors utilization parametrics associated with the applications - and the hardware interfaces - to determine the utilization of an application and\/or management of computing resources. Additionally, the monitoring module  monitors utilization parametrics, such as keystrokes or websites, associated with the operating system which, in turn, is monitoring the hardware interfaces -. By way of example, the monitoring module  monitors the Internet application  by monitoring the keystrokes entered into keyboard interface , the history folder or file generated by the Internet application , the bandwidth consumption associated with the NIC  and the amount of time the Internet application  is in an active state, e.g., the monitoring module  does not consider the Internet application  to be active when it is minimized. The monitoring of the IM application  is similar to the monitoring of the Internet application . The monitoring module  monitors the word processing application  by monitoring the keystrokes entered into keyboard interface , the number of pages generated by the word processing application , and the amount of time the word processing application  is in an active state.","The monitoring module  is equipped with additional features that prevent user abuse and ensure an accurate measurement of the time a user is utilizing an application. The monitoring module is operable to search the platform  for unauthorized files. For example, in the event that the user of the platform  attempts to circumvent the monitoring module  by installing unauthorized applications, the monitoring module  is operable to perform a periodic search of the files on the platform  to determine the presence of unauthorized file names and, in one embodiment, block the use of programs associated with these unauthorized file names. The monitoring module  may accomplish this by comparing a compiled list of file names associated with unauthorized applications to the applications installed in the application space . Additionally, the monitoring module can detect extended periods of application inactivity by analysis of the collected utilization parametrics. Responsive to the detected inactivity, the monitoring module may automatically minimize the application or temporarily halt the relevant utilization parametrics. By using either of these methodologies, user inactivity that may skew the visibility of the application utilization is ignored and not taken into consideration.","Accordingly, the monitoring module  tracks when the applications - are used and how each is being utilized in terms of utilization parametrics. The data collected by the monitoring module  relative to the utilization parametrics may be provided to the user and\/or an administrator to yield insight into application utilization and management of computing resources at various levels including enterprise, department, group, and individual, for example. With respect to the user, based upon the guidelines  for utilizing the particular application, the monitoring module  provides the user a substantially realtime, visible indication of the utilization that is a tool for self-directed behavioral management. For example, a timer or meter may display to the user the remaining time with respect to non-Internet based applications like a company word processing program. By way of another example, the timer or meter may display a target time with respect to a non-Internet application such as a new company document retrieval system that each employee must use for a minimum of 30 minutes per week. In this case, the meter may count toward achieving a minimum usage rather than counting toward a maximum usage. Preferably, any of these indications are achieved by way of a meter that is visible on a display associated with the platform . It should be appreciated, however, that the indication may also be audio. With respect to the administrator, the data may be forwarded via the NIC  to a processing module associated with a server so that an administrator may have visibility into the user's utilization of the application by viewing web-based reports, for example.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["100","102","116","120","122","120","122"]},"By way of example, the bandwidth meter  includes both a bandwidth used tab  and a bandwidth remaining tab  that provide the user with indications of the used and remaining bandwidth, respectively. As illustrated, the bandwidth remaining tab  is selected and, correspondingly, the bandwidth remaining , 4 MB, is shown. Similarly, the Internet meter  includes a time used tab  and a time remaining tab . The time used tab  is selected and the amount of time, 3 hours and 30 minutes, that the user has used accessing the Internet is displayed. The meters  and  may include other information as well. For example, meter  may include a listing by category (please see Table 1: Table 1: Categorization of Websites at paragraph 40 hereinbelow) of the most frequently visited websites.","The user is utilizing the Internet browser application  as indicated by the interactive www session icon . As discussed previously, the monitoring module monitors utilization parametrics  through the various applications or the hardware input interfaces such as keyboard inputs or mouse inputs, and the application state, for example. In particular, the bandwidth consumed, the destination or websites visited, and the time consumed are monitored. The monitoring module has the ability to monitor bandwidth usage by source application and by destination. An indication of the bandwidth consumed is provided to the user via meter . Each website that is visited is rated in accordance with a predefined list of categories, websites, and URLs as will be discussed in further detail hereinbelow. The time consumed is monitored and a corresponding indication of the time consumed is provided to the user by way of meter . In the illustrated embodiment, the data relative to the utilization parametrics  including the data relative to the bandwidth consumed, source information, destination information, and time consumed is forwarded to a processing module for further analysis.","The user is also utilizing an IM application  as indicated by the virtual contact session icon . The utilization of the IM application  is being monitored by way of utilization parametrics . More specifically, the amount of time consumed, the number of messages and the number of contacts communicated with are monitored by the monitoring module and then reported to the processing module for further analysis.","The word processing application  is also being utilized as represented by a word processing session icon . Utilization parametrics  which include keystrokes, number of pages produced, number of documents produced and amount of time consumed utilizing the word processing session  are monitored and data relative to the utilization parametrics  is transferred to the processing module. Although the meters  and  are depicted and described as only monitoring bandwidth and time consumed with respect to the Internet browser application , it should be appreciated that the meters  and  may provide any type of indication of application utilization to the user. By way of example, with respect to the IM application  and the IM session , a meter may display the amount of time spent using the IM application  or number of IMs sent during the IM session , for example. With respect to the word processing application  and the word processing session , a meter may display the average number of words per minute entered or the average number of pages generated per hour, for example. Moreover, a meter may notify a user of a violation of the guidelines by presenting a visual indication with an explanation or an audio signal, for example.","It should be appreciated that the meters may have varied forms. For example, an IM meter  is located in the tray or pan of the desk top environment. The IM meter  indicates the amount of time, the number of messages, and the number of recipients with meters -, respectively, that express each of these utilization parametrics in terms of a continuum having \u201cnominal\u201d, \u201cacceptable\u201d, and \u201cunacceptable\u201d designations. It should be further appreciated that any other applications, such as applications - of , may have meters associated therewith for providing substantially real-time indications of application utilization to the user. Further, the meters may be pop-up meters or meters that express or summarize a utilization parametric by presenting a small icon in a corner of the desktop environment for a temporary period of time. Additionally, meters may be integrated together to create a dashboard that provides a quick and easily accessible overview of the user's utilization. In particular, the dashboard may combine the data of meters , , and  into a single meter. It should be appreciated that alone, or integrated as a dashboard, meters , , and  provide a visible indication to the user of the utilization parametrics. Moreover, this visible indication may be updated in substantially realtime.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["160","160","162","164","166","168","162","160","164","166","168"]},"The database  provides an accessible archive of websites and their corresponding rating.

Each monitoring module transfers the data, e.g., history log  of , relative to the utilization parametrics from the user's computer to the processing module  wherein the analysis engine  stores the data in database . The monitoring modules may stream the data in substantially real-time, transfer the data after a predetermined period of time has lapsed, or transfer the data in response to an event such as the end of a business day or a violation of the guidelines. Once the data is transferred, the analysis engine  may be utilized by an administrator to view the raw data or generate a report (examples of which are presented hereinbelow). Moreover, it should be appreciated that the reports can be accessed and generated by users that have the proper permissions and network connection to the processing module.","With respect to database  and database , the websites a user has visited may be stored in the database  and these websites may be rated as the data is loaded into the database  from the monitoring modules. In another embodiment, the websites that a user has visited may be rated after a predetermined period of time in order to ensure that the database  of categories has the most up to date data.","Additionally, the processing module  can generate a exception notification  via an email or a page, for example, to notify a manager or employee supervisor of a user violation of the guidelines. In another embodiment, the exception notification  may be a regular update that is periodically sent to the administrator.","The report  displays the productivity of user  in table  and the Internet browsing activities of user  in table . Utilizing reports, such as the report , ensures that administrators and other IT management have the information necessary in order to gauge the usage levels of various applications, the amount of time the business spends running non-essential applications, and the amount of time the business spends utilizing essential applications, such as Internet browsers, for personal reasons, for example.","Reports, such as the report , generated from analysis of user activities, enable administrators or supervisors to design a group or user-specific gateway page based on the group's or user's application utilization. The gateway page may be a customized application presentation, such as a customized Internet browser presentation, that optimizes the selection of applications  through  that are presented on the user's computer platform. In another implementation, the gateway page may include a customized initial website or homepage, e.g., a gateway page, having quick links to the most valuable resources for a particular group's or user's profile. By way of example, the gateway page will contain the most frequently used pages and suggest links based on the utilization parametrics as well as the utilization parametrics of similarly situated groups users. The multiple levels of analysis and correlation from the individual level through the group, company, industry, and overall population provide opportunities to determine productive resources and usage practices. In an ASP model, with the user's and organization's permission, the gateway page provides a mechanism for targeted purchase offers, individualized advertisements, or marketing surveys, for example. In this model, the ASP acts as a broker between the user or organization and providers of goods and services. It should be appreciated that the technology described herein is not limited to ASP business models, but is amenable to other business models as well.","Moreover, reports such as the report  enable administrators to build user profiles that may be used for advertising purposes, to detect economic espionage, or to determine if the particular user posses a homeland security threat. Additionally, reports enable administrators or supervisors to understand trends in a user's behavior to understand how a user's behavior has changed over time.

Exemplary types of raw data are presented in Table I, below. At the processing module, the collected raw data is continuously or periodically processed and transformed into aggregate data which is stored and accessible in summary tables. In one implementation, the processing module pre-generates commonly requested reports using the aggregate data stored in the summary tables.","An administrator employing the systems and methods presented herein in the form of a productivity software suite interfaces with the processing module, which may be a reporting center engine, and selects from a menu of reports or selects a set of parameters to build a customizable report. If the former option is elected, then the processing module forwards the requested report to the productivity software suite for the administrator to view. The administrator may then drill down to other reports for additional information. For example, if a Top Websites Report by Group was selected to view the top websites visited by a group of employees, the administrator or manager may drill down to view a report on Top Websites Report for an Individual. In response to the administrator or manager requesting to drill-down into the Report, the processing module utilizes the summary table and aggregate data, which forms a portion of the basis of the originally requested report, to generate the newly requested report in substantially realtime. Further, it should be appreciated that the aggregate data structure provided by the processing modules permits the administrator to pull back on the reports and view a report at a higher level using the same technology and methodology that permits drilling down. Accordingly, the processing module uses the summary tables to dynamically provide scalable reports having varying levels of detail.","In the instances where the administrator selects a set of criteria to create a customized report, the processing module utilizes links between the selected criteria and particular parts of the aggregate data populating the summary tables to generate in the requested customized report. With this configuration and methodology, customized reports are built quickly, as it is not necessary to mine the raw data to construct the reports. Rather, the summary tables provide the foundation for creating the reports. It should be appreciated that the following table is non-exhaustive and non-limiting of the types of data.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 3"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Types of Raw Data Collected"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"140pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Type","Definition"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Activation","Start and stop times and active period"]},{"entry":[{},"period","for each program used"]},{"entry":[{},"Websites","Names and IP addresses of websites"]},{"entry":[{},{},"visited, time of day, duration, reports"]},{"entry":[{},{},"to whom in management"]},{"entry":[{},"Operating","Windows 2000, XP, Vista, Linux, Mac, etc"]},{"entry":[{},"Systems"]},{"entry":[{},"Service Pack","Latest version of OS patches"]},{"entry":[{},"Employee","Sort employees by department"]},{"entry":[{},"Department"]},{"entry":[{},"RAM","Size and type of Memory per computer"]},{"entry":[{},"Hard Drive","Size, type, speed, capacity, unused, etc"]},{"entry":[{},"Machine name","Name of machine and manufacturer"]},{"entry":[{},"Subnet","Subnet assigned"]},{"entry":[{},"User Login","Current, and previous logins to this"]},{"entry":[{},{},"machine with dates and times"]},{"entry":[{},"IP Address","Current and previous IP addresses"]},{"entry":[{},{},"assigned with dates and times"]},{"entry":[{},"Printers,","Lists printers assigned to machine and"]},{"entry":[{},"accessories","any accessories attached including dates"]},{"entry":[{},{},"of each"]},{"entry":[{},"Application","Reports on applications hanging for"]},{"entry":[{},"hanging","proactive management activities"]},{"entry":[{},"All software","Reports per machine, department,"]},{"entry":[{},"applications","enterprise . . . quantities, total time spent,"]},{"entry":[{},{},"average time spent, concurrent usage, per"]},{"entry":[{},{},"day, week, month, etc."]},{"entry":[{},"Detailed","Name, version, manufacturer, service"]},{"entry":[{},"software","pack, date installed, date last used,"]},{"entry":[{},"information","number of times used per day, week,"]},{"entry":[{},{},"month, etc, number of concurrent users"]},{"entry":[{},{},"per day, week, month, etc. number of"]},{"entry":[{},{},"average users per day week month etc.,"]},{"entry":[{},{},"maximum number of users per day, week,"]},{"entry":[{},{},"month, etc."]},{"entry":[{},"Various Logging","Event logs, error logs, system logs,"]},{"entry":[{},"reports","audit logs, etc., per day, week, month,"]},{"entry":[{},{},"etc."]},{"entry":[{},"Software","Software may be categorized by type for"]},{"entry":[{},"Categorization","various needs . . . ie security software,"]},{"entry":[{},{},"business application software, internet,"]},{"entry":[{},{},"email, IM, etc."]},{"entry":[{},"Last login","Records last login to machine, name,"]},{"entry":[{},{},"date, attempts, etc."]},{"entry":[{},"Failed login","Reports attempts to hack into a machine"]},{"entry":[{},"Antivirus","Categories and updates"]},{"entry":[{},"Anti-spyware","Categories and updates"]},{"entry":[{},"Management","Separate users by department, specific"]},{"entry":[{},"Capabilities","management groups, managers, direct"]},{"entry":[{},{},"reports, and ability to provide logins at"]},{"entry":[{},{},"all levels to view lower level user"]},{"entry":[{},{},"activities in a management group, and"]},{"entry":[{},{},"restrict logins to only those a manager"]},{"entry":[{},{},"has responsibility over."]},{"entry":[{},"Exception based","Ability to set various parameters and"]},{"entry":[{},"reporting","obtain reports based on violation of"]},{"entry":[{},{},"parameters"]},{"entry":[{},"Bandwidth","Report on bandwidth consumption by"]},{"entry":[{},{},"application, user, machine, time of day,"]},{"entry":[{},{},"and cumulative reports by different"]},{"entry":[{},{},"groups or the entire organization."]},{"entry":[{},"Permissions","Permissions to view reports based on need"]},{"entry":[{},{},"and management level.
