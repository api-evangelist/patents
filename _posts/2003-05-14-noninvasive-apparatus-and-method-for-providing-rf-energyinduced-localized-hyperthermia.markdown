title: Non-invasive apparatus and method for providing RF energy-induced localized hyperthermia
abstract: An apparatus for providing hyperthermia treatment for enhancing cancer therapy includes an applicator body and a plurality of antennas operatively associated with the applicator body. The applicator body has a concave profile extending from an aperture and defines an open cavity for receiving RF standing waves. The antennas are arrayed for transmitting RF standing waves at respective selected amplitudes and relative phases into the cavity and generally toward a tumor-containing tissue disposed in operative alignment with the antennas. In use, the tissue such as a breast or chest wall is immersed in the cavity or supported on a pillow mounted to the cavity. The cavity contains a fluid such as deionized water through which the RF energy is transmitted to heat the tissue. The hyperthermia treatment can be used to enhance the effects of a cancer-related therapy such as radiotherapy or chemotherapy.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTEREST","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND ART","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This invention was made with Government support under Grant No. 5P01 CA 427 45-16 awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The Government has certain rights in the invention.","The present invention generally relates to inducing hyperthermia in a desired target such as living tissue. More particularly, the present invention relates to non-invasively causing localized hyperthermia in tissue such as tumor-containing tissue using a phased antenna array to direct standing waves of RF energy to the tissue. An advantageous application of the present invention is enhancing the effects of cancer-related therapeutic procedures.","Certain types of cancers such as breast cancers, particularly inflammatory and locally advanced tumors, often resist traditional treatments. It has been statistically shown that sixty to seventy percent of victims of such breast tumors do not survive past five years. The efficacy of conventional methods of treating cancer, such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy, is limited due to necessary constraints on dosage amounts for safety. For example, it is known that chemotherapy can be applied in sufficient amounts to kill virtually all cancer cells of a tumor. However, the amounts of chemotherapy needed to achieve this can be high enough to cause poisoning of the patient and\/or undue side effects. As another example, the intensity of an x-ray beam applied in accordance with radiotherapy cannot be so high as to damage nearby critical organs and surrounding healthy tissues. Accordingly, there is an ongoing need to develop techniques that enhance existing cancer-related therapeutic procedures so as to increase their effectiveness without increasing the risk of damage to healthy tissue and causing additional discomfort for cancer patients.","One recent approach toward improving cancer therapy is to subject a tumor to a hyperthermia treatment. The application of heat to cancer cells has been found to increase the efficacy of certain types of therapies for various proposed reasons. Microwave and radio frequency (RF) energy sources have been employed to conduct hyperthermia treatment. Microwave energy has been applied to tumors using waveguides. However, the relatively high frequencies at which microwaves propagate are not suitable for deep penetration into tissue. RF energy has also been utilized in some instances, and has the potential to achieve greater penetration due to relatively lower frequencies. However, both microwave and RF techniques have in the past required the use of invasive elements, such as wires, catheters, lumens, probes, receivers, and the like. These invasive elements are typically inserted or embedded in the tumor to be treated to ensure proper coupling and focusing of the electromagnetic energy at the tumor site. The use of invasive elements adds complexity to the procedure and is a source of discomfort for patients. Examples of invasive heating techniques using microwave and RF energy are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,928,159; 6,275,738; 6,358,246; 6,391,026; and 6,468,273.","It therefore would be desirable to provide a method and apparatus for non-invasively inducing hyperthermia in a tumor by applying electromagnetic energy, and preferably RF energy, to the tumor in a controllable, coherent manner, and while avoiding or reducing problems associated with conventional techniques.","According to one embodiment, an apparatus for providing hyperthermia treatment for enhancing cancer therapy comprises an applicator body and a plurality of antennas. The applicator body has a concave profile extending from an aperture, and defines an open cavity for receiving RF standing waves. The antennas are operatively associated with the applicator body and are arrayed for transmitting RF standing waves at respective selected amplitudes and relative phases into the cavity and generally toward a tumor-containing tissue disposed in operative alignment with the antennas.","According to another embodiment, a method for providing hyperthermia treatment for enhancing cancer therapy comprises the following steps. A tumor-containing tissue is placed in operative alignment with a phased array of antennas operatively associated with a body defining a cavity containing a fluid. RF energy is transmitted from the antennas through the fluid and to the tissue to heat the tissue.","According to yet another embodiment, a method for providing hyperthermia treatment to enhance tumor-related therapy comprises the following steps. A tumor-containing tissue is treated by performing a tumor-related therapeutical procedure. The tissue is placed in operative alignment with a phased array of antennas operatively associated with a body defining a cavity containing a fluid. RF energy is transmitted from the antennas, through the fluid, and into the tissue to heat the tissue.","It is therefore an object to provide an apparatus and method for inducing localized hyperthermia by applying controlled RF energy.","An object having been stated hereinabove, and which is addressed in whole or in part by the present invention, other objects will become evident as the description proceeds when taken in connection with the accompanying drawings as best described hereinbelow.","Referring now to , a hyperthermia treatment apparatus, generally designated HTA, is illustrated according to one embodiment. Hyperthermia treatment apparatus HTA primarily comprises a treatment applicator, generally designated TA, and associated electrical circuitry, generally designated EC (see , described in detail hereinbelow). Treatment applicator TA has a body, generally designated , constructed to form an open cavity  with which a biological target such as tumor-afflicted tissue can be proximally disposed for exposure to RF electromagnetic energy via electromagnetic coupling. In one embodiment, body  is constructed from a clear polymeric material such as LEXAN\u00ae material. The profile of body  can be polygonal as illustrated or can be generally semispherical or semi-ovoid. The embodiments of hyperthermia treatment apparatus HTA illustrated herein are particularly advantageous for the treatment of tumors of the breast and chest wall. For this purpose, treatment applicator TA can be mounted in a cut-out section of any suitable patient support structure  (e.g., a table, bed or couch) such that its cavity  opens upwards toward a top surface A of patient support structure . In one embodiment, patient support structure  includes a base  and a padding . By this configuration, a patient can lie comfortably in a prone position on top surface A with the breast or chest wall to be treated depending or facing downwardly into cavity .","In some embodiments, hyperthermia treatment apparatus HTA further includes a tissue (e.g., breast or chest wall) support structure  that is secured to the top of treatment applicator TA by any suitable fastening means (not shown) such as threaded screws, bolts and nuts, or clamps. In , tissue support structure  includes a container  that extends into cavity  to provide additional support for a breast. The use of tissue support structure  will generally depend on breast size. Moreover, while container  is illustrated as being cup- or bowl-shaped, the size and shape of container  can generally depend on breast size and shape.","As further shown in , during the operation of hyperthermia treatment apparatus HTA according to advantageous embodiments, cavity  of treatment applicator TA and container  of tissue support structure  (when used) are filled with a suitable fluid F such as deionized water. The breast or other tissue can be immersed in fluid F during treatment. As shown in , the temperature of fluid F can be regulated to prevent skin burns and improve patient comfort, by circulating fluid F through an inlet A and outlet B of cavity  as generally indicated by arrows and distributing the heat evenly around the tissue. The arrows in  can represent fluid flow through liquid conduits that communicate with any suitable temperature regulating system TRS. Water is useful as fluid F because its dielectric constant is similar to that of the tissue of a patient, and thus RF energy can be efficiently propagated and directed by treatment applicator TA (in a manner described hereinbelow) with minimal reflected energy. The use of water as fluid F is considered superior to air, at least in part because air cannot transfer heat as efficiently and its dielectric constant differs from water by a factor of about 10.","Referring now to , details of treatment applicator TA are illustrated according to a four-antenna embodiment. Body  of treatment applicator TA includes six body sections or walls defining cavity . In the illustrated example, the body  sections include two opposing side sections E and F generally perpendicular to the plane of an aperture  of body ; two opposing side sections A and D angled relative to aperture ; and two angled bottom sections B and C. Aperture  is formed by the respective top edges of perpendicular side sections E and F and angled side sections A and D. Antennas ANT-ANTare respectively disposed in each of angled side sections A and D and angled bottom sections B and C, although more or less antennas could be provided in angled side sections A and D and angled bottom sections B and C. Antennas ANT-ANTcan be secured to body  in any suitable manner, such as by gluing antennas ANT-ANTto the inside surfaces of angled side sections A and D and angled bottom sections B and C. Antennas ANT-ANTcan have any design suitable for transmitting RF energy through a selected fluid such as water. In the advantageous embodiments illustrated herein, each antenna ANT-ANThas a \u201cbowtie\u201d or \u201cH\u201d shape constructed from a pair of generally C-shaped antenna elements A and B. For each pair, antenna elements A and B () are inverted with respect to each other, with their corresponding legs opening away from each other. Antennas ANT-ANTare arrayed along angled side sections A and D and angled bottom sections B and C to enable standing RF waves to be coherently focused toward the tissue residing in or over cavity .  schematically depicts a coherent pattern of standing RF waves RF focused on a tumor mass TM of a breast BR. As shown in , each antenna ANT-ANTcommunicates with electrical circuitry EC via respective low-loss output cables OC-OCto provide RF energy as described hereinbelow.","Referring now to , tissue support structure  includes a plate  from which container  extends downwardly. Plate  is sized to cover cavity  and thus enable tissue support structure  to be mounted onto body , for example at a rim  thereof. Tissue support structure  can be secured to body  by any suitable means, one example being the use of screws (not shown) tapped through respective apertures A and A of plate  and rim , or bolts extending through apertures A and A and held by nuts.","As further shown in , in some embodiments, a magnetic coil device MC can be mounted to the inside or outside of container  so as to circumscribe the breast or other tissue to be treated. Magnetic coil device MC can be coupled to any suitable magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) device MRI to generate images of the tumor in the breast during treatment. Apart from other known visual uses, the MRI images can be correlated to temperature, and hence magnetic coil device MC can be used as a temperature-sensing device. In other embodiments, a temperature-sensing device can be provided in the form of a thermometer that is physically inserted into the breast, such as through a catheter as is understood by persons skilled in the art. The use of magnetic coil device MC, however, is non-invasive and much less discomforting for the patient undergoing treatment.","Referring now to , treatment applicator TA is illustrated according to a five-antenna embodiment. Body  of treatment applicator TA includes five body sections or walls A-E defining cavity . In the illustrated example, the body  sections include two opposing side sections D and E generally perpendicular to the plane of aperture  of body ; two opposing side sections A and C angled relative to aperture ; and a bottom section B generally parallel with aperture . Antennas ANT-ANTare respectively disposed in angled side section A, bottom section B, angled side section C, perpendicular side section D, and perpendicular side section E, although more or less antennas could be provided in each section A-E. Antennas ANT-ANTcan be secured to body  in any suitable manner, and can have any design, such as described hereinabove with reference to  and . In the embodiment illustrated in , side sections A and C include both angled portions A, A and perpendicular portions B, B, respectively, and their corresponding antennas ANTand ANTdisposed over both portions A, A and B, B, to provide additional directions over which standing RF waves propagate toward the tissue residing in cavity .","Referring now to , treatment applicator TA is illustrated according to a six-antenna embodiment. Body  of treatment applicator TA is similar to that shown in  and . In , however, two additional antennas ANTand ANTare provided and are mounted at perpendicular side sections E and F, respectively. Antennas ANT-ANTcan be secured to body  in any suitable manner, and can have any design, such as the bowtie shape described hereinabove with reference to .","For a given hyperthermia treatment, the selection of the four-, five- or six-antenna embodiment of treatment applicator TA can depend on factors including the type of tissue to be treated, such as the size and\/or shape of a breast; the type, location and advancement of the tumor to be treated; and the pattern of standing RF waves determined to be optimal for the treatment of a given tumor. The decision to employ tissue support structure  with treatment applicator TA can also depend on these factors. For instance, the use of the four-antenna embodiment of treatment applicator TA without tissue support structure  can be indicated for a large-size breast afflicted with a bilateral disease.","Referring now to , an alternate embodiment of treatment applicator TA is illustrated in which tissue support structure  is provided in the form of a pillow  filled with a suitable fluid F such as deionized water and attached to a planar structure such as a silastic membrane . Similar to plate  of tissue support structure  illustrated in , B,  and , membrane  is sized to cover cavity  and enable pillow  to be mounted onto body  of treatment applicator TA. As shown in , pillow  is sized to be generally flush with top surface A of patient support structure . Pillow  is useful for treating superficial or skin diseases, and post-mastectomy chest wall recurrence. The patient can be comfortably positioned prone on patient support structure , with the chest wall lying on pillow  in operative alignment with antennas ANT of treatment applicator TA.","Referring now to , a block diagram depicts one exemplary embodiment of electrical circuitry EC suitable for driving antennas ANT-ANTof hyperthermia treatment apparatus HTA (see, for example, FIGS. A and B). The primary functions of electrical circuitry EC are to generate RF signals at a desired frequency (e.g., approximately 130-160 MHz), and divide the power of the signals into separate channels CH-CHfor distribution to corresponding antennas ANT-ANTprovided with hyperthermia treatment apparatus HTA. In addition, advantageous embodiments of electrical circuitry EC enable, in each channel CH-CH, attenuation of the amplitude of the RF signal to control final output power in that channel CH-CH. Moreover, in at least some of the channels CH-CH, electrical circuitry EC enables variation of the phase of the RF signal to establish RF standing wave patterns in cavity  of hyperthermia treatment apparatus HTA that are optimal for the embodiment of hyperthermia treatment apparatus HTA being employed, the type of tissue being treated, the characteristics of the tumor afflicting the tissue, the status of the patient (e.g., pre-surgical, post-mastectomy, and the like), and the type of therapy that is to be enhanced by hyperthermia treatment apparatus HTA (e.g., chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and the like). In further embodiments, electrical circuitry EC provides closed loop control of amplitude and phase in each channel CH-CHduring a hyperthermia treatment procedure. In still further embodiments, electrical circuitry EC enables impedance matching to optimize the transfer of RF power to antennas ANT-ANT.","In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in , electrical circuitry EC comprises an RF signal generator  of any suitable type, one example being an HP 8647A signal generator available from Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, Calif. RF signal generator  generates the initial RF signal for the system. The initial signal is then split by a 2-way power divider  to provide a reference signal over a reference line RL for a purpose described hereinbelow. The main initial signal is then amplified by a pre-amp  and fed to a 4-way power divider . At 4-way power divider , the amplified signal is split into four channels CH-CH, although more or less channels could be provided.","It will be noted that, for brevity,  does not show all components associated with first, second and third channels CH-CH. However, the circuitry associated with first, second and third channels CH-CHis similar to that of fourth channel CH. All channels CH-CHcan include an electronically variable attenuator . One primary difference in the present embodiment is that first channel CHdoes not include an electronically variable phase shifter , whereas each of second, third and fourth channels CH-CHinclude phase shifter .","Continuing with the illustrated example of fourth channel CH, the divided RF signal dedicated for fourth channel CHis fed to variable attenuator , where the amplitude of the signal and thus the final output power of fourth channel CHcan be controlled. The output phase of fourth channel CHis controlled by phase shifter . After the phase and amplitude of the signal have been set, a high-power amplifier  amplifies the signal up to a maximum power of, for example, 160 W. One example of a suitable high-power amplifier  is available from LCF Enterprises, Post Falls, Id. Once the signal has been appropriately conditioned, it is transmitted over a length of low-loss output cable OCto fourth antenna ANTfrom which it is outputted into cavity  of treatment applicator TA (see, for example, FIG. C).","Referring again to , electronic circuitry EC can include a circulator  positioned after high-power amplifier  to isolate high-power amplifier  from the rest of fourth channel CHand allow high-power amplifier  to operate reliably under any loading condition. Circulator  is particularly useful in clinical applications, because the loading condition of antennas ANT-ANTvaries from one treatment to another and can lead to impedance mismatch. In addition, a high-pass filter  can be provided to filter the signal at a desired cut-off frequency. In the present example, the bandwidth of the system ranges from approximately 100-200 MHz, although the actual bandwidth might be narrower due to the use of circulator  and high-pass filter . The RF frequency should be low enough to ensure sufficiently deep penetration into tissue where a tumor is located, as opposed to other frequency ranges such as microwaves that are considered herein to propagate at too high of a frequency to offer suitable penetration.","Electronic circuitry EC also includes a closed loop feedback circuit for monitoring and adjusting amplitude and phase during operation. At the output of fourth channel CH, a dual directional coupler  taps off a portion of the forward power and reflected power in output cable OCand feeds these sample signals to a switch  via respective sample lines SL-SL. An example of a suitable dual directional coupler  is available from Bird Electronic, Solon, Ohio. The respective dual directional couplers  of other channels CH-CHalso provide sample signals to switch , as indicated by additional sample lines SL. Switch  connects a selected channel CH-CHto a vector voltmeter , which measures the amplitude and phase of the channel CH-CHbeing sampled. Switch  can be controlled to cycle or scan through all of channels CH-CHso that phase and amplitude measurements for all channels CH-CHare read from vector voltmeter  by a computer  several times per second. An example of a suitable computer  is a DELL\u00ae Model No. XP120C PC computer. Computer  receives the measurements made by vector voltmeter  as inputs for a software algorithm executable by the central processing unit (CPU) of computer . The algorithm compares these measurements to predetermined set points and makes appropriate adjustments by sending control signals over control signal lines CLand CLto variable attenuator  and phase shifter , respectively.","The phase measurements for all channels CH-CHshould be made with respect to the same reference signal. First channel CHis arbitrarily selected in the present embodiment to be the reference channel of the system, since its phase is always zero and does not require a phase shifter . Hence, first channel CHwould be the logical choice for providing the reference input to vector voltmeter . However, for some treatments, first channel CHmight be turned off and therefore inactive. To ensure that vector voltmeter  can make measurements under this circumstance, a portion of the signal from RF signal generator  (which is always ON during treatment) is routed by 2-way power divider  to vector voltmeter  over reference line RL, prior to the main signal being divided into channels CH-CHat 4-way power divider .","The RF power system provided by electrical circuitry EC can be calibrated to enable vector voltmeter  to accurately measure signals sampled from each channel CH-CH. It can be seen from  that while samples are measured at point B corresponding to the selected input to vector voltmeter  from switch , the phase and amplitude of the RF signal are of greater interest at point A, where output cable OCattaches to antenna ANT. To calibrate each channel CH-CH, the input of dual directional coupler  can be connected to any signal generator, and point A of output cable OC, which usually is connected to antenna ANT, can then be connected to the reference signal port of vector voltmeter  in place of reference line RL, thus becoming the reference signal for vector voltmeter . Vector voltmeter  then measures the difference in phase and amplitude between point A and point B over a band of frequencies. When the system is reconnected in the standard operating configuration shown in , computer  can retrieve the values measured during calibration and add them to the vector voltmeter  readings at point B to reconstruct the amplitude and phase values at point A. This process can be implemented by software executed in computer .","To increase the efficiency of power transfer from the RF energy source to antennas ANT-ANT, electrical circuitry EC can provide for impedance matching. As appreciated by persons skilled in the art, the amount of power radiated from antennas ANT-ANTis frequency-dependent. If the impedance of any given antenna ANT-ANTis not close to that of its corresponding output cable OC-OC, which typically is a 50-Ohm impedance, there will be an impedance mismatch and much of the RF energy sent to that antenna ANT-ANTwill be reflected back into the system where it is absorbed by a dummy load . The input impedance of any given antenna ANT-ANTdepends on the material and the geometry of the load placed inside treatment applicator TA. Since the load changes from treatment to treatment, it is not always possible to know what frequency provides the best impedance match. This problem can be solved by scanning each individual channel CH-CHacross the usable bandwidth of the system and recording the impedance match (i.e., the ratio of reflected power to forward power) at each frequency. While channels CH-CHall match at similar frequencies, they do not match at exactly the same frequency. The match of the entire system at each frequency is taken to be the match of the worst channel at that frequency. It is then suggested that the therapist use the frequency at which the entire system has the best match.","During treatment, it is possible for the impedance to change due to, for example, patient movement. As a result, it is possible for the impedance match of the system to change during treatment. A matching algorithm, which can be implemented by software executed by computer , can be run at any point during a treatment to determine if it would be advantageous to change frequencies. Inputs for the matching algorithm include the frequency setting of RF signal generator , the power setting for the amplifier of each channel CH-CH(e.g., high-power amplifier  of fourth channel CH), and the phase setting for each channel CH-CH. For each channel CH-CH, computer  can display the forward power, reverse power, and phase measured by vector voltmeter , as well as amplifier current. Vector voltmeter  samples phase, forward power, and reverse power in each channel CH-CHat some interval (e.g., twenty times per second), makes a comparison with the respective set values, and adjusts the respective voltages over control signal lines CLand CL(e.g., 0-5 V) to control variable attenuator  and variable phase shifter  associated with each channel CH-CH.","It thus can be seen that electrical circuitry EC provides a 4-channel RF power source for treatment applicator TA (FIGS. -), with seven degrees of freedom or adjustability (four power settings ranging from approximately 0-160 W, three relative phase settings ranging from approximately +\/\u2212180 degrees). If, in the present example, all four channels CH-CHare operating at full power, the system can deliver a total output of 640 W.","It can be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that while electronic circuitry EC illustrated by way of example in  is configured to drive the four-antenna embodiment of treatment applicator TA (FIGS. A-), electronic circuitry EC can be modified, or similar circuitry provided, so as to accommodate any of the other embodiments of treatment applicator TA (for example, FIGS. -). For instance, when using the five-antenna embodiment of treatment applicator TA (FIG. ), the output of fourth channel CHcould be split using a coaxial 2-way splitter to drive two antennas ANTand ANT() instead of one.","It can be further appreciated by persons skilled in the art that the algorithms described hereinabove can be implemented by any suitable software written in an appropriate language such as Visual Basic, C++, or the like.","In operation, hyperthermia treatment apparatus HTA (see generally ) can be employed to heat any material that can benefit from the application of coherently focused RF energy coupled from a phased antenna array and through a medium such as deionized water. As described hereinabove, hyperthermia treatment apparatus HTA is particularly advantageous for the treatment of locally advanced or inflammatory breast cancer in presurgical patients, and of the recurrence of chest wall diseases in post-mastectomy patients. Depending on the nature of the tissue and tumor contained therein to be treated, the configuration of treatment applicator TA is selected\u2014e.g., whether to use the four, five, six, or other multiple antenna embodiment of treatment applicator TA, whether to use tissue support structure  (see, for example, , ,  and ), and whether container  () or pillow  () is used as tissue support structure .","Once treatment applicator TA has been selected, the channels CH-CHof electrical circuitry EC that are to be active are selected, as well as the desired settings (e.g., amplitude and phase) for the RF signals to be carried in each active channel CH-CH. In addition, the frequency setting of RF signal generator  is selected. These various settings are selected so as to provide a beneficial standing RF wave pattern in cavity  of treatment applicator TA that is tailored, for example, to the configuration chosen for treatment applicator TA. Software executed by computer  () can be provided to assist in this optimization. The patient is then positioned on patient support structure  () with the tumor-containing tissue supported on or in treatment applicator TA as described hereinabove. In general, the tissue can be characterized as being in operative alignment with antennas ANT, meaning that the tissue is either immersed in cavity  or supported over or in close proximity to cavity  as appropriate to effect electromagnetic coupling and direct RF standing waves to the tumor. Electrical circuitry EC is then operated as described above to supply RF energy to treatment applicator TA, and antennas ANT broadcast the RF energy through cavity  to the tumor-containing tissue whereby the tumor is heated. In addition, treatment applicator TA is preferably connected with temperature regulation device TRD () to circulate fluid F such as deionized water through cavity  at a temperature setting comfortable for the patient. The hyperthermia procedure proceeds in this manner for a predetermined schedule (e.g., one hour per cycle, one cycle every three weeks, four cycles total).","Hyperthermia treatment apparatus HTA is particularly advantageous as a mechanism for enhancing tumor-related therapeutic procedures provided for cancer patients. It is contemplated that the therapeutic procedure will typically be carried out prior to the use of hyperthermia treatment apparatus HTA, but the practice of the embodiments disclosed herein is not limited to the order in which tumor-related therapy and hyperthermia treatment are performed. One example is radiotherapy, the effects of which have been proven to be improved through the application of heat to the tumor being treated. Another example is chemotherapy.","In particular, certain types of chemotherapy are administered to patients in liposomal encapsulations or coatings. When treatment applicator TA is employed to focus RF energy at the tumor of a patient, the consequent heating of the tissue can have a number of benefits. Heating promotes the disintegration of the chemotherapy-carrying liposomes. Heating draws liposomes out of the bloodstream and directly to the site of the tumor, thus concentrating the chemotherapy-containing liposomes where they are most needed. A tumor's blood vessels are much more leaky or chaotic than normal blood vessels. Heating pulls the blood vessels apart more than usual, thereby allowing the liposomes to leak out and pool into the tumor's interstitial spaces. Consequently, the chemotherapy is preferentially delivered to the tumor and not to surrounding tissue. In normal tissues of the patient's body that remain unheated during the hyperthermia treatment, the chemotherapy slowly leaks out from the liposomes over a period of typically three or four weeks, a rate sufficient to enable the liver and spleen of the patient to blunt any toxic side effects. Moreover, the heat provided by hyperthermia as disclosed herein increases the rate of the chemotherapy's uptake into the cancer cell itself. Heating further increases oxygen levels within the tumor, which is advantageous for many chemotherapy agents whose proper functioning critically relies on oxygen. Heating also boosts the potency of the chemotherapy by interfering with mechanisms that control a cancer cell's ability to replicate. Finally, heating amplifies the level of DNA damage that chemotherapy inflicts upon the cancer cell by inhibiting enzymes that normally repair such DNA damage.","Presently, \u201cmelting\u201d liposomes are being developed that melt quickly in response to heating, thereby dumping their contents directly into a tumor within about twenty seconds of heating. Some of these liposomes have a precisely determined melting point such as about 40\u00b0 C. (104\u00b0 F.). The effects of chemotherapy encapsulated in such liposomes can be advantageously enhanced by performing hyperthermia treatment according to the embodiments disclosed herein. For instance, referring to , the bath of fluid F circulated in cavity  of treatment applicator TA can be maintained by temperature regulating device at 40\u00b0 C., which is warm enough to engage the benefits of heating but cool enough to prevent burning the skin of the patient.","Data have been acquired from pre-clinical and phase I clinical studies on human patients undergoing hyperthermia treatment using hyperthermia treatment apparatus HTA in conjunction with chemotherapy infusion via liposomes. In particular, twenty-one women afflicted with newly diagnosed breast cancers participated in a twelve-week hyperthermia trial. It was found that encapsulating the chemotherapy inside of liposomes enabled the delivery of thirty times more chemotherapy to the tumor site as compared with more conventional techniques, and without poisoning the rest of the body. Patients generally experienced less nausea, fatigue, and cardiac toxicity than with traditional chemotherapy. In addition, the results showed that the combined therapy halted tumor growth in all patients and at least shrunk tumors in half of the patients. Eleven percent of the patients had complete pathologic responses, meaning no cancer was found in the breast tissue upon analyzing its surgical remains. Thirty-three percent of patients had complete clinical responses, meaning visible signs of the tumor could no longer be detected. Seventeen percent of patients were converted from mastectomy candidates to lumpectomy candidates.","As one non-limiting example of a combined therapy\/hyperthermia treatment, a traditional cancer therapy (e.g., chemotherapy and\/or radiation) is given to a patient and followed by a CT or other appropriate scanning technique to locate the precise location of the tumor within the tissue. The hyperthermia treatment is then given as described hereinabove. After the final hyperthermia treatment is given, a radiation oncologist measures the tumor shrinkage by any suitable means, and recommends the least invasive type of surgery to remove the tumor. Surgery is followed by additional therapy and hyperthermia treatment, if one or both procedures are indicated at this stage, to kill any undetected cancer cells in the tissue.","In the traditional order of cancer therapy, surgery is performed first and chemotherapy and radiation performed last. It can be seen from the foregoing disclosure that the methods disclosed herein can be characterized as reversing that traditional order. Hyperthermia treatment apparatus HTA can be implemented as part of a more recent therapeutic model termed \u201cneo-adjuvant\u201d therapy, meaning the treatment occurs prior to surgery. In many cases, neo-adjuvant therapy is a more logical sequence of treatment events, because it requires less invasive surgery and offers patients a wider range of treatment-related options. Moreover, the methods disclosed herein can further the treatment goal of shrinking tumors enough for surgeons to successfully remove them without damaging the surrounding tissue or leaving behind errant cancer cells.","It can be appreciated that the embodiments disclosed hereinabove have potential applications outside the immediate scope of cancer therapy, such as cellular necrosis, chemical reaction kinetics, and catalysis.","It will be understood that various details of the invention may be changed without departing from the scope of the invention. Furthermore, the foregoing description is for the purpose of illustration only, and not for the purpose of limitation, as the invention is defined by the claims as set forth hereinafter."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":["FIG. 1B","FIG. 1A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 2A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 2B","FIG. 2A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 2C","FIG. 2A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 2D","FIG. 2A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2A and a"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 6"],"b":"2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 8"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
