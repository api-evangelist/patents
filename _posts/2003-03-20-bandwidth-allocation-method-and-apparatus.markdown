title: Bandwidth allocation method and apparatus
abstract: A satellite communications system provides a communications service to a mobile terminal on which different communications applications may be run. Calls are set up between any of the applications via a satellite to a network management centre which provides different service adaptors which adapt the calls to different types of service provided over terrestrial networks, such as telephony, facsimile, internet or ATM services. The bandwidth allocated to each call over the satellite link may be varied during the call according to demand either from the relevant application or from the network management centre. Multiple calls may be connected concurrently to or from different applications running on the mobile terminal. A maximum bandwidth is allocated to each call. Efficient use is thereby made of the limited bandwidth available over the satellite, according to the instantaneous bandwidth requirements of different applications. For real-time calls requiring multiple slots per frame in a TDMA channel, the slots are mutually spaced apart to reduce delay.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["The present invention is a divisional of and claims priority from, U.S. application Ser. No. 10\/229,150, filed Aug. 28, 2002, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,643,515, which is a divisional of U.S. application Ser. No. 09\/319,460 filed Aug. 9, 1999, now abandoned which in turn claims priority from PCT\/GB97\/03344 filed Dec. 4, 1997 and GB 9625475.0 filed Dec. 6, 1996.","The present invention relates to a communication method and apparatus and particularly, but not exclusively, to a communication method for allocating bandwidth to a call with a mobile terminal.","In some satellite and terrestrial mobile communication systems, terminals are available which provide both voice and data communication. For example, some GSM mobile telephones are connectable to data terminals, such as portable computers. During a data call using such mobile terminals. TDMA slots are assigned to the data call in a similar way as to a voice call, so that a constant bandwidth connection is established both in the forward and return direction. Mobile satellite systems, such as the Inmarsat-B\u2122, InmarsatC\u2122 and Inmarsat-M\u2122 satellite communication systems, allow fixed-bandwidth data communications.","Such systems are suitable for the exchange of some types of data, but are primarily designed for voice communications, which require a constant symmetrical data rate. Such systems are not optimised for both data and voice communication.","There is an increasing demand for data communications which require intermittent bursts of data to be sent or received at a high data rate, while requiring only low data rate communication at other times. For example, it is desirable when using a Web browser for requested pages to be downloaded as quickly as possible to the user terminal, but little or no bandwidth is required in the forward direction while the user reads the downloaded page. Such usage is also very asymmetrical, since the user only needs to send requests for new pages or small amounts of data in the return direction. The use of such applications over the GSM system is unsatisfactory, since for some of the time during the data call the allocated bandwidth is not used, but while large amounts of data are being downloaded, the allocated bandwidth is insufficient.","Furthermore, it would be desirable to allow multiple calls to be handled concurrently by the same mobile terminal. For example, during a telephone call, a mobile user may wish to refer to data from an online database, or receive an incoming facsimile.","A variable data rate satellite communication system is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,256,925. In this system, a satellite is used for communication between a plurality of ground stations. Each ground station requests a proportion of the total channel capacity in accordance with the traffic load of voice and data call to that ground station. A reference station in the network allocates the channel capacity among the stations.","An ATM (asynchronous transfer mode) satellite communication system is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,363,374. Each earth station requests sporadic connection to the communication system and a central management station determines whether to accept or refuse the connection according to the available bandwidth.","The document GB 2 270 815A discloses a cellular mobile radio system which provides a packet reservation multiple access protocol for implementing a variable bit rate service. The mobile terminals contend for access in the same time slots in which they will transmit information. In order to support variable bit rates, the terminals have the ability to reserve multiple slots in any given frame. Both voice and data calls may be supported in the same frame, with a larger burst size being used for data traffic for greater efficiency, and a small burst size being used for voice traffic to reduce the delay incurred in waiting for enough information from a voice code.","The document EP 0 713 347A discloses a system for transmission of STM and ATM traffic on a broadband communications network, such as a fiber\/coax network or a wireless network in which mobile stations depend on a base station for feedback. ATM calls can be constant bit rate, delay sensitive variable bit rate, delay tolerant variable bit rate or contention based. Delay sensitive variable bit rate calls are allocated time slots in accordance with a statistically weighted incremental bandwidth determination that takes into account existing variable bit rate traffic and the statistical characteristics of the new call request. ATM traffic is assigned a minimum guaranteed bandwidth and any spare bandwidth is assigned among existing ATM calls or used to admit a new ATM call.","According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a mobile communication system in which the bandwidth available for an individual call between a mobile communications terminal and a base station is varied according to the demand for bandwidth during that call without exceeding a predetermined maximum level determined for that call. Advantageously, the bandwidth may be increased when a large quantity of data is to be sent, but is reduced at other times and the additional capacity made available to other users.","The maximum level may be determined according to the type of call in order to support a peak bandwidth suitable for that type of call.","According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of assigning time slots to individual calls in a TDMA mobile communication system, in which multiple slots within a frame which relate to a real-time call are spaced apart from each other in the frame. Advantageously, this slot allocation scheme reduces the delay incurred by the TDMA frame structure.","According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of registering a mobile terminal in a satellite communications system which has both spot beams and a global beam, in which the terminal first attempts to communicate in the last spot beam channel used, and only re-registers in the global beam to receive a new spot beam channel allocation if the last spot beam channel cannot be received.","The present invention extends to apparatus for carrying out any of the above methods.","System Overview",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["12","18","22","2","4","4","4","4","12","6","2","2","14","8","8","10"],"i":["a","b","c","d "]},"The antenna  is located within the coverage region of a spot beam B generated by the satellite , which may for example be a geostationary satellite having multibeam receive\/transmit antennas for receiving and transmitting signals in each of a plurality of spot beams B. Each spot beam B carries a plurality of frequency channels both in the forward and return directions. The satellite also receives and transmits in a global beam G which has a coverage area extending substantially or completely over the coverage areas of the spot beams B. The global beam G carries at least one forward and one return frequency channel.","The RF signals transmitted between the antenna  and satellite  comply with an air interface protocol , which will be more fully described hereafter. The satellite  acts as a repeater and converts channels from multiple spot beams B into channels in a feeder beam F and vice versa. The feeder beam F provides a link between the satellite  and an earth station  via an earth station antenna . The air interface protocol over the feeder beam F is referenced as F in .","The network management centre  is connected to the earth station  and includes a number of different service adaptors , , , providing an interface to terrestrial networks , such as PSTN, ATM networks or ISDN. For example, the service adaptors  may comprise a telephony adaptor including a codec for converting voice signals on a PSTN to data at the network management centre  and vice versa. A facsimile service adaptor may implement facsimile protocols, such as defined in ITU Recommendations T.30 and T.4 and include a modem for communication over a PSTN. An internet service adaptor implements TCP\/IP and an ATM service adaptor implements ATM protocols. These standard protocols and interfaces are designated collectively by  in .","The mobile terminal  allows multiple different types of communication to be set up over the satellite communication system, such as telephony, internet, fax and ATM. These applications may be run concurrently. The bandwidth allocated to each application may be varied independently in the forward and return directions during a call, as will be described below.","Air Interface Protocols","The implementation of the air interface protocols  and F, as performed by the driver software  of mobile terminal  and by the network management centre , will now be described with reference to . The protocol structure is described in terms of \u201clayers\u201d which interwork with each other as shown in .","The top layer comprises a slot management layer  which receives data D from and sends data D to the applications  or the service adaptors . The data is formatted in slots S, each comprising a cell, as shown in . Each cell C comprises a header H and data D both of fixed length. The slot management layer  formats data into and out of slots containing such cells, and exchanges the slots with a TDMA layer  which controls the timing of transmission and reception of the slots S within TDMA frames FR, which are sent to or received from a physical layer .","The physical layer  corresponds to the interface , the interface card  and the antenna , providing a physical interface between the driver software  and the air interface , or corresponds to the earth station antenna  and earth station , which likewise provide a physical interface between the network management centre  and the satellite . In both cases, the physical layer  converts the frames FR to radio frequency signals RF and vice versa.","The slots S contain, in addition to the traffic data D, signalling information which is used to set up calls and to vary the assignment of bandwidth during a call. The creation and reception of these signals is performed by a session management protocol layer , which interworks with the slot management layer  and the TDMA layer  to receive or transmit signalling information within the cells C, in the header H and\/or as data D.","As shown in , each TDMA frame is transmitted or received in a format comprising 18 slots S. . . S, each comprising a cell C, with a guard band G separating each slot. Each slot S also contains synchronisation and control information which is used to acquire the timing of the slots, and will not be discussed further.","Each slot S may be assigned to any mobile terminal  with which a call has been set up, under the control of the network management centre .","Alternatively, more than one cell may be transmitted in each slot, with each cell being assignable to a different call to or from the same mobile terminal or even to a different mobile terminal.","Call Management","The different states through which the mobile terminal  passes during operation are shown in . In order to communicate with the mobile terminal , the network management centre  determines in which spot beam B the mobile terminal  is located. If the mobile terminal  is being used for the first time, or has moved into a different spot beam B since it was last used, then the mobile terminal  is in an \u201cunlocated\u201d state. When the mobile terminal  has acquired a spot beam channel but is not handling any calls, it is in an \u201cidle\u201d state. When a first call is being set up with the mobile terminal , it enters a \u201csignalling\u201d state, unless the call set up fails in which case it returns to the \u201cidle\u201d state. When the first call has been set up, the mobile terminal  enters an \u201cactive\u201d state and remains in the active state until all calls are terminated, when the mobile terminal  enters the \u201cidle\u201d state once again. If contact is lost with the spot beam channel, the mobile terminal  returns to the unlocated state. Each of these states will now be described in detail.","Unlocated State","Transitions from the unlocated state will now be described with reference to .","When the mobile terminal  is activated i.e. switched on or otherwise enabled to communicate, the driver software  first tunes the interface card  to the frequency of the spot beam B last used for communication (step ), if there has been any previous communication. If the interface card  is able to receive in this spot beam B, the driver software  detects whether any of the applications  have requested that an outgoing call should be set up from the mobile terminal  (step ). If so, the mobile terminal  enters the signalling state; otherwise it enters the idle state.","If the interface card  is unable to receive signals at the frequency of the previously used spot beam B, then the interface card  is tuned to the forward and return frequencies of the global beam G received by the satellite  (step ). The mobile terminal  then transmits a \u201clog-on\u201d message (step ) in the global beam return channel. The log-on message includes identification information identifying both the mobile terminal  and its current user, together with location information which is sufficient for the network management centre  to determine in which spot beam B the mobile terminal  is located. This information may be entered by the user of the mobile terminal (i.e. by indicating in what country the mobile terminal  is located), or may be derived by positioning equipment in the mobile terminal , such as a GPS (Global Positioning System) receiver. Preferably, the positioning information is sufficient to identify in which spot beam B the mobile terminal  is located, but does not have sufficient accuracy to allow eavesdroppers to locate the mobile terminal  precisely and thereby pose a security risk. If one of the applications  has requested that a call be set up, the log-on message may also indicate that the mobile terminal  intends to establish a call.","The mobile terminal  then awaits a response from the network management centre  in the forward channel of the global beam G (step ). The response from the network management centre  includes identification information so that the response may be correlated with the log-on message, spot beam channel identification information which identifies the frequency channel to be used by the mobile terminal  for communication in the spot beam B in which it is located, and timing information derived from the timing of the log-on message as received by the earth station , to assist the mobile terminal  in synchronising with the timing of the frames FR. If the mobile terminal  indicated in the log-on message that a call is to be setup, the response includes a label which is used in a slot negotiation phase, as will be described later.","The interface card  is then tuned to the spot beam channel indicated by the response (step ). If no calls are currently required either from or to the mobile terminal, the mobile terminal  enters the idle state while continuing to monitor the spot beam forward channel, otherwise it enters the signalling state (step ).","Idle State","In the idle state, as shown in , the mobile terminal  continuously detects whether it is able to receive frames correctly in the designated spot beam channel (step ). If it is no longer able to do so, the driver software  enters the unlocated state. Otherwise, the mobile terminal  detects whether any of the applications  require an outgoing call to be set up (step ). If so, the mobile terminal  transmits a request message (step ) in a slot S reserved for such signalling in the return spot beam channel. The allocation of such slots S is periodically indicated by the network management centre  in the forward direction spot beam channel. Access to such slots is determined by a slotted aloha access scheme, with the possibility of collision if two mobile terminals  attempt to transmit in the same slot, in which case the network management centre  will not receive either request message. The request message contains identification information identifying the mobile terminal .","In response to the request message, the network management centre  sends a \u201cwelcome\u201d message, including a label which is used as a temporary identity code for the mobile terminal . If the mobile terminal  detects the welcome message (step ) it enters the signalling state; otherwise, the request is repeated (step ) after a predetermined period. The period is increased after each unsuccessful request (step ) and includes a randomised component, to avoid repeated conflict for the same return channel slot with the same other mobile terminals sending request messages. After a predetermined number of unsuccessful requests, the terminal  returns to the idle state.","If a call originating from the terrestrial network  is to be connected to the mobile terminal , the network management centre  sends identifying information over the forward spot beam channel to the mobile terminal , to indicate that an incoming call is to be set up. If the mobile terminal  detects such an incoming call (step ) it enters the signalling state; otherwise if there are no incoming or outgoing calls, the mobile terminal  stays in the idle state.","Signalling State","In the signalling state, as shown in , a setup protocol exchange takes place (step ), in which user authentication information is sent by the mobile terminal  to the network management centre  and the addresses of the call and calling parties are exchanged. A committed bit rate (CBR) and maximum bit rate (MBR) are established for each direction of the call. The committed bit rate is a bit rate which is guaranteed throughout the call. The maximum bit rate is the maximum rate that can be assigned to the new call at any stage during the call. These variables are used by the network management centre  during the call to determine the number of slots allocated to the mobile terminal . The MBR and CBR in each direction may be determined according to the type of the call and\/or according to a request by the mobile terminal  during call set-up. For example, if the call is an internet connection to be used for web access by the mobile terminal , a low CBR and MBR are set in the return direction while a low CBR and a high MBR are set in the forward direction, the level of the MBR being set according to a request from the mobile terminal .","If setup fails for any reason (step ), for example because the requested committed bit rate is not available in the spot beam B, or the network management centre  is unable to connect the call through the terrestrial network, the mobile terminal  returns to the idle state.","After the setup exchange, the mobile terminal  may retune (step ) to a different channel within the spot beam B if the channel assigned during setup is not the same as the channel being used for the call. If setup is successful, the mobile terminal  enters the active state.","Active State","Once the mobile terminal  is in the active state, additional signalling may take place between the mobile terminal  and the network management centre  so as to terminate a call, to exchange charging information or system information, to request more or less bandwidth for a call or to establish another call. This information is preferably sent in one or more of the slots already assigned to the mobile terminal . Alternatively, in the forward direction the network management centre  may send signalling information in a cell C of a slot S which is not committed to any mobile terminal , and indicate in the header information of this cell that the cell contains signalling information addressed to the mobile terminal .","An example of a protocol exchange which may take place in the active state of the mobile terminal  is shown in . The mobile terminal  detects whether an incoming or outgoing call has been terminated (step ). If so, it detects (step ) whether there are now no incoming or outgoing calls. If so, the mobile terminal  enters the idle state, while remaining tuned to its current forward and return spot beam channels; otherwise, it continues in the active state.","The mobile terminal  also detects whether any additional calls are to be set up (step ), either signalled by one of the applications  in the case of an outgoing call or indicated in a forward direction cell C from the network management centre  in the case of an incoming call. The mobile terminal  determines, by means of a signalling exchange with the network management centre , whether the committed bit rate required for the new call is available (step ). If not, the driver software  determines whether a lower CBR than the requested CBR is suitable and available for the new call (step ). If so, the new call is set up (step ) by assigning additional slots to the new call within the same frequency channels, in addition to the slots which may already be assigned to other calls connected to the mobile terminal .","If the lower committed bit rate is not available or acceptable, the call is terminated (step ) and the mobile terminal  continues in the active state, unless there are no other calls in progress in which case the idle state is entered.","If the requested capacity is not available in the frequency channel to which the mobile terminal is currently tuned, but is available in another channel, the network management centre  may signal to the mobile terminal  that the option is available of retuning to another channel and reassigning slots in that channel. If the mobile terminal  accepts, it retunes to the new channel and receives a new slot assignment in that channel from the network management centre .","While the mobile terminal  is in its active state, one of the applications  may enter a state in which the driver software  detects that additional bandwidth is required (step ). For example, the application may begin to output a large graphics or audio file. In that case, the mobile terminal  signals in one of the assigned slots of the return channel that additional slots are required (step ) in the return direction. If the current bit rate assigned to that call is less than the maximum bit rate, and additional capacity is available in the frequency channel to which the mobile terminal  is tuned, the network management centre  assigns additional slots to the call in the return direction and signals to the mobile terminal which additional slots may be used in the return direction.","Slot Assignment","The system by which slots are assigned to the mobile terminal  in both the forward and return direction will now be described in detail. Once the mobile terminal  has left the unlocated state, it is tuned to receive one spot beam frequency channel in the forward direction and to transmit in another spot beam frequency channel in the return direction. Each mobile terminal  continuously receives in the forward frequency channel, but transmits only in the slots in the return channel which have been assigned to that mobile terminal, and optionally in the slots which have been designated for sending request messages, as described above. The forward and return slots can contain both signalling and call traffic.","As shown in , each cell comprises a header H and data D.

As described above, the label is a temporary identity code which is assigned to each mobile terminal  when it is in the active or signalling state. When the mobile terminal  returns to the idle state, its label may be reassigned by the network management centre  to another mobile terminal . In this way, the number of bits needed to address a mobile terminal is reduced. Since each frame FR of a frequency channel contains 18 slots, only 18 different labels are need to identify each of the different mobile terminals tuned to that frequency channel. Six bits are assigned to the label field, allowing additional labels to be used for other purposes. For example, a further label may indicate that the cell contains a broadcast message addressed to all the mobile terminals receiving the frequency channel, or for signalling purposes.","After a mobile terminal returns to the idle state, its label is not made available for reassignment for a predetermined period, to avoid the possibility of the same label being used for two different mobile terminals on the same frequency channel due to loss of call state synchronization between the network management centre  and the mobile terminal entering the idle state.","Return Assignment","In the forward direction, this field contains the label of the mobile terminal which is allowed to transmit in the corresponding slot of the return channel, for example the slot having the same order in the frame of the return channel.","Bandwidth Demand","This field is used in the return direction to indicate the bandwidth required by the transmitting mobile terminal  for all its calls in the return direction. One bit of the bandwidth demand field indicates that additional slots are required in the return direction for signalling purposes, thus allowing signalling to take place without reducing the bandwidth available to currently active calls.","Virtual Channel Identifier (VCI)","This field identifies the individual call with which the cell C is associated, thus allowing a single mobile terminal to support multiple concurrent calls. The driver software  identifies the VCI of each cell C addressed to the mobile terminal and directs the contents of the cell to the corresponding application . Likewise, data from an active application is assigned a VCI when formatted into a cell by the driver software .","Payload Type Identifier (PTI)","This field is present for ATM compatibility, and is passed transparently by the satellite communication system, to allow interworking with terrestrial ATM services through the terrestrial network .","Cell Loss Priority (CLP)","This field is also present for ATM compatibility, and is passed transparently by the satellite system.","Header Error Control (HEC)","This field contains a check value calculated from the values from the other three bytes of the header, to allow corrupted headers to be detected.","Bandwidth Allocation","The network management centre  receives the bandwidth demand fields from each of the mobile terminals  transmitting in a single return frequency channel, and allocates return channel slots according to these bandwidth demands, and the committed and maximum rate of each call. The allocation of slots in the return channel is indicated by the return assignment field.","The network management centre  also determines which slots are addressed to each of the mobile terminals in the forward direction, according to the required capacity in a forward direction for each of the calls. Thus, the capacity allocated in the forward direction may be selected independently from the capacity allocated in the return direction, allowing asymmetric calls to be assigned only so much capacity as is needed in each direction.","The network management centre  buffers data received from the network  for transmission to the mobile terminal , and determines the number of slots assigned to each call in the forward direction, and therefore the current forward bit rate, so that the committed bit rate is provided but the maximum bit rate is not exceeded. The current forward bit rate may be determined according to the quantity of data buffered for that call at the network management centre, so that a burst of data from the network  will result in an increased forward bit rate. Optionally, if capacity on a forward channel is still available even after the maximum bit rate has been assigned to all calls, the maximum bit rate may be exceeded by assigning further slots to calls for which large amounts of data are buffered.","By appropriate selection of the committed and maximum bit rate for each call, various different types of call may be implemented. For example, a voice call may have a maximum bit rate equal to its committed bit rate, which is the bit rate required for the voice signal. Non-real-time low bit-rate applications, such as E-mail, may be assigned a low committed bit rate, but a high maximum bit rate so as to clear buffered e-mail at the network management centre  when there is any unused channel capacity.","Billing Strategy","The network management center  may compile billing information according to the committed and maximum bit rates assigned to each call. For example, the billing rate may be proportional to the committed bit rate, with a comparatively small surcharge proportional to the maximum bit rate. In this way, the total capacity of a frequency channel is shared between different mobile users according to their bandwidth requirements, with lower priority non real-time users being charged less for access to the channel.","Real-time Calls","When determining the slot allocation for individual calls, the network management centre  takes into account whether the call is a real-time call (such as a voice call. For such calls, the delay in transmission to and from the mobile terminal  should be kept to a minimum. Therefore, where a real-time call occupies multiple slots in a frame, those slots are spaced apart and distributed as evenly as possible throughout the frame so as to reduce the maximum delay encountered by any of the data in the real-time call. For example, Table 2 below shows the slot allocation where four different voice calls, V  to V, are established to four different mobile terminals , with each call V occupying four slots S within the frame FR, while Table 3 shows, by way of comparison, an arrangement in which the slots assigned to each call V are grouped together.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0074","num":"0073"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 2"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"V\u2002V\u2002V\u2002V\u2002V\u2002V\u2002V\u2002V\u2002V\u2002V\u2002V\u2002V\u2002V\u2002V\u2002V\u2002V"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0074"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 3"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"V\u2002V\u2002V\u2002V\u2002V\u2002V\u2002V\u2002V\u2002V\u2002V\u2002V\u2002V\u2002V\u2002V\u2002V\u2002V"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"In the case shown in Table 3, the data for each call may be buffered for up to one complete frame period. In contrast, the method in accordance with this embodiment, as shown in Table 2, requires data to be buffered for only a small fraction of the frame period, thereby reducing both delay and the size of the buffer required. Real-time calls are therefore given priority when allocating slots, so as to achieve regular spacing of the relevant slots through the frame. Non real-time variable bandwidth calls are then allocated to the remaining slots available so as to assign the committed bit rate to each of these calls. Surplus capacity is then allocated according to demand by the mobile terminals, subject to the maximum bit rate for each call.","While the above embodiment is described with reference to a satellite communications system, aspects of the present invention may also be applied to terrestrial cellular communications systems. The mobile terminal may be portable, may be mounted on a vehicle or form part of a temporary or permanent installation, such as a temporary office building or a wireless telephone booth.","Elements of the embodiment are described in terms of functional blocks. These blocks do not necessarily correspond to discrete units, but functions of more than one functional block may be performed by one discrete unit, or the function of one functional block may be performed by more than one discrete unit.","Although the preferred channel format is TDMA, aspects of the present invention may also be applied to CDMA communications systems."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF INVENTION","BACKGROUND ART","STATEMENT OF INVENTION","MODES OF CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Embodiments of the present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 4"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
