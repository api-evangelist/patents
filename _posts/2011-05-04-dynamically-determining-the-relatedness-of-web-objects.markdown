title: Dynamically determining the relatedness of web objects
abstract: A first cluster of web objects is identified from a click-through data structure. The click-through data structure can organize web objects into clusters based on query results of web objects selected by a user. Also, a second cluster of web objects can be identified from a metadata data structure. The metadata data structure can organize web objects into clusters based on metadata associated with the web objects. An output set of web objects is selected, in real time, from the identifier clusters.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["1. Technical Field","Embodiments of the invention relate generally to web objects, and more specifically, dynamically determining the relatedness of web objects to a new web object.","2. Prior Art","The vast amount of information available on the Internet gives rise to the need for effective techniques for web searching. Search engines provide one mechanism for indexing web information and allowing users to retrieve results with a search query. However, queries can be interpretive due to idiosyncrasies in language such as double meanings. For example, a query for \u2018Paris\u2019 could return results for both the city of Paris and the celebrity Paris Hilton.","One complement to search results based on the search query is suggested results. These suggestions are based on the search results themselves, or even a specific search result that is selected by a user. Once a result has been selected, suggestions that are similar to the selected result are presented. Returning to the example, if Paris Hilton is selected from the results, suggestions provide additional results related to Paris Hilton and to other characteristics of the selected query result. For example, if the selected result concerns a movie starring Paris Hilton, the suggestions may include other Paris Hilton movies.","Problematically, when web objects, such as movies, images or documents, are initially made available on the Internet, conventional techniques have difficulty in finding related web objects to present as suggestions. Whereas web pages are easily described by text, many web objects do not include text, making indexing and searching more difficult. Although various parameters about web objects develop over time, such as user comments and click-throughs, this data may not be available for newer web objects. Also, databases that index web objects are often updated offline or in batch. Thus, web objects that have yet to be indexed present difficulties when presenting suggestions of related web objects.","In the light of the foregoing discussion, there is a need for a technique to dynamically identify web objects related to a relatively new web object.","The above-mentioned needs are met by a method, a computer program product and a system for dynamically identifying web objects related to new web objects.","In one embodiment, a first cluster of web objects is identified from a click-through data structure. The click-through data structure can organize web objects into clusters based on query results of web objects selected by a user. Also, a second cluster of web objects can be identified from a metadata data structure. The metadata data structure can organize web objects into clusters based on metadata associated with the web objects. An output set of web objects is selected, in real time, from the identifier clusters.","A web object can comprise a video, an image, a document, or any other suitable web component. In one example, a set of related videos are suggested for a user that selects a video from search results.","Advantageously, a robust selection of related web objects can be suggested for newly added web objects.","The features and advantages described in this summary and in the following detailed description are not all-inclusive, and particularly, many additional features and advantages will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the relevant art in view of the drawings, specification, and claims hereof. Moreover, it should be noted that the language used in the specification has been principally selected for readability and instructional purposes, and may not have been selected to delineate or circumscribe the inventive subject matter, resort to the claims being necessary to determine such inventive subject matter.","The above-mentioned needs are met by a method, computer program product and system for dynamically identifying web objects related to a newly added web objects. For example, when a recently published image is selected, a robust set of suggested images can also be presented to the user. The following detailed description is intended to provide example implementations to one of ordinary skill in the art, and is not intended to limit the invention to the explicit disclosure, as one or ordinary skill in the art will understand that variations can be substituted that are within the scope of the invention as described.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"At step , a new web object is received. Generally, a web object is an element of a web page such as an image, a document or a video (or viewer for an image, document or video). In some embodiments, a web object includes a group of web objects. Web objects can have properties that describe behaviors such as a response to a roll over, hover, or click. Additionally, web objects can be sized, formatted, and manipulated in various ways. Web objects can be embedded in a web page and managed using source code such as HTML or auxiliary software such as Java or Flash.","A new web object includes web objects that have been recently made available by publication to the Internet or otherwise, and have yet to be processed into existing data structures. As a result, new web objects, in some embodiments, have relatively little or no information about relatedness to exiting web objects. Tools such as web crawlers and data scrapers update databases and indexes from time to time during a batch process, thereby adding the new web objet to existing data structures.","For example, frequently updated web sites such as Yahoo! Video constantly receive video uploads. When a video is first uploaded, a data structure that describes a relation between videos has yet to be updated to include the new video, and thus, has no inherent way to identify related videos. Once processing has occurred, the data structure can be walked to find related videos. The above example is described with more detail below with respect to .","At step , a related web objects are selected from data structures, as described below with respect to . In one embodiment, related web objects are selected in substantially real time. For example, related objects can be identified while a video is being uploaded. In another embodiment, the related web objects can be updated from time to time, or on demand when new information is gathered. Various types of data structures can be used to relate web objects to each other. Relatedness to web objects of the data structures can be determined by one or many data structures.","In one embodiment, data structures are processed in batch while a server is offline or during low-traffic periods. Some servers are less busy during late night hours, or the server may go offline temporarily. During this time, newly added web objects can be added to a data structure. Once the server returns to a live status, new objects can be cached until the next batch processing.","At step , related web objects are output. The specific type of output is implementation specific. In one example, the output suggestions of related objects. The related objects can be objects related to search results returned from a search engine (either a general search engine such as Yahoo! Search or an internal search engine such as within YouTube). In another example, the output can be display of an advertisement object. The advertisement object can be related to another object such as an image object.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":"120"},"At step , a first cluster of web objects is identified from a click-through data structure and can be generated in an off-line process. In one embodiment, a click-through data structure describes the relatedness between a group of web objects. Object-to-object relatedness can be shown in the form of a matrix where each object has either a zero or a non-zero relatedness to each other object with respect to a query. The zero relatedness refers to when query results are returned to users, there are no instances of users selecting at least one of the objects from the results. On the other hand, the non-zero relatedness refers to when query results are returned to users, there are instances in which users are selecting a first web object, and there are also instances in which the users are selecting a second web object. The frequency of selections is represented by a relatedness value. For example, the top two query results selected by users will have the highest relatedness value.","Web objects having a non-zero relatedness value are added to a cluster. In one embodiment, a threshold defines a minimum for relatedness value of clustered objects. There are at least two, but possibly many more objects per cluster. Individual web objects can be part of more than one cluster.","Thus, a resultant static click-through data structure includes a group of clusters. Each cluster is representative of a search query and includes a group of related web objects.","At step , a second cluster of web objects is identified from a metadata data structure and can also be generated in an off-line process. Generally, metadata associated with a web object provides some type of description. For example, a web user can make a comment or give a rating. Additionally, metadata can include properties such as category, file type, length or size. Metadata relatedness can be shown in the form of a matrix with non-zero and zero values.","A metadata structure can include clusters of web objects. Each cluster can represent, for example, terms from the metadata and include web objects having the same or similar terms. As described above, a threshold can be set for the relatedness of clustered objects.","In one implementation, words associated with the metadata can be tokenized. Next, clusters associated with the word can be identified (i.e., identify a cluster given a word). Next, web objects from a cluster are identified (i.e., identify web objects given a cluster).","In one embodiment, metadata similarity between two objects can be quantified using a cosine similarity metric. As such, a graph data structure wherein each object is a unique node in a graph and two nodes are connected by an edge with an edge weight, represents the metadata similarity between the two corresponding objects. To simplify computation, edges can be discarded.","In another embodiment, a Hadoop framework is used to compute graph data in a distributed setting. The Hadoop framework allows the computation process to be simplified, for example, from a corpus of hundreds of millions.","In one embodiment, a distributed version of the Markov Clustering Algorithm can be used to cluster videos. Resultant clusters can be referred to as static-metadata clusters. Subsequently, to find related objects, a list of other videos in a cluster in descending order of their cosine similarity to a subject (e.g., a new) object can be obtained.","At step , an output set of web objects is selected from the first and second clusters of web objects. In some embodiments, a predetermined number of web objects having the highest relatedness are selected. In other embodiments, prior to selecting, relatedness values of different matrices are normalized to a common scale. Then, the top web objects are selected in accordance with the specific implementation.","In one implementation, a relatedness value is calculated for each related web object using the below formula:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"munder":{"mo":"\u2211","mi":"w"},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"P","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"w"}},{"mi":"F","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"w"}},{"mi":"P","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["C","w"],"mo":"|"}}},{"mi":"P","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["d","C"],"mo":"|"}}}],"mo":["*","*","*"]}}}}},"Further, a score is calculated for click-through related videos using the below formula:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"munder":{"mo":"\u2211","mi":"w"},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"P","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"w"}},{"mi":"F","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"w"}},{"mi":"P","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["C","w"],"mo":"|"}}},{"mi":"P","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["d","C"],"mo":"|"}}},{"mi":"P","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["d_c","d"],"mo":"|"}}}],"mo":["*","*","*","*"]}}}},"br":{}},"P(w): A word which is a part of a large number of clusters is considered ambiguous and hence its weight is low. But, a word which belongs to a small number of clusters is considered to be a specific word and its weight is high. This quantity is normalized such that P(w) when summed over all the words is unity.","F(w): frequency of a term in metadata of a web object.","P(C|w): For each term\/word, an ordered list of metadata clusters with a score. This quantity represents the most likely cluster given a word w. This is normalized such that the quantity P(C|w), for a word w when summed over all the clusters is unity.","P(w|C): For each cluster, the list of significant terms with a score. This gives us the list of significant words in cluster and its weight is proportional to the number of documents in the cluster containing the word. This is normalized such that P(w|C) for a cluster, when summed over all the words is unity.","P(d|C): For each cluster, an ordered list of documents and their scores. This quantity represents how strongly each document belongs to the cluster. This quantity signifies how strongly each document is associated with each cluster. Amongst various alternatives, convergence values from the MCL algorithm as P(d|C) are considered.","P(d_c|d): For each document d, an ordered list of documents d_c that are related to it, extracted from the click clusters. Each related document is associated with a score obtained from the random walk formulation.","Various implementation-specific calculations can be substituted as the above is given only for purposes of illustration.","In one implementation, for each new object, the following steps can occur. First, metadata of the document is tokenized and filtered by P(w). P(C|w) is looked-up and all metadata clusters (set C) is extracted for most significant worlds (top N) in the metadata (set W). Next, for each of the clusters in C, a significant list of terms from P(w|C) is retrieved and weighted cosine distance is calculated for the set with W. This gives a better estimate of the relatedness of that cluster to the object. Afterwards, P(d|C) is looked-up and objects for the top K clusters in C are extracted. P(d_c|d) is then looked-up and the top U objects from the pool are extracted and added. Finally, a score is calculated for each object, using, for example, the above-mentioned formulas.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","300","310","320","330"]},"The web page  can be any Internet or local page displaying newly added web objects and related web objects.
