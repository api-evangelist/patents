title: Wireless location using multiple mobile station location techniques
abstract: A hybrid wireless location system and method is disclosed for locating mobile stations (MSs). Multiple wireless location techniques (FOMs) are provided for MS location. One or more FOMs can be activated in various combinations (serially or parallelly) for outputting one or more MS location estimates with signal protocols, e.g., CDMA, TDMA, or GSM. Resulting location estimates may be for, e.g.: 911 emergency calls, tracking, navigation, people and animal location, andJor applications for confinement to andlor exclusion from geographical areas. System components may be distributed on a network (e.g., the Internet). FOMs may be based on one or more of: TOA, TDOA, AOA, signal pattern recognitionlfingerprinting, statistical analysis, base station coverage, GPS signals received at the MS, andlor input from mobile stations. Location estimates are enhanced by adjusting MS estimates (and/or confidences therefor) according to: a past performance of the FOM providing such estimates, and/or MS geolocation or velocity constraints.

Wireless cellular telecommunications systems are rapidly replacing conventional wire-based telecommunications systems in many applications. Cellular radio telephone networks (\u201cCRT\u201d), and specialized mobile radio-and mobile data radio networks are examples. The general principles of wireless cellular telephony have been described variously, for example in U.S. Pat. No. 5,295,180 to Vendetti, et al, which is incorporated herein by reference.","There is great interest in using existing infrastructures for wireless communication systems for locating people and\/or objects in a cost effective manner. Such a capability would be invaluable in a variety of situations, especially in emergency or crime situations. Due to the substantial benefits of such a location system, several attempts have been made to design and implement such a system.","Systems have been proposed that rely upon signal strength and trilateralization techniques to permit location include those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,818,998 and 4,908,629 to Apsell et al. (\u201cthe Apsell patents\u201d) and 4,891,650 to Sheffer (\u201cthe Sheffer patent\u201d). However, these systems have drawbacks that include high expense in that special purpose electronics are required. Furthermore, the systems are generally only effective in line-of-sight conditions, such as rural settings. Radio wave surface reflections, refractions and ground clutter cause significant distortion, in determining the location of a signal source in most geographical areas that are more than sparsely populated. Moreover, these drawbacks are particularly exacerbated in dense urban canyon (city) areas, where errors and\/or conflicts in location measurements can result in substantial inaccuracies.","Another example of a location system using time of arrival and triangulation for location are satellite-based systems, such as the military and commercial versions of the Global Positioning Satellite system (\u201cGPS\u201d). GPS can provide accurate position determination (i.e., about 100 meters error for the commercial version of GPS) from a time-based signal received simultaneously from at least three satellites. A ground-based GPS receiver at or near the object to be located determines the difference between the time at which each satellite transmits a time signal and the time at which the signal is received and, based on the time differentials, determines the object's location. However, the GPS is impractical in many applications. The signal power levels from the satellites are low and the GPS receiver requires a clear, line-of-sight path to at least three satellites above a horizon of about 60 degrees for effective operation. Accordingly, inclement weather conditions, such as clouds, terrain features, such as hills and trees, and buildings restrict the ability of the GPS receiver to determine its position. Furthermore, the initial GPS signal detection process for a GPS receiver is relatively long (i.e., several minutes) for determining the receiver's position. Such delays are unacceptable in many applications such as, for example, emergency response and vehicle tracking.","Differential GPS, or DGPS systems offer correction schemes to account for time synchronization drift. Such correction schemes include the transmission of correction signals over a two-way radio link or broadcast via FM radio station subcarriers. These systems have been found to be awkward and have met with limited success.","Additionally, GPS-based location systems have been attempted in which the received GPS signals are transmitted to a central data center for performing location calculations. Such systems have also met with limited success. In brief, each of the various GPS embodiments have the same fundamental problems of limited reception of the satellite signals and added expense and complexity of the electronics required for an inexpensive location mobile station or handset for detecting and receiving the GPS signals from the satellites.","Radio Propagation Background","The behavior of a mobile radio signal in the general environment is unique and complicated. Efforts to perform correlations between radio signals and distance between a base station and a mobile station are similarly complex. Repeated attempts to solve this problem in the past have been met with only marginal success. Factors include terrain undulations, fixed and variable clutter, atmospheric conditions, internal radio characteristics of cellular and PCS systems, such as frequencies, antenna configurations, modulation schemes, diversity methods, and the physical geometries of direct, refracted and reflected waves between the base stations and the mobile. Noise, such as man-made externally sources (e.g., auto ignitions) and radio system co-channel and adjacent channel interference also affect radio reception and related performance measurements, such as the analog carrier-to-interference ratio (C\/I), or digital energy-per-bit\/Noise density ratio (E) and are particular to various points in time and space domains.","RF Propagation in Free Space","Before discussing real world correlations between signals and distance, it is useful to review the theoretical premise, that of radio energy path loss across a pure isotropic vacuum propagation channel, and its dependencies within and among various communications channel types.  illustrates a definition of channel types arising in communications:","Over the last forty years various mathematical expressions have been developed to assist the radio mobile cell designer in establishing the proper balance between base station capital investment and the quality of the radio link, typically using radio energy field-strength, usually measured in microvolts\/meter, or decibels.\n\nFirst consider Hata's single ray model.

However, frequencies between 1 GHz and 2 GHz experience increased values in the exponent, ranging from 2 to 4, or 20 to 40 dB\/decade, which would be predicted for the new PCS 1.8-1.9 GHz band. One consequence from a location perspective is that the effective range of values for higher exponents is an increased at higher frequencies, thus providing improved granularity of ranging correlation.","Environmental Clutter and RF Propagation Effects","Actual data collected in real-world environments uncovered huge variations with respect to the free space path loss equation, giving rise to the creation of many empirical formulas for radio signal coverage prediction. Clutter, either fixed or stationary in geometric relation to the propagation of the radio signals, causes a shadow effect of blocking that perturbs the free space loss effect.

In current practice, however, field technicians often have to make a guess for dense urban an suburban areas (applying whatever model seems best), then installing a base stations and begin taking manual measurements. Coverage problems can take up to a year to resolve.","Relating Received Signal Strength to Location","Having previously established a relationship between d and P, reference equation 2 above: d represents the distance between the mobile station (MS) and the base station (BS); Prepresents the received power in free space) for a given set of unchanging environmental conditions, it may be possible to dynamically measure Pand then determine d.","In 1991, U.S. Pat. No. 5,055,851 to Sheffer taught that if three or more relationships have been established in a triangular space of three or more base stations (BSs) with a location database constructed having data related to possible mobile station (MS) locations, then arculation calculations may be performed, which use three distinct Pmeasurements to determine an X,Y, two dimensional location, which can then be projected onto an area map. The triangulation calculation is based on the fact that the approximate distance of the mobile station (MS) from any base station (BS) cell can be calculated based on the received signal strength. Sheffer acknowledges that terrain variations affect accuracy, although as noted above, Sheffer's disclosure does not account for a sufficient number of variables, such as fixed and variable location shadow fading, which are typical in dense urban areas with moving traffic.","Most field research before about 1988 has focused on characterizing (with the objective of RF coverage prediction) the RF propagation channel (i.e., electromagnetic radio waves) using a single-ray model, although standard fit errors in regressions proved dismal (e.g., 40-80 dB). Later, multi-ray models were proposed, and much later, certain behaviors were studied with radio and digital channels. In 1981, Vogler proposed that radio waves at higher frequencies could be modeled using optics principles. In 1988 Walfisch and Bertoni applied optical methods to develop a two-ray model, which when compared to certain highly specific, controlled field data, provided extremely good regression fit standard errors of within 12 dB.","In the Bertoni two ray model it was assumed that most cities would consist of a core of high-rise buildings surrounded by a much larger area having buildings of uniform height spread over regions comprising many square blocks, with street grids organizing buildings into rows that are nearly parallel. Rays penetrating buildings then emanating outside a building were neglected.  provides a basis for the variables.","After a lengthy analysis it was concluded that path loss was a function of three factors: (1) the path loss between antennas in free space; (2) the reduction of rooftop wave fields due to settling; and (3) the effect of diffraction of the rooftop fields down to ground level. The last two factors were summarily termed L, given by:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0040"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00004","num":"00004"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["L","ex"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mn":"57.1","mo":["+","+","+","-"],"mi":["A","R"],"mrow":[{"mi":"log","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"f"}},{"mo":"(","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mn":"18","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mrow":{"mi":"log","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"H"}}}},{"mn":"18","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mrow":{"mi":"log","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":"-","mfrac":{"msup":{"mi":"R","mn":"2"},"mrow":{"mn":"17","mo":"\u2062","mi":"H"}}}}}}],"mo":"-"}}]}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"Equation","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mn":"9"}}}]}}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0041"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00005","num":"00005"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mo":"=","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mn":"5","mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mi":"log","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"msup":{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mfrac":{"mi":"d","mn":"2"}},"mn":"2"}}}},{"mn":"9","mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}],"mi":["log","d"]},{"mn":"20","mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mi":"log","mrow":{"mo":["{","}"],"msup":{"mrow":[{"mi":"tan","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mn":"2","mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"h","mo":"-","msub":{"mi":["H","MS"]}}}}}},{"mo":"-","mn":"1"}]}}}],"mo":["-","+"]}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"Equation","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mn":"10"}}}]}}}}},"However, a substantial difficulty with the two-ray model in practice is that it requires a substantial amount of data regarding building dimensions, geometries, street widths, antenna gain characteristics for every possible ray path, etc. Additionally, it requires an inordinate amount of computational resources and such a model is not easily updated or maintained.","Unfortunately, in practice clutter geometries and building heights are random. Moreover, data of sufficient detail has been extremely difficult to acquire, and regression standard fit errors are poor; i.e., in the general case, these errors were found to be 40-60 dB. Thus the two-ray model approach, although sometimes providing an improvement over single ray techniques, still did not predict RF signal characteristics in the general case to level of accuracy desired (<10 dB).","Work by Greenstein has since developed from the perspective of measurement-based regression models, as opposed to the previous approach of predicting-first, then performing measurement comparisons. Apparently yielding to the fact that low-power, low antenna (e.g., 12-25 feet above ground) height PCS microcell coverage was insufficient in urban buildings, Greenstein, et al, authored \u201cPerformance Evaluations for Urban Line-of-sight Microcells Using a Multi-ray Propagation Model\u201d, in IEEE Globecom Proceedings, 12\/91. This paper proposed the idea of formulating regressions based on field measurements using small PCS microcells in a lineal microcell geometry (i.e., geometries in which there is always a line-of-sight (LOS) path between a subscriber's mobile and its current microsite).","Additionally, Greenstein studied the communication channels variable Bit-Error-Rate (BER) in a spatial domain, which was a departure from previous research that limited field measurements to the RF propagation channel signal strength alone. However, Greenstein based his finding on two suspicious assumptions: 1) he assumed that distance correlation estimates were identical for uplink and downlink transmission paths; and 2) modulation techniques would be transparent in terms of improved distance correlation conclusions. Although some data held very correlations, other data and environments produced poor results. Accordingly, his results appear unreliable for use in general location context.","In 1993 Greenstein, et al, authored \u201cA Measurement-Based Model for Predicting Coverage Areas of Urban Microcells\u201d, in the IEEE Journal On Selected Areas in Communications, Vol. II, No. 7, 9\/93. Greenstein reported a generic measurement-based model of RF attenuation in terms of constant-value contours surrounding a given low-power, low antenna microcell environment in a dense, rectilinear neighborhood, such as New York City. However, these contours were for the cellular frequency band. In this case, LOS and non-LOS clutter were considered for a given microcell site. A result of this analysis was that RF propagation losses (or attenuations), when cell antenna heights were relatively low, provided attenuation contours resembling a spline plane curve depicted as an asteroid, aligned with major street grid patterns. Further, Greenstein found that convex diamond-shaped RF propagation loss contours were a common occurrence in field measurements in a rectilinear urban area. The special plane curve asteroid is represented by the formula x+y=r. However, these results alone have not been sufficiently robust and general to accurately locate an MS, due to the variable nature of urban clutter spatial arrangements.","At Telesis Technology in 1994 Howard Xia, et al, authored \u201cMicrocellular Propagation Characteristics for Personal Communications in Urban and Suburban Environments\u201d, in IEEE Transactions of Vehicular Technology, Vol. 43, No. 3, 8\/94, which performed measurements specifically in the PCS 1.8 to 1.9 GHz frequency band. Xia found corresponding but more variable outcome results in San Francisco, Oakland (urban) and the Sunset and Mission Districts (suburban).","Summary of Factors Affecting RF Propagation","The physical radio propagation channel perturbs signal strength, frequency (causing rate changes, phase delay, signal to noise ratios (e.g., C\/I for the analog case, or E, RF energy per bit, over average noise density ratio for the digital case) and Doppler-shift. Signal strength is usually characterized by:\n\n","Loss due to slow fading includes shadowing due to clutter blockage (sometimes included in Lp). Fast fading is composed of multipath reflections which cause: 1) delay spread; 2) random phase shift or Rayleigh fading; and 3) random frequency modulation due to different Doppler shifts on different paths.","Summing the path loss and the two fading margin loss components from the above yields a total path loss of:\n\n\n\nReferring to , the figure illustrates key components of a typical cellular and PCS power budget design process. The cell designer increases the transmitted power Pby the shadow fading margin Lwhich is usually chosen to be within the 1-2 percentile of the slow fading probability density function (PDF) to minimize the probability of unsatisfactorily low received power level Pat the receiver. The Plevel must have enough signal to noise energy level (e.g., 10 dB) to overcome the receiver's internal noise level (e.g., \u2212118 dBm in the case of cellular 0.9 GHz), for a minimum voice quality standard. Thus in the example Pmust never be below \u2212108 dBm, in order to maintain the quality standard.\n","Additionally the short term fast signal fading due to multipath propagation is taken into account by deploying fast fading margin L, which is typically also chosen to be a few percentiles of the fast fading distribution. The 1 to 2 percentiles compliment other network blockage guidelines. For example the cell base station traffic loading capacity and network transport facilities are usually designed for a 1-2 percentile blockage factor as well. However, in the worst-case scenario both fading margins are simultaneously exceeded, thus causing a fading margin overload.","In Roy, Steele's, text, Mobile Radio Communications, IEEE Press, 1992, estimates for a GSM system operating in the 1.8 GHz band with a transmitter antenna height of 6.4 m and an MS receiver antenna height of 2 m, and assumptions regarding total path loss, transmitter power would be calculated as follows:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0056"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE I"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"GSM Power Budget Example"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"84pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Parameter","dBm value","Will require"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"84pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"L","14",{}]},{"entry":[{},"L","7"]},{"entry":[{},"LI","110"]},{"entry":[{},"Min.

In general, the definitions here are also defined elsewhere in this document as well.","(3.1) The term \u201cwireless\u201d herein is, in general, an abbreviation for \u201cdigital wireless\u201d, and in particular, \u201cwireless\u201d refers to digital radio signaling using one of standard digital protocols such as CDMA, NAMPS, AMPS, TDMA and GSM, as one skilled in the art will understand.\n\n(3.2) As used herein, the term \u201cmobile station\u201d (equivalently, MS) refers to a wireless device that is at least a transmitting device, and in most cases is also a wireless receiving device, such as a portable radio telephony handset. Note that in some contexts herein instead or in addition to MS, the following terms are also used: \u201cpersonal station\u201d (PS), and \u201clocation unit\u201d (LU). In general, these terms may be considered synonymous. However, the later two terms may be used when referring to reduced functionality communication devices in comparison to a typical digital wireless mobile telephone.\n\n(3.3) The term, \u201cinfrastructure\u201d, denotes the network of telephony communication services, and more particularly, that portion of such a network that receives and processes wireless communications with wireless mobile stations. In particular, this infrastructure includes telephony wireless base stations (BS) such as those for radio mobile communication systems based on CDMA, AMPS, NAMPS, TDMA, and GSM wherein the base stations provide a network of cooperative communication channels with an air interface with the MS, and a conventional telecommunications interface with a Mobile Switch Center (MSC). Thus, an MS user within an area serviced by the base stations may be provided with wireless communication throughout the area by user transparent communication transfers (i.e., \u201chandoffs\u201d) between the user's MS and these base stations in order to maintain effective telephony service. The mobile switch center (MSC) provides communications and control connectivity among base stations and the public telephone network .\n\n(3.4) The phrase, \u201ccomposite wireless signal characteristic values\u201d denotes the result of aggregating and filtering a collection of measurements of wireless signal samples, wherein these samples are obtained from the wireless communication between an MS to be located and the base station infrastructure (e.g., a plurality of networked base stations). However, other phrases are also used herein to denote this collection of derived characteristic values depending on the context and the likely orientation of the reader. For example, when viewing these values from a wireless signal processing perspective of radio engineering, as in the descriptions of the subsequent Detailed Description sections concerned with the aspects of the present invention for receiving MS signal measurements from the base station infrastructure, the phrase typically used is: \u201cRF signal measurements\u201d. Alternatively, from a data processing perspective, the phrases: \u201clocation signature cluster\u201d and \u201clocation signal data\u201d are used to describe signal characteristic values between the MS and the plurality of infrastructure base stations substantially simultaneously detecting MS transmissions. Moreover, since the location communications between an MS and the base station infrastructure typically include simultaneous communications with more than one base station, a related useful notion is that of a \u201clocation signature\u201d which is the composite wireless signal characteristic values for signal samples between an MS to be located and a single base station. Also, in some contexts, the phrases: \u201csignal characteristic values\u201d or \u201csignal characteristic data\u201d are used when either or both a location signature(s) and\/or a location signature cluster(s) are intended.\n","The present invention relates to a wireless mobile station location system, and in particular, various subsystems related thereto such as a wireless location gateway, and the combining or hybriding of a plurality of wireless location techniques.","Regarding a wireless location gateway, this term refers to a communications network node whereat a plurality of location requests are received for locating various mobile stations from various sources (e.g., for E911 requests, for stolen vehicle location, for tracking of vehicles traveling cross country, etc.), and for each such request and the corresponding mobile station to be located, this node: (a) activates one or more wireless location estimators for locating the mobile station, (b) receives one or more location estimates of the mobile station from the location estimators, and (c) transmits a resulting location estimate(s) to, e.g., an application which made the request. Moreover, such a gateway typically will likely activate location estimators according to the particulars of each individual wireless location request, e.g., the availability of input data needed by particular location estimators. Additionally, such a gateway will typically have sufficiently well defined uniform interfaces so that such location estimators can be added and\/or deleted to, e.g., provide different location estimators for performing wireless location different coverage areas.","The present invention encompasses such wireless location gateways. Thus, for locating an identified mobile station, the location gateway embodiments of the present invention may activate one or more of a plurality of location estimators depending on, e.g., (a) the availability of particular types of wireless location data for locating the mobile station, and (b) the location estimators accessible by the location gateway. Moreover, a plurality of location estimators may be activated for locating the mobile station in a single location, or different ones of such location estimators may be activated to locate the mobile station at different locations. Moreover, the location gateway of the present invention may have incorporated therein one or more of the location estimators, and\/or may access geographically distributed location estimators via requests through a communications network such as the Internet.","In particular, the location gateway of the present invention may access, in various instances of locating mobile stations, various location estimators that utilize one or more of the following wireless location techniques:\n\n","Accordingly, some embodiments of the present invention may be viewed as platforms for integrating wireless location techniques in that wireless location computational models (denoted \u201cfirst order models\u201d or \u201cFOMs\u201d hereinbelow) may be added and\/or deleted from such embodiments of the invention without changing the interface to further downstream processes. That is, one aspect of the invention is the specification of a common data interface between such computational models and subsequent location processing such as processes for combining of location estimates, tracking mobile stations, and\/or outputting location estimates to location requesting applications.","Moreover, it should be noted that the present invention also encompasses various hybrid approaches to wireless location, wherein various combinations of two or more of the location techniques (a) through (g) immediately above may be used in locating a mobile station at substantially a single location. Thus, location information may be obtained from a plurality of the above location techniques for locating a mobile station, and the output from such techniques can be synergistically used for deriving therefrom an enhanced location estimate of the mobile station.","It is a further aspect of the present invention that it may be used to wirelessly locate a mobile station: (a) from which a 911 emergency call is performed, (b) for tracking a mobile station (e.g., a truck traveling across country), (c) for routing a mobile station, and (d) locating people and\/or animals, including applications for confinement to (and\/or exclusion from) certain areas.","It is a further aspect of the present invention that it may be decomposed into: (i) a first low level wireless signal processing subsystem for receiving, organizing and conditioning low level wireless signal measurements from a network of base stations cooperatively linked for providing wireless communications with mobile stations (MSs); and (ii) a second high level signal processing subsystem for performing high level data processing for providing most likelihood location estimates for mobile stations.","Thus, the present invention may be considered as a novel signal processor that includes at least the functionality for the high signal processing subsystem mentioned hereinabove. Accordingly, assuming an appropriate ensemble of wireless signal measurements characterizing the wireless signal communications between a particular MS and a networked wireless base station infrastructure have been received and appropriately filtered of noise and transitory values (such as by an embodiment of the low level signal processing subsystem disclosed in a copending PCT patent application PCT\/US97\/15933 titled, \u201cWireless Location Using A Plurality of Commercial Network Infrastructures,\u201d by F. W. LeBlanc et al., filed Sep. 8, 1997 from which U.S. Pat. No. 6,236,365, filed Jul. 8, 1999 is the U.S. national counterpart; these two references being herein fully incorporated by reference), the present invention uses the output from such a low level signal processing system for determining a most likely location estimate of an MS.","That is, once the following steps are appropriately performed (e.g., by the LeBlanc U.S. Pat. No. 6,236,365):\n\n","Referring now to (4.3) above, the filtered and aggregated wireless signal characteristic values are provided to a number of location hypothesizing models (denoted First Order Models, or FOMs), each of which yields a location estimate or location hypothesis related to the location of the target MS. In particular, there are location hypotheses for both providing estimates of where the target MS is likely to be and where the target MS is not likely to be. Moreover, it is an aspect of the present invention that confidence values of the location hypotheses are provided as a continuous range of real numbers from, e.g., \u22121 to 1, wherein the most unlikely areas for locating the target MS are given a confidence value of \u22121, and the most likely areas for locating the target MS are given a confidence value of 1. That is, confidence values that are larger indicate a higher likelihood that the target MS is in the corresponding MS estimated area, wherein \u22121 indicates that the target MS is absolutely NOT in the estimated area, 0 indicates a substantially neutral or unknown likelihood of the target MS being in the corresponding estimated area, and 1 indicates that the target MS is absolutely within the corresponding estimated area.","Referring to (4.4) above, it is an aspect of the present invention to provide location hypothesis enhancing and evaluation techniques that can adjust target MS location estimates according to historical MS location data and\/or adjust the confidence values of location hypotheses according to how consistent the corresponding target MS location estimate is: (a) with historical MS signal characteristic values, (b) with various physical constraints, and (c) with various heuristics. In particular, the following capabilities are provided by the present invention:\n\n","As also mentioned above in (2.3), the present invention utilizes adaptive signal processing techniques. One particularly important utilization of such techniques includes the automatic tuning of the present invention so that, e.g., such tuning can be applied to adjusting the values of location processing system parameters that affect the processing performed by the present invention. For example, such system parameters as those used for determining the size of a geographical area to be specified when retrieving location signal data of known MS locations from the historical (location signature) data base can substantially affect the location processing. In particular, a system parameter specifying a minimum size for such a geographical area may, if too large, cause unnecessary inaccuracies in locating an MS. Accordingly, to accomplish a tuning of such system parameters, an adaptation engine is included in the present invention for automatically adjusting or tuning parameters used by the present invention. Note that in one embodiment, the adaptation engine is based on genetic algorithm techniques.","A novel aspect of the present invention relies on the discovery that in many areas where MS location services are desired, the wireless signal measurements obtained from communications between the target MS and the base station infrastructure are extensive enough to provide sufficiently unique or peculiar values so that the pattern of values alone may identify the location of the target MS. Further, assuming a sufficient amount of such location identifying pattern information is captured in the composite wireless signal characteristic values for a target MS, and that there is a technique for matching such wireless signal patterns to geographical locations, then a FOM based on this technique may generate a reasonably accurate target MS location estimate. Moreover, if the present invention (e.g., the location signature data base) has captured sufficient wireless signal data from location communications between MSs and the base station infrastructure wherein the locations of the MSs are also verified and captured, then this captured data (e.g., location signatures) can be used to train or calibrate such models to associate the location of a target MS with the distinctive signal characteristics between the target MS and one or more base stations. Accordingly, the present invention includes one or more FOMs that may be generally denoted as classification models wherein such FOMs are trained or calibrated to associate particular composite wireless signal characteristic values with a geographical location where a target MS could likely generate the wireless signal samples from which the composite wireless signal characteristic values are derived. Further, the present invention includes the capability for training (calibrating) and retraining (recalibrating) such classification FOMs to automatically maintain the accuracy of these models even though substantial changes to the radio coverage area may occur, such as the construction of a new high rise building or seasonal variations (due to, for example, foliage variations).","Note that such classification FOMs that are trained or calibrated to identify target MS locations by the wireless signal patterns produced constitute a particularly novel aspect of the present invention. It is well known in the wireless telephony art that the phenomenon of signal multipath and shadow fading renders most analytical location computational techniques such as time-of-arrival (TOA) or time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) substantially useless in urban areas and particularly in dense urban areas. However, this same multipath phenomenon also may produce substantially distinct or peculiar signal measurement patterns, wherein such a pattern coincides with a relatively small geographical area. Thus, the present invention utilizes multipath as an advantage for increasing accuracy where for previous location systems multipath has been a source of substantial inaccuracies. Moreover, it is worthwhile to note that the utilization of classification FOMs in high multipath environments is especially advantageous in that high multipath environments are typically densely populated. Thus, since such environments are also capable of yielding a greater density of MS location signal data from MSs whose actual locations can be obtained, there can be a substantial amount of training or calibration data captured by the present invention for training or calibrating such classification FOMs and for progressively improving the MS location accuracy of such models. Moreover, since it is also a related aspect of the present invention to include a plurality stationary, low cost, low power \u201clocation detection base stations\u201d (LBS), each having both restricted range MS detection capabilities and a built-in MS, a grid of such LBSs can be utilized for providing location signal data (from the built-in MS) for (re)training or (re)calibrating such classification FOMs.","In one embodiment of the present invention, one or more classification FOMs may each include a learning module such as an artificial neural network (ANN) for associating target MS location signal data with a target MS location estimate. Additionally, one or more classification FOMs may be statistical prediction models based on such statistical techniques as, for example, principle decomposition, partial least squares, or other regression techniques.","It is a further aspect of the present invention that the personal communication system (PCS) infrastructures currently being developed by telecommunication providers offer an appropriate localized infrastructure base upon which to build various personal location systems (PLS) employing the present invention and\/or utilizing the techniques disclosed herein. In particular, the present invention is especially suitable for the location of people and\/or objects using code division multiple access (CDMA) wireless infrastructures, although other wireless infrastructures, such as, time division multiple access (TDMA) infrastructures and GSM are also contemplated. Note that CDMA personal communications systems are described in the Telephone Industries Association standard IS-95, for frequencies below 1 GHz, and in the Wideband Spread-Spectrum Digital Cellular System Dual-Mode Mobile Station-Base Station Compatibility Standard, for frequencies in the 1.8-1.9 GHz frequency bands, both of which are incorporated herein by reference. Furthermore, CDMA general principles have also been described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,109,390, to Gilhausen, et al, filed Nov. 7, 1989, and CDMA Network Engineering Handbook by Qualcomm, Inc., each of which is also incorporated herein by reference.","Notwithstanding the above mentioned CDMA references, a brief introduction of CDMA is given here. Briefly, CDMA is an electromagnetic signal modulation and multiple access scheme based on spread spectrum communication. Each CDMA signal corresponds to an unambiguous pseudorandom binary sequence for modulating the carrier signal throughout a predetermined spectrum of bandwidth frequencies. Transmissions of individual CDMA signals are selected by correlation processing of a pseudonoise waveform. In particular, the CDMA signals are separately detected in a receiver by using a correlator, which accepts only signal energy from the selected binary sequence and despreads its spectrum. Thus, when a first CDMA signal is transmitted, the transmissions of unrelated COMA signals correspond to pseudorandom sequences that do not match the first signal. Therefore, these other signals contribute only to the noise and represent a self-interference generated by the personal communications system.","As mentioned in the discussion of classification FOMs above, the present invention can substantially automatically retrain and\/or recalibrate itself to compensate for variations in wireless signal characteristics (e.g., multipath) due to environmental and\/or topographic changes to a geographic area serviced by the present invention. For example, in one embodiment, the present invention optionally includes low cost, low power base stations, denoted location base stations (LBS) above, providing, for example, CDMA pilot channels to a very limited area about each such LBS. The location base stations may provide limited voice traffic capabilities, but each is capable of gathering sufficient wireless signal characteristics from an MS within the location base station's range to facilitate locating the MS. Thus, by positioning the location base stations at known locations in a geographic region such as, for instance, on street lamp poles and road signs, additional MS location accuracy can be obtained. That is, due to the low power signal output by such location base stations, for there to be signaling control communication (e.g., pilot signaling and other control signals) between a location base station and a target MS, the MS must be relatively near the location base station. Additionally, for each location base station not in communication with the target MS, it is likely that the MS is not near to this location base station. Thus, by utilizing information received from both location base stations in communication with the target MS and those that are not in communication with the target MS, the present invention can substantially narrow the possible geographic areas within which the target MS is likely to be. Further, by providing each location base station (LBS) with a co-located stationary wireless transceiver (denoted a built-in MS above) having similar functionality to an MS, the following advantages are provided:","(6.1) assuming that the co-located base station capabilities and the stationary transceiver of an LBS are such that the base station capabilities and the stationary transceiver communicate with one another, the stationary transceiver can be signaled by another component(s) of the present invention to activate or deactivate its associated base station capability, thereby conserving power for the LBS that operate on a restricted power such as solar electrical power;\n\n(6.2) the stationary transceiver of an LBS can be used for transferring target MS location information obtained by the LBS to a conventional telephony base station;\n\n(6.3) since the location of each LBS is known and can be used in location processing, the present invention is able to (re)train and\/or (re)calibrate itself in geographical areas having such LBSs. That is, by activating each LBS stationary transceiver so that there is signal communication between the stationary transceiver and surrounding base stations within range, wireless signal characteristic values for the location of the stationary transceiver are obtained for each such base station. Accordingly, such characteristic values can then be associated with the known location of the stationary transceiver for training and\/or calibrating various of the location processing modules of the present invention such as the classification FOMs discussed above. In particular, such training and\/or calibrating may include:\n\n","It is also an aspect of the present invention to automatically (re)calibrate as in (6.3) above with signal characteristics from other known or verified locations. In one embodiment of the present invention, portable location verifying electronics are provided so that when such electronics are sufficiently near a located target MS, the electronics: (i) detect the proximity of the target MS; (ii) determine a highly reliable measurement of the location of the target MS; (iii) provide this measurement to other location determining components of the present invention so that the location measurement can be associated and archived with related signal characteristic data received from the target MS at the location where the location measurement is performed. Thus, the use of such portable location verifying electronics allows the present invention to capture and utilize signal characteristic data from verified, substantially random locations for location system calibration as in (6.3) above. Moreover, it is important to note that such location verifying electronics can verify locations automatically wherein it is unnecessary for manual activation of a location verifying process.","One embodiment of the present invention includes the location verifying electronics as a \u201cmobile (location) base station\u201d (MBS) that can be, for example, incorporated into a vehicle, such as an ambulance, police car, or taxi. Such a vehicle can travel to sites having a transmitting target MS, wherein such sites may be randomly located and the signal characteristic data from the transmitting target MS at such a location can consequently be archived with a verified location measurement performed at the site by the mobile location base station. Moreover, it is important to note that such a mobile location base station as its name implies also includes base station electronics for communicating with mobile stations, though not necessarily in the manner of a conventional infrastructure base station. In particular, a mobile location base station may only monitor signal characteristics, such as MS signal strength, from a target MS without transmitting signals to the target MS. Alternatively, a mobile location base station can periodically be in bi-directional communication with a target MS for determining a signal time-of-arrival (or time-difference-of-arrival) measurement between the mobile location base station and the target MS. Additionally, each such mobile location base station includes components for estimating the location of the mobile location base station, such mobile location base station location estimates being important when the mobile location base station is used for locating a target MS via, for example, time-of-arrival or time-difference-of-arrival measurements as one skilled in the art will appreciate. In particular, a mobile location base station can include:","(7.1) a mobile station (MS) for both communicating with other components of the present invention (such as a location processing center included in the present invention);","(7.2) a GPS receiver for determining a location of the mobile location base station;","(73) a gyroscope and other dead reckoning devices; and","(7.4) devices for operator manual entry of a mobile location base station location.","Furthermore, a mobile location base station includes modules for integrating or reconciling distinct mobile location base station location estimates that, for example, can be obtained using the components and devices of (7.1) through (7.4) above. That is, location estimates for the mobile location base station may be obtained from: GPS satellite data, mobile location base station data provided by the location processing center, deadreckoning data obtained from the mobile location base station vehicle deadreckoning devices, and location data manually input by an operator of the mobile location base station.","Moreover, there are numerous additional advantages of the system of the present invention when applied in CDMA communication systems. The location system of the present invention readily benefits from the distinct advantages of the CDMA spread spectrum scheme, namely, these advantages include the exploitation of radio frequency spectral efficiency and isolation by (a) monitoring voice activity, (b) management of two-way power control, (c) provisioning of advanced variable-rate modems and error correcting signal encoding, (d) inherent resistance to fading, (e) enhanced privacy, and (f) multiple \u201crake\u201d digital data receivers and searcher receivers for correlation of signal multipaths.","At a more general level, it is an aspect of the present invention to demonstrate the utilization of various novel computational paradigms such as:","(8.1) providing a multiple hypothesis computational architecture (as illustrated best in ) wherein the hypotheses are:","(8.1.1) generated by modular independent hypothesizing computational models;","(8.1.2) the models are embedded in the computational architecture in a manner wherein the architecture allows for substantial amounts of application specific processing common or generic to a plurality of the models to be straightforwardly incorporated into the computational architecture;","(8.1.3) the computational architecture enhances the hypotheses generated by the models both according to past performance of the models and according to application specific constraints and heuristics without requiring feedback loops for adjusting the models;","(8.1.4) the models are relatively easily integrated into, modified and extracted from the computational architecture;","(8.2) providing a computational paradigm for enhancing an initial estimated solution to a problem by using this initial estimated solution as, effectively, a query or index into an historical data base of previous solution estimates and corresponding actual solutions for deriving an enhanced solution estimate based on past performance of the module that generated the initial estimated solution.","Note that the multiple hypothesis architecture provided herein is useful in implementing solutions in a wide range of applications. For example, the following additional applications are within the scope of the present invention: (9.1) document scanning applications for transforming physical documents in to electronic forms of the documents. Note that in many cases the scanning of certain documents (books, publications, etc.) may have a 20% character recognition error rate. Thus, the novel computation architecture of the present invention can be utilized by (I) providing a plurality of document scanning models as the first order models, (ii) building a character recognition data base for archiving a correspondence between characteristics of actual printed character variations and the intended characters (according to, for example, font types), and additionally archiving a correspondence of performance of each of the models on previously encountered actual printed character variations (note, this is analogous to the Signature Data Base of the MS location application described herein), and (iii) determining any generic constraints and\/or heuristics that are desirable to be satisfied by a plurality of the models. Accordingly, by comparing outputs from the first order document scanning models, a determination can be made as to whether further processing is desirable due to, for example, discrepancies between the output of the models. If further processing is desirable, then an embodiment of the multiple hypothesis architecture provided herein may be utilized to correct such discrepancies. Note that in comparing outputs from the first order document scanning models, these outputs may be compared at various granularities; e.g., character, sentence, paragraph or page;","(9.2) diagnosis and monitoring applications such as medical diagnosis\/monitoring, communication network diagnosis\/monitoring;","(9.3) robotics applications such as scene and\/or object recognition;","(9.4) seismic and\/or geologic signal processing applications such as for locating oil and gas deposits;","(9.5) Additionally, note that this architecture need not have all modules co-located. In particular, it is an additional aspect of the present invention that various modules can be remotely located from one another and communicate with one another via telecommunication transmissions such as telephony technologies and\/or the Internet. Accordingly, the present invention is particularly adaptable to such distributed computing environments. For example, some number of the first order models may reside in remote locations and communicate their generated hypotheses via the Internet.","For instance, in weather prediction applications it is not uncommon for computational models to require large amounts of computational resources. Thus, such models running at various remote computational facilities can transfer weather prediction hypotheses (e.g., the likely path of a hurricane) to a site that performs hypothesis adjustments according to: (i) past performance of the each model; (ii) particular constraints and\/or heuristics, and subsequently outputs a most likely estimate for a particular weather condition.","In an alternative embodiment of the present invention, the processing following the generation of location hypotheses (each having an initial location estimate) by the first order models may be such that this processing can be provided on Internet user nodes and the first order models may reside at Internet server sites. In this configuration, an Internet user may request hypotheses from such remote first order models and perform the remaining processing at his\/her node.","In other embodiments of the present invention, a fast, albeit less accurate location estimate may be initially performed for very time critical location applications where approximate location information may be required. For example, less than 1 second response for a mobile station location embodiment of the present invention may be desired for 911 emergency response location requests. Subsequently, once a relatively coarse location estimate has been provided, a more accurate most likely location estimate can be performed by repeating the location estimation processing a second time with, e.g., additional with, measurements of wireless signals transmitted between a mobile station to be located and a network of base stations with which the mobile station is communicating, thus providing a second, more accurate location estimate of the mobile station.","Additionally, note that it is within the scope of the present invention to provide one or more central location development sites that may be networked to, for example, geographically dispersed location centers providing location services according to the present invention, wherein the FOMs may be accessed, substituted, enhanced or removed dynamically via network connections (via, e.g., the Internet) with a central location development site. Thus, a small but rapidly growing municipality in substantially flat low density area might initially be provided with access to, for example, two or three FOMs for generating location hypotheses in the municipality's relatively uncluttered radio signaling environment. However, as the population density increases and the radio signaling environment becomes cluttered by, for example, thermal noise and multipath, additional or alternative FOMs may be transferred via the network to the location center for the municipality.","Note that in some embodiments of the present invention, since there is a lack of sequencing between the FOMs and subsequent processing of location hypotheses, the FOMs can be incorporated into an expert system, if desired. For example, each FOM may be activated from an antecedent of an expert system rule. Thus, the antecedent for such a rule can evaluate to TRUE if the FOM outputs a location hypothesis, and the consequent portion of such a rule may put the output location hypothesis on a list of location hypotheses occurring in a particular time window for subsequent processing by the location center. Alternatively, activation of the FOMs may be in the consequents of such expert system rules. That is, the antecedent of such an expert system rule may determine if the conditions are appropriate for invoking the FOM(s) in the rule's consequent.","Of course, other software architectures may also be used in implementing the processing of the location center without departing from scope of the present invention. In particular, object-oriented architectures are also within the scope of the present invention. For example, the FOMs may be object methods on an MS location estimator object, wherein the estimator object receives substantially all target MS location signal data output by the signal filtering subsystem. Alternatively, software bus architectures are contemplated by the present invention, as one skilled in the art will understand, wherein the software architecture may be modular and facilitate parallel processing.","Further features and advantages of the present invention are provided by the figures and detailed description accompanying this invention summary.","Various digital wireless communication standards have been introduced such as Advanced Mobile Phone Service (AMPS), Narrowband Advanced Mobile Phone Service (NAMPS), code division multiple access (CDMA) and Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) (e.g., Global Systems Mobile (GSM). These standards provide numerous enhancements for advancing the quality and communication capacity for wireless applications. Referring to CDMA, this standard is described in the Telephone Industries Association standard IS-95, for frequencies below 1 GHz, and in J-STD-008, the Wideband Spread-Spectrum Digital Cellular System Dual-Mode Mobile Station-Base station Compatibility Standard, for frequencies in the 1.8-1.9 GHz frequency bands. Additionally, CDMA general principles have been described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,109,390, Diversity Receiver in a CDMA Cellular Telephone System by Gilhousen. There are numerous advantages of such digital wireless technologies such as CDMA radio technology. For example, the CDMA spread spectrum scheme exploits radio frequency spectral efficiency and isolation by monitoring voice activity, managing two-way power control, provision of advanced variable-rate modems and error correcting signal design, and includes inherent resistance to fading, enhanced privacy, and provides for multiple \u201crake\u201d digital data receivers and searcher receivers for correlation of multiple physical propagation paths, resembling maximum likelihood detection, as well as support for multiple base station communication with a mobile station, i.e., soft or softer hand-off capability. When coupled with a location center as described herein, substantial improvements in radio location can be achieved. For example, the CDMA spread spectrum scheme exploits radio frequency spectral efficiency and isolation by monitoring voice activity, managing two-way power control, provision of advanced variable-rate modems and error correcting signal design, and includes inherent resistance to fading, enhanced privacy, and provides for multiple \u201crake\u201d digital data receivers and searcher receivers for correlation of multiple physical propagation paths, resembling maximum likelihood detection, as well as support for multiple base station communication with a mobile station, i.e., soft hand-off capability. Moreover, this same advanced radio communication infrastructure can also be used for enhanced radio location. As a further example, the capabilities of IS-41 and AIN already provide a broad-granularity of wireless location, as is necessary to, for example, properly direct a terminating call to an MS. Such information, originally intended for call processing usage, can be re-used in conjunction with the location center described herein to provide wireless location in the large (i.e., to determine which country, state and city a particular MS is located) and wireless location in the small (i.e., which location, plus or minus a few hundred feet within one or more base stations a given MS is located).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0119","num":"0160"},"figref":"FIG. 4","ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0020","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0020-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0021","list-style":"none"},"li":["(a) a (large) plurality of conventional wireless mobile stations (MSs)  for at least one of voice related communication, visual (e.g., text) related communication, and according to present invention, location related communication;","(b) a mobile switching center (MSC) ;","(c) a plurality of wireless cell sites in a radio coverage area , wherein each cell site includes an infrastructure base station such as those labeled  (or variations thereof such as A-D). In particular, the base stations  denote the standard high traffic, fixed location base stations used for voice and data communication with a plurality of MSs , and, according to the present invention, also used for communication of information related to locating such MSs . Additionally, note that the base stations labeled  are more directly related to wireless location enablement. For example, as described in greater detail hereinbelow, the base stations  may be low cost, low functionality transponders that are used primarily in communicating MS location related information to the location center  (via base stations  and the MSC ).

Although base stations may be placed in any configuration, a typical deployment configuration is approximately in a cellular honeycomb pattern, although many practical tradeoffs exist, such as site availability, versus the requirement for maximal terrain coverage area. To illustrate, three such exemplary base stations (BSs) are A, B and C, each of which radiate referencing signals within their area of coverage  to facilitate mobile station (MS)  radio frequency connectivity, and various timing and synchronization functions. Note that some base stations may contain no sectors  (e.g. E), thus radiating and receiving signals in a 360 degree omnidirectional coverage area pattern, or the base station may contain \u201csmart antennas\u201d which have specialized coverage area patterns. However, the generally most frequent base stations  have three sector  coverage area patterns. For example, base station A includes sectors , additionally labeled a, b and c. Accordingly, each of the sectors  radiate and receive signals in an approximate 120 degree arc, from an overhead view. As one skilled in the art will understand, actual base station coverage areas  (stylistically represented by hexagons about the base stations ) generally are designed to overlap to some extent, thus ensuring seamless coverage in a geographical area. Control electronics within each base station  are used to communicate with a mobile stations . Information regarding the coverage area for each sector , such as its range, area, and \u201choles\u201d or areas of no coverage (within the radio coverage area ), may be known and used by the location center  to facilitate location determination. Further, during communication with a mobile station , the identification of each base station  communicating with the MS  as well, as any sector identification information, may be known and provided to the location center .","In the case of the base station types , , and  communication of location information, a base station or mobility controller  (BSC) controls, processes and provides an interface between originating and terminating telephone calls from\/to mobile station (MS) , and the mobile switch center (MSC) . The MSC , on-the-other-hand, performs various administration to functions such as mobile station  registration, authentication and the relaying of various system parameters, as one skilled in the art will understand.","The base stations  may be coupled by various transport facilities  such as leased lines, frame relay, T-Carrier links, optical fiber links or by microwave communication links.","When a mobile station  (such as a CDMA, AMPS, NAMPS mobile telephone) is powered on and in the idle state, it constantly monitors the pilot signal transmissions from each of the base stations  located at nearby cell sites. Since base station\/sector coverage areas may often overlap, such overlapping enables mobile stations  to detect, and, in the case of certain wireless technologies, communicate simultaneously along both the forward and reverse paths, with multiple base stations  and\/or sectors . In  the constantly radiating pilot signals from base station sectors , such as sectors a, b and c of BS A, are detectable by mobile stations  within the coverage area  for BS A. That is, the mobile stations  scan for pilot channels, corresponding to a given base station\/sector identifiers (IDs), for determining which coverage area  (i.e., cell) it is contained. This is performed by comparing signals strengths of pilot signals transmitted from these particular cell-sites.","The mobile station  then initiates a registration request with the MSC , via the base station controller . The MSC  determines whether or not the mobile station  is allowed to proceed with the registration process (except in the case of a 911 call, wherein no registration process is required). At this point calls may be originated from the mobile station  or calls or short message service messages can be received from the network. The MSC  communicates as appropriate, with a class 4\/5 wireline telephony circuit switch or other central offices, connected to the PSTN  network. Such central offices connect to wireline terminals, such as telephones, or any communication device compatible with the line. The PSTN  may also provide connections to long distance networks and other networks.","The MSC  may also utilize IS\/41 data circuits or trunks connecting to signal transfer point , which in turn connects to a service control point , via Signaling System #7 (SS7) signaling links (e.g., trunks) for intelligent call processing, as one skilled in the art will understand. In the case of wireless AIN services such links are used for call routing instructions of calls interacting with the MSC  or any switch capable of providing service switching point functions, and the public switched telephone network (PSTN) , with possible termination back to the wireless network.","Referring to  again, the location center (LC)  interfaces with the MSC  either via dedicated transport facilities , using for example, any number of LAN\/WAN technologies, such as Ethernet, fast Ethernet, frame relay, virtual private networks, etc., or via the PSTN . The LC  receives autonomous (e.g., unsolicited) command\/response messages regarding, for example: (a) the state of the wireless network of each service provider, (b) MS  and BS  radio frequency (RF) measurements, (c) any MBSs , (d) location applications requesting MS locations using the location center. Conversely, the LC  provides data and control information to each of the above components in (a)-(d). Additionally, the LC  may provide location information to an MS , via a BS . Moreover, in the case of the use of a mobile base station (MBS) , several communications paths may exist with the LC .","The MBS  acts as a low cost, partially-functional, moving base station, and is, in one embodiment, situated in a vehicle where an operator may engage in MS  searching and tracking activities. In providing these activities using CDMA, the MBS  provides a forward link pilot channel for a target MS , and subsequently receives unique BS pilot strength measurements from the MS . The MBS  also includes a mobile station for data communication with the LC , via a BS . In particular, such data communication includes telemetering the geographic position of the MBS  as well as various RF measurements related to signals received from the target MS . In some embodiments, the MBS  may also utilize multiple-beam fixed antenna array elements and\/or a moveable narrow beam antenna, such as a microwave dish . The antennas for such embodiments may have a known orientation in order to further deduce a radio location of the target MS  with respect to an estimated current location of the MBS . As will be described in more detail herein below, the MBS  may further contain a global positioning system (GPS), distance sensors, deadreckoning electronics, as well as an on-board computing system and display devices for locating both the MBS  itself as well as tracking and locating the target MS . The computing and display provides a means for communicating the position of the target MS  on a map display to an operator of the MBS .","Each location base station (LBS)  is a low cost location device. Each such LBS  communicates with one or more of the infrastructure base stations  using one or more wireless technology interface standards. In some embodiments, to provide such LBS's cost effectively, each LBS  only partially or minimally supports the air-interface standards of the one or more wireless technologies used in communicating with both the BSs  and the MSs . Each LBS , when put in service, is placed at a fixed location, such as at a traffic signal, lamp post, etc., and wherein the location of the LBS may be determined as accurately as, for example, the accuracy of the locations of the infrastructure BSs . Assuming the wireless technology CDMA is used, each BS  uses a time offset of the pilot PN sequence to identify a forward CDMA pilot channel. In one embodiment, each LBS  emits a unique, time-offset pilot PN sequence channel in accordance with the CDMA standard in the RF spectrum designated for BSs , such that the channel does not interfere with neighboring BSs  cell site channels, nor would it interfere with neighboring LBSs . However, as one skilled in the art will understand, time offsets, in CDMA chip sizes, may be re-used within a PCS system, thus providing efficient use of pilot time offset chips, thereby achieving spectrum efficiency. Each LBS  may also contain multiple wireless receivers in order to monitor transmissions from a target MS . Additionally, each LBS  contains mobile station  electronics, thereby allowing the LBS to both be controlled by the LC , and to transmit information to the LC , via at least one neighboring BS .","As mentioned above, when the location of a particular target MS  is desired, the LC  can request location information about the target MS  from, for instance, one or more activated LBSs  in a geographical area of interest. Accordingly, whenever the target MS  is in such an area, or is suspected of being in the area, either upon command from the LC , or in a substantially continuous fashion, the LBS's pilot channel appears to the target MS  as a potential neighboring base station channel, and consequently, is placed, for example, in the CDMA neighboring set, or the CDMA remaining set, of the target MS  (as one familiar with the CDMA standards will understand).","During the normal CDMA pilot search sequence of the mobile station initialization state (in the target MS), the target MS  will, if within range of such an activated LBS , detect the LBS pilot presence during the CDMA pilot channel acquisition substate. Consequently, the target MS  performs RF measurements on the signal from each detected LBS . Similarly, an activated LBS  can perform RF measurements on the wireless signals from the target MS . Accordingly, each LBS  detecting the target MS  may subsequently telemeter back to the LC  measurement results related to signals from\/to the target MS . Moreover, upon command, the target MS  will telemeter back to the LC  its own measurements of the detected LBSs , and consequently, this new location information, in conjunction with location related information received from the BSs , can be used to locate the target MS .","It should be noted that an LBS  will normally deny hand-off requests, since typically the LBS does not require the added complexity of handling voice or traffic bearer channels, although economics and peak traffic load conditions would dictate preference here. GPS timing information, needed by any CDMA base station, is either achieved via the inclusion of a local GPS receiver or via a telemetry process from a neighboring conventional BS , which contains a GPS receiver and timing information. Since energy requirements are minimal in such an LBS , (rechargeable) batteries or solar cells may be used to power the LBS. No expensive terrestrial transport link is typically required since two-way communication is provided by the included MS  (or an electronic variation thereof).","Thus, LBSs  may be placed in numerous locations, such as:\n\n","A location application programming interface or L-API  (see , and including L-API-Loc_APP , L-API-MSC , and L-API-SCP  shown in ), is required between the location center  (LC) and the mobile switch center (MSC) network element type, in order to send and receive various control, signals and data messages. The L-API  should be implemented using a preferably high-capacity physical layer communications interface, such as IEEE standard 802.3 (10 baseT Ethernet), although other physical layer interfaces could be used, such as fiber optic ATM, frame relay, etc. Two forms of API implementation are possible. In the first case the signals control and data messages are realized using the MSC  vendor's native operations messages inherent in the product offering, without any special modifications. In the second case the L-API includes a full suite of commands and messaging content specifically optimized for wireless location purposes, which may require some, although minor development on the part of the MSC vendor.","Signal Processor Description","Referring to , the signal processing subsystem  receives control messages and signal measurements and transmits appropriate control messages to the wireless network via the location applications programming interface referenced earlier, for wireless location purposes. The signal processing subsystem additionally provides various signal identification, conditioning and pre-processing functions, including buffering, signal type classification, signal filtering, message control and routing functions to the location estimate modules.","There can be several combinations of Delay Spread\/Signal Strength sets of measurements made available to the signal processing subsystem . In some cases the mobile station  () may be able to detect up to three or four Pilot Channels representing three to four Base Stations, or as few as one Pilot Channel, depending upon the environment. Similarly, possibly more than one BS  can detect a mobile station  transmitter signal, as evidenced by the provision of cell diversity or soft hand-off in the CDMA standards, and the fact that multiple CMRS base station equipment commonly will overlap coverage areas. For each mobile station  or BS  transmitted signal detected by a receiver group at a station, multiple delayed signals, or \u201cfingers\u201d may be detected and tracked resulting from multipath radio propagation conditions, from a given transmitter.","In typical spread spectrum diversity CDMA receiver design, the \u201cfirst\u201d finger represents the most direct, or least delayed multipath signal. Second or possibly third or fourth fingers may also be detected and tracked, assuming the mobile station contains a sufficient number of data receivers. Although traditional TOA and TDOA methods would discard subsequent fingers related to the same transmitted finger, collection and use of these additional values can prove useful to reduce location ambiguity, and are thus collected by the Signal Processing subsystem in the Location Center .","From the mobile receiver's perspective, a number of combinations of measurements could be made available to the Location Center. Due to the disperse and near-random nature of CDMA radio signals and propagation characteristics, traditional TOA\/TDOA location methods have failed in the past, because the number of signals received in different locations are different. In a particularly small urban area, of say less than 500 square feet, the number of RF signals and their multipath components may vary by over 100 percent.","Due to the large capital outlay costs associated with providing three or more overlapping base station coverage signals in every possible location, most practical digital PCS deployments result in fewer than three base station pilot channels being reportable in the majority of location areas, thus resulting in a larger, more amorphous location estimate. This consequence requires a family of location estimate location modules, each firing whenever suitable data has been presented to a model, thus providing a location estimate to a backend subsystem which resolves ambiguities.","In one embodiment of this invention using backend hypothesis resolution, by utilizing existing knowledge concerning base station coverage area boundaries (such as via the compilation a RF coverage database\u2014either via RF coverage area simulations or field tests), the location error space is decreased. Negative logic Venn diagrams can be generated which deductively rule out certain location estimate hypotheses.","Although the forward link mobile station's received relative signal strength (RRSS) of detected nearby base station transmitter signals can be used directly by the location estimate modules, the CDMA base station's reverse link received relative signal strength (RRSS) of the detected mobile station transmitter signal must be modified prior to location estimate model use, since the mobile station transmitter power level changes nearly continuously, and would thus render relative signal strength useless for location purposes.","One adjustment variable and one factor value are required by the signal processing subsystem in the CDMA air interface case: 1.) instantaneous relative power level in dBm (IRPL) of the mobile station transmitter, and 2.) the mobile station Power Class. By adding the IRPL to the RRSS, a synthetic relative signal strength (SRSS) of the mobile station  signal detected at the BS  is derived, which can be used by location estimate model analysis, as shown below:\n\nSRSS=RRSS+IRPL (in dBm)\n\nSRSS, a corrected indication of the effective path loss in the reverse direction (mobile station to BS), is now comparable with RRSSand can be used to provide a correlation with either distance or shadow fading because it now accounts for the change of the mobile station transmitter's power level. The two signals RRSSand SRSScan now be processed in a variety of ways to achieve a more robust correlation with distance or shadow fading.\n","Although Rayleigh fading appears as a generally random noise generator, essentially destroying the correlation value of either RRSSor SRSSmeasurements with distance individually, several mathematical operations or signal processing functions can be performed on each measurement to derive a more robust relative signal strength value, overcoming the adverse Rayleigh fading effects. Examples include averaging, taking the strongest value and weighting the strongest value with a greater coefficient than the weaker value, then averaging the results. This signal processing technique takes advantage of the fact that although a Rayleigh fade may often exist in either the forward or reverse path, it is much less probable that a Rayleigh fade also exists in the reverse or forward path, respectively. A shadow fade however, similarly affects the signal strength in both paths.","At this point a CDMA radio signal direction independent of \u201cnet relative signal strength measurement\u201d can be derived which can be used to establish a correlation with either distance or shadow fading, or both. Although the ambiguity of either shadow fading or distance cannot be determined, other means can be used in conjunction, such as the fingers of the CDMA delay spread measurement, and any other TOA\/TDOA calculations from other geographical points. In the case of a mobile station with a certain amount of shadow fading between its BS  (), the first finger of a CDMA delay spread signal is most likely to be a relatively shorter duration than the case where the mobile station  and BS  are separated by a greater distance, since shadow fading does not materially affect the arrival time delay of the radio signal.","By performing a small modification in the control electronics of the CDMA base station and mobile station receiver circuitry, it is possible to provide the signal processing subsystem  (reference ) within the location center  () with data that exceed the one-to-one CDMA delay-spread fingers to data receiver correspondence. Such additional information, in the form of additional CDMA fingers (additional multipath) and all associated detectable pilot channels, provides new information which is used to enhance the accuracy of the location center's location estimators.","This enhanced capability is provided via a control message, sent from the location center  to the mobile switch center , and then to the base station(s) in communication with, or in close proximity with, mobile stations  to be located. Two types of location measurement request control messages are needed: one to instruct a target mobile station  (i.e., the mobile station to be located) to telemeter its BS pilot channel measurements back to the primary BS  and from there to the mobile switch center  and then to the location system . The second control message is sent from the location system  to the mobile switch center , then to first the primary BS, instructing the primary BS\u2032 searcher receiver to output (i.e., return to the initiating request message source) the detected target mobile station  transmitter CDMA pilot channel offset signal and their corresponding delay spread finger (peak) values and related relative signal strengths.","The control messages are implemented in standard mobile station  and BS  CDMA receivers such that all data results from the search receiver and multiplexed results from the associated data receivers are available for transmission back to the Location Center . Appropriate value ranges are required regarding mobile station  parameters T_ADD, T_DROP, and the ranges and values for the Active, Neighboring and Remaining Pilot sets registers, held within the mobile station  memory. Further mobile station  receiver details have been discussed above.","In the normal case without any specific multiplexing means to provide location measurements, exactly how many CDMA pilot channels and delay spread fingers can or should be measured vary according to the number of data receivers contained in each mobile station . As a guide, it is preferred that whenever RF characteristics permit, at least three pilot channels and the strongest first three fingers, are collected and processed. From the BS  perspective, it is preferred that the strongest first four CDMA delay spread fingers and the mobile station power level be collected and sent to the location system , for each of preferably three BSs  which can detect the mobile station . A much larger combination of measurements is potentially feasible using the extended data collection capability of the CDMA receivers.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0151","num":"0200"},"figref":["FIG. 30","FIGS. 5"],"b":["1220","6","8","7","9","17","19","21","23","8","2","26","15"]},"Input queues  are required in order to stage the rapid acceptance of a significant amount of RF signal measurement data, used for either location estimate purposes or to accept autonomous location data. Each location request using fixed base stations may, in one embodiment, contain from 1 to 128 radio frequency measurements from the mobile station, which translates to approximately 61.44 kilobytes of signal measurement data to be collected within 10 seconds and 128 measurements from each of possibly four base stations, or 245.76 kilobytes for all base stations, for a total of approximately 640 signal measurements from the five sources, or 307.2 kilobytes to arrive per mobile station location request in 10 seconds. An input queue storage space is assigned at the moment a location request begins, in order to establish a formatted data structure in persistent store. Depending upon the urgency of the time required to render a location estimate, fewer or more signal measurement samples can be taken and stored in the input queue(s)  accordingly.","The signal processing subsystem  supports a variety of wireless network signaling measurement capabilities by detecting the capabilities of the mobile and base station through messaging structures provided by the location application programming interface (L-API , ). Detection is accomplished in the signal classifier  () by referencing a mobile station database table within the signal processor database , which provides, given a mobile station identification number, mobile station revision code, other mobile station characteristics. Similarly, a mobile switch center table  provides MSC characteristics and identifications to the signal classifier\/filter . The signal classifier\/filter adds, additional message header information that further classifies the measurement data which allows the digital signal processor and image filter components to select the proper internal processing subcomponents to perform operations on the signal measurement data, for use by the location estimate modules.","Regarding service control point messages (of L-API-SCP interface , ) autonomously received from the input queue  (), the signal classifier\/filter  determines via a signal processing database  query whether such a message is to be associated with a home base station module. Thus appropriate header information is added to the message, thus enabling the message to pass through the digital signal processor  unaffected to the output queue , and then to the router\/distributor . The router\/distributor  then routes the message to the HBS first order model. Those skilled in the art will understand that associating location requests from Home Base Station configurations require substantially less data: the mobile identification number and the associated wireline telephone number transmission from the home location register are on the order of less than 32 bytes. Consequentially the home base station message type could be routed without any digital signal processing.","Output queue(s)  () are required for similar reasons as input queues : relatively large amounts of data must be held in a specific format for further location processing by the location estimate modules .","The router and distributor component  () is responsible for directing specific signal measurement data types and structures to their appropriate modules. For example, the HBS FOM has no use for digital filtering structures, whereas the TDOA module would not be able to process an HBS response message.","The controller  () is responsible for staging the movement of data among the signal processing subsystem  components input queue , digital signal processor , router\/distributor  and the output queue , and to initiate signal measurements within the wireless network, in response from an internet  location request message in , via the location application programming interface.","In addition the controller  receives autonomous messages from the MSC, via the location applications programming interface or L-API  () and the input queue , whenever a 9-1-1 wireless call is originated. The mobile switch center provides this autonomous notification to the location system as follows: by specifying the appropriate mobile switch center operations and maintenance C commands to surveil calls based on certain digits dialed such as 9-1-1, the location applications programming interface , in communications with the MSCs, receives an autonomous notification whenever a mobile station user dials 9-1-1. Specifically, a bi-directional authorized communications port is configured, usually at the operations and maintenance subsystem of the MSCs, or with their associated network element manager system(s), with a data circuit, such as a DS-1, with the location applications programming interface . Next, the \u201ccall trace\u201d capability of the mobile switch center is activated for the respective communications port. The exact implementation of the vendor-specific man-machine or Open Systems Interface (OSI) command(s) and their associated data structures generally vary among MSC vendors. However, the trace function is generally available in various forms, and is required in order to comply with Federal Bureau of Investigation authorities for wire tap purposes. After the appropriate surveillance commands are established on the MSC, such 9-1-1 call notifications messages containing the mobile station identification number (MIN) and, in U.S. FCC phase 1 E9-1-1 implementations, a pseudo-automatic number identification (a.k.a. pANI) which provides an association with the primary base station in which the 9-1-1 caller is in communication. In cases where the pANI is known from the onset, the signal processing subsystem  avoids querying the MSC in question to determine the primary base station identification associated with the 9-1-1 mobile station caller.","After the signal processing controller  receives the first message type, the autonomous notification message from the mobile switch center  to the location system , containing the mobile identification number and optionally the primary base station identification, the controller  queries the base station table  () in the signal processor database  to determine the status and availability of any neighboring base stations, including those base stations of other CMRS in the area. The definition of neighboring base stations include not only those within a provisionable \u201chop\u201d based on the cell design reuse factor, but also includes, in the case of CDMA, results from remaining set information autonomously queried to mobile stations, with results stored in the base station table. Remaining set information indicates that mobile stations can detect other base station (sector) pilot channels which may exceed the \u201chop\u201d distance, yet are nevertheless candidate base stations (or sectors) for wireless location purposes. Although cellular and digital cell design may vary, \u201chop\u201d distance is usually one or two cell coverage areas away from the primary base station's cell coverage area.","Having determined a likely set of base stations which may both detect the mobile station's transmitter signal, as well as to determine the set of likely pilot channels (i.e., base stations and their associated physical antenna sectors) detectable by the mobile station in the area surrounding the primary base station (sector), the controller  initiates messages to both the mobile station and appropriate base stations (sectors) to perform signal measurements and to return the results of such measurements to the signal processing system regarding the mobile station to be located. This step may be accomplished via several interface means. In a first case the controller  utilizes, for a given MSC, predetermined storage information in the MSC table  to determine which type of commands, such as man-machine or OSI commands are needed to request such signal measurements for a given MSC. The controller generates the mobile and base station signal measurement commands appropriate for the MSC and passes the commands via the input queue  and the locations application programming interface  in , to the appropriate MSC, using the authorized communications port mentioned earlier. In a second case, the controller  communicates directly with base stations within having to interface directly with the MSC for signal measurement extraction.","Upon receipt of the signal measurements, the signal classifier  in  examines location application programming interface-provided message header information from the source of the location measurement (for example, from a fixed BS , a mobile station , a distributed antenna system  in  or message location data related to a home base station), provided by the location applications programming interface (L-API ) via the input queue  in  and determines whether or not device filters  or image filters  are needed, and assesses a relative priority in processing, such as an emergency versus a background location task, in terms of grouping like data associated with a given location request. In the case where multiple signal measurement requests are outstanding for various base stations, some of which may be associated with a different CMRS network, and additional signal classifier function includes sorting and associating the appropriate incoming signal measurements together such that the digital signal processor  processes related measurements in order to build ensemble data sets. Such ensembles allow for a variety of functions such as averaging, outlier removal over a time period, and related filtering functions, and further prevent association errors from occurring in location estimate processing.","Another function of the signal classifier\/low pass filter component  is to filter information that is not useable, or information that could introduce noise or the effect of noise in the location estimate modules. Consequently low pass matching filters are used to match the in-common signal processing components to the characteristics of the incoming signals. Low pass filters match: Mobile Station, base station, CMRS and MSC characteristics, as well as to classify Home Base Station messages.","The signal processing subsystem  contains a base station database table  () which captures the maximum number of CDMA delay spread fingers for a given base station.","The base station identification code, or CLLI or common language level identification code is useful in identifying or relating a human-labeled name descriptor to the Base Station. Latitude, Longitude and elevation values are used by other subsystems in the location system for calibration and estimation purposes. As base stations and\/or receiver characteristics are added, deleted, or changed with respect to the network used for location purposes, this database table must be modified to reflect the current network configuration.","Just as an upgraded base station may detect additional CDMA delay spread signals, newer or modified mobile stations may detect additional pilot channels or CDMA delay spread fingers. Additionally different makes and models of mobile stations may acquire improved receiver sensitivities, suggesting a greater coverage capability. A table may establish the relationships among various mobile station equipment suppliers and certain technical data relevant to this location invention.","Although not strictly necessary, the MIN can be populated in this table from the PCS Service Provider's Customer Care system during subscriber activation and fulfillment, and could be changed at deactivation, or anytime the end-user changes mobile stations. Alternatively, since the MIN, manufacturer, model number, and software revision level information is available during a telephone call, this information could extracted during the call, and the remaining fields populated dynamically, based on manufacturer's specifications information previously stored in the signal processing subsystem . Default values are used in cases where the MIN is not found, or where certain information must be estimated.","A low pass mobile station filter, contained within the signal classifier\/low pass filter  of the signal processing subsystem , uses the above table data to perform the following functions: 1) act as a low pass filter to adjust the nominal assumptions related to the maximum number of CDMA fingers, pilots detectable; and 2) to determine the transmit power class and the receiver thermal noise floor. Given the detected reverse path signal strength, the required value of SRSS, a corrected indication of the effective path loss in the reverse direction (mobile station to BS), can be calculated based on data contained within the mobile station table , stored in the signal processing database .","The effects of the maximum number of CDMA fingers allowed and the maximum number of pilot channels allowed essentially form a low pass filter effect, wherein the least common denominator of characteristics are used to filter the incoming RF signal measurements such that a one for one matching occurs. The effect of the transmit power class and receiver thermal noise floor values is to normalize the characteristics of the incoming RF signals with respect to those RF signals used.","The signal classifier\/filter  () is in communication with both the input queue  and the signal processing database . In the early stage of a location request the signal processing subsystem  shown in, e.g., ,  and , will receive the initiating location request from either an autonomous 9-1-1 notification message from a given MSC, or from a location application, for which mobile station characteristics about the target mobile station  () is required. Referring to , a query is made from the signal processing controller  to the signal processing database , specifically the mobile station table , to determine if the mobile station characteristics associated with the MIN to be located is available in table . If the data exists then there is no need for the controller  to query the wireless network in order to determine the mobile station characteristics, thus avoiding additional real-time processing which would otherwise be required across the air interface, in order to determine the mobile station MIN characteristics. The resulting mobile station information my be provided either via the signal processing database  or alternatively a query may be performed directly from the signal processing subsystem  to the MSC in order to determine the mobile station characteristics.","Referring now to , another location application programming interface, L-API-CCS  to the appropriate CMRS customer care system provides the mechanism to populate and update the mobile station table  within the database . The L-API-CCS  contains its own set of separate input and output queues or similar implementations and security controls to ensure that provisioning data is not sent to the incorrect CMRS, and that a given CMRS cannot access any other CMRS\u2032 data. The interface to the customer care system for CMRS-A provides an autonomous or periodic notification and response application layer protocol type, consisting of add, delete, change and verify message functions in order to update the mobile station table  within the signal processing database , via the controller . A similar interface is used to enable provisioning updates to be received from CMRS-B customer care system ","Although the L-API-CCS application message set may be any protocol type which supports the autonomous notification message with positive acknowledgment type, the T1M1.5 group within the American National Standards Institute has defined a good starting point in which the L-API-CCS  could be implemented, using the robust OSI TMN X-interface at the service management layer. The object model defined in Standards proposal number T1M1.5\/96-22R9, Operations Administration, Maintenance, and Provisioning (OAM&P)\u2014Model for Interface Across Jurisdictional Boundaries to Support Electronic Access Service Ordering: Inquiry Function, can be extended to support the L-API-CCS information elements as required and further discussed below. Other choices in which the L-API-CCS application message set may be implemented include ASCII, binary, or any encrypted message set encoding using the Internet protocols, such as TCP\/IP, simple network management protocol, http, https, and email protocols.","Referring to the digital signal processor (DSP) , in communication with the signal classifier\/LP filter , the DSP  provides a time series expansion method to convert non-HBS data from a format of an signal measure data ensemble of time-series based radio frequency data measurements, collected as discrete time-slice samples, to a three dimensional matrix location data value image representation. Other techniques further filter the resultant image in order to furnish a less noisy training and actual data sample to the location estimate modules.","After 128 samples (in one embodiment) of data are collected of the delay spread-relative signal strength RF data measurement sample: mobile station RX for BS-1 are grouped into a quantization matrix, where rows constitute relative signal strength intervals and columns define delay intervals. Each measurement row, column pair (which could be represented as a complex number or Cartesian point pair) is added to their respective values to generate a Z direction of frequency of recurring measurement value pairs or a density recurrence function. By next applying a grid function to each x, y, and z value, a three-dimensional surface grid is generated, which represents a location data value or unique print of that 128-sample measurement.","In the general case where a mobile station is located in an environment with varied clutter patterns, such as terrain undulations, unique man-made structure geometries (thus creating varied multipath signal behaviors), such as a city or suburb, although the first CDMA delay spread finger may be the same value for a fixed distance between the mobile station and BS antennas, as the mobile station moves across such an area, different finger-data are measured. In the right image for the defined BS antenna sector, location classes, or squares numbered one through seven, are shown across a particular range of line of position (LOP).","A traditional TOA\/TDOA ranging method between a given BS and mobile station only provides a range along an arc, thus introducing ambiguity error. However a unique three dimensional image can be used in this method to specifically identify, with recurring probability, a particular unique location class along the same Line Of Position, as long as the multipath is unique by position but generally repeatable, thus establishing a method of not only ranging, but also of complete latitude, longitude location estimation in a Cartesian space. In other words, the unique shape of the \u201cmountain image\u201d enables a correspondence to a given unique location class along a line of position, thereby eliminating traditional ambiguity error.","Although man-made external sources of interference, Rayleigh fades, adjacent and co-channel interference, and variable clutter, such as moving traffic introduce unpredictability (thus no \u201cmountain image\u201d would ever be exactly alike), three basic types of filtering methods can be used to reduce matching\/comparison error from a training case to a location request case: 1.) select only the strongest signals from the forward path (BS to mobile station) and reverse path (mobile station to BS), 2.) Convolute the forward path  sample image with the reverse path  sample image, and 3.) process all image samples through various digital image filters to discard noise components.","In one embodiment, convolution of forward and reverse images is performed to drive out noise. This is one embodiment that essentially nulls noise completely, even if strong and recurring, as long as that same noise characteristic does not occur in the opposite path.","The third embodiment or technique of processing CDMA delay spread profile images through various digital image filters, provides a resultant \u201cimage enhancement\u201d in the sense of providing a more stable pattern recognition paradigm to the neural net location estimate model. For example, image histogram equalization can be used to rearrange the images' intensity values, or density recurrence values, so that the image's cumulative histogram is approximately linear.","Other methods which can be used to compensate for a concentrated histogram include: 1) Input Cropping, 2) Output Cropping and 3) Gamma Correction. Equalization and input cropping can provide particularly striking benefits to a CDMA delay spread profile image. Input cropping removes a large percentage of random signal characteristics that are non-recurring.","Other filters and\/or filter combinations can be used to help distinguish between stationary and variable clutter affecting multipath signals. For example, it is desirable to reject multipath fingers associated with variable clutter, since over a period of a few minutes such fingers would not likely recur. Further filtering can be used to remove recurring (at least during the sample period), and possibly strong but narrow \u201cpencils\u201d of RF energy. A narrow pencil image component could be represented by a near perfect reflective surface, such as a nearby metal panel truck stopped at a traffic light.","On the other hand, stationary clutter objects, such as concrete and glass building surfaces, adsorb some radiation before continuing with a reflected ray at some delay. Such stationary clutter-affected CDMA fingers are more likely to pass a 4\u00d74 neighbor Median filter as well as a 40 to 50 percent Input Crop filter, and are thus more suited to neural net pattern recognition. However when subjected to a 4\u00d74 neighbor Median filter and 40 percent clipping, pencil-shaped fingers are deleted. Other combinations include, for example, a 50 percent cropping and 4\u00d74 neighbor median filtering. Other filtering methods include custom linear filtering, adaptive (Weiner) filtering, and custom nonlinear filtering.","The DSP  may provide data ensemble results, such as extracting the shortest time delay with a detectable relative signal strength, to the router\/distributor , or alternatively results may be processed via one or more image filters , with subsequent transmission to the router\/distributor . The router\/distributor  examines the processed message data from the DSP  and stores routing and distribution information in the message header. The router\/distributor  then forwards the data messages to the output queue , for subsequent queuing then transmission to the appropriate location estimator FOMs.","Location Center High Level Functionality","At a very high level the location center  computes location estimates for a wireless Mobile Station  (denoted the \u201ctarget MS\u201d or \u201cMS\u201d) by performing the following steps:","(23.1) receiving signal transmission characteristics of communications communicated between the target MS  and one or more wireless infrastructure base stations ;","(23.2) filtering the received signal transmission characteristics (by a signal processing subsystem  illustrated in ) as needed so that target MS location data can be generated that is uniform and consistent with location data generated from other target MSs . In particular, such uniformity and consistency is both in terms of data structures and interpretation of signal characteristic values provided by the MS location data;\n\n(23.3) inputting the generated target MS location data to one or more MS location estimating models (denoted First order models or FOMs, and labeled collectively as  in ), so that each such model may use the input target MS location data for generating a \u201clocation hypothesis\u201d providing an estimate of the location of the target MS ;\n\n(23.4) providing the generated location hypotheses to an hypothesis evaluation module (denoted the hypothesis evaluator  in ):\n","(a) for adjusting at least one of the target MS location estimates of the generated location hypotheses and related confidence values indicating the confidence given to each location estimate, wherein such adjusting uses archival information related to the accuracy of previously generated location hypotheses,","(b) for evaluating the location hypotheses according to various heuristics related to, for example, the radio coverage area  terrain, the laws of physics, characteristics of likely movement of the target MS ; and","(c) for determining a most likely location area for the target MS , wherein the measurement of confidence associated with each input MS location area estimate is used for determining a \u201cmost likely location area\u201d; and","(23.5) outputting a most likely target MS location estimate to one or more applications  () requesting an estimate of the location of the target MS .","Location Hypothesis Data Representation","In order to describe how the steps (23.1) through (23.5) are performed in the sections below, some introductory remarks related to the data denoted above as location hypotheses will be helpful. Additionally, it will also be helpful to provide introductory remarks related to historical location data and the data base management programs associated therewith.","For each target MS location estimate generated and utilized by the present invention, the location estimate is provided in a data structure (or object class) denoted as a \u201clocation hypothesis\u201d (illustrated in Table LH-1).

Since such confidence values are an important aspect of the present invention, much of the description and use of such confidence values are described below; however, a brief description is provided here. Each such confidence value is in the range \u22121.0 to 1.0, wherein the larger the value, the greater the perceived likelihood that the target MS  is in (or at) a corresponding MS location estimate of the location hypothesis to which the confidence value applies. As an aside, note that a location hypothesis may have more than one MS location estimate (as will be discussed in detail below) and the confidence value will typically only correspond or apply to one of the MS location estimates in the location hypothesis. Further, values for the confidence value field may be interpreted as: (a) \u22121.0 may be interpreted to mean that the target MS  is NOT in such a corresponding MS area estimate of the location hypothesis area, (b) 0 may be interpreted to mean that it is unknown as to the likelihood of whether the MS  in the corresponding MS area estimate, and (c)+1.0 may be interpreted to mean that the MS  is perceived to positively be in the corresponding MS area estimate.","Additionally, note that it is within the scope of the present invention that the location hypothesis data structure may also include other related \u201cperception\u201d measurements related to a likelihood of the target MS  being in a particular MS location area estimate. For example, it is within the scope of the present invention to also utilize measurements such as, (a) \u201csufficiency factors\u201d for indicating the likelihood that an MS location estimate of a location hypothesis is sufficient for locating the target MS ; (b) \u201cnecessity factors\u201d for indicating the necessity that the target MS be in an particular area estimate. However, to more easily describe the present invention, a single confidence field is used having the interpretation given above.","Additionally, in utilizing location hypotheses in, for example, the location evaluator  as in (23.4) above, it is important to keep in mind that each location hypothesis confidence value is a relative measurement. That is, for confidences, cfand cf, if cf<=cf, then for a location hypotheses Hand Hhaving cfand cf, respectively, the target MS  is expected to more likely reside in a target MS estimate of Hthan a target MS estimate of H. Moreover, if an area, A, is such that it is included in a plurality of location hypothesis target MS estimates, then a confidence score, CS, can be assigned to A, wherein the confidence score for such an area is a function of the confidences (both positive and negative) for all the location hypotheses whose (most pertinent) target MS location estimates contain A. That is, in order to determine a most likely target MS location area estimate for outputting from the location center , a confidence score is determined for areas within the location center service area. More particularly, if a function, \u201cf\u201d, is a function of the confidence(s) of location hypotheses, and f is a monotonic function in its parameters and f(cf, cf, cf, . . . , cf)=CSfor confidences cfof location hypotheses H, i=1, 2, . . . , N, with CScontained in the area estimate for H, then \u201cf\u201d is denoted a confidence score function. Accordingly, there are many embodiments for a confidence score function f that may be utilized in computing confidence scores with the present invention; e.g.,\n\n()=\u03a3;\u2003\u2003(a)\n\n()=\u03a31, 3, 5, . . . ;\u2003\u2003(b)\n\n()=\u03a3()=,\u2003\u2003(c)\n\nwherein K, i=1, 2, . . . are positive system (tunable) constants (possibly dependent on environmental characteristics such as topography, time, date, traffic, weather, and\/or the type of base station(s)  from which location signatures with the target MS  are being generated, etc.).\n","For the present description of the invention, the function f as defined in (c) immediately above is utilized. However, for obtaining a general understanding of the present invention, the simpler confidence score function of (a) may be more useful. It is important to note, though, that it is within the scope of the present invention to use other functions for the confidence score function.","Coverage Area: Area Types And Their Determination","The notion of \u201carea type\u201d as related to wireless signal transmission characteristics has been used in many investigations of radio signal transmission characteristics. Some investigators, when investigating such signal characteristics of areas have used somewhat naive area classifications such as urban, suburban, rural, etc. However, it is desirable for the purposes of the present invention to have a more operational definition of area types that is more closely associated with wireless signal transmission behaviors.","To describe embodiments of the an area type scheme used in the present invention, some introductory remarks are first provided. Note that the wireless signal transmission behavior for an area depends on at least the following criteria:\n\n","Accordingly, a description of wireless signal characteristics for determining area types could potentially include a characterization of wireless signaling attributes as they relate to each of the above criteria. Thus, an area type might be: hilly, treed, suburban, having no buildings above 50 feet, with base stations spaced apart by two miles. However, a categorization of area types is desired that is both more closely tied to the wireless signaling characteristics of the area, and is capable of being computed substantially automatically and repeatedly over time. Moreover, for a wireless location system, the primary wireless signaling characteristics for categorizing areas into at least minimally similar area types are: thermal noise and, more importantly, multipath characteristics (e.g., multipath fade and time delay).","Focusing for the moment on the multipath characteristics, it is believed that (23.8.1) and (23.8.3) immediately above are, in general, more important criteria for accurately locating an MS  than (23.8.2). That is, regarding (23.8.1), multipath tends to increase as the density of nearby vertical area changes increases. For example, multipath is particularly problematic where there is a high density of high rise buildings and\/or where there are closely spaced geographic undulations. In both cases, the amount of change in vertical area per unit of area in a horizontal plane (for some horizontal reference plane) may be high. Regarding (23.8.3), the greater the density of base stations , the less problematic multipath may become in locating an MS . Moreover, the arrangement of the base stations  in the radio coverage area  in  may affect the amount and severity of multipath.","Accordingly, it would be desirable to have a method and system for straightforwardly determining area type classifications related to multipath, and in particular, multipath due to (23.8.1) and (23.8.3). The present invention provides such a determination by utilizing a novel notion of area type, hereinafter denoted \u201ctransmission area type\u201d (or, \u201c(transmission) area type\u201d when both a generic area type classification scheme and the transmission area type discussed hereinafter are intended) for classifying \u201csimilar\u201d areas, wherein each transmission area type class or category is intended to describe an area having at least minimally similar wireless signal transmission characteristics. That is, the novel transmission area type scheme of the present invention is based on: (a) the terrain area classifications; e.g., the terrain of an area surrounding a target MS , (b) the configuration of base stations  in the radio coverage area , and (c) characterizations of the wireless signal transmission paths between a target MS  location and the base stations .","In one embodiment of a method and system for determining such (transmission) area type approximations, a partition (denoted hereinafter as P) is imposed upon the radio coverage area  for partitioning for radio coverage area into subareas, wherein each subarea is an estimate of an area having included MS  locations that are likely to have is at least a minimal amount of similarity in their wireless signaling characteristics. To obtain the partition Pof the radio coverage area , the following steps are performed:\n\n","Now assuming Phas been obtained, the subareas of Pare provided with a first classification or categorization as follows:\n\n","Note that other transmission signal characteristics may be incorporated into the transmission area types. For example, thermal noise characteristics may be included by providing a third radio coverage area  partition, P, in addition to the partitions of Pand Pgenerated in (23.8.4.1) and (23.8.4.2) respectively. Moreover, the time varying characteristics of (23.8.2) may be incorporated in the transmission area type frame work by generating multiple versions of the transmission area types such that the transmission area type for a given subarea of Pmay change depending on the combination of time varying environmental characteristics to be considered in the transmission area types. For instance, to account for seasonality, four versions of the partitions Pand Pmay be generated, one for each of the seasons, and subsequently generate a (potentially) different partition Pfor each season. Further, the type and\/or characteristics of base station  antennas may also be included in an embodiment of the transmission area type.","Accordingly, in one embodiment of the present invention, whenever the term \u201carea type\u201d is used hereinbelow, transmission area types as described hereinabove are intended.","Location Information Data Bases And Data","Location Data Bases Introduction","It is an aspect of the present invention that MS location processing performed by the location center  should become increasingly better at locating a target MS  both by (a) building an increasingly more detailed model of the signal characteristics of locations in the service area for the present invention, and also (b) by providing capabilities for the location center processing to adapt to environmental changes.","One way these aspects of the present invention are realized is by providing one or more data base management systems and data bases for:","(a) storing and associating wireless MS signal characteristics with known locations of MSs  used in providing the signal characteristics. Such stored associations may not only provide an increasingly better model of the signal characteristics of the geography of the service area, but also provide an increasingly better model of more changeable signal characteristic affecting environmental factors such as weather, seasons, and\/or traffic patterns;","(b) adaptively updating the signal characteristic data stored so that it reflects changes in the environment of the service area such as, for example, a new high rise building or a new highway.","Referring again to  of the collective representation of these data bases is the location information data bases . Included among these data bases is a data base for providing training and\/or calibration data to one or more trainable\/calibratable FOMs , as well as an archival data base for archiving historical MS location information related to the performance of the FOMs. These data bases will be discussed as necessary hereinbelow. However, a further brief introduction to the archival data base is provided here. Accordingly, the term, \u201clocation signature data base\u201d is used hereinafter to denote the archival data base and\/or data base management system depending on the context of the discussion. The location signature data base (shown in, for example,  and labeled ) is a repository for wireless signal characteristic data derived from wireless signal communications between an MS  and one or more base stations , wherein the corresponding location of the MS  is known and also stored in the location signature data base . More particularly, the location signature data base  associates each such known MS location with the wireless signal characteristic data derived from wireless signal communications between the MS  and one or more base stations  at this MS location. Accordingly, it is an aspect of the present invention to utilize such historical MS signal location data for enhancing the correctness and\/or confidence of certain location hypotheses as will be described in detail in other sections below.","Data Representations for the Location Signature Data Base","There are four fundamental entity types (or object classes in an object oriented programming paradigm) utilized in the location signature data base . Briefly, these data entities are described in the items (24.1) through (24.4) that follow:","(24.1) (verified) location signatures: Each such (verified) location signature describes the wireless signal characteristic measurements between a given base station (e.g., BS  or LBS ) and an MS  at a (verified or known) location associated with the (verified) location signature. That is, a verified location signature corresponds to a location whose coordinates such as latitude-longitude coordinates are known, while simply a location signature may have a known or unknown location corresponding with it. Note that the term (verified) location signature is also denoted by the abbreviation, \u201c(verified) loc sig\u201d hereinbelow;\n\n(24.2) (verified) location signature clusters: Each such (verified) location signature cluster includes a collection of(verified) location signatures corresponding to all the location signatures between a target MS  at a (possibly verified) presumed substantially stationary location and each BS (e.g.,  or ) from which the target MS  can detect the BS's pilot channel regardless of the classification of the BS in the target MS (i.e., for CDMA, regardless of whether a BS is in the MS's active, candidate or remaining base station sets, as one skilled in the art will understand). Note that for simplicity here, it is presumed that each location signature cluster has a single fixed primary base station to which the target MS  synchronizes or obtains its timing;\n\n(24.3) \u201ccomposite location objects (or entities)\u201d: Each such entity is a more general entity than the verified location signature cluster. An object of this type is a collection of (verified) location signatures that are associated with the same MS  at substantially the same location at the same time and each such loc sig is associated with a different base station. However, there is no requirement that a loc sig from each BS  for which the MS  can detect the BS's pilot channel is included in the \u201ccomposite location object (or entity)\u201d; and\n\n(24.4) MS location estimation data that includes MS location estimates output by one or more MS location estimating first order models , such MS location estimate data is described in detail hereinbelow.\n","It is important to note that a loc sig is, in one embodiment, an instance of the data structure containing the signal characteristic measurements output by the signal filtering and normalizing subsystem also denoted as the signal processing subsystem  describing the signals between: (i) a specific base station  (BS) and (ii) a mobile station  (MS), wherein the BS's location is known and the MS's location is assumed to be substantially constant (during a 2-5 second interval in one embodiment of the present invention), during communication with the MS  for obtaining a single instance of loc sig data, although the MS location may or may not be known. Further, for notational purposes, the BS  and the MS  for a loc sig hereinafter will be denoted the \u201cBS associated with the loc sig\u201d, and the \u201cMS associated with the loc sig\u201d respectively. Moreover, the location of the MS  at the time the loc sig data is obtained will be denoted the \u201clocation associated with the loc sig\u201d (this location possibly being unknown).","In particular, for each (verified) loc sig includes the following:\n\n","Additionally, note that at least in one embodiment of the signal topography characteristics (25.7) above, such a first surface may be generated for the (forward) signals from the base station  to the target MS  and a second such surface may be generated for (or alternatively, the first surface may be enhanced by increasing its dimensionality with) the signals from the MS  to the base station  (denoted the reverse signals).","Additionally, in some embodiments the location hypothesis may include an estimated error as a measurement of perceived accuracy in addition to or as a substitute for the confidence field discussed hereinabove. Moreover, location hypotheses may also include a text field for providing a reason for the values of one or more of the location hypothesis fields. For example, this text field may provide a reason as to why the confidence value is low, or provide an indication that the wireless signal measurements used had a low signal to noise ratio.","Loc sigs have the following functions or object methods associated therewith:\n\n","Normalization for the BS  associated with a loc sig is similar to the normalization for MS signal processing and generating characteristics. Just as with the MS normalization, the signal processing subsystem  provides a loc sig method for \u201cnormalizing\u201d loc sigs according to base station signal processing and generating characteristics.","Note, however, loc sigs stored in the location signature data base  are NOT \u201cnormalized\u201d according to either MS or BS signal processing and generating characteristics. That is, \u201craw\u201d values of the wireless signal characteristics are stored with each loc sig in the location signature data base .\n\n","Referring now to the composite location objects and verified location signature clusters of (24.3) and (24.2) respectively, the following information is contained in these aggregation objects:\n\n","Note, a verified composite location object is designated as \u201cincomplete\u201d if a loc sig initially referenced by the verified composite location object is deleted from the location signature data base  (e.g., because of a confidence that is too low).

Also note that common fields between loc sigs referenced by the same composite location object may be provided in the composite location object only (e.g., timestamp, etc.).","Accordingly, a composite location object that is complete (i.e., not incomplete) is a verified location signature cluster as described in (24.2).","Location Center Architecture","Overview of Location Center functional Components",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0221","num":"0307"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["142","139"]},"It is important to note that the architecture for the location center  and the location engine  provided by the present invention is designed for extensibility and flexibility so that MS  location accuracy and reliability may be enhanced as further location data become available and as enhanced MS location techniques become available. In addressing the design goals of extensibility and flexibility, the high level architecture for generating and processing MS location estimates may be considered as divided into the following high level functional groups described hereinbelow.","Low Level Wireless Signal Processing Subsystem for Receiving and Conditioning Wireless Signal Measurements","A first functional group of location engine  modules is for performing signal processing and filtering of MS location signal data received from a conventional wireless (e.g., CDMA) infrastructure, as discussed in the steps (23.1) and (23.2) above. This group is denoted the signal processing subsystem  herein. One embodiment of such a subsystem is described in the PCT patent application titled, \u201cWireless Location Using A Plurality of Commercial Network Infrastructures,\u201d by F. W. LeBlanc and the present inventors.","Initial Location Estimators: First Order Models","A second functional group of location engine  modules is for generating various target MS  location initial estimates, as described in step (23.3). Accordingly, the modules here use input provided by the signal processing subsystem . This second functional group includes one or more signal analysis modules or models, each hereinafter denoted as a first order model  (FOM), for generating location hypotheses for a target MS  to be located. Note that it is intended that each such FOM  use a different technique for determining a location area estimate for the target MS . A brief description of some types of first order models is provided immediately below. Note that  illustrates another, more detailed view of the location system for the present invention. In particular, this figure illustrates some of the FOMs  contemplated by the present invention, and additionally illustrates the primary communications with other modules of the location system for the present invention. However, it is important to note that the present invention is not limited to the FOMs  shown and discussed herein. That is, it is a primary aspect of the present invention to easily incorporate FOMs using other signal processing and\/or computational location estimating techniques than those presented herein. Further, note that each FOM type may have a plurality of its models incorporated into an embodiment of the present invention.","For example, (as will be described in further detail below), one such type of model or FOM  (hereinafter models of this type are referred to as \u201cdistance models\u201d) may be based on a range or distance computation and\/or on a base station signal reception angle determination between the target MS  from each of one or more base stations. Basically, such distance models  determine a location estimate of the target MS  by determining a distance offset from each of one or more base stations , possibly in a particular direction from each (some of) the base stations, so that an intersection of each area locus defined by the base station offsets may provide an estimate of the location of the target MS. Distance model FOMs  may compute such offsets based on:\n\n","In one embodiment, such a distance model may perform the following steps:\n\n","Another type of FOM  is a statistically based first order model , wherein a statistical technique, such as regression techniques (e.g., least squares, partial least squares, principle decomposition), or e.g., Bollenger Bands (e.g., for computing minimum and maximum base station offsets). In general, models of this type output location hypotheses that are determined by performing one or more statistical techniques or comparisons between the verified location signatures in location signature data base , and the wireless signal measurements from a target MS. Models of this type are also referred to hereinafter as a \u201cstochastic signal (first order) model\u201d or a \u201cstochastic FOM\u201d or a \u201cstatistical model.\u201d","In one embodiment, such a stochastic signal model may output location hypotheses determined by one or more statistical comparisons with loc sigs in the Location Signature database  (e.g., comparing MS location signals with verified signal characteristics for predetermined geographical areas).","Still another type of FOM  is an adaptive learning model, such as an artificial neural net or a genetic algorithm, wherein the FOM may be trained to recognize or associate each of a plurality of locations with a corresponding set of signal characteristics for communications between the target MS  (at the location) and the base stations . Moreover, typically such a FOM is expected to accurately interpolate\/extrapolate target MS  location estimates from a set of signal characteristics from an unknown target MS  location. Models of this type are also referred to hereinafter variously as \u201cartificial neural net models\u201d or \u201cneural net models\u201d or \u201ctrainable models\u201d or \u201clearning models.\u201d Note that a related type of FOM  is based on pattern recognition. These FOMs can recognize patterns in the signal characteristics of communications between the target MS  (at the location) and the base stations  and thereby estimate a location area of the target MS. However, such FOMs may not be trainable.","In one embodiment, an adaptive learning model such as a model based on an artificial neural network may determine an MS  location estimate using base station IDs, data on signal-to-noise, other signal data (e.g., a number of signal characteristics including, e.g., all CDMA fingers). Moreover, the output from such a model may include: a latitude and longitude for a center of a circle having radius R (R may be an input to such an artificial neural network), and is in the output format of the distance model(s).","Yet another type of FOM  can be based on a collection of dispersed low power, low cost fixed location wireless transceivers (also denoted \u201clocation base stations \u201d hereinabove) that are provided for detecting a target MS  in areas where, e.g., there is insufficient base station  infrastructure coverage for providing a desired level of MS  location accuracy. For example, it may uneconomical to provide high traffic wireless voice coverage of a typical wireless base station  in a nature preserve or at a fair ground that is only populated a few days out of the year. However, if such low cost location base stations  can be directed to activate and deactivate via the direction of a FOM  of the present type, then these location base stations can be used to both locate a target MS  and also provide indications of where the target MS is not. For example, if there are location base stations  populating an area where the target MS  is presumed to be, then by activating these location base stations , evidence may be obtained as to whether or not the target MS is actually in the area; e.g., if the target MS  is detected by a location base station , then a corresponding location hypothesis having a location estimate corresponding to the coverage area of the location base station may have a very high confidence value. Alternatively, if the target MS  is not detected by a location base station , then a corresponding location hypothesis having a location estimate corresponding to the coverage area of the location base station may have a very low confidence value. Models of this type are referred to hereinafter as \u201clocation base station models.\u201d","In one embodiment, such a location base station model may perform the following steps:\n\n","Yet another type of FOM  can be based on input from a mobile base station , wherein location hypotheses may be generated from target MS  location data received from the mobile base station . In one embodiment, such a mobile base station model may provide output similar to the distance FOM  described hereinabove.","Still other types of FOM  can be based on various techniques for recognizing wireless signal measurement patterns and associating particular patterns with locations in the coverage area . For example, artificial neural networks or other learning models can used as the basis for various FOMs.","Note that the FOM types mentioned here as well as other FOM types are discussed in detail hereinbelow. Moreover, it is important to keep in mind that a novel aspect of the present invention is the simultaneous use or activation of a potentially large number of such first order models , wherein such FOMs are not limited to those described herein. Thus, the present invention provides a framework for incorporating MS location estimators to be subsequently provided as new FOMs in a straightforward manner. For example, a FOM  based on wireless signal time delay measurements from a distributed antenna system  for wireless communication may be incorporated into the present invention for locating a target MS  in an enclosed area serviced by the distributed antenna system (such a FOM is more fully described in the U.S. Pat. No. 6,236,365 filed Jul. 8, 1999 which is incorporated fully by reference herein). Accordingly, by using such a distributed antenna FOM  (FIG. ()), the present invention may determine the floor of a multi-story building from which a target MS is transmitting. Thus, MSs  can be located in three dimensions using such a distributed antenna FOM .","In one embodiment, such a distributed antenna model may perform the following steps:\n\n","Additionally, FOMs  for detecting certain registration changes within, for example, a public switched telephone network  can also be used for locating a target MS . For example, for some MSs  there may be an associated or dedicated device for each such MS that allows the MS to function as a cordless phone to a line based telephone network when the device detects that the MS is within signaling range. In one use of such a device (also denoted herein as a \u201chome base station\u201d), the device registers with a home location register of the public switched telephone network  when there is a status change such as from not detecting the corresponding MS to detecting the MS, or visa versa, as one skilled in the art will understand. Accordingly, by providing a FOM  (denoted the \u201cHome Base Station First Order Model\u201d in FIG. ()) that accesses the MS status in the home location register, the location engine  can determine whether the MS is within signaling range of the home base station or not, and generate location hypotheses accordingly.","In one embodiment, such a home base station model may perform the following steps:\n\n","Moreover, other FOMs based on, for example, chaos theory and\/or fractal theory are also within the scope of the present invention.","It is important to note the following aspects of the present invention relating to FOMs :\n\n","A third functional group of location engine  modules evaluates location hypotheses output by the first order models  and thereby provides a \u201cmost likely\u201d target MS location estimate. The modules for this functional group are collectively denoted the hypothesis evaluator .","Hypothesis Evaluator Introduction","A primary purpose of the hypothesis evaluator  is to mitigate conflicts and ambiguities related to location hypotheses output by the first order models  and thereby output a \u201cmost likely\u201d estimate of an MS for which there is a request for it to be located. In providing this capability, there are various related embodiments of the hypothesis evaluator that are within the scope of the present invention. Since each location hypothesis includes both an MS location area estimate and a corresponding confidence value indicating a perceived confidence or likelihood of the target MS being within the corresponding location area estimate, there is a monotonic relationship between MS location area estimates and confidence values. That is, by increasing an MS location area estimate, the corresponding confidence value may also be increased (in an extreme case, the location area estimate could be the entire coverage area  and thus the confidence value may likely correspond to the highest level of certainty; i.e., +1.0). Accordingly, given a target MS location area estimate (of a location hypothesis), an adjustment to its accuracy may be performed by adjusting the MS location area estimate and\/or the corresponding confidence value. Thus, if the confidence value is, for example, excessively low then the area estimate may be increased as a technique for increasing the confidence value. Alternatively, if the estimated area is excessively large, and there is flexibility in the corresponding confidence value, then the estimated area may be decreased and the confidence value also decreased. Thus, if at some point in the processing of a location hypothesis, if the location hypothesis is judged to be more (less) accurate than initially determined, then (i) the confidence value of the location hypothesis can be increased (decreased), and\/or (ii) the MS location area estimate can be decreased (increased).","In a first class of embodiments, the hypothesis evaluator  evaluates location hypotheses and adjusts or modifies only their confidence values for MS location area estimates and subsequently uses these MS location estimates with the adjusted confidence values for determining a \u201cmost likely\u201d MS location estimate for outputting. Accordingly, the MS location area estimates are not substantially modified. Alternatively, in a second class of embodiments for the hypothesis evaluator , MS location area estimates can be adjusted while confidence values remain substantially fixed. Of course, hybrids between the first two embodiments can also be provided. Note that the present embodiment provided herein adjusts both the areas and the confidence values.","More particularly, the hypothesis evaluator  may perform any or most of the following tasks:\n\n","Note that, as can be seen in , the hypothesis evaluator  includes the following four high level modules for processing output location hypotheses from the first order models : a context adjuster , a hypothesis analyzer , an MS status repository  and a most likelihood estimator . These four modules are briefly described hereinbelow.","Context Adjuster Introduction.","The context adjuster  module enhances both the comparability and predictability of the location hypotheses output by the first order models . In particular, this module modifies location hypotheses received from the FOMs  so that the resulting location hypotheses output by the context adjuster  may be further processed uniformly and substantially without concern as to differences in accuracy between the first order models from which location hypotheses originate. In providing this capability, the context adjuster  may adjust or modify various fields of the input location hypotheses. In particular, fields giving target MS  location estimates and\/or confidence values for such estimates may be modified by the context adjuster . Further, this module may determine those factors that are perceived to impact the perceived accuracy (e.g., confidence) of the location hypotheses: (a) differently between FOMs, and\/or (b) with substantial effect. For instance, environmental characteristics may be taken into account here, such as time of day, season, month, weather, geographical area categorizations (e.g., dense urban, urban, suburban, rural, mountain, etc.), area subcategorizations (e.g., heavily treed, hilly, high traffic area, etc.). A detailed description of one embodiment of this module is provided in APPENDIX D hereinbelow. Note that, the embodiment described herein is simplified for illustration purposes such that only the geographical area categorizations are utilized in adjusting (i.e., modifying) location hypotheses. But, it is an important aspect of the present invention that various categorizations, such as those mentioned immediately above, may be used for adjusting the location hypotheses. That is, categories such as, for example:\n\n","Accordingly, the present invention is not limited to the factors explicitly mentioned here. That is, it is an aspect of the present invention to be extensible so that other environmental factors of the coverage area  affecting the accuracy of location hypotheses may also be incorporated into the context adjuster .","It is also an important and novel aspect of the context adjuster  that the methods for adjusting location hypotheses provided in this module may be generalized and thereby also utilized with multiple hypothesis computational architectures related to various applications wherein a terrain, surface, volume or other \u201cgeometric\u201d interpretation (e.g., a metric space of statistical samples) may be placed on a large body of stored application data for relating hypothesized data to verified data. Moreover, it is important to note that various techniques for \u201cvisualizing data\u201d may provide such a geometric interpretation. Thus, the methods herein may be utilized in applications such as:\n\n","More generally, the novel computational paradigm of the context adjuster  may be utilized in a number of applications wherein there is a large body of archived information providing verified or actual application process data related to the past performance of the application process.","It is worth mentioning that the computational paradigm used in the context adjuster  is a hybrid of a hypothesis adjuster and a data base query mechanism. For example, the context adjuster  uses an input (location) hypothesis both as an hypothesis and as a data base query or index into the location signature data base  for constructing a related but more accurate location hypothesis. Accordingly, substantial advantages are provided by this hybrid architecture, such as the following two advantages.","As a first advantage, the context adjuster  reduces the likelihood that a feedback mechanism is necessary to the initial hypothesis generators (i.e., FOMs ) for periodically adjusting default evaluations of the goodness or confidence in the hypotheses generated.","That is, since each hypothesis generated is, in effect, an index into a data base or archive of verified application (e.g., location) data, the context adjuster , in turn, generates new corresponding hypotheses based on the actual or verified data retrieved from an archival data base. Thus, as a result, this architecture tends to separate the computations of the initial hypothesis generators (e.g., the FOMs  in the present MS location application) from any further processing and thereby provide a more modular, maintainable and flexible computational system.","As a second advantage, the context adjuster  tends to create hypotheses that are more accurate than the hypotheses generated by the initial hypotheses generators. That is, for each hypothesis, H, provided by one of the initial hypothesis generators, G (e.g., a FOM ), a corresponding enhanced hypothesis, provided by the context adjuster , is generated by mapping the past performance of G into the archived verified application data (as will be discussed in detail hereinbelow). In particular, the context adjuster hypothesis generation is based on the archived verified (or known) performance application data that is related to both G and H. For example, in the present wireless location application, if a FOM , G, substantially consistently generates, in a particular geographical area, location hypotheses that are biased approximately 1000 feet north of the actual verified MS  location, then the context adjuster  can generate corresponding hypotheses without this bias. Thus, the context adjuster  tends to filter out inaccuracies in the initially generated hypotheses.","Therefore in a multiple hypothesis architecture where typically the generated hypotheses may be evaluated and\/or combined for providing a \u201cmost likely\u201d result, it is believed that a plurality of relatively simple (and possibly inexact) initial hypothesis generators may be used in conjunction with the hybrid computational paradigm represented by the context adjuster  for providing enhanced hypotheses with substantially greater accuracy.","Additionally, note that this hybrid paradigm applies to other domains that are not geographically based. For instance, this hybrid paradigm applies to many prediction and\/or diagnostic applications for which:","(a) the application data and the application are dependent on a number of parameters whose values characterize the range of outputs for the application. That is, there is a set of parameters, p, p, p, . . . , pfrom which a parameter space p\u00d7p\u00d7p\u00d7 . . . \u00d7pis derived whose points characterize the actual and estimated (or predicted) outcomes. As examples, in the MS location system, p=latitude and p=longitude;","(b) there is historical data from which points for the parameter space, p\u00d7p\u00d7p\u00d7 . . . \u00d7pcan be obtained, wherein this data relates to (or indicates) the performance of the application, and the points obtained from this data are relatively dense in the space (at least around the likely future actual outcomes that the application is expected to predict or diagnose). For example, such historical data may associate the predicted outcomes of the application with corresponding actual outcomes;","(c) there is a metric or distance-like evaluation function that can be applied to the parameter space for indicating relative closeness or accuracy of points in the parameter space, wherein the evaluation function provides a measurement of closeness that is related to the actual performance of the application.","Note that there are numerous applications for which the above criteria are applicable. For instance, computer aided control of chemical processing plants are likely to satisfy the above criteria. Certain robotic applications may also satisfy this criteria. In fact, it is believed that a wide range of signal processing applications satisfy this criteria.","MS Status Repository Introduction","The MS status repository  is a run-time storage manager for storing location hypotheses from previous activations of the location engine  (as well as for storing the output \u201cmost likely\u201d target MS location estimate(s)) so that a target MS  may be tracked using target MS location hypotheses from previous location engine  activations to determine, for example, a movement of the target MS  between evaluations of the target MS location.","Location Hypothesis Analyzer Introduction.","The location hypothesis analyzer , adjusts confidence values of the location hypotheses, according to:\n\n","As shown in , the hypothesis analyzer  module receives (potentially) modified location hypotheses from the context adjuster  and performs additional location hypothesis processing that is likely to be common and generic in analyzing most location hypotheses. More specifically, the hypothesis analyzer  may adjust either or both of the target MS  estimated location and\/or the confidence of a location hypothesis. In brief, the hypothesis analyzer  receives target MS  location hypotheses from the context analyzer , and depending on the time stamps of newly received location hypotheses and any previous (i.e., older) target MS location hypotheses that may still be currently available to the hypothesis analyzer , the hypothesis analyzer may:","(a) update some of the older hypotheses by an extrapolation module,","(b) utilize some of the old hypotheses as previous target MS estimates for use in tracking the target MS , and\/or","(c) if sufficiently old, then delete the older location hypotheses.","Note that both the newly received location hypotheses and the previous location hypotheses that are updated (i.e., extrapolated) and still remain in the hypothesis analyzer  will be denoted as \u201ccurrent location hypotheses\u201d or \u201ccurrently active location hypotheses\u201d.","The modules within the location hypothesis analyzer  use various types of application specific knowledge likely substantially independent from the computations by the FOMs  when providing the corresponding original location hypotheses. That is, since it is aspect of at least one embodiment of the present invention that the FOMs  be relatively straightforward so that they may be easily to modified as well as added or deleted, the processing, for example, in the hypothesis analyzer  (as with the context adjuster ) is intended to compensate, when necessary, for this straightforwardness by providing substantially generic MS location processing capabilities that can require a greater breadth of application understanding related to wireless signal characteristics of the coverage area .","Accordingly, the hypothesis analyzer  may apply various heuristics that, for example, change the confidence in a location hypothesis depending on how well the location hypothesis (and\/or a series of location hypotheses from e.g., the same FOM ): (a) conforms with the laws of physics, (b) conforms with known characteristics of location signature clusters in an area of the location hypothesis MS  estimate, and (c) conforms with highly likely heuristic constraint knowledge. In particular, as illustrated best in , the location hypothesis analyzer  may utilize at least one of a blackboard system and\/or an expert system for applying various application specific heuristics to the location hypotheses output by the context adjuster . More precisely, the location hypothesis analyzer  includes, in one embodiment, a blackboard manager for managing processes and data of a blackboard system. Additionally, note that in a second embodiment, where an expert system is utilized instead of a blackboard system, the location hypothesis analyzer provides an expert system inference engine for the expert system. Note that additional detail on these aspects of the invention are provided hereinbelow.","Additionally, note that the hypothesis analyzer  may activate one or more extrapolation procedures to extrapolate target MS  location hypotheses already processed. Thus, when one or more new location hypotheses are supplied (by the context adjuster ) having a substantially more recent timestamp, the hypothesis analyzer may invoke an extrapolation module (i.e., location extrapolator , ) for adjusting any previous location hypotheses for the same target MS  that are still being used by the location hypothesis analyzer so that all target MS location hypotheses (for the same target MS) being concurrently analyzed are presumed to be for substantially the same time. Accordingly, such a previous location hypothesis that is, for example, 15 seconds older than a newly supplied location hypothesis (from perhaps a different FOM ) may have both: (a) an MS location estimate changed (e.g., to account for a movement of the target MS), and (b) its confidence changed (e.g., to reflect a reduced confidence in the accuracy of the location hypothesis).","It is important to note that the architecture of the present invention is such that the hypothesis analyzer  has an extensible architecture. That is, additional location hypothesis analysis modules may be easily integrated into the hypothesis analyzer  as further understanding regarding the behavior of wireless signals within the service area  becomes available. Conversely, some analysis modules may not be required in areas having relatively predictable signal patterns. Thus, in such service areas, such unnecessary modules may be easily removed or not even developed.","Most Likelihood Estimator Introduction","The most likelihood estimator  is a module for determining a \u201cmost likely\u201d location estimate for a target MS being located by the location engine . The most likelihood estimator  receives a collection of active or relevant location hypotheses from the hypothesis analyzer  and uses these location hypotheses to determine one or more most likely estimates for the target MS . Still referring to the hypothesis evaluator , it is important to note that not all the above mentioned modules are required in all embodiments of the present invention. In particular, for some coverage areas , the hypothesis analyzer  may be unnecessary. Accordingly, in such an embodiment, the enhanced location hypothesis output by the context adjuster  are provided directly to the most likelihood estimator .","Control and Output Gating Modules","A fourth functional group of location engine  modules is the control and output gating modules which includes the location center control subsystem , and the output gateway . The location control subsystem  provides the highest level of control and monitoring of the data processing performed by the location center . In particular, this subsystem performs the following functions:\n\n","Note that in , (a)-(d) above are, at least at a high level, performed by utilizing the operator interface .","Referring now to the output gateway , this module routes target MS  location estimates to the appropriate location application(s). For instance, upon receiving a location estimate from the most likelihood estimator , the output gateway  may determine that the location estimate is for an automobile being tracked by the police and therefore must be provided according to a particular protocol.","System Tuning and Adaptation: The Adaptation Engine","A fifth functional group of location engine  modules provides the ability to enhance the MS locating reliability and\/or accuracy of the present invention by providing it with the capability to adapt to particular operating configurations, operating conditions and wireless signaling environments without performing intensive manual analysis of the performance of various embodiments of the location engine . That is, this functional group automatically enhances the performance of the location engine for locating MSs  within a particular coverage area  using at least one wireless network infrastructure therein. More precisely, this functional group allows the present invention to adapt by tuning or optimizing certain system parameters according to location engine  location estimate accuracy and reliability.","There are a number location engine  system parameters whose values affect location estimation, and it is an aspect of the present invention that the MS location processing performed should become increasingly better at locating a target MS  not only through building an increasingly more detailed model of the signal characteristics of location in the coverage area  such as discussed above regarding the location signature data base , but also by providing automated capabilities for the location center processing to adapt by adjusting or \u201ctuning\u201d the values of such location center system parameters.","Accordingly, the present invention includes a module, denoted herein as an \u201cadaptation engine\u201d , that performs an optimization procedure on the location center  system parameters either periodically or concurrently with the operation of the location center in estimating MS locations. That is, the adaptation engine  directs the modifications of the system parameters so that the location engine  increases in overall accuracy in locating target MSs . In one embodiment, the adaptation engine  includes an embodiment of a genetic algorithm as the mechanism for modifying the system parameters. Genetic algorithms are basically search algorithms based on the mechanics of natural genetics. The genetic algorithm utilized herein is included in the form of pseudo code in APPENDIX . Note that to apply this genetic algorithm in the context of the location engine  architecture only a \u201ccoding scheme\u201d and a \u201cfitness function\u201d are required as one skilled in the art will appreciate. Moreover, it is also within the scope of the present invention to use modified or different adaptive and\/or tuning mechanisms. For further information regarding such adaptive mechanisms, the following references are incorporated herein by reference: Goldberg, D. E. (1989).

In some embodiments of distance models, the target MS location estimate(s) generated are obtained using radio signal analysis techniques that are quite general and therefore are not capable of taking into account the peculiarities of the topography of a particular radio coverage area. For example, substantially all radio signal analysis techniques using conventional procedures (or formulas) are based on \u201csignal characteristic measurements\u201d such as:","(a) signal timing measurements (e.g., TOA and TDOA),","(b) signal strength measurements, and\/or","(c) signal angle of arrival measurements.","Furthermore, such signal analysis techniques are likely predicated on certain very general assumptions that can not fully account for signal attenuation and multipath due to a particular radio coverage area topography.","Taking a CDMA or TDMA base station network as an example, each base station (BS)  is required to emit a constant signal-strength pilot channel pseudo-noise (PN) sequence on the forward link channel identified uniquely in the network by a pilot sequence offset and frequency assignment. It is possible to use the pilot channels of the active, candidate, neighboring and remaining sets, maintained in the target MS, for obtaining signal characteristic measurements (e.g., TOA and\/or TDOA measurements) between the target MS  and the base stations in one or more of these sets.","Based on such signal characteristic measurements and the speed of signal propagation, signal characteristic ranges or range differences related to the location of the target MS  can be calculated. Using TOA and\/or TDOA ranges as exemplary, these ranges can then be input to either the radius-radius multilateration or the time difference multilateration algorithms along with the known positions of the corresponding base stations  to thereby obtain one or more location estimates of the target MS . For example, if there are, four base stations  in the active set, the target MS  may cooperate with each of the base stations in this set to provide signal arrival time measurements. Accordingly, each of the resulting four sets of three of these base stations  may be used to provide an estimate of the target MS  as one skilled in the art will understand. Thus, potentially (assuming the measurements for each set of three base stations yields a feasible location solution) there are four estimates for the location of the target MS . Further, since such measurements and BS  positions can be sent either to the network or the target MS , location can be determined in either entity.","Since many of the signal measurements utilized by embodiments of distance models are subject to signal attenuation and multipath due to a particular area topography. Many of the sets of base stations from which target MS location estimates are desired may result in either no location estimate, or an inaccurate location estimate.","Accordingly, some embodiments of distance FOMs may attempt to mitigate such ambiguity or inaccuracies by, e.g., identifying discrepancies (or consistencies) between arrival time measurements and other measurements (e.g., signal strength), these discrepancies (or consistencies) may be used to filter out at least those signal measurements and\/or generated location estimates that appear less accurate. In particular, such identifying by filtering can be performed by, for example, an expert system residing in the distance FOM.","A second approach for mitigating such ambiguity or conflicting MS location estimates is particularly novel in that each of the target MS location estimates is used to generate a location hypothesis regardless of its apparent accuracy. Accordingly, these location hypotheses are input to an alternative embodiment of the context adjuster  that is substantially (but not identical to) the context adjuster as described in detail in APPENDIX D so that each location hypothesis may be adjusted to enhance its accuracy. In contradistinction to the embodiment of the context adjuster  of APPENDIX D, where each location hypothesis is adjusted according to past performance of its generating FOM  in an area of the initial location estimate of the location hypothesis (the area, e.g., determined as a function of distance from this initial location estimate), this alternative embodiment adjusts each of the location hypotheses generated by a distance first order model according to a past performance of the model as applied to signal characteristic measurements from the same set of base stations  as were used in generating the location hypothesis. That is, instead of only using only an identification of the distance model (i.e., its FOM_ID) to, for example, retrieve archived location estimates generated by the model in an area of the location hypothesis' estimate (when determining the model's past performance), the retrieval retrieves only the archived location estimates that are, in addition, derived from the signal characteristics measurement obtained from the same collection of base stations  as was used in generating the location hypothesis. Thus, the adjustment performed by this embodiment of the context adjuster  adjusts according to the past performance of the distance model and the collection of base stations  used.","Coverage Area First Order Model","Radio coverage area of individual base stations  may be used to generate location estimates of the target MS . Although a first order model  based on this notion may be less accurate than other techniques, if a reasonably accurate RF coverage area is known for each (or most) of the base stations , then such a FOM (denoted hereinafter as a \u201ccoverage area first order model\u201d or simply \u201ccoverage area model\u201d) may be very reliable. To determine approximate maximum radio frequency (RF) location coverage areas, with respect to BSs , antennas and\/or sector coverage areas, for a given class (or classes) of (e.g., CDMA or TDMA) mobile station(s) , location coverage should be based on an MS's ability to adequately detect the pilot channel, as opposed to adequate signal quality for purposes of carrying user-acceptable traffic in the voice channel. Note that more energy is necessary for traffic channel activity (typically on the order of at least \u221294 to \u2212104 dBm received signal strength) to support voice, than energy needed to simply detect a pilot channel's presence for location purposes (typically a maximum weakest signal strength range of between \u2212104 to \u2212110 dBm), thus the \u201cLocation Coverage Area\u201d will generally be a larger area than that of a typical \u201cVoice Coverage Area\u201d, although industry studies have found some occurrences of \u201cno-coverage\u201d areas within a larger covered area. An example of a coverage area including both a \u201cdead zone\u201d, i.e., area of no coverage, and a \u201cnotch\u201d (of also no coverage) is shown in .","The approximate maximum RF coverage area for a given sector of (more generally angular range about) a base station  may be represented as a set of points representing a polygonal area (potentially with, e.g., holes therein to account for dead zones and\/or notches). Note that if such polygonal RF coverage area representations can be reliably determined and maintained over time (for one or more BS signal power level settings), then such representations can be used in providing a set theoretic or Venn diagram approach to estimating the location of a target MS . Coverage area first order models utilize such an approach.","In one embodiment, a coverage area model utilizes both the detection and non-detection of base stations  by the target MS  (conversely, of the MS by one or more base stations ) to define an area where the target MS  may likely be. A relatively straightforward application of this technique is to:\n\n","In the location base station (LBS) model (FOM ), a database is accessed which contains electrical, radio propagation and coverage area characteristics of each of the location base stations in the radio coverage area. The LBS model is an active model, in that it can probe or excite one or more particular LBSs  in an area for which the target MS  to be located is suspected to be placed. Accordingly, the LBS model may receive as input a most likely target MS  location estimate previously output by the location engine  of the present invention, and use this location estimate to determine which (if any) LBSs  to activate and\/or deactivate for enhancing a subsequent location estimate of the target MS. Moreover, the feedback from the activated LBSs  may be provided to other FOMs , as appropriate, as well as to the LBS model. However, it is an important aspect of the LBS model that when it receives such feedback, it may output location hypotheses having relatively small target MS  location area estimates about the active LBSs  and each such location hypothesis also has a high confidence value indicative of the target MS  positively being in the corresponding location area estimate (e.g., a confidence value of 0.9 to +1), or having a high confidence value indicative of the target MS  not being in the corresponding location area estimate (i.e., a confidence value of \u22120.9 to \u22121). Note that in some embodiments of the LBS model, these embodiments may have functionality similar to that of the coverage area first order model described above. Further note that for LBSs within a neighborhood of the target MS wherein there is a reasonable chance that with movement of the target MS may be detected by these LBSs, such LBSs may be requested to periodically activate. (Note, that it is not assumed that such LBSs have an on-line external power source; e.g., some may be solar powered). Moreover, in the case where an LBS  includes sufficient electronics to carry voice communication with the target MS  and is the primary BS for the target MS (or alternatively, in the active or candidate set), then the LBS model will not deactivate this particular LBS during its procedure of activating and deactivating various LBSs .","Stochastic First Order Model","The stochastic first order models may use statistical prediction techniques such as principle decomposition, partial least squares, or other regression techniques for predicting, for example, expected minimum and maximum distances of the target MS from one or more base stations , e.g., Bollenger Bands. Additionally, some embodiments may use Markov processes and Random Walks (predicted incremental MS movement) for determining an expected area within which the target MS  is likely to be. That is, such a process measures the incremental time differences of each pilot as the MS moves for predicting a size of a location area estimate using past MS estimates such as the verified location signatures in the location signature data base .","Pattern Recognition and Adaptive First Order Models","It is a particularly important aspect of the present invention to provide:\n\n","Regarding FOMs  using pattern recognition or associativity techniques, there are many such techniques available. For example, there are statistically based systems such as \u201cCART\u201d (an acronym for Classification and Regression Trees) by ANGOSS Software International Limited of Toronto, Canada that may be used for automatically detecting or recognizing patterns in data that were unprovided (and likely previously unknown). Accordingly, by imposing a relatively fine mesh or grid of cells on the radio coverage area, wherein each cell is entirely within a particular area type categorization such as the transmission area types (discussed in the section, \u201cCoverage Area: Area Types And Their Determination\u201d above), the verified location signature clusters within the cells of each area type may be analyzed for signal characteristic patterns. If such patterns are found, then they can be used to identify at least a likely area type in which a target MS is likely to be located. That is, one or more location hypotheses may be generated having target MS  location estimates that cover an area having the likely area type wherein the target MS  is located. Further note that such statistically based pattern recognition systems as \u201cCART\u201d include software code generators for generating expert system software embodiments for recognizing the patterns detected within a training set (e.g., the verified location signature clusters).","Accordingly, although an embodiment of a FOM as described here may not be exceedingly accurate, it may be very reliable. Thus, since a fundamental aspect of the present invention is to use a plurality MS location techniques for generating location estimates and to analyze the generated estimates (likely after being adjusted) to detect patterns of convergence or clustering among the estimates, even large MS location area estimates are useful. For example, it can be the case that four different and relatively large MS location estimates, each having very high reliability, have an area of intersection that is acceptably precise and inherits the very high reliability from each of the large MS location estimates from which the intersection area was derived.","A similar statistically based FOM  to the one above may be provided wherein the radio coverage area is decomposed substantially as above, but in addition to using the signal characteristics for detecting useful signal patterns, the specific identifications of the base station  providing the signal characteristics may also be used. Thus, assuming there is a sufficient density of verified location signature clusters in some of the mesh cells so that the statistical pattern recognizer can detect patterns in the signal characteristic measurements, an expert system may be generated that outputs a target MS  location estimate that may provide both a reliable and accurate location estimate of a target MS .","Adaptive\/Trainable First Order Models","Adaptive\/Trainable First Order Models","The term adaptive is used to describe a data processing component that can modify its data processing behavior in response to certain inputs that are used to change how subsequent inputs are processed by the component. Accordingly, a data processing component may be \u201cexplicitly adaptive\u201d by modifying its behavior according to the input of explicit instructions or control data that is input for changing the component's subsequent behavior in ways that are predictable and expected. That is, the input encodes explicit instructions that are known by a user of the component. Alternatively, a data processing component may be \u201cimplicitly adaptive\u201d in that its behavior is modified by other than instructions or control data whose meaning is known by a user of the component. For example, such implicitly adaptive data processors may learn by training on examples, by substantially unguided exploration of a solution space, or other data driven adaptive strategies such as statistically generated decision trees. Accordingly, it is an aspect of the present invention to utilize not only explicitly adaptive MS location estimators within FOMs , but also implicitly adaptive MS location estimators. In particular, artificial neural networks (also denoted neural nets and ANNs herein) are used in some embodiments as implicitly adaptive MS location estimators within FOMs. Thus, in the sections below, neural net architectures and their application to locating an MS is described.","Artificial Neural Networks For MS Location","Artificial neural networks may be particularly useful in developing one or more first order models  for locating an MS , since, for example, ANNs can be trained for classifying and\/or associatively pattern matching of various RF signal measurements such as the location signatures. That is, by training one or more artificial neural nets using RF signal measurements from verified locations so that RF signal transmissions characteristics indicative of particular locations are associated with their corresponding locations, such trained artificial neural nets can be used to provide additional target MS  location hypotheses. Moreover, it is an aspect of the present invention that the training of such artificial neural net based FOMs (ANN FOMs) is provided without manual intervention as will be discussed hereinbelow.","Artificial Neural Networks That Converge on Near Optimal Solutions","It is as an aspect of the present invention to use an adaptive neural network architecture which has the ability to explore the parameter or matrix weight space corresponding to a ANN for determining new configurations of weights that reduce an objective or error function indicating the error in the output of the ANN over some aggregate set of input data ensembles. Accordingly, in one embodiment, a genetic algorithm is used to-provide such an adaptation capability. However, it is also within the scope of the present invention to use other adaptive techniques such as, for example, simulated annealing, cascade correlation with multistarts, gradient descent with multistarts, and truncated Newton's method with multistarts, as one skilled in the art of neural network computing will understand.","Artificial Neural Networks as MS Location Estimators for First Order Models","Although there have been substantial advances in artificial neural net computing in both hardware and software, it can be difficult to choose a particular ANN architecture and appropriate training data for yielding high quality results. In choosing a ANN architecture at least the following three criteria are chosen (either implicitly or explicitly):\n\n","However, the architecture of the present invention allows substantial flexibility in the implementation of ANN for FOMs . In particular, there is no need to choose only one artificial neural net architecture and\/or implementation in that a plurality of ANNs may be accommodated by the architecture of the location engine . Furthermore, it is important to keep in mind that it may not be necessary to train a ANN for a FOM as rigorously as is done in typical ANN applications since the accuracy and reliability in estimating the location of a target MS  with the present invention comes from synergistically utilizing a plurality of different MS location estimators, each of which may be undesirable in terms of accuracy and\/or reliability in some areas, but when their estimates are synergistically used as in the location engine , accurate and reliable location estimates can be attained. Accordingly, one embodiment of the present invention may have a plurality of moderately well trained ANNs having different neural net architectures such as: multilayer perceptrons, adaptive resonance theory models, and radial basis function networks.","Additionally, many of the above mentioned ANN architecture and implementation decisions can be addressed substantially automatically by various commercial artificial neural net development systems such as: \u201cNEUROGENETIC OPTIMIZER\u201d by BioComp Systems, wherein genetic algorithms are used to optimize and configure ANNs, and artificial neural network hardware and software products by Accurate Automation Corporation of Chattanooga, Tenn., such as \u201cACCURATE AUTOMATION NEURAL NETWORK TOOLS.","Artificial Neural Network Input and Output","It is worthwhile to discuss the data representations for the inputs and outputs of a ANN used for generating MS location estimates. Regarding ANN input representations, recall that the signal processing subsystem  may provide various RF signal measurements as input to an ANN (such as the RF signal measurements derived from verified location signatures in the location signature data base ). For example, a representation of a histogram of the frequency of occurrence of CDMA fingers in a time delay versus signal strength 2-dimensional domain may be provided as input to such an ANN. In particular, a 2-dimensional grid of signal strength versus time delay bins may be provided so that received signal measurements are slotted into an appropriate bin of the grid. In one embodiment, such a grid is a six by six array of bins such as illustrated in the left portion of . That is, each of the signal strength and time delay axes are partitioned into six ranges so that both the signal strength and the time delay of RF signal measurements can be slotted into an appropriate range, thus determining the bin.","Note that RF signal measurement data (i.e., location signatures) slotted into a grid of bins provides a convenient mechanism for classifying RF measurements received over time so that when each new RF measurement data is assigned to its bin, a counter for the bin can be incremented. Thus in one embodiment, the RF measurements for each bin can be represented pictorially as a histogram. In any case, once the RF measurements have been slotted into a grid, various filters may be applied for filtering outliers and noise prior to inputting bin values to an ANN. Further, various amounts of data from such a grid may be provided to an ANN. In one embodiment, the tally from each bin is provided to an ANN. Thus, as many as 108 values could be input to the ANN (two values defining each bin, and a tally for the bin). However, other representations are also possible. For instance, by ordering the bin tallies linearly, only 36 need be provided as ANN input. Alternatively, only representations of bins having the highest tallies may be provided as ANN input. Thus, for example, if the highest 10 bins and their tallies were provided as ANN input, then only 20 inputs need be provided (i.e., 10 input pairs, each having a single bin identifier and a corresponding tally).","In addition, note that the signal processing subsystem  may also obtain the identifications of other base stations  (15.2) for which their pilot channels can be detected by the target MS  (i.e., the forward path), or for which the base stations can detect a signal from the target MS (i.e., the reverse path). Thus, in order to effectively utilize substantially all pertinent location RF signal measurements (i.e., from location signature data derived from communications between the target MS  and the base station infrastructure), a technique is provided wherein a plurality of ANNs may be activated using various portions of an ensemble of location signature data obtained. However, before describing this technique, it is worthwhile to note that a naive strategy of providing input to a single ANN for locating target MSs throughout an area having a large number of base stations (e.g., ) is likely to be undesirable. That is, given that each base station (antenna sector) nearby the target MS is potentially able to provide the ANN with location signature data, the ANN would have to be extremely large and therefore may require inordinate training and retraining. For example, since there may be approximately 30 to 60 ANN inputs per location signature, an ANN for an area having even twenty base stations  can require at least 600 input neurons, and potentially as many as 1,420 (i.e., 20 base stations with 70 inputs per base station and one input for every one of possibly  additional surrounding base stations in the radio coverage area  that might be able to detect, or be detected by, a target MS  in the area corresponding to the ANN).","Accordingly, the technique described herein limits the number of input neurons in each ANN constructed and generates a larger number of these smaller ANNs. That is, each ANN is trained on location signature data (or, more precisely, portions of location signature clusters) in an area A(hereinafter also denoted the \u201cnet area\u201d), wherein each input neuron receives a unique input from one of:\n\n","Thus, by generating an ANN for each of a plurality of net areas (potentially overlapping), a local environmental change in the wireless signal characteristics of one net area is unlikely to affect more than a small number of adjacent or overlapping net areas. Accordingly, such local environmental changes can be reflected in that only the ANNs having net areas affected by the local change need to be retrained. Additionally, note that in cases where RF measurements from a target MS  are received across multiple net areas, multiple ANNs may be activated, thus providing multiple MS location estimates. Further, multiple ANNs may be activated when a location signature cluster is received for a target MS  and location signature cluster includes location signature data corresponding to wireless transmissions between the MS and, e.g., more base stations (antenna sectors) than needed for the collection B described in the previous section. That is, if each collection B identifies four base stations  (antenna sectors), and a received location signature cluster includes location signature data corresponding to five base stations (antenna sectors), then there may be up to five ANNs activated to each generate a location estimate.","Moreover, for each of the smaller ANNs, it is likely that the number of input neurons is on the order of 330; (i.e., 70 inputs per each of four location signatures (i.e., 35 inputs for the forward wireless communications and 35 for the reverse wireless communications), plus 40 additional discrete inputs for an appropriate area surrounding A, plus 10 inputs related to: the type of MS, power levels, etc.). However, it is important to note that the number of base stations (or antenna sectors ) having corresponding location signature data to be provided to such an ANN may vary. Thus, in some subareas of the coverage area , location signature data from five or more base stations (antenna sectors) may be used, whereas in other subareas three (or less) may be used.","Regarding the output from ANNs used in generating MS location estimates, there are also numerous options. In one embodiment, two values corresponding to the latitude and longitude of the target MS are estimated. Alternatively, by applying a mesh to the coverage area , such ANN output may be in the form of a row value and a column value of a particular mesh cell (and its corresponding area) where the target MS is estimated to be. Note that the cell sizes of the mesh need not be of a particular shape nor of uniform size. However, simple non-oblong shapes are desirable. Moreover, such cells should be sized so that each cell has an area approximately the size of the maximum degree of location precision desired. Thus, assuming square mesh cells, 250 to 350 feet per cell side in an urban\/suburban area, and 500 to 700 feet per cell side in a rural area may be desirable.","Artificial Neural Network Training","The following are steps provide one embodiment for training a location estimating ANN according to the present invention.\n\n","Regarding (d) immediately above, it is important to note that it is believed that less accuracy is required in training a ANN used for generating a location hypothesis (in a FOM ) for the present invention than in most applications of ANNs (or other trainable\/adaptive components) since, in most circumstances, when signal measurements are provided for locating a target MS , the location engine  will activate a plurality location hypothesis generating modules (corresponding to one or more FOMs ) for substantially simultaneously generating a plurality of different location estimates (i.e., hypotheses). Thus, instead of training each ANN so that it is expected to be, e.g., 92% or higher in accuracy, it is believed that synergies with MS location estimates from other location hypothesis generating components will effectively compensate for any reduced accuracy in such a ANN (or any other location hypothesis generating component). Accordingly, it is believed that training time for such ANNs may be reduced without substantially impacting the MS locating performance of the location engine .","Finding Near-Optimal Location Estimating Artificial Neural Networks","In one traditional artificial neural network training process, a relatively tedious set of trial and error steps may be performed for configuring an ANN so that training produces effective learning. In particular, an ANN may require configuring parameters related to, for example, input data scaling, test\/training set classification, detecting and removing unnecessary input variable selection. However, the present invention reduces this tedium. That is, the present invention uses mechanisms such as genetic algorithms or other mechanisms for avoiding non-optimal but locally appealing (i.e., local minimum) solutions, and locating near-optimal solutions instead. In particular, such mechanism may be used to adjust the matrix of weights for the ANNs so that very good, near optimal ANN configurations may be found efficiently. Furthermore, since the signal processing system  uses various types of signal processing filters for filtering the RF measurements received from transmissions between an MS  and one or more base stations (antenna sectors ), such mechanisms for finding near-optimal solutions may be applied to selecting appropriate filters as well. Accordingly, in one embodiment of the present invention, such filters are paired with particular ANNs so that the location signature data supplied to each ANN is filtered according to a corresponding \u201cfilter description\u201d for the ANN, wherein the filter description specifies the filters to be used on location signature data prior to inputting this data to the ANN. In particular, the filter description can define a pipeline of filters having a sequence of filters wherein for each two consecutive filters, fand f(fpreceding f), in a filter description, the output of fflows as input to f. Accordingly, by encoding such a filter description together with its corresponding ANN so that the encoding can be provided to a near optimal solution finding mechanism such as a genetic algorithm, it is believed that enhanced ANN locating performance can be obtained. That is, the combined genetic codes of the filter description and the ANN are manipulated by the genetic algorithm in a search for a satisfactory solution (i.e., location error estimates within a desired range). This process and system provides a mechanism for optimizing not only the artificial neural network architecture, but also identifying a near optimal match between the ANN and one or more signal processing filters. Accordingly, the following filters may be used in a filter pipeline of a filter description: Sobel, median, mean, histogram normalization, input cropping, neighbor, Gaussian, Weiner filters.","One embodiment for implementing the genetic evolving of filter description and ANN pairs is provided by the following steps that may automatically performed without substantial manual effort:\n\n","Note that artificial neural network genotypes may be formed by selecting various types of artificial neural network architectures suited to function approximation, such as fast back propagation, as well as characterizing several varieties of candidate transfer\/activation functions, such as Tanh, logistic, linear, sigmoid and radial basis. Furthermore, ANNs having complex inputs may be selected (as determined by a filter type in the signal processing subsystem ) for the genotypes.","Examples of genetic parameters include: (a) maximum population size (typical default: 300), (b) generation limit (typical default: 50), (c) selection criteria, such as a certain percentage to survive (typical default: 0.5) or roulette wheel, (d) population refilling, such as random or cloning (default), (e) mating criteria, such as tail swapping (default) or two cut swapping, (f) rate for a choice of mutation criterion, such as random exchange (default: 0.25) or section reversal, (g) population size of the concatenated artificial neural network\/filter combinations, (h) use of statistical seeding on the initial population to bias the random initialization toward stronger first order relating variables, and (i) neural node influence factors, e.g., input nodes and hidden nodes. Such parameters can be used as weighting factors that influences the degree the system optimizes for accuracy versus network compactness. For example, an input node factor greater than 0 provides a means to reward artificial neural networks constructed that use fewer input variables (nodes). A reasonable default value is 0.1 for both input and hidden node factors.","Examples of neural net\/filter description system control parameters include: (a) accuracy of modeling parameters, such as relative accuracy, R-squared, mean squared error, root mean squared error or average absolute error (default), and (b) stopping criteria parameters, such as generations run, elapsed time, best accuracy found and population convergence.","Locating a Mobile Station Using Artificial Neural Networks","When using an artificial neural network for estimating a location of an MS , it is important that the artificial neural network be provided with as much accurate RF signal measurement data regarding signal transmissions between the target MS  and the base station infrastructure as possible. In particular, assuming ANN inputs as described hereinabove, it is desirable to obtain the detection states of as many surrounding base stations as possible. Thus, whenever the location engine  is requested to locate a target MS  (and in particular in an emergency context such as an emergency 911 call), the location center  automatically transmits a request to the wireless infrastructure to which the target MS is assigned for instructing the MS to raise its transmission power to full power for a short period of time (e.g., 100 milliseconds in a base station infrastructure configuration an optimized for such requests to 2 seconds in a non-optimized configuration). Note that the request for a change in the transmission power level of the target MS has a further advantage for location requests such as emergency 911 that are initiated from the MS itself in that a first ensemble of RF signal measurements can be provided to the location engine  at the initial 911 calling power level and then a second ensemble of RF signal measurements can be provided at a second higher transmission power level. Thus, in one embodiment of the present invention, an artificial neural network can be trained not only on the location signature cluster derived from either the initial wireless 911 transmissions or the full power transmissions, but also on the differences between these two transmissions. In particular, the difference in the detection states of the discrete ANN inputs between the two transmission power levels may provide useful additional information for more accurately estimating a location of a target MS.","It is important to note that when gathering RF signal measurements from a wireless base station network for locating MSs, the network should not be overburdened with location related traffic. Accordingly, note that network location data requests for data particularly useful for ANN based FOMs is generally confined to the requests to the base stations in the immediate area of a target MS  whose location is desired. For instance, both collections of base stations B\u2032 and b discussed in the context of training an ANN are also the same collections of base stations from which MS location data would be requested. Thus, the wireless network MS location data requests are data driven in that the base stations to queried for location data (i.e., the collections B\u2032 and b) are determined by previous RF signal measurement characteristics recorded. Accordingly, the selection of the collections B\u2032 and b are adaptable to changes in the wireless environmental characteristics of the coverage area .","Location Signature Data Base","Before proceeding with a description of other levels of the present invention as described in (24.1) through (24.3) above, in this section further detail is provided regarding the location signature data base . Note that a brief description of the location signature data base was provided above indicating that this data base stores MS location data from verified and\/or known locations (optionally with additional known environmental characteristic values) for use in enhancing current target MS location hypotheses and for comparing archived location data with location signal data obtained from a current target MS. However, the data base management system functionality incorporated into the location signature data base  is an important aspect of the present invention, and is therefore described in this section. In particular, the data base management functionality described herein addresses a number of difficulties encountered in maintaining a large archive of signal processing data such as MS signal location data. Some of these difficulties can be described as follows:\n\n","It is an aspect of the present invention that the data base management functionality of the location signature data base  addresses each of the difficulties mentioned immediately above.

In one embodiment, the most likelihood estimator performs an integration or summing of all location hypothesis confidence values for any geographic region(s) of interest having at least one location hypothesis that has been provided to the most likelihood estimator, and wherein the location hypothesis has a relatively (or sufficiently) high confidence.

Note that both speed and direction can be important constraints; e.g., even though a speed might be appropriate for an area, such as 20 mph in a dense urban area, if the direction indicated by a time series of related location hypotheses is directly through an extensive building complex having no through traffic routes, then a reduction in the confidence of one or more of the location hypotheses may be appropriate.","One embodiment of the Analytical Reasoner illustrating how such constraints may be implemented is provided in the following section.

For instance, if a time series of target MS location hypotheses for a given FOM is predicting a path of the target MS that lies along an interstate highway, the confidence of the currently active location hypothesis for this FOM should, in general, be increased.

For example, the attribute may be a \u201ctarget MS path data\u201d attribute, wherein a value for the attribute is an estimated target MS path derived from location hypotheses generated by a fixed FOM over some (recent) time period. Alternatively, the attribute might be, for example, one of a velocity and\/or acceleration, wherein a value for the attribute is a velocity and\/or acceleration derived from location hypotheses generated by a fixed FOM over some (recent) time period.","In a general context, the attribute comparison module  operates according to the following premise:","(38.1) for each of two or more currently active location hypotheses (with, e.g., positive confidences) if:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0381","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0136","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0136-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0137","list-style":"none"},"li":["(a) each of these currently active location hypotheses, H, was initially generated by a corresponding different FOM;","(b) for a given MS estimate attribute and each such currently active location hypothesis, H, there is a corresponding value for the attribute (e.g., the attribute value might be an MS path estimate, or alternatively an MS estimated velocity, or an MS estimated acceleration), wherein the attribute value is derived without using a FOM different from FOM, and;","(c) the derived attribute values cluster sufficiently well,\n\nthen each of these currently active location hypotheses, H, will have their corresponding confidences increased.

Accordingly, for each of the confidence adjustment types, T, above, there is a corresponding system setable parameter, \u201calpha_T\u201d, that is tunable by the adaptation engine . Accordingly, the following high level program segment illustrates the aggregate confidence adjustment value computed by the Analytical Reasoner Controller.\n\n","The historical location reasoner module  may be, for example, a daemon or expert system rule base. The module adjusts the confidences of currently active location hypotheses by using (from location signature data base ) historical signal data correlated with: (a) verified MS locations (e.g. locations verified when emergency personnel co-locate with a target MS location), and (b) various environmental factors to evaluate how consistent the location signature cluster for an input location hypothesis agrees with such historical signal data.","This reasoner will increase\/decrease the confidence of a currently active location hypothesis depending on how well its associated loc sigs correlate with the loc sigs obtained from data in the location signature data base.","Note that the embodiment hereinbelow is but one of many embodiments that may adjust the confidence of currently active location hypotheses appropriately. Accordingly, it is important to note other embodiments of the historical location reasoner functionality are within the scope of the present invention as one skilled in the art will appreciate upon examining the techniques utilized within this specification. For example, calculations of a confidence adjustment factor may be determined using Monte Carlo techniques as in the context adjuster . Each such embodiment generates a measurement of at least one of the similarity and the discrepancy between the signal characteristics of the verified location signature clusters in the location signature data base and the location signature cluster for an input currently active location hypothesis, \u201cloc_hyp\u201d.","The embodiment hereinbelow provides one example of the functionality that can be provided by the historical location reasoner  (either by activating the following programs as a daemon or by transforming various program segments into the consequents of expert system rules). The present embodiment generates such a confidence adjustment by the following steps:\n\n","The program illustrated in APPENDIX E provides a more detailed embodiment of the steps immediately above.","Location Extrapolator","The location extrapolator  works on the following premise: if for a currently active location hypothesis there is sufficient previous related information regarding estimates of the target MS (e.g., from the same FOM or from using a \u201cmost likely\u201d previous target MS estimate output by the location engine ), then an extrapolation may be performed for predicting future target MS locations that can be compared with new location hypotheses provided to the blackboard. Note that interpolation routines (e.g., conventional algorithms such as Lagrange or Newton polynomials) may be used to determine an equation that approximates a target MS path corresponding to a currently active location hypothesis.","Subsequently, such an extrapolation equation may be used to compute a future target MS location. For further information regarding such interpolation schemes, the following reference is incorporated herein by reference: Mathews, 1992, Numerical methods for mathematics, science, and engineering. Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice Hall.","Accordingly, if a new currently active location hypothesis (e.g., supplied by the context adjuster) is received by the blackboard; then the target MS location estimate of the new location hypothesis may be compared with the predicted location. Consequently, a confidence adjustment value can be determined according to how well the new location hypothesis \u201ci\u201d fits with the predicted location. That is, this confidence adjustment value will be larger as the new MS estimate and the predicted estimate become closer together.","Note that in one embodiment of the present invention, such predictions are based solely on previous target MS location estimates output by location engine . Thus, in such an embodiment, substantially every currently active location hypothesis can be provided with a confidence adjustment value by this module once a sufficient numberof previous target MS location estimates have been output. Accordingly, a value, extrapolation_chk(i), that represents how accurately the new currently active location hypothesis (identified here by \u201ci\u201d) matches the predicted location is determined.","Hypothesis Generating Module","The hypothesis generating module  is used for generating additional location hypotheses according to, for example, MS location information not adequately utilized or modeled. Note, location hypotheses may also be decomposed here if, for example it is determined that a location hypothesis includes an MS area estimate that has subareas with radically different characteristics such as an area that includes an uninhabited area and a densely populated area. Additionally, the hypothesis generating module  may generate \u201cpoor reception\u201d location hypotheses that specify MS location areas of known poor reception that are \u201cnear\u201d or intersect currently active location hypotheses. Note, that these poor reception location hypotheses may be specially tagged (e.g., with a distinctive FOM_ID value or specific tag field) so that regardless of substantially any other location hypothesis confidence value overlapping such a poor reception area, such an area will maintain a confidence value of \u201cunknown\u201d (i.e., zero). Note that substantially the only exception to this constraint is location hypotheses generated from mobile base stations .","Mobile Base Station Location Subsystem Description","Mobile Base Station Subsystem Introduction","Any collection of mobile electronics (denoted mobile location unit) that is able to both estimate a location of a target MS  and communicate with the base station network may be utilized by the present invention to more accurately locate the target MS. Such mobile location units may provide greater target MS location accuracy by, for example, homing in on the target MS and by transmitting additional MS location information to the location center . There are a number of embodiments for such a mobile location unit contemplated by the present invention. For example, in a minimal version, such the electronics of the mobile location unit may be little more than an onboard MS , a sectored\/directional antenna and a controller for communicating between them. Thus, the onboard MS is used to communicate with the location center  and possibly the target MS , while the antenna monitors signals for homing in on the target MS . In an enhanced version of the mobile location unit, a GPS receiver may also be incorporated so that the location of the mobile location unit may be determined and consequently an estimate of the location of the target MS may also be determined. However, such a mobile location unit is unlikely to be able to determine substantially more than a direction of the target MS  via the sectored\/directional antenna without further base station infrastructure cooperation in, for example, determining the transmission power level of the target MS or varying this power level. Thus, if the target MS or the mobile location unit leaves the coverage area  or resides in a poor communication area, it may be difficult to accurately determine where the target MS is located. None-the-less, such mobile location units may be sufficient for many situations, and in fact the present invention contemplates their use. However, in cases where direct communication with the target MS is desired without constant contact with the base station infrastructure, the present invention includes a mobile location unit that is also a scaled down version of a base station . Thus, given that such a mobile base station or MBS  includes at least an onboard MS , a sectored\/directional antenna, a GPS receiver, a scaled down base station  and sufficient components (including a controller) for integrating the capabilities of these devices, an enhanced autonomous MS mobile location system can be provided that can be effectively used in, for example, emergency vehicles, airplanes and boats. Accordingly, the description that follows below describes an embodiment of an MBS  having the above mentioned components and capabilities for use in a vehicle.","As a consequence of the MBS  being mobile, there are fundamental differences in the operation of an MBS in comparison to other types of BS's  (). In particular, other types of base stations have fixed locations that are precisely determined and known by the location center, whereas a location of an MBS  may be known only approximately and thus may require repeated and frequent re-estimating. Secondly, other types of base stations have substantially fixed and stable communication with the location center (via possibly other BS's in the case of LBSs ) and therefore although these BS's may be more reliable in their in their ability to communicate information related to the location of a target MS with the location center, accuracy can be problematic in poor reception areas. Thus, MBS's may be used in areas (such as wilderness areas) where there may be no other means for reliably and cost effectively locating a target MS  (i.e., there may be insufficient fixed location BS's coverage in an area).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0404","num":"0706"},"figref":"FIG. 11","b":["1508","142","1512","140","1508","148","142","148","148","140"]},"Additionally, many commercial wireless telephony technologies require all BS's in a network to be very accurately time synchronized both for transmitting MS voice communication as well as for other services such as MS location. Accordingly, the MBS  will also require such time synchronization. However, since an MBS  may not be in constant communication with the fixed location BS network (and indeed may be off-line for substantial periods of time), on-board highly accurate timing device may be necessary. In one embodiment, such a device may be a commercially available ribidium oscillator  as shown in .","Since the MBS , includes a scaled down version of a BS  (denoted  in ), it is capable of performing most typical BS  tasks, albeit on a reduced scale. In particular, the base station portion of the MBS  can:\n\n","Moreover, the MBS  has an additional advantage in that it can substantially increase the reliability of communication with a target MS  in comparison to the base station infrastructure by being able to move toward or track the target MS  even if this MS is in (or moves into) a reduced infrastructure base station network coverage area. Furthermore, an MBS  may preferably use a directional or smart antenna  to more accurately locate a direction of signals from a target MS . Thus, the sweeping of such a smart antenna  (physically or electronically) provides directional information regarding signals received from the target MS . That is, such directional information is determined by the signal propagation delay of signals from the target MS  to the angular sectors of one of more directional antennas  on-board the MBS .","Before proceeding to further details of the MBS location subsystem , an example of the operation of an MBS  in the context of responding to a 911 emergency call is given. In particular, this example describes the high level computational states through which the MBS  transitions, these states also being illustrated in the state transition diagram of . Note that this figure illustrates the primary state transitions between these MBS  states, wherein the solid state transitions are indicative of a typical \u201cideal\u201d progression when locating or tracking a target MS , and the dashed state transitions are the primary state reversions due, for example, to difficulties in locating the target MS .","Accordingly, initially the MBS  may be in an inactive state , wherein the MBS location subsystem  is effectively available for voice or data communication with the fixed location base station network, but the MS  locating capabilities of the MBS are not active. From the inactive state  the MBS (e.g., a police or rescue vehicle) may enter an active state  once an MBS operator has logged onto the MBS location subsystem of the MBS, such logging being for authentication, verification and journaling of MBS  events. In the active state , the MBS may be listed by a 911 emergency center and\/or the location center  as eligible for service in responding to a 911 request. From this state, the MBS  may transition to a ready state  signifying that the MBS is ready for use in locating and\/or intercepting a target MS . That is, the MBS  may transition to the ready state  by performing the following steps:\n\n","Thus, while in the ready state , as the MBS  moves, it has its location repeatedly (re)-estimated via, for example, GPS signals, location center  location estimates from the base stations  (and ), and an on-board deadreckoning subsystem  having an MBS location estimator according to the programs described hereinbelow. However, note that the accuracy of the base station time synchronization (via the ribidium oscillator ) and the accuracy of the MBS  location may need to both be periodically recalibrated according to (1a) and (1b) above.","Assuming a 911 signal is transmitted by a target MS , this signal is transmitted, via the fixed location base station infrastructure, to the 911 emergency center and the location center , and assuming the MBS  is in the ready state , if a corresponding 911 emergency request is transmitted to the MBS (via the base station infrastructure) from the 911 emergency center or the location center, then the MBS may transition to a seek state  by performing the following steps:\n\n","Subsequently, when the MBS  is in the seek state , the MBS may commence toward the target MS location estimate provided. Note that it is likely that the MBS is not initially in direct signal contact with the target MS. Accordingly, in the seek state  the following steps may be, for example, performed:\n\n","Assuming that the MBS  and target MS  detect one another (which typically occurs when the two units are within 0.25 to 3 miles of one another), the MBS enters a contact state  when the target MS  enters a soft hand-off state with the MBS.","Accordingly, in the contact state , the following steps are, for example, performed:\n\n","When the target MS  detects that the MBS pilot channel is sufficiently strong, the target MS may switch to using the MBS  as its primary base station. When this occurs, the MBS enters a control state , wherein the following steps are, for example, performed:\n\n","Note, there can be more than one MBS  tracking or locating an MS . There can also be more than one target MS  to be tracked concurrently and each target MS being tracked may be stationary or moving.","MBS Subsystem Architecture","An MBS  uses MS signal characteristic data for locating the MS . The MBS  may use such signal characteristic data to facilitate determining whether a given signal from the MS is a \u201cdirect shot\u201d or an multipath signal. That is, in one embodiment, the MBS  attempts to determine or detect whether an MS signal transmission is received directly, or whether the transmission has been reflected or deflected. For example, the MBS may determine whether the expected signal strength, and TOA agree in distance estimates for the MS signal transmissions. Note, other signal characteristics may also be used, if there are sufficient electronics and processing available to the MBS ; i.e., determining signal phase and\/or polarity as other indications of receiving a \u201cdirect shot\u201d from an MS .","In one embodiment, the MBS  () includes an MBS controller  for controlling the location capabilities of the MBS . In particular, the MBS controller  initiates and controls the MBS state changes as described in  above. Additionally, the MBS controller  also communicates with the location controller , wherein this latter controller controls MBS activities related to MBS location and target MS location; e.g., this performs the program, \u201cmobile_base_station_controller\u201d described in APPENDIX A hereinbelow. The location controller  receives data input from an event generator  for generating event records to be provided to the location controller . For example, records may be generated from data input received from: (a) the vehicle movement detector  indicating that the MBS  has moved at least a predetermined amount and\/or has changed direction by at least a predetermined angle, or (b) the MBS signal processing subsystem  indicating that the additional signal measurement data has been received from either the location center  or the target MS . Note that the MBS signal processing subsystem , in one embodiment, is similar to the signal processing subsystem  of the location center . Moreover, also note that there may be multiple command schedulers. In particular, a scheduler  for commands related to communicating with the location center , a scheduler  for commands related to GPS communication (via GPS receiver ), a scheduler  for commands related to the frequency and granularity of the reporting of MBS changes in direction and\/or position via the MBS deadreckoning subsystem  (note that this scheduler is potentially optional and that such commands may be provided directly to the deadreckoning estimator ), and a scheduler  for communicating with the target MS(s)  being located. Further, it is assumed that there is sufficient hardware and\/or software to perform commands in different schedulers substantially concurrently.","In order to display an MBS computed location of a target MS , a location of the MBS must be known or determined. Accordingly, each MBS  has a plurality of MBS location estimators (or hereinafter also simply referred to as location estimators) for determining the location of the MBS. Each such location estimator computes MBS location information such as MBS location estimates, changes to MBS location estimates, or, an MBS location estimator may be an interface for buffering and\/or translating a previously computed MBS location estimate into an appropriate format. In particular, the MBS location module , which determines the location of the MBS, may include the following MBS location estimators  (also denoted baseline location estimators):\n\n","Additionally, note that a plurality of MBS location technologies and their corresponding MBS location estimators are utilized due to the fact that there is currently no single location technology available that is both sufficiently fast, accurate and accessible in substantially all terrains to meet the location needs of an MBS . For example, in many terrains GPS technologies may be sufficiently accurate; however, GPS technologies: (a) may require a relatively long time to provide an initial location estimate (e.g., greater than 2 minutes); (b) when GPS communication is disturbed, it may require an equally long time to provide a new location estimate; (c) clouds, buildings and\/or mountains can prevent location estimates from being obtained; (d) in some cases signal reflections can substantially skew a location estimate. As another example, an MBS  may be able to use triangulation or trilateralization technologies to obtain a location estimate; however, this assumes that there is sufficient (fixed location) infrastructure BS coverage in the area the MBS is located. Further, it is well known that the multipath phenomenon can substantially distort such location estimates. Thus, for an MBS  to be highly effective in varied terrains, an MBS is provided with a plurality of location technologies, each supplying an MBS location estimate.","In fact, much of the architecture of the location engine  could be incorporated into an MBS . For example, in some embodiments of the MBS , the following FOMs  may have similar location models incorporated into the MBS:\n\n","However, for those MBS location models requiring communication with the base station infrastructure, an alternative embodiment is to rely on the location center  to perform the computations for at least some of these MBS FOM models. That is, since each of the MBS location models mentioned immediately above require communication with the network of fixed location BS's  (), it may be advantageous to transmit MBS location estimating data to the location center  as if the MBS were another MS  for the location center to locate, and thereby rely on the location estimation capabilities at the location center rather than duplicate such models in the MBS . The advantages of this approach are that:\n\n","As will be discussed further below, in one embodiment of the MBS , there are confidence values assigned to the locations output by the various location estimators . Thus, the confidence for a manual entry of location data by an MBS operator may be rated the highest and followed by the confidence for (any) GPS location data, followed by the confidence for (any) location center location  estimates, followed by the confidence for (any) location estimates using signal characteristic data from LBSs. However, such prioritization may vary depending on, for instance, the radio coverage area . In an one embodiment of the present invention, it is an aspect of the present invention that for MBS location data received from the GPS and location center, their confidences may vary according to the area in which the MBS  resides. That is, if it is known that for a given area, there is a reasonable probability that a GPS signal may suffer multipath distortions and that the location center has in the past provided reliable location estimates, then the confidences for these two location sources may be reversed.","In one embodiment of the present invention, MBS operators may be requested to occasionally manually enter the location of the MBS  when the MBS is stationary for determining and\/or calibrating the accuracy of various MBS location estimators.","There is an additional important source of location information for the MBS  that is incorporated into an MBS vehicle (such as a police vehicle) that has no comparable functionality in the network of fixed location BS's. That is, the MBS  may use deadreckoning information provided by a deadreckoning MBS location estimator  whereby the MBS may obtain MBS deadreckoning location change estimates. Accordingly, the deadreckoning MBS location estimator  may use, for example, an on-board gyroscope , a wheel rotation measurement device (e.g., odometer) , and optionally an accelerometer (not shown). Thus, such a deadreckoning MBS location estimator  periodically provides at least MBS distance and directional data related to MBS movements from a most recent MBS location estimate. More precisely, in the absence of any other new MBS location to information, the deadreckoning MBS location estimator  outputs a series of measurements, wherein each such measurement is an estimated change (or delta) in the position of the MBS  between a request input timestamp and a closest time prior to the timestamp, wherein a previous deadreckoning terminated. Thus, each deadreckoning location change estimate includes the following fields:\n\n","Further, the frequency of such measurements provided by the deadreckoning subsystem  may be adaptively provided depending on the velocity of the MBS  and\/or the elapsed time since the most recent MBS location update. Accordingly, the architecture of at least some embodiments of the MBS location subsystem  must be such that it can utilize such deadreckoning information for estimating the location of the MBS .","In one embodiment of the MBS location subsystem  described in further detail hereinbelow, the outputs from the deadreckoning MBS location estimator  are used to synchronize MBS location estimates from different MBS baseline location estimators. That is, since such a deadreckoning output may be requested for substantially any time from the deadreckoning MBS location estimator, such an output can be requested for substantially the same point in time as the occurrence of the signals from which a new MBS baseline location estimate is derived. Accordingly, such a deadreckoning output can be used to update other MBS location estimates not using the new MBS baseline location estimate.","It is assumed that the error with deadreckoning increases with deadreckoning distance. Accordingly, it is an aspect of the embodiment of the MBS location subsystem  that when incrementally updating the location of the MBS  using deadreckoning and applying deadreckoning location change estimates to a \u201cmost likely area\u201d in which the MBS  is believed to be, this area is incrementally enlarged as well as shifted. The enlargement of the area is used to account for the inaccuracy in the deadreckoning capability. Note, however, that the deadreckoning MBS location estimator is periodically reset so that the error accumulation in its outputs can be decreased. In particular, such resetting occurs when there is a high probability that the location of the MBS is known. For example, the deadreckoning MBS location estimator may be reset when an MBS operator manually enters an MBS location or verifies an MBS location, or a computed MBS location has sufficiently high confidence.","Thus, due to the MBS  having less accurate location information (both about itself and a target MS ), and further that deadreckoning information must be utilized in maintaining MBS location estimates, a first embodiment of the MBS location subsystem architecture is somewhat different from the location engine  architecture. That is, the architecture of this first embodiment is simpler than that of the architecture of the location engine . However, it important to note that, at a high level, the architecture of the location engine  may also be applied for providing a second embodiment of the MBS location subsystem , as one skilled in the art will appreciate after reflecting on the architectures and processing provided at an MBS . For example, an MBS location subsystem  architecture may be provided that has one or more first order models  whose output is supplied to, for example, a blackboard or expert system for resolving MBS location estimate conflicts, such an architecture being analogous to one embodiment of the location engine  architecture.","Furthermore, it is also an important aspect of the present invention that, at a high level, the MBS location subsystem architecture may also be applied as an alternative architecture for the location engine . For example, in one embodiment of the location engine , each of the first order models  may provide its MS location hypothesis outputs to a corresponding \u201clocation track,\u201d analogous to the MBS location tracks described hereinbelow, and subsequently, a most likely MS current location estimate may be developed in a \u201ccurrent location track\u201d (also described hereinbelow) using the most recent location estimates in other location tracks.","Further, note that the ideas and methods discussed here relating to MBS location estimators  and MBS location tracks, and; the related programs hereinbelow are sufficiently general so that these ideas and methods may be applied in a number of contexts related to determining the location of a device capable of movement and wherein the location of the device must be maintained in real time. For example, the present ideas and methods may be used by a robot in a very cluttered environment (e.g., a warehouse), wherein the robot has access: (a) to a plurality of \u201crobot location estimators\u201d that may provide the robot with sporadic location information, and (b) to a dead reckoning location estimator.","Each MBS , additionally, has a location display (denoted the MBS operator visual user interface  in ) where area maps that may be displayed together with location data. In particular, MS location data may be displayed on this display as a nested collection of areas, each smaller nested area being the most likely area within (any) encompassing area for locating a target MS . Note that the MBS controller algorithm below may be adapted to receive location center  data for displaying the locations of other MBSs  as well as target MSs .","Further, the MBS  may constrain any location estimates to streets on a street map using the MBS location snap to street module . For example, an estimated MBS location not on a street may be \u201csnapped to\u201d a nearest street location. Note that a nearest street location determiner may use \u201cnormal\u201d orientations of vehicles on streets as a constraint on the nearest street location, particularly, if an MBS  is moving at typical rates of speed and acceleration, and without abrupt changes in direction. For example, if the deadreckoning MBS location estimator  indicates that the MBS  is moving in a northerly direction, then the street snapped to should be a north-south running street. Moreover, the MBS location snap to street module  may also be used to enhance target MS location estimates when, for example, it is known or suspected that the target MS  is in a vehicle and the vehicle is moving at typical rates of speed. Furthermore, the snap to street location module  may also be used in enhancing the location of a target MS  by either the MBS  or by the location engine . In particular, the location estimator  or an additional module between the location estimator  and the output gateway  may utilize an embodiment of the snap to street location module  to enhance the accuracy of target MS  location estimates that are known to be in vehicles. Note that this may be especially useful in locating stolen vehicles that have embedded wireless location transceivers (MSs ), wherein appropriate wireless signal measurements can be provided to the location center .","MBS Data Structure Remarks","Assuming the existence of at least some of the location estimators  that were mentioned above, the discussion here refers substantially to the data structures and their organization as illustrated in .","The location estimates (or hypotheses) for an MBS  determining its own location each have an error or range estimate associated with the MBS location estimate. That is, each such MBS location estimate includes a \u201cmost likely MBS point location\u201d within a \u201cmost likely area\u201d. The \u201cmost likely MBS point location\u201d is assumed herein to be the centroid of the \u201cmost likely area.\u201d In one embodiment of the MBS location subsystem , a nested series of \u201cmost likely areas\u201d may be provided about a most likely MBS point location. However, to simplify the discussion herein each MBS location estimate is assumed to have a single \u201cmost likely area\u201d. One skilled in the art will understand how to provide such nested \u201cmost likely areas\u201d from the description herein. Additionally, it is assumed that such \u201cmost likely areas\u201d are not grossly oblong; i.e., area cross sectioning lines through the centroid of the area do not have large differences in their lengths. For example, for any such \u201cmost likely area\u201d, A, no two such cross sectioning lines of A may have lengths that vary by more than a factor of two.","Each MBS location estimate also has a confidence associated therewith providing a measurement of the perceived accuracy of the MBS being in the \u201cmost likely area\u201d of the location estimate.","A (MBS) \u201clocation track\u201d is an data structure (or object) having a queue of a predetermined length for maintaining a temporal (timestamp) ordering of \u201clocation track entries\u201d such as the location track entries , , , , , , , , and (), wherein each such MBS location track entry is an estimate of the location of the MBS at a particular corresponding time.","There is an MBS location track for storing MBS location entries obtained from MBS location estimation information from each of the MBS baseline location estimators described above (i.e., a GPS location track  for storing MBS location estimations obtained from the GPS location estimator , a location center location track  for storing MBS location estimations obtained from the location estimator  deriving its MBS location estimates from the location center , an LBS location track  for storing MBS location estimations obtained from the location estimator  deriving its MBS location estimates from base stations  and\/or , and a manual location track  for MBS operator entered MBS locations). Additionally, there is one further location track, denoted the \u201ccurrent location track\u201d  whose location track entries may be derived from the entries in the other location tracks (described further hereinbelow). Further, for each location track, there is a location track head that is the head of the queue for the location track. The location track head is the most recent (and presumably the most accurate) MBS location estimate residing in the location track. Thus, the GPS location track  has location track head ; the location center location track  has location track head ; the LBS location track  has location track head ; the manual location track  has location track head ; and the current location track  has location track head . Additionally, for notational convenience, for each location track, the time series of previous MBS location estimations (i.e., location track entries) in the location track will herein be denoted the \u201cpath for the location track.\u201d Such paths are typically the length of the location track queue containing the path. Note that the length of each such queue may be determined using at least the following considerations:\n\n","Regarding location track entries, each location track entry includes:\n\n","For each MBS location track, there are two categories of MBS location track entries that may be inserted into a MBS location track:\n\n","Further, there are two categories of location tracks:\n\n","In order to be able to properly compare the track heads to determine the most likely MBS location estimate it is an aspect of the present invention that the track heads of all location tracks include MBS location estimates that are for substantially the same (latest) timestamp. However, the MBS location information from each MBS baseline location estimator is inherently substantially unpredictable and unsynchronized. In fact, the only MBS location information that may be considered predicable and controllable is the deadreckoning location change estimates from the deadreckoning MBS location estimator  in that these estimates may reliably be obtained whenever there is a query from the location controller  for the most recent estimate in the change of the location for the MBS . Consequently (referring to ), synchronization records  (having at least a portion, and in some cases also having a portion) may be provided for updating each location track with a new MBS location estimate as a new track head. In particular, each synchronization record includes a deadreckoning location change estimate to be used in updating all but at most one of the location track heads with a new MBS location estimate by using a deadreckoning location change estimate in conjunction with each MBS location estimate from an MBS baseline location estimator, the location track heads may be synchronized according to timestamp. More precisely, for each MBS location estimate, E, from an MBS baseline location estimator, the present invention also substantially simultaneously queries the deadreckoning MBS location estimator for a corresponding most recent change in the location of the MBS . Accordingly, E and the retrieved MBS deadreckoning location change estimate, C, have substantially the same \u201clatest timestamp\u201d. Thus, the location estimate E may be used to create a new baseline track head for the location track having the corresponding type for E, and C may be used to create a corresponding extrapolation entry as the head of each of the other location tracks. Accordingly, since for each MBS location estimate, E, there is a MBS deadreckoning location change estimate, C, having substantially the same \u201clatest timestamp\u201d, E and C will be hereinafter referred as \u201cpaired.\u201d","High level descriptions of an embodiment of the location functions performed by an MBS  are provided in APPENDIX A hereinbelow.","Mobile Base Station Controller Program","mobile_base_station_controller( ) {","wait_for_input_of_first_MBS_location(event); \/*\u201cevent\u201d is a record (object) with MBS location data*\/","WHILE (no MBS operator input to exit) D0","CASE OF (event): \/*determine the type of \u201cevent\u201d and process it.*\/\n\n","It is assumed that with increasing continuous dead reckoning without additional MBS location verification, the potential error in the MBS location increases.","It is assumed that each MBS location estimate includes: (a) a most likely area estimate surrounding a central location and (b) a confidence value of the MBS being in the location estimate.","The confidence value for each MBS location estimate is a measurement of the likelihood of the MBS location estimate being correct.

These heuristics are implemented using fuzzy mathematics, wherein linguistic, fuzzy \u201cif-then\u201d rules embody the heuristics. That is, each fuzzy rule includes terms in both the \u201cif\u201d and the \u201cthen\u201d portions that are substantially described using natural language\u2014like terms to denote various parameter value classifications related to, but not equivalent to, probability density functions. Further note that the Context Adjuster and\/or the FOM's may be calibrated using the location information from LBSs (i.e., fixed location BS transceivers), via the Location Base Station Model since such LBS's have well known and accurate predetermined locations.","Regarding the heuristics of the present embodiment of the context adjuster, the following is an example of a fuzzy rule that might appear in this embodiment of the Context Adjuster:","If <the season is Fall> then <the confidence level of Distance Model is increased by 5%>.","In the above sample rule, \u201cDistance Model\u201d denotes a First Order Model utilized by the present invention. To apply this sample rule, the fuzzy system needs a concrete definition of the term \u201cFall.\u201d In traditional expert systems, the term Fall would be described by a particular set of months, for example, September through November, in which traditional set theory is applied. In traditional set theory, an entity, in this case a date, is either in a set or it is not in a set, e.g. its degree of membership in a set is either , indicating that the entity is not in a particular set, or 1, indicating that the entity is in the set. However, the traditional set theory employed in expert systems does not lend itself well to entities that fall on set boundaries. For example, a traditional expert system could take dramatically different actions for a date of August 31 than it could for a date of September 1 because August 31 might belong to the set \u201cSummer\u201d while the date September 1 might belong to the set \u201cFall.\u201d This is not a desirable behavior since it is extremely difficult if not impossible to determine such lines of demarcation so accurately. However, fuzzy mathematics allows for the possibility of an entity belonging to multiple sets with varying degrees of confidence ranging from a minimum value of 0 (indicating that the confidence the entity belongs to the particular set is minimum) to 1 (indicating that the confidence the entity belongs to the particular set is maximum). The \u201cfuzzy boundaries\u201d between the various sets are described by fuzzy membership functions which provide a membership function value for each value on the entire range of a variable. As a consequence of allowing entities to belong to multiple sets simultaneously, the fuzzy rule base might have more than one rule that is applicable for any situation. Thus, the actions prescribed by the individual rules are averaged via a weighting scheme where each rule is implemented in proportion to its minimum confidence. For further information regarding such fuzzy heuristics, the following references are incorporated herein by reference: (McNeil and Freiberger, 1993; Cox, 1994; Klir and Folger, 1999; Zimmerman, 1991).","Thus, the rules defined in the fuzzy rule base in conjunction with the membership functions allow the heuristics for adjusting confidence values to be represented in a linguistic form more readily understood by humans than many other heuristic representations and thereby making it easier to maintain and modify the rules. The fuzzy rule base with its membership functions can be thought of as an extension to a traditional expert system. Thus, since traditional expert systems are subsets of fuzzy systems, an alternative to a fuzzy rule base is a traditional expert system, and it is implicit that anywhere in the description of the current invention that a fuzzy rule base can be replaced with an expert system.","Also, these heuristics may evolve over time by employing adaptive mechanisms including, but not limited to, genetic algorithms to adjust or tune various system values in accordance with past experiences and past performance of the Context Adjuster for increasing the accuracy of the adjustments made to location hypothesis confidence values. For example, in the sample rule presented above:","If <the season is Fall> then <the confidence level of Distance Model is increased by 5%> an adaptive mechanism or optimization routine can be used to adjust the percent increase in the confidence level of the Distance Model. For example, by accessing the MS Status Repository, a genetic algorithm is capable of adjusting the fuzzy rules and membership functions such that the location hypotheses are consistent with a majority of the verified MS locations. In this way, the Context Adjuster is able to employ a genetic algorithm to improve its performance over time. For further information regarding such adaptive mechanisms, the following references are incorporated herein by reference: (Goldberg, 1989; Holland, 1975). For further information regarding the tuning of fuzzy systems using such adaptive mechanisms, the following references are incorporated herein by reference: (Karr, 1991a, 1991b).","In one embodiment, the Context Adjuster alters the confidence values of location hypotheses according to one or more of the following environmental factors: (1) the type of region (e.g., dense urban, urban, rural, etc.), (2) the month of the year, (3) the time of day, and (4) the operational status of base stations (e.g., on-line or off-line), as well as other environmental factors that may substantially impact the confidence placed in a location hypothesis. Note that in this embodiment, each environmental factor has an associated set of linguistic heuristics and associated membership functions that prescribe changes to be made to the confidence values of the input location hypotheses.","The context adjuster begins by receiving location hypotheses and associated confidence levels from the First Order Models. The Context Adjuster takes this information and improves and refines it based on environmental information using the modules described below.","B.1 COA Calculation Module","As mentioned above each location hypothesis provides an approximation to the MS position in the form of a geometric shape and an associated confidence value, a. The COA calculation module determines a center of area (COA) for each of the geometric shapes, if such a COA is not already provided in a location hypothesis. The COA Calculation Module receives the following information from each First Order Model: (1) a geometrical shape and (2) an associated confidence value, a. The COA calculation is made using traditional geometric computations (numerical algorithms are readily available). Thus, following this step, each location hypothesis includes a COA as a single point that is assumed to represent the most likely approximation of the location of the MS. The COA Calculation Module passes the following information to the fuzzification module: (1) a geometrical shape associated with each first order model , (2) an associated confidence value, and (3) an associated COA.","B.2 Fuzzification Module","A fuzzification module receives the following information from the COA Calculation Module: (1) a geometrical shape associated with each First Order Model, (2) an associated confidence value, and (3) an associated COA. The Fuzzification Module uses this information to compute a membership function value (\u03bc) for each of the M location hypotheses received from the COA calculation module (where the individual models are identified with an i index) for each of the N environmental factors (identified with a j index). In addition to the information received from the COA Calculation Module, the Fuzzification Module receives information from the Location Center Supervisor. The fuzzification module uses current environmental information such as the current time of day, month of year, and information about the base stations on-line for communicating with the MS associated with a location hypothesis currently being processed (this information may include, but is not limited to, the number of base stations of a given type, e.g., location base stations, and regular base stations, that have a previous history of being detected in an area about the COA for a location hypothesis). The base station coverage information is used to compute a percentage of base stations reporting for each location hypothesis.","The fuzzification is achieved in the traditional fashion using fuzzy membership functions for each environmental factor as, for example, is described in the following references incorporated herein by reference: (McNeil and Freiberger, 1993; Cox, 1994; Klir and Folger, 1999; Zimmerman, 1991).","Using the geographical area types for illustration purposes here, the following procedure might be used in the Fuzzification Module. Each value of COA for a location hypothesis is used to compute membership function values (\u03bc) for each of five types of areas: (1) dense urban (\u03bc), (2) urban (\u03bc), (3) suburban (\u03bc), (4) rural plain (\u03bc), and (5) rural mountains (\u03bc). These membership function values provide the mechanism for representing degrees of membership in the area types, these area types being determined from an area map that has been sectioned off. In accordance with fuzzy theory, there may be geographical locations that include, for example, both dense urban and urban areas; dense urban and rural plane areas; dense urban, urban, and rural plane areas, etc. Thus for a particular MS location area estimate (described by a COA), it may be both dense urban and urban at the same time. The resolution of any apparent conflict in applicable rules is later resolved in the Defuzzification Module using the fuzzy membership function values (\u03bc) computed in the Fuzzification Module.","Any particular value of a COA can land in more than one area type. For example, the COA may be in both dense urban and urban. Further, in some cases a location hypothesis for a particular First Order Model i may have membership functions \u03bc, \u03bc, \u03bc, \u03bc, and \u03bcwherein they all potentially have non-zero values. Additionally, each geographical area is contoured. Note that the membership function contours allow for one distinct value of membership function to be determined for each COA location (i.e., there will be distinct values of \u03bc, \u03bc, \u03bc, \u03bc, and \u03bcfor any single COA value associated with a particular model i). For example, the COA would have a dense urban membership function value, \u03bc, equal to 0.5. Similar contours would be used to compute values of \u03bc, \u03bc,\u03bc, and \u03bc.","Thus, for each COA, there now exists an array or series of membership function values; there are K membership function values (K=number of descriptive terms for the specified environmental factor) for each of M First Order Models. Each COA calculation has associated with it a definitive value for \u03bc, \u03bc, \u03bc, \u03bc, and \u03bc. Taken collectively, the M location hypotheses with membership function values for the K descriptive terms for the particular environmental factor results in a membership function value matrix. Additionally, similar membership function values are computed for each of the N environmental factors, thereby resulting in a corresponding membership function value matrix for each of the N environmental factors.","The Fuzzification Module passes the N membership function value matrices described above to the Rule Base Module along with all of the information it originally received from the COA Calculation Module.","B.3 Rule Base Module","The Rule Base Module receives from the Fuzzification Module the following information: (1) a geometrical shape associated with each First Order Model, (2) an associated confidence value, (3) an associated COA, and (4) N membership function value matrices. The Rule Base Module uses this information in a manner consistent with typical fuzzy rule bases to determine a set of active or applicable rules. Sample rules were provided in the general discussion of the Context Adjuster. Additionally, references have been supplied that describe the necessary computations. Suffice it to say that the Rule Base Modules employ the information provided by the Fuzzification Module to compute confidence value adjustments for each of the m location hypotheses. Associated with each confidence value adjustment is a minimum membership function value contained in the membership function matrices computed in the Fuzzification Module.","For each location hypothesis, a simple inference engine driving the rule base queries the performance database to determine how well the location hypotheses for the First Order Model providing the current location hypothesis has performed in the past (for a geographic area surrounding the MS location estimate of the current location hypothesis) under the present environmental conditions. For example, the performance database is consulted to determine how well this particular First Order Model has performed in the past in locating an MS for the given time of day, month of year, and area type. Note that the performance value is a value between 0 and 1 wherein a value of 0 indicates that the model is a poor performer, while a value of 1 indicates that the model is always (or substantially always) accurate in determining an MS location under the conditions (and in the area) being considered. These performance values are used to compute values that are attached to the current confidence of the current location hypothesis; i.e., these performance values serve as the \u201cthen\u201d sides of the fuzzy rules; the First Order Models that have been effective in the past have their confidence levels incremented by large amounts while First Order Models that have been ineffective in the past have their confidence levels incremented by small amounts. This information is received from the Performance Database in the form of an environmental factor, a First Order Model number, and a performance value. Accordingly, an intermediate value for the adjustment of the confidence value for the current location hypothesis is computed for each environmental condition (used by Context Adjuster) based on the performance value retrieved from the Performance Database. Each of these intermediate adjustment values are computed according to the following equation which is applicable to area information:\n\nadjustment=[D]\u0394a=performance_value*[D]\u0394a\n\nwhere a is the confidence value of a particular location hypothesis, performance_value is the value obtained from the Performance Database, [D]\u0394ais a system parameter that accounts for how important the information is being considered by the context adjuster. Furthermore, this parameter is initially provided by an operator in, for example, a system start-up configuration and a reasonable value for this parameter is believed to be in the range 0.05 to 0.1, the subscript j represents a particular environmental factor, and the superscript i represents a particular First Order Model. However, it is an important aspect of the present invention that this value can be repeatedly altered by an adaptive mechanism such as a genetic algorithm for improving the MS location accuracy of the present invention. In this way, and because the rules are \u201cwritten\u201d using current performance information as stored in the Performance Database, the Rule Module is dynamic and becomes more accurate with time.\n","The Rule Base Module passes the matrix of adjustments to the Defuzzification Module along with the membership function value matrices received from the Fuzzification Module.","B.6 Defuzzification Module","The Defuzzification Module receives the matrix of adjustments and the membership function value matrices from the Rule Base Module.
