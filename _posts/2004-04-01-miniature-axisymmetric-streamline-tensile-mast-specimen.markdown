abstract: A miniature axisymmetric streamline tensile (MAST) specimen having improved axisymmetric surface profile design and surface stress concentration factor (SSCF) improvements, i.e., close to unity is described. The MAST specimen also has improved variable curvature transition fillets, miniaturized profile dimension and shoulder region features used in conjunction with the collet loading method. An axisymmetric, rather than flat, design is preferred since no stress gradients exist in the hoop direction, i.e., circumferential direction, of the specimen. The MAST specimen is designed to permit various loading options. The MAST specimen  may be used for testing any suitable material including, but not limited to, metals, plastics and ceramics.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for Governmental purposes without the payment of any royalty thereon or therefor.","(1) Field of the Invention","This invention relates to a miniature axisymmetric streamline tensile (MAST) specimen that is to undergo tensile stress. This MAST specimen is axisymmetrical with transition regions (i.e., regions that transition from the constant diameter shoulder or grip regions near the end sections to the gauge section region) having variable curvature fillets and having a surface stress concentration factor (SSCF) close to unity.","(2) Description of the Prior Art","The Navy has a need to test piezoelectric ceramic materials in order to determine their performance in sonar transducers. The piezoelectric ceramic materials are typically grown as a single crystal which limits the size of the sample. These materials are very brittle and subject to cracking during use as a transducer. The Navy needs to know the useful life of these materials and the amount of stress that they can be subjected to while still being useful. It is also necessary to determine the electrical properties of the materials and how small flaws in the material affect these properties. No prior art test configuration properly gives this information for piezoelectric ceramics.","Tensile testing of ceramic materials using a standard tensile testing machine is not commonly performed because the tensile strength of ceramic materials is typically very sensitive to small cracks. These cracks are almost always present in normally sized specimens. In brittle materials, such as these ceramic materials, no energy is dissipated in plastic deformation ahead of the crack and the crack propagates easily. A bend test is more commonly used to determine the transverse rupture strength of a ceramic; however, this test does not give the true tensile strength of the material, and the ceramic is subject to failure at the points of load. Another problem is that properties determined using the bend test are not independent of the volume of material being tested.","The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) is a large, not-for-profit, standards organization that provides a forum for producers, users, ultimate consumers, and those having a general interest to meet on common ground and write standards for materials, products, systems, and services. ASTM develops and publicizes voluntary consensus standards for materials, products, systems, and services. ASTM also publishes standard test methods, specifications, practices, guides, classifications, and terminology. ASTM's standards development activities encompass metals, paints, plastics, textiles, petroleum, construction, energy, the environment, consumer products, medical services and devices, computerized systems, electronics, and many other areas.","Several commonly used standardized tensile and compression specimen shapes can be found within the ASTM literature. Tension specimens are generally either flat or axisymmetric shaped. They are typically loaded for testing using wedge grips, collets, threaded ends or pinned ends. Typically, these existing specimen shapes are several inches or longer in length and include constant radius fillets that transition a grip region to a gauge section.","The use of constant curvature fillets, while reducing the complexity of specimen machining and costs, results in surface stress concentration factors (SSCF) ranging minimally from 1.10 to 1.20. A desired SSCF value is unity, 1.00. Furthermore, these specimens yield material strengths that are dependent upon specimen profiles.","With these specimens, the maximum stress may not occur within the gauge section where the applied stress field is assumed uniaxial. Rather, the maximum stress resides at a surface transition point where stress fields are neither uniaxial nor uniform, but rather biaxial and highly non-uniform. For materials that are brittle or lacking sufficient ductility, the surface transition points may become failure initiation regions, especially under dynamic fatigue loads. No suitable miniature axisymmetric standard tensile specimens were available that provide SSCFs close to unity.","The prior art discloses various testing specimens. One such prior art specimen is Van Winkle et al., U.S. Pat. No. 2,454,850, which is said to disclose a torsion specimen having a cylindrical gauge region.","Also known in the prior art is Scott et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,606,230, which is said to disclose a tensile testing apparatus with a tensile specimen having a rectangular gauge section.","Also known are Pratt, U.S. Pat. No. 4,895,750, and Pratt, U.S. Pat. No. 5,078,843, which are said to disclose a carbon composite tensile test specimen for high temperature testing and a method of fabricating the same. The tensile test specimen has a central gauge section that appears to be curved and of constant dimension.","Also known is Hiyoshi, U.S. Publication No. 2002\/0166386 A1, which is said to disclose a method and apparatus for measuring elongation in a contact-less manner capable of obtaining accurate measured value without attaching reference lines and capable of being automated wherein a test specimen has a straight, constant-width gauge section.","Also known is Oplinger et al., On the Streamline Specimen for Tension Testing of Composite Materials, Special Technical Testing Publication 864\u2014American Society for Testing and Materials, pp. 541\u2013542, Philadelphia, 1985, which is said to disclose the analogy between elastic stress fields and 2-D fluid flow through a reducer. Concerning the testing of fibrous composites, this publication teaches the use of a flat, streamlined specimen to reduce surface stress concentration factors to near unity. Wedge grips are used to hold the flat sample in the test apparatus.","Other devices and specimens are known for tensile and compression testing of various materials. These specimens, along with those above, have various shortcomings including having maximum stress not occurring within a gauge section, failure regions at surface transition points and surface stress concentration factors (SSCF) not at unity. The shortcomings of these specimens are addressed by the present invention.","A primary object of the present invention is to provide a miniature axisymmetric streamline tensile (MAST) specimen with a surface stress concentration factor (SSCF) close to unity, 1.0.","Another primary object of the present invention is to provide a MAST specimen with a surface profile consisting of variable curvature transition fillets and virtually stress concentration free surfaces compared to existing standardized specimens.","Another object of the present invention is to provide a MAST specimen with uniform axial stress fields within and adjacent to the gauge section unlike that of existing standardized specimens.","Another object of the present invention is to provide a MAST specimen with static and dynamic fatigue failure strengths which accurately reflect the material's true strength.","Another object of the present invention is to provide a MAST specimen which requires a smaller volume of material per specimen than existing standardized specimens.","Another object of the present invention is to provide a MAST specimen with lower material costs, machining costs and shipping and handling costs.","Accordingly, the present invention provides a MAST specimen having improved axisymmetric shaped design, variable curvature transition fillets, miniaturized profile dimension and shoulder region features used in conjunction with the collet loading method. An axisymmetric, rather than flat, design is preferred since no stress gradients exist in the hoop direction, i.e., circumferential direction, of the specimen. The MAST specimen of the present invention is designed to permit various loading options.","The present invention is a miniature axisymmetric streamline tensile (MAST) specimen  having improved axisymmetric surface profile design and surface stress concentration factor (SSCF) improvements, i.e., close to unity, 1.0. The MAST specimen  of the present invention also has improved variable curvature transition fillets , miniaturized profile dimension and shoulder  region features used in conjunction with the collet loading method. An axisymmetric, rather than flat, design is preferred since no stress gradients exist in the hoop direction, i.e., circumferential direction, of the specimen. The axisymmetric design requires shoulders  because wedge grips cannot be applied to a curved surface.","A preferred MAST specimen  profile of the present invention is shown in . The MAST specimen  has two axisymmetric end sections  and a substantially central axisymmetric gauge section . A variable curvature transition fillet  provides a transition between each end section  and the substantially central gauge section .  shows a preferred first quadrant profile of a MAST specimen  showing a preferred variable curvature transition fillet . This transition fillet  can be calculated as a traction-free boundary with an offset distance. The offset distance provides improved handling characteristics. The offset is also used to create the same cross sectional area as other samples for comparison.","The MAST specimen  of the present invention is designed to permit various loading options. For example, the MAST specimen  may be loaded using collets, threaded ends, etc. However, the collet method requires that the MAST specimen  be machined to include oversized load bearing shoulders  on each end section  to eliminate the possibility of a bearing stress-induced fracture within this load transfer region prior to failing the gauge section .","A collet version of the MAST specimen  is shown in . A collet  is located near the free end of each end section . A shoulder  provides a transition between each collet  and each respective end section . The collet version \u2032 of the MAST specimen  must be sized to avoid bearing stress failures in the shoulder . For example, a collet-loaded MAST specimen \u2032 having a maximum SSCF of 1.01 and a length of 1.0 inch will preferably have a resulting gauge section  diameter of 0.042 inch. Because this diameter is relatively small, extreme care must be used in installing the specimen within the test machine. Otherwise, MAST specimen breakage may occur during test set-up. However, any suitable length and gauge section  diameter may be used for the MAST specimen , \u2032.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["50","52","54","56","54","56","58","60","54","56","50","52","58"]},"Another preferred embodiment of the MAST specimen  is the threaded MAST specimen \u2033, shown in . In this embodiment, threaded regions  are formed, cut into or attached to each end of the specimen \u2033. The specimen \u2033 can then be mounted in test blocks  and  prior to testing. This embodiment affords a greater gauge section  diameter since threaded region  stress can be distributed over a larger surface area than found in the collet method.","In either embodiment, universal joints are recommended within the specimen-to-test machine load train to eliminate any misalignment effects on the specimen that could otherwise result in specimen breakage. For example, a threaded end MAST specimen \u2033having a maximum SSCF of 1.01 and a length of 1.0 inch will preferably have a resulting gauge section  diameter of approximately 0.080 inch, which is nearly double the gauge section  diameter of a preferred embodiment of a collet MAST specimen \u2032. However, any suitable length and gauge section diameter may be used for the MAST specimen ,\u2033.","An exemplary use of the MAST specimen  of the present invention is in the area of new generation piezoelectric materials such as Single Crystal PMN, i.e., Single Crystal Lead Magnesium Niobate. During testing, new generation piezoelectric materials, such as Single Crystal PMN, cannot be grown to the sizes required by most standardized tensile test specifications. Today, manufacturing methods for this material are limited to a maximum nominal size of only one inch. Therefore, to obtain accurate mechanical properties for the Single Crystal PMN that are ideally independent of both specimen size and profile, the MAST specimen of the present invention was developed with surface stress concentration factors (SSCF) approaching 1.0. This could only be accomplished by the MAST specimen  containing variable curvature fillets  in transition regions.","Primary advantages of the MAST specimen  of the present invention include, but are not limited to, surface stress concentration factors (SSCF) close to unity, a surface profile consisting of variable curvature transition fillets , virtually stress concentration free surfaces compared to existing standardized specimens, uniform axial stress fields within and adjacent to the gauge section  unlike that of existing standardized specimens and static and dynamic fatigue failure strengths which accurately reflect a material's true strength. The MAST specimen  also requires a smaller volume of material per specimen than existing standardized specimens. The MAST specimen  may be used for testing any suitable material including, but not limited to, metals, plastics and ceramics.","While the impetus of developing the MAST specimen  was to obtain a miniature specimen shape having substantial improvements over existing specimen designs found in the prior art, the MAST specimen  can be scaled for specimens regardless of size and loading methods. Additionally, the SSCF improvements also make the MAST specimen  a highly suitable specimen shape for compression testing of materials. However, from the compression perspective, the specimen diameters must be increased to avoid buckling failures prior to gauge section  compression failures.","In order to prepare the MAST specimen , a single crystal sample of the material, such as a piezoelectric material, used for the test is grown. This crystal sample is then machined to the disclosed profile utilizing numerically controlled manufacturing. Preferably, the specimen  is cut down from the single crystal axially. This avoids radial scribing which can create surface stress concentrators. As an alternative, the specimen  can be made, i.e., machined, using a numerically controlled lathe which will leave radial scribing such that the surface of the specimen has a surface stress concentration factor near unity. The radial scribing on the surface of the specimen can then be polished away. In either case, it is best that the numerically controlled machine follow the streamline equation with sufficient accuracy to avoid stress concentrators. This can be done by using point to point machining on a large set of points or by using a machine capable of following an equation precisely.","When a specimen is made from a piezoelectric material, it is desirable to monitor the specimen's electrical properties while it is being tested.  shows a test setup for this purpose. Electrical equipment  is electrically joined to each end section  of the specimen  such as by test blocks. The electrical equipment  should be capable of recording the voltage, current, impedance and resistance of the specimen  while it is being tested.","The specimen  can be tested using a standard mechanical tensile test where the ends of the specimen are drawn apart from each other until the specimen breaks or the specimen can be loaded by providing an electrical difference voltage at each end of the specimen  causing it to contract. This can be performed by electrical equipment  attached to the test blocks, which may apply an electrical current to the specimen cyclically to cause cyclical contractions. In either test, the specimen  can be cyclically loaded.","During testing, the specimen  may be subjected to axial forces, preferably performed mechanically, until failure. In a preferred embodiment, subjecting the specimens to axial forces until failure comprises causing contraction of the specimen by providing an electrical current to the specimen. The elongation of the specimen, the axial forces on the specimen, and the electrical properties of the specimen may be measured during testing. After the specimen destructively fails, it is microscopically examined to find the flaw causing the failure. Other properties measured from the specimen are stress, strain, cycle life, power output and acceptable flaw size.","The exemplary embodiments herein disclosed are not intended to be exhaustive or to unnecessarily limit the scope of the invention. The exemplary embodiments were chosen and described in order to explain the principles of the present invention so that others skilled in the art may practice the invention. As will be apparent to one skilled in the art, various modifications can be made within the scope of the aforesaid description.
