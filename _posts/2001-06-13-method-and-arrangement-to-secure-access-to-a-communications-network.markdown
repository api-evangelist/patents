{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present invention relates to a method and an arrangement in a data communications system in Internet Protocol (IP) environments according to the preamble of the independent claims. More specifically it relates to remote and secure access to a data communications network, such as a corporate Intranet, via a so-called Pseudo-Connectionless Technology (PCT) device such as General Packet Radio Service (GPRS).","In the very near future, when commercial GPRS and other similar services are introduced, the mobile workforce of corporations, e.g. business executives, consultants, sales persons, delivery fleets, etc., will be able to access their corporate network while on the move in a cost effective manner, as opposed to previous Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) circuit-switched data that incurred high per minute charges regardless of whether data was actually transmitted. (A list of acronyms will be found in the end of the description.)","To achieve the remote access several procedures for storage and handling of configuration information and dynamically setting-up communication channels are required","More specifically the configuration information and dynamic set-up procedures pertain to three distinct areas:\n\n","So-called \u2018dial-up clients\u2019 and \u2018connection managers\u2019 enable to automatically configure and manage network connections for computers, e.g. desktop PCs, laptops, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), etc. More generally, such software can be embedded inside any consumer or industrial electronic device, e.g. games console, digital camera, vending machine, digital meter etc., that uses an internal or external communication device to access a data network via a different, often public, telecommunications network.","There are mainly two sorts of software used for remote access to data networks:\n\n","The first type of software provides the basic components that are required by a computer or integrated communications device to access the Internet using a modem via a public telecommunications network, generally the analogue fixed-wire telephone or a mobile phone service, either analogue or digital. Such software comprises:\n\n","The second type of software, dial-up managers, builds on the functionality of the first by providing some \u2018value-added\u2019 functions, such as:\n\n","A wide range of fixed and mobile data communications technologies exists. All these technologies have in common that they are always connected but require some complex set-up information. In the following, these characteristics will be termed \u2018pseudo\u2019-connectionless. These technologies have further in common that they use a specalised access network and use dedicated gateways to access the Internet These technologies will further on be termed Pseudo-Connectionless Technologies (PCT).","One such mobile data communications technology is the so-called GPRS technology. (GPRS) is a telecommunications service which is specially adapted to digital cellular networks such as GSM, Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) and Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), which is the digital mobile services in the US and other markets, that operates in the 800 and 1900 MHz frequency band. GPRS makes use of the packet radio principle and is used to transfer data via e.g. the protocols IP and X.25 from a GPRS terminal to other GPRS terminals or external data networks. GPRS is standardised in European Telecommunication Standardisation Institute (ETSI) (ETSI GSM 09.61, 07.07, 04.60 for GPRS and GSM technologies) and in the third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), e.g. the 3GPP 23.060 specification. GPRS makes use of a packet data technique to transmit high speed data and low speed data in an efficient way over e.g. GSM radio networks. GPRS optimises the use of network resources and radio resources. A strict separation of the radio subsystems and the network subsystems is obtained which results in that the network subsystems can be reused by other radio access technologies.","GPRS consequently is a packet switched data service which gives a mobile high speed transmission of data with efficient use of the available bandwidth. In theory it can achieve transmission rates up to several 100 kb\/s. With a third generation air interface, such as Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA) as in the global UMTS standard raw data throughput can go up to 2000 kb\/s, as compared with 9,6kb\/s which GSM can deliver today. Data transmission via GSM can be realised in two different ways, circuit switched as in voice transmissions of today or packet switched as in GPRS.","However, other fixed or mobile data communications technologies, can fulfil a similar \u2018bearer\u2019 role and share some characteristics with GPRS, such as they are \u2018pseudo-connectionless\u2019, use a specialised dedicated access network and dedicated gateways to access the Internet One example is Cellular Digital Packet Data (CDPD) which refers to the standardised technology \u201cTelecommunications Industry Association (TIA) TR-45.6 (IS-732 and IS-732A) for CDPD\u201d A similar but fixed-line pseudo-connectionless technology is Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL).","Dial-up software requires to be adapted to the pseudo-connectionless characteristics of these technologies and to incorporate configuration parameters and session set-up procedures specific to these technologies.","Current implementations re-use existing software developed for Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) dialup and use tricks to manage the GPRS connection from a computing device. This will be described later on.","Remote Access Virtual Private Network (VPN) Software.","Secure networking covers three areas:","Authentication: These are techniques that enable to ensure that both ends of the session, the user and the remote network access server, are really who they say they are. This is achieved in a number of ways, but generally requires the user to provide some input, e.g. a password, a smart card etc., and the machines to perform some cryptographic treatment, e.g. hash functions. Password Authentication Protocol (PAP), Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP), Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), Message Digest algorithm number 5 (MD-5) and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) are examples of standard authentication techniques that exists in the market.","Encryption: Using a previously agreed encryption algorithm, machines can scramble the data they exchange so that they can detect any attempt to tamper with it, and ensure end-to-end confidentiality. This however generally requires the two machines to have an identical set of cryptographic material or keys to seed the encryption algorithm. There is a number of encryption algorithms such as Data Encryption Standard DES), 3-DES, Blowfish, Carlisle Adams and Stafford Tavares (CAST), International Data encryption'Standard (IDEA), Rons Code RC-40\/128) etc., and a number of key exchange mechanisms such as Internet Key Exchange (IKE), Diffie-Hellman, Rivest Shamir and Aldeman's (RSA) public key encryption algorithm, etc., with various parameters, that users can choose from.","Tunnelling or Virtual Private Networks (VPNs): Lastly, private networks, e.g. corporate, require to be isolated from the public Internet. However, remote mobile users communicate via a public network, in general the Internet Therefore, secure networking requires a protocol that hides the fact that traffic between the private \u2018islands\u2019 goes through the public Internet \u2018ocean\u2019, illustrated in . This is necessary because outgoing traffic from a local computer  within a private network  to a remotely-connected computer  must go through a dedicated security gateway , e.g. a VPN router, that applies cryptographic treatment to the data traffic.","To achieve this, a so-called \u2018tunneling protocol\u2019 is required. This protocol gives the illusion that a remote computer  is directly connected to the private network . It avoids local machines sending data in clear via an un-secure public gateway  when they reply to a remote computer. Instead data to the remote computer is intercepted by the secure gateway , e.g. using proxy Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), optionally encrypted, then \u2018encapsulated\u2019, and finally routed via the Internet  to the remote computer . This secured private data traffic is indicated in  with a broken line .","Again, there is a range of protocols that users can choose from, each with their own particularities and requiring specific configuration data. Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) standards such as Secure IP (IPSec), Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP), General Routing Encapsulation (GRE), etc. are examples of such protocols.","Commercial secure VPN client software generally comprises two components:\n\n","In the very near future, when commercial GPRS and similar services are introduced, a mobile workforce of a corporation that requires to access its corporate network while on the move will face two challenges:\n\n","Below is an overview of the required installation and configuration steps with current techniques:\n\n","This PDP definition step could also be performed at session setup time (see next sub-section).\n\n","When a user wants to access a network, e.g. his\/her corporate network, using the GPRS service, the procedure below is currently followed:\n\n","As can be seen in the \u2018Typical Usage Scenario\u2019 above, installation and session set-up can be fairly complex and constitute a barrier to the initial take-up by corporate users and further mass-usage of GPRS services.","Notably, the configuration requires a lot of manual keying-in of information in the handset and manual software configuration in numerous places of the operating system and dial-up\/VPN software. This requites an in-depth technical knowledge that most end users will not have.","Also, the session set-up procedure requires the user to launch different applications and multiple username\/password entries, as well as optionally running a script of some sort to configure the specific GPRS session parameters (PDP context data). This is time consuming and requires an in-depth technical knowledge that most end users will not have.","Moreover, the current way of configuring and setting up such GPRS remote access is not flexible and does not enable to take advantage of future capabilities of e.g. GPRS terminals such as multiple PDP context support roaming using a \u2018visited\u2019 Access Point Name (APN), alternative ISP support and quality of service options.","Mainly, this is due to the fact that the PDP context data is either configured in the handset or using modem init commands. Because of this, depending on PC operating system and GPRS handset capabilities, only one set of PDP context information can be stored, or supporting several ones is cumbersome.","To summarise, drawbacks with the current remote access to a private data communications network, via a PCT device, are that the management of PCT session parameters (e.g. GPRS PDP context) lacks flexibility.","The object of the invention is to overcome the above mentioned drawbacks and provide a way of remote and secure access to a private data communications network, via a PCT device, that is further facilitated for the user.","This is achieved according to the method and arrangement set forth in the characterising parts of the independent claims.","Thanks to the provision of the Remote Access Login system, the information and instructions, needed for secure networking session configuration and set-up, are brought together in a single interface, and thanks to the provision of the remote access login method, a single connect activity by a user will perform the remote and secure access.","Preferred embodiments are set forth in the dependent claims.","An advantage of the present invention is that the procedures for session set-up are shorter and require less user intervention.","Another advantage of the present invention is that the configuration becomes easier.","A further advantage of the present invention is that the flexible PDP context management enable usage scenarios that are not straightforwardly possible using current software, such as obtaining GPRS services when roaming using a so-called \u201cvisited APN\u201d, easily changing Quality of service parameters e.g. when using different handsets, accessing another Internet Service Provider service than the one provided by default in the handset.","The present invention can be described in short as a dial-up remote access \u2018dialler\u2019 integrated with a secure VPN client and with features for the support of so-called Pseudo-Connectionless Technology (PCT) devices and services such as GPRS devices and services, as well as an enhanced user interface for greater usability. The invention, comprising software logic and software components, is implemented in a computer, e.g., a Personal Computer (PC)\u2014a desktop or a laptop, a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) or any industrial or consumer electronic device with communications or interfacing capabilities, and is from now on called the Remote Access Login (RAL) system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0079"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":"201"},"The vertical areas in the figure represent the user mode , the kernel mode transport drivers  and the kernel mode Network Driver Interface Specification (NDIS) drivers  and are separated by horizontal dash-dotted lines.","The software components involved are, starting from the lower layer, the kernel mode NDIS drivers  are the Asynchronous\/Serial Port Drivers , the Network Driver (ND) Proxy , the so-called dial-up adapter, PPP NDIS Wide Area Network (WAN) , the virtual 802.3 adapter (using the Ethernet (IEEE 802.3 specification)) , the Point to Point Tunnelling Protocol\/Layer 2 Tunnelling Protocol (PPTP\/L2TP) component  with a virtual adapter , and two instances of a 3rd Party IPSec driver  and its virtual adapter . This 3rd Party IPSec is an NDIS driver provided by an independent software vendor. The virtual adapter , fulfils a similar role as the previously mentioned 802.3 virtal adapter . When functioning in the so-called \u2018tunnel mode\u2019 the second instance of the 3rd-party IPSec driver must resemble a Network Interface Card (NIC) from the point of view of the first instance of the 3rd-party IPSec driver.","Involved software components in the kernel mode transport drivers , are the Microsoft\u2122 IPSec  and the Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol (TCP\/IP) protocol driver  and the UNImodem .","Involved software components in the user mode  are the Telecommunication Application Programming Interface (TAPI) , the Remote Access Service (RAS)  and the upper layer application , e.g. a web browser.","The user mode  further comprises the RAL system , i.e. the software components according to the present invention, which now will be described more in detail.","Starting from the lower layers, these user mode  components mainly include:","Application Programming Interface (API) to GPRS  and API to VPN  devices. In order to support devices that are non-standard for the operating system, the RAL system comprises components APIs that enable to abstract a generic behaviour of these devices for the other, upper, software components. This generic behaviour is embodied by a standard set of commands for each of the GPRS device and the VPN device that will be sent by the upper layer components and translated into device- or system-specific signals indicated with arrows  and  to the appropriate underlying kernel devices.","If required, a set of RAS functions  for VPNs and GPRS, because of possible limitations of the operating system. These components enable to perform specific session set-up procedures that are not covered by existing software, e.g. specific GPRS functions such as PDP context definition.","A user Profiles Database . The RAL system  maintains a database containing all the data relevant to the end-to-end chain of configuration data that is required by the different software components outside the RAL system , to set-up a secure mobile data connection. It notably enables to flexibly manage PDP context data. Where appropriate, the data will be passed to components outside of the RAL system, e.g. to the RAS for the dial-up parameters such as phone numbers etc.","Genetic APIs are in two forms:\n\n","The processing core  is the controlling part of the RAL system . It translates user input, such as text, numbers, mouse clicks, etc., taken from the Graphical User Interface (GUI) , into signals to the appropriate underlying components and co-ordinates and triggers the different procedures according to the appropriate logic, e.g. define a PCT session PDP context, passing the session context to the PCT device, trigger the set-up of a dial-up connection, then set-up the VPN connection.","The GUI  of the RAL system brings together in the same application all the necessary interfaces for the configuration and set-up of a networking session over pseudo-connectionless bearers, e.g. GPRS, or standard dial-up bearers, e.g. PSTN, Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN).","An example of a GUI of the RAL system comprises a genetic control window, enabling session management and giving access to \u2018session profiles\u2019 for the three layers involved in mobile secure networking, VPN, GPRS (PDP), mobile device (modem dial-up). An expanded bottom frame comprises the particular configuration settings of the selected profile. An information element enables to link the three layers together, thus enabling to automate the set-up for a particular end-to-end session.","As an add-on to main RAL system , several standalone plugin modules  can communicate with the RAL  via a generic API part of  to perform value-added functions that make use of special characteristics or functions of the PCT connection or PCT device. In the case of GPRS, such a plugin module  could for instance be a meter that records the volume of data transferred and translates it into the amount of money that the user will have to pay the GPRS operator (the latter charges usage per unit of data volume transferred), the amount of money is then displayed in real-time towards the user, via a GUI implemented in the plugin software code  independent of the main RAL system . The principles of such plugins is that they are completely autonomous and rely only on the API .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0096"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},"The method includes the following steps:\n\n","The method is implemented by means of a computer program product comprising the software code portions for performing the steps of the method. The computer program product is run on the computer.","The computer program is loaded directly or from a computer usable medium, such as floppy-disc, CD, Internet etc.","The Required Installation and Configuration of the RAL System.","In these examples the PCT used is GPRS.\n\n","When a user of a computer wants to access their corporate network via the GPRS service using the RAL system the procedure below will be followed:\n\n","The diagram in  outlines what happens in the network after the user clicks \u2018connect\u2019. The involved networks are the GPRS Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) backbone , the Public Internet  and the Private IP Network . The process can be divided in the four main parts:\n\n","After the user clicked \u2018connect\u2019, the RAL system software, comprised in the computer  will first pass on a message  to the GPRS device , the message  comprising the GPRS session parameters that were configured when the session profile was created. These parameters define the pseudo-connectionless characteristics of the GPRS session, and form the so-called \u2018PDP context\u2019.","These parameters are e.g. PDP Type, Access Point Name (APN), compression options, IP address and quality of service options. All these parameters are optional in a PDP context definition message. Where they are not explicitly set, they can be set later by either the computer  during the PPP negotiation phase , provided by the GPRS network at the Home Location Register (HLR) query step , or by default setting in the handset .","With current GPRS terminals the message  is passed using a standard AT command, sent to the terminal via a PC peripheral interface such as e.g.\n\n","Then, the software logic of the RAL system  calls the dial-up capabilities of the Operating System it resides on. For Windows\u2122 98, NT or 2000, this makes use of functions provided by the Remote Access Service (RAS) component. Alternatively, the said operating system can be any of the ones in existence, such as Palm\u2122, EPOC\u2122, Mac\u2122, Linux\u2122, unix\u2122; in which case the said dial-up capabilities make use of functions provided by OS functions equivalent to the RAS or functions provided by independent 3-party software.","The parameters that are passed to the RAS are dial-up parameters, e.g. authentication protocol address allocation policy, compression etc. and authentication credentials which are used optionally for the GPRS non-transparent access case.","In Windows\u2122, the software logic of the RAL system writes the dial-up parameters in a system file, a so called phonebook, that is then read by the RAS when it performs the dial-up connection procedure. The software logic of the RAL system also indicates the RAS in which file to read when it Triggers the RAS dial-up. This file also contains, hard coded, the service string, i.e. phone number, for GPRS, e.g. *98**1#.","The authentication credentials are put in an \u2018opaque\u2019 memory (Random Access Memory (RAM) location by the software logic of the RAL system, where they will later be retrieved by the RAS using standard Operating System (OS) functions. A pointer to this location is passed to the RAS.","Once the RAS is launched, it performs the following operations without the involvement of the software logic of the RAL system:\n\n","This third step in turn triggers the GPRS handset  to initiate  a PDP context activation procedure with the Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) in the GPRS network. This \u2018Activate PDP Context Request\u2019 message  contains the APN and optionally the authentication credentials.","The PPP IPCP configuration phase will terminate when the GPRS network acknowledges the end of the PDP context activation procedure . The handset will then return to the computer  a \u2018PPP IPCP configuration acknowledgement\u2019 , which notifies the RAS of the end of the session set-up. The control focus then returns to the RAL system.","Depending on the service scenario, the PDP context activation procedure inside the GPRS network will be more or less complex.","Several combinations of cases are possible here, e.g. Transparent or Non-Transparent case and Roaming or non-roaming case.","The behaviour of the network is determined by the APN that is passed on to the Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) and Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) at PDP context activation time. This is independent of the RAL system. Based on the APN, it is the SGSN that determines the behaviour with respect to roaming, the SGSN then establishes a GPRS Tunnelling Protocol (GTP) tunnel and passes on the APN to the GGSN which determines the behaviour with respect to access transparency.","For instance, in the most complicated case which is the non-transparent roaming access:\n\n","Once the RAS receives this PPP IPCP configuration acknowledgement message , it configures the computer 's. Operating System's TCP\/IP stack correctly and binds it with the low level NDIS drivers for dial-up NDISWAN\u2014see .","The RAS then generates a response towards the RAL system software to acknowledge that the GPRS connection was successfully set-up.","In cases where VPN components shall be used, as indicated in the user-defined profile, the RAL system then triggers the next step, the necessary procedures to establish a secure VPN session.","For instance, based on the user configuration parameters it stores, the RAL system selects a VPN device e.g. Microsoft\u2122 IPSec  in , and Microsoft\u2122 L2TP , or a 3-party IPSec driver , and passes on, either via the RAS  or directly , the additional parameters required such as VPN gateway name or IP address, authentication protocol, pointer to authentication credentials, e.g. digital certificates or username\/password, which may have been defined using the RAL system.","The VPN software will then perform the necessary steps to establish the secure connection by negotiating bulk encryption keys with the VPN gateway , by using IPSec's Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocol , then establish the VPN tunnel, e.g. L2TP  and authenticate the user , which may involve optionally a RADIUS\/Authentication, Authorisation, Accounting (AAA) query .","The invention is not limited to the above described embodiments. Various alternatives, modifications and equivalents may be used. Therefore, the above embodiments should not be taken as limiting the scope of invention, which is defined by the appendant claims.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0087","num":"0161"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"259pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Acronyms"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"210pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["3GPP","Third
