{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application is a division of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/572,811, filed May 17, 2000, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,762,339, issuing on Jul. 13, 2004 which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/135,381, filed May 21, 1999, and U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/153,626, filed Sep. 13, 1999, the disclosures of which are hereby fully incorporated by reference herein.","In one aspect, this invention relates to hydrophilic polypropylene fibers which preferably have antimicrobial activity. In another aspect it relates to a multilayer absorbent device suitable as, e.g., a wound dressing, a medical drape, and the like.","Briefly, in one aspect, the invention provides a polypropylene fiber having incorporated therein a Cto Cfatty acid monoglyceride or a mixture of glycerides containing at least 80 percent by weight of one or more Cto Cfatty monoglycerides, and a hydrophilic enhancer material. The invention includes fibrous nonwoven, woven and knit webs and batts made from such fibers.","In another aspect, the invention provides a hydrophilic polypropylene fiber comprising: (a) polypropylene; (b) an effective amount of at least one Cto Cfatty acid monoglyceride added to the polypropylene as a melt additive to impart both hydrophilicity and antimicrobial activity to Gram-positive bacteria to the surface of the fiber; and (c) an effective amount of an antimicrobial enhancer material such that the surface of the fiber is antimicrobial to Gram-negative bacteria such as . Preferred antimicrobial enhancer materials include organic acids and chelating agents, most preferably lactic acid.","In another aspect, the invention provides an absorbent device comprising: (a) an absorbent layer having upper and lower opposed, major surfaces and comprising fibers that are hydrophilic and, preferably, antimicrobial to Gram-positive bacteria; and (b) a liquid-impermeable and moisture vapor permeable backing sheet adhered to the upper surface of the absorbent layer. The fibers comprise polypropylene and an effective amount of at least one Cto Cfatty acid monoglyceride added to the polypropylene as a melt additive to render the surface of the fibers hydrophilic and, preferably, antimicrobial. In one preferred embodiment of this invention, the surface of the hydrophilic fibers are treated with an effective amount of an antimicrobial enhancer material, such as lactic acid, such that the surface of the fibers in the absorbent layer are antimicrobial to Gram-negative bacteria.","In one embodiment of the absorbent device, the absorbent layer and backing sheet are substantially coextensive. When the absorbent device is used as a wound dressing, it can be positioned over the wound with the absorbent layer positioned adjacent to the wound. The device is then adhered to the skin around the wound, for example, by tape. In another embodiment of the absorbent device, the absorbent layer and the backing sheet are not substantially coextensive and the backing sheet extends beyond at least a portion of the outer perimeter of the absorbent layer to form an extended portion with an upper and lower surface. The lower surface of the extended portion is adjacent to the absorbent layer and at least a portion of the lower surface carries an adhesive layer which can be used to adhere the absorbent device to the skin around the wound. Optionally, this embodiment can further comprise a release liner that is substantially coextensive with the backing sheet and adhered to the backing sheet by the adhesive layer. The release liner would be removed from the absorbent device prior to application to a wound.","A preferred embodiment of the absorbent device further comprises a liquid-permeable sheet that is substantially coextensive with, and adhered to, the lower surface of the absorbent layer. The liquid permeable sheet permits passage of liquid, e.g., exudate, from the wound into the absorbent layer, and preferably prevents adherence of the absorbent layer to the wound. Optionally, the liquid permeable sheet can be hydrophilic or antimicrobial, or both.","The invention also provides useful devices made from such fibers, such as fabrics, webs, batts, and single and multi-layer nonwoven constructions, which are employed in the manufacture of wound dressings, medical drapes, surgical gowns, surgical masks, disposable diapers, filter media, face masks, orthopedic cast padding\/stockinettes, respirators, food packaging, dental floss, industrial wipes, textiles, and battery separators. In particular, the absorbent device of the present invention can advantageously be used as a wound dressing because it can (i) absorb a substantial quantity of wound exudate when the dressing is worn for an extended period of time or when the wound produces a large quantity of exudate, and (ii) retard growth of bacteria in the absorbent layer, and, in some cases, in the wound. A further advantage of the absorbent device is that the antimicrobial activity of the device reduces the sterilization load associated with the wound dressing when the device is sterilized prior to packaging such as, for example, by exposure to ethylene oxide.","The invention further provides a method of preparing fibers that are both hydrophilic and, preferably, antimicrobial to Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, the method comprising the steps of (i) preparing a hot melt mixture comprising melted polypropylene and an amount of at least one Cto Cfatty acid monoglyceride that is effective to impart both hydrophilicity and, preferably, antimicrobial activity to Gram-positive bacteria to the surface of the fiber; and (ii) shaping the mixture into the desired shape, for example forming the fibers by extrusion through a die. When it is desired that the fibers also be antimicrobial to Gram-negative bacteria, the method further comprises the step of contacting the shaped mixture with a liquid composition comprising at least one antimicrobial enhancer material, thereby cooling and at least partially solidifying the shaped mixture and, when present, evaporating sufficient solvent or carrier liquid from the liquid composition to yield an essentially dry coating of the antimicrobial enhancer material on the surface of the shaped mixture that is of sufficient concentration and uniformity such that the extruded surface is antimicrobial to Gram-negative bacteria. When both hydrophilicity and antimicrobial activity are desired, preferably the monoglyceride is a C-Cfatty acid monoglyceride, such as, for example, glycerol monolaurate. Some embodiments of the aforementioned fibers further incorporate an effective amount of a hydrophilic enhancer material added to the polypropylene as a melt additive to enhance the hydrophilicity of the fibers.","As used herein, \u201chydrophilic\u201d, \u201chydrophilicity\u201d or similar terminology is used to describe substrates (e.g., fibers, woven or nonwoven fabrics, webs, knits or fiber batts etc.) that can be wet by water, by aqueous solutions of acids and bases (e.g., aqueous potassium hydroxide) and by polar liquids (e.g. sulfuric acid and ethylene glycol).","As used herein, \u201cantimicrobial\u201d or \u201cantimicrobial activity\u201d means that a material has sufficient antimicrobial activity as measured by American Association of Textile and Color Chemists (AATCC) Test Method 100-1993 (AATCC Technical Manual, 1997, pp. 143 to 144), to reduce an initial bacterial load by at least 90% over a 24-hour exposure period at 23-24\u00b0 C.","The terms \u201cfiber\u201d and \u201cfibrous\u201d as used herein refer to particulate matter, generally comprising thermoplastic resin, wherein the length to diameter ratio of the particulate matter is greater than or equal to about 10. Fiber diameters may range from about 0.5 micron up to at least 1,000 microns and each fiber may have a variety of cross-sectional geometries, may be solid or hollow, and may be colored by, e.g., incorporating dye or pigment into the polymer melt prior to extrusion.","The term \u201cnonwoven web\u201d or \u201cnonwoven fabric\u201d means a web or fabric having a structure of individual fibers which are interlaid, but not in a regular manner, such as knitting and weaving. Nonwoven fabrics or webs have been formed from many processes such as, for example, melt blowing processes, spunbonding processes, and bonded carded web processes.","The term \u201cspunbonded fibers\u201d refers to small diameter fibers which are formed or \u201cspun\u201d by extruding molten thermoplastic material in the form of filaments from a plurality of fine, usually circular, capillaries of a spinneret, and then rapidly reducing the diameter of the extruded filaments, for example, by the methods described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,340,563 (Appel et al.) and U.S. Pat. No. 3,692,618 (Dorschner et al.). The \u201cspun\u201d fabric is then passed between the rolls of a heated calender to bond the fibers together. Various patterns can be imparted to the fabric by the calender rolls, but the principle purpose of bonding is to increase the integrity of the fabric. The bond area in thermal bonding is usually about 15%, but may vary widely depending on the desired web properties. Bonding may also be accomplished by needling, hydroentanglement, or other methods known in the art.","The term \u201cmelt blown fibers\u201d refers to fibers which are typically formed by extruding the molten thermoplastic material through a plurality of fine, usually circular, die capillaries as molten threads or filaments into a high velocity, usually heated gas (e.g., air) stream which attenuates the filaments of molten thermoplastic material to reduce their diameter. Thereafter, the melt-blown fibers are carried by the high velocity gas stream and are deposited on a collecting surface to form a web of randomly disbursed melt-blown fibers. Any of the nonwoven webs may be made from a single type of fiber or two or more fibers which differ in composition and\/or thickness. Alternatively, sheath-core fibers can be extruded containing different polymer compositions in each layer, or containing the same polymer composition in each layer but employing the more hydrophilicity-imparting component in the outer sheath layer.","The polymers useful in preparation of the hydrophilic fibers of the present invention are polypropylenes, including isotactic polypropylene, syndiotactic polypropylene, and mixtures of isotactic, atactic and\/or syndiotactic polypropylene.","The monoglycerides useful in the invention are derived from glycerol and medium to long chain length (i.e., Cto C) fatty acids such as caprylic, capric, and lauric acids. Most preferably, the monoglycerides are derived from Cto Cfatty acids and are food grade and Generally Regarded as Safe (\u201cGRAS\u201d) materials. Examples of preferred monoglycerides include glycerol monolaurate, glycerol monocaprate, and glycerol monocaprylate. Because the monoglycerides useful in the invention are typically available in the form of mixtures of unreacted glycerol, monoglycerides, diglycerides and triglycerides, it is preferred to use mixtures that contain a high concentration (e.g., greater than about 80%, preferably greater than about 85 wt. %, more preferably greater than about 90 wt. %, and most preferably greater than about 92 wt. %) of the monoglyceride. A convenient way to determine whether one of the aforementioned mixtures, or even a particular monoglyceride, will work in the invention is to calculate the hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (\u201cHLB value\u201d) for the mixture. Typically, the HLB value of one of the aforementioned mixtures decreases with increasing fatty acid chain lengths, and also decreases as the diglyceride and triglyceride content in the mixture increases. Useful materials (including pure monoglycerides) typically have HLB values of about 4.5 to about 9, more preferably from about 5.3 to about 8.5. Examples of particularly useful commercially available materials include those available from Med-Chem Laboratories, East Lansing, Mich., under the tradename LAURICIDIN\u2122, Riken Vitamin Ltd., Tokyo, Japan under the tradename POEM\u2122, and Henkel Corp. of Germany under the tradename \u201cMONOMULS\u2122 90 L-12\u201d.","Generally, it is difficult to impart hydrophilicity to polypropylene fibers using surfactants. Conventional surfactants typically must be added to polypropylene at higher concentrations than are used in polyethylene, and it is difficult to find effective surfactants that can be used in polypropylene at low concentrations. The impact of the use of high concentrations of conventional surfactants is increased cost, in some instances impairment of the physical properties of the extruded fiber, or impairment of processability of the extrudable polyolefin mixture (e.g., screw slippage, see T. Klun, et al., \u201cHydrophilic Melt Additives, Synergistic Fluorochemical\/Hydrocarbon Surfactant Mixtures,\u201d Proceedings of INDA-TEC '97, Cambridge, Mass., Sep. 8-10, 1997). It is quite surprising that the monoglycerides used in this invention can impart good hydrophilicity to polypropylene at concentrations of only about 3 weight percent or less, when typically at least about 5 weight percent of other hydrocarbon surfactants is required to impart acceptable hydrophilicity to polypropylene.","The fibers of this invention can be made by blending or otherwise uniformly mixing at least one Cto Cfatty acid monoglyceride and the solid polypropylene, for example, by intimately mixing the monoglyceride with pelletized or powdered polymer, and melt extruding the mixture into a fibrous web using any of the commonly known processes for producing nonwoven webs, such as by using the spunbonding techniques or melt-blowing techniques, or combinations of the two, described above. The monoglyceride can be mixed per se with the polypropylene, or it can be mixed with the polymer in the form of a \u201cmasterbatch\u201d (concentrate) of the monoglyceride in the polymer. Masterbatches can typically contain from about 10% to as much as about 25% by weight of the monoglyceride. Also, an organic solution of the monoglyceride can be mixed with the powdered or pelletized polymer, the mixture dried to remove solvent, then melted and extruded into the desired shape. Alternatively, the neat form of monoglyceride can be injected into a molten polymer stream to form a blend just prior to extrusion into the desired shape. After extrusion, an annealing step may be carried out to enhance hydrophilicity. Preferably, the article is annealed at a temperature and for a time sufficient to increase the amount of monoglyceride at the surface of the article. Effective time and temperature will bear an inverse relationship to one another and a wide variety of conditions will be suitable. Using polypropylene, for example, the annealing process can be conducted below the melt temperature at about 60\u00b0 to about 80\u00b0 C. for a period of about 30 seconds to about 5 minutes or more. In some cases, the presence of moisture during annealing can improve the effectiveness of the monoglyceride. The annealing of a fibrous web can be carried out, for example, in combination with other processing steps for the web (e.g., during the warm cycle of an ethylene oxide sterilization cycle). Hydrophilicity may also be enhanced by contacting the shaped article with heated surfaces, such as hot rolls at about 60\u00b0 C. to 100\u00b0 C. for about 10-60 seconds.","Melt-blown hydrophilic fibers useful in the present invention can be prepared as described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,849,241 (Butin et al.) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,064,578 (Insley et al.), or from microfiber webs containing particulate matter such as those disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 3,971,373 (Braun), U.S. Pat. No. 4,100,324 (Anderson), and U.S. Pat. No. 4,429,001 (Kolpin et al.). Multilayer constructions of nonwoven fabrics enjoy wide industrial and commercial utility and include such uses as fabrics for medical gowns and drapes. The nature of the constituent layers of such multilayer constructions can be varied according to the desired end use characteristics, and can comprise two or more layers of melt-blown and spun-bond webs in many useful combinations, such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,145,727 (Potts et al.) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,149,576 (Potts et al.). In particular, a process similar to that described in Wente, Superfine Thermoplastic Fibers, 48 INDUS. ENG'G CHEM. 1342(1956), or in Wente et al., MANUFACTURE OF SUPERFINE ORGANIC FIBERS, (Naval Research Laboratories Report No. 4364, 1954), can be used for the preparation of the nonwoven webs of this invention. However, because of the potential for thermal instability of the glycerol monoesters employed in the invention as melt additives, it is preferable to incorporate the monoester into the polymer melt just before or just after the die, such as is generally described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,933,229 (Insley et al.) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,064,578 (Insley et al.).","Preferred hydrophilic enhancer materials include polybutylene, polybutylene copolymers, ethylene\/octene copolymers, atactic polypropylene, and certain sorbitan monoesters. Polybutylene and its copolymers, such as, for example, polybutylene 0200, polybutylene 0400, polybutylene 0800, polybutylene DP 8310, and polybutylene DP 8340 (all available from Shell Chemical Co.), ethylene\/octene copolymers, such as, for example, ENGAGE\u2122 8401 and 8402 (available from DuPont Dow Elastomer), ethylene\/butylene and butylene\/ethylene copolymers, for example, EXACT\u2122 4023 (available from Exxon) and MONTELL\u2122 dp-8340 (AVAILABLE FROM Montell), and atactic poly(alpha)olefins, such as APAO-2180-E8 atactic polypropylene, a high molecular weight homopolymer of polypropylene, available from Rexene Co., may be incorporated as an additional polymer melt additive to enhance the hydrophilic properties of the extrudate. Effective concentrations of the polybutylene homopolymer and copolymers, determined by measuring the amount incorporated as a melt additive prior to fiber formation, range from about 2 to about 25% by weight, and preferably from about 5% to about 15% by weight. The enhancement effect is seen at polybutylene levels up to about 25% by weight, and at monoglyceride concentrations as low as 1.0% by weight, based on the weight of the composition prior to fiber formation.","Cto C, preferably Cto Csorbitan monoesters such as SPAN\u2122 20 (sorbitan monolaurate) or SPAN\u2122 40 (sorbitan monopalmitate) for example EXACT\u2122 4023 (available from Exxon) and MONTELL\u2122 DP-8340 (available from Montell), in combination with the monoglyceride, with or without polybutylene, can further enhance the hydrophilic properties of the extrudate. These monoesters both enhance the hydrophilicity of the web and allow the web to maintain its hydrophilicity after aging at ambient conditions. When these hydrophilic enhancer materials are used, they may replace from about 10% to about 50% of the monoglyceride, preferably from about 30% to about 50%.","In addition to the hydrophilic fibers of the present invention, the nonwoven webs or fabrics and fiber batts can further include commonly used hydrophilic fillers such as, for example, wood pulp, cellulose, cotton, rayon, recycled cellulose, and shredded cellulose sponge, as well as adhesive binders and antistats.","Any of a wide variety of constructions, especially multilayer constructions such as spunbond\/melt-blown\/spunbond (\u201cSMS\u201d) constructions, may be made from the above-described fibers and fabrics, and such constructions will find utility in applications requiring hydrophilicity. Such constructions include aqueous media absorbent devices such as diapers, feminine care products, and adult incontinence products, which utilize the fiber and fabrics as at least a portion of their fluid-absorbing \u201ccore\u201d element. \u201cAbsorbent device\u201d as used herein refers to a consumer product that is capable of absorbing significant quantities of water and other aqueous fluids (i.e., liquids) such as body fluids. Examples of aqueous media absorbent devices include wound dressings, disposable diapers, sanitary napkins, tampons, incontinence pads, disposable training pants, paper towels, geofabrics, facial tissues, medical drapes and masks, medical gowns, and the like. The fabrics of the present invention are particularly suitable for use in devices like sanitary napkins, diapers, and incontinence pads.","Aqueous media absorbent devices frequently will comprise a substantially aqueous media impervious and moisture vapor-permeable backing sheet, an aqueous media permeable top sheet, and an aqueous media absorbent core comprising at least one aqueous media absorbent layer positioned between said backing sheet and said top sheet. The aqueous media impervious backing sheets may comprise any suitable material, such as polyethylene, polypropylene and polyurethane, preferably having a thickness of at least about 0.020 mm, which will help retain fluid within the absorbent article. The aqueous media impervious backing sheet may also comprise a fabric treated with a water repellent material. The aqueous media permeable top sheets can comprise material, such as polyester, polyolefin, rayon, and the like, that is substantially porous and permits aqueous media to readily pass therethrough into the underlying absorbent core. Suitable materials for both the top sheets and the backing sheets are well known in the art.","More detailed descriptions of sanitary napkins and suitable materials for use therein may be found in U.S. Pat. No. 3,871,378 (Duncan et al.), U.S. Pat. No. 4,324,246 (Smith et al.), and U.S. Pat. No. 4,589,876 (Van Tillberg).","Disposable diapers comprising the hydrophilic fabrics of the invention may be made by using conventional diaper making techniques, replacing or supplementing the wood pulp fiber core typically employed with the fabrics comprising hydrophilic fibers of the present invention. The hydrophilic fibers of the invention may also be used to input hydrophilicity to the top sheet of such an article where hydrophilicity is desired. The hydrophilic fabrics of this invention may thus be used in diapers in single layer or in multiple layer core configurations. Articles in the form of disposable diapers are described by U.S. Pat. No. 3,592,194 (Duncan et al.), U.S. Pat. No. 3,489,148 (Duncan et al.), and U.S. Pat. No. 3,860,003 (Buell).","Preferably, a liquid composition comprising at least one antimicrobial enhancer material and optionally a liquid vehicle is applied by, e.g., dipping, spraying, printing, padding or by brush or sponge, to a portion of or the entire exterior surface of the shaped article, namely, fibers, woven and nonwoven fabrics or webs, and batts. The liquid vehicle is then removed, typically by drying, from the liquid composition to provide an essentially dry coating of the antimicrobial enhancer material containing at least about 50 weight percent enhancer material, preferably at least about 75 weight percent enhancer material, and more preferably at least about 95 wt. % enhancer material on the surface of the article. The antimicrobial enhancer, when combined in sufficient concentration and uniformity with a fiber prepared with the monoglyceride melt additive, enhances either the antimicrobial activity of the article surface or the spectrum of antimicrobial activity, that is, the article surface has antimicrobial activity to both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Preferred antimicrobial enhancer materials are organic acids and chelating agents. Examples of suitable antimicrobial enhancer materials include: lactic acid, tartaric acid, adipic acid, succinic acid, citric acid, ascorbic acid, malic acid, mandelic acid, acetic acid, sorbic acid, benzoic acid, salicylic acid, sodium acid pyrophosphate, acidic sodium hexametaphosphate (such as SPORIX\u2122 acidic sodium hexametaphosphate and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid or EDTA) and salts thereof. Preferred materials are both food grade and GRAS materials, and a particularly preferred antimicrobial enhancer material is lactic acid. Typically, the liquid composition is prepared by dissolving, dispersing or emulsifying the antimicrobial enhancer material in a liquid vehicle such as water and\/or a lower alcohol, such as ethanol, to provide a liquid composition comprising from about 1.0 to about 50 wt. % enhancer material based on total weight of the liquid composition. A preferred method for applying the liquid composition to extruded fibers is to spray the hot fibers as they exit the extrusion die. Typical spray rates of about 3 kg\/hr to about 25 kg\/hr of an aqueous lactic acid solution are suitable for fiber extrusion rates of about 90 to about 100 kg\/hr. Undiluted liquid lactic acid or any dilution up to a 1 part lactic acid per 3 parts water are preferred. Solvent removal, if necessary, can be accomplished by drying the coated fibers in an oven.","Turning now to the drawings, in  there is shown an absorbent device . The device has an absorbent layer  which is substantially conformable and is comprised of one or more layers of nonwoven or woven fabrics, webs or fiber batts. The layers are comprised of fibers that are hydrophilic and, preferably, also antimicrobial to Gram-positive bacteria, and even more preferably, to Gram-negative bacteria as well. Where more than one layer of fabric, web or fiber batt is employed to make the absorbent layer, the layers may be bonded together by melt bonding (e.g., pattern bonding or radio frequency bonding) or adhesives to form a single, unitary layer. Suitable adhesives include hot melt spray adhesives such as HL-1685-X or HL-1710-X, both of which are commercially available from H.B. Fuller Co., St. Paul, Minn. The hot melt adhesive can be applied using spiral spray adhesive systems such as those commercially available from Nordson Corporation, Duluth, Ga. Typical adhesive application rates using such systems are about 6 to 10 grams\/m. In addition, the fibers may be combined with other additives commonly used to prepare absorbent fabrics or batts, such as wood pulp, cellulose, cotton, rayon, recycled cellulose, shredded cellulose sponge and binders. Typically, the thickness of the absorbent layer is from about 0.5 to about 10 mm.","The absorbent layer  has an upper surface  and a lower surface . Adhered to the upper surface  is a substantially conformable and substantially coextensive, liquid-impermeable backing sheet . The backing sheet  can be essentially continuous, or it can be microporous, and preferably it is moisture vapor-permeable so as to prevent an unacceptable buildup of moisture within the absorbent device when the absorbent layer  is saturated, for example, with wound exudate. The backing sheet  is typically about 0.02 to about 0.12 mm thick, and can be selected from a variety of commonly known polymeric films, such as polyurethane and polypropylene films. A microporous film preferred for use as a backing sheet can be prepared according to the method of U.S. Pat. No. 4,726,989 (Mrozinski), and particularly the procedure described in Examples 1-8 of that patent, without the solvent extraction of the oil. The backing sheet  can be adhered to the absorbent layer  by melt bonding (e.g., pattern bonding or radio frequency bonding), or by a continuous or discontinuous adhesive layer (not shown) comprising, for example, one of the non-cytotoxic adhesives known in the art such as those described above.","Optionally, a substantially conformable liquid-permeable sheet  is adhered to the lower surface  of the absorbent layer . By \u201cadhered\u201d is meant that sheet  abuts and extends along the lower surface  and can be, but need not be, attached thereto by adhesive means. The liquid-permeable sheet  is preferably substantially coextensive with the absorbent layer  and adhered to it either by melt bonding or by an adhesive as described hereinabove (e.g., a hot melt spray adhesive). Typically, the liquid-permeable sheet is about 0.05 mm to about 0.075 mm thick, and is substantially porous to permit free flow of liquid. A particularly preferred liquid-permeable sheet is the non-stick netting commercially available from Applied Extrusion Technologies, Middletown, Del. as Delnet CKX215 P-S or Delnet P530-S.","Another embodiment of the absorbent device is depicted in . Shown in  is an absorbent device . The device  has an absorbent layer  with an upper surface  and lower surface . Adhered to the upper surface  of the absorbent layer  is a substantially conformable backing sheet . However, in this embodiment, the backing sheet  is not coextensive with the absorbent layer . Instead, the backing sheet  extends beyond the outer perimeter of the absorbent layer , preferably uniformly, to provide an extended portion  with a lower surface . The lower surface of the extended portion  carries an adhesive layer  that can be used to adhere the absorbent device to the target, such as the skin around a wound. The adhesive , preferably a pressure sensitive adhesive, may be in the extended portion  or may be covering the entire surface . Preferred adhesives include adhesives having good adhesion to skin and resistance to moisture. Examples of such adhesives are those described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,648,166 (Dunshee).","Optionally, the device also includes a substantially conformable, liquid-permeable sheet  adhered to the lower surface  of the absorbent layer . Most preferably, the liquid permeable sheet  is coextensive with the absorbent layer . The device also optionally includes a release liner  that is substantially coextensive with and adhered to the backing sheet  by the adhesive layer . Prior to application of the absorbent device  to the target, the release liner  is removed from the absorbent device. Examples of suitable adhesives for adhesive layer  include any of the non-cytotoxic adhesives described hereinabove. Release liner  can be any polymeric film, paper or foil known in the art to be useful as a release liner. Examples of useful release liners include 50 g\/mbasis weight SC 501FM40 white Sopal Flexible Packaging available from Day Cedex, France. The backing sheet , absorbent layer , and liquid permeable sheet  can be the same as those elements used in the absorbent device depicted in . However, moisture vapor-permeable adhesive coated films like those described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,726,989 can also be used as the backing sheet .","The invention may also find particular utility as an antimicrobial face mask, e.g., a surgical mask, or as an antimicrobial medical drape or gown, e.g., a surgical drape. Face masks are used as barriers between the wearer and the environment, and are well described in the art, e.g., in U.S. Pat. No. Re. 28,102 (Mayhew). Through their filtration efficiency, face masks can remove particulates (organic, inorganic, or microbiological) from the incoming or out going breath. Face masks are generally not antimicrobially active even though they are commonly used in a health care setting as a method of minimizing pathogen transmission risk. The invention includes a face mask with antimicrobial activity, that is a mask capable of killing microorganisms that come into contact with it. This activity extends to antimicrobial kill of such common organisms like bacteria, fungi, the influenza A virus, and the rhinovirus, the cause of the common cold. Surgical drapes may be constructed from single layers of a fibrous web material or include multi-layered laminates that include one or more film layers, e.g., as described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,809,077 (Hansen) and U.S. Pat. No. 4,522,203 (Mays). Surgical drapes require sterilization prior to use and since the drapes generally do not have inherent antimicrobial activity, any microbial contamination can remain on the surface of these drapes.","The invention includes surgical drapes that can be self-sterilizing through the application of an antimicrobial coating to the surface of the surgical drape. Active surfaces like the self-sterilizing surgical drapes of this invention can provide long term antimicrobial kill of microorganisms coming in contact with the drape surface. The following examples are offered to aid in understanding of the present invention and are not to be construed as limiting the scope thereof. Unless otherwise indicated, all parts and percentages are by weight.","GML: glycerol monolaurate, available from Med-Chem Laboratories, East Lansing, Mich. under the tradename \u201cLAURICIDIN\u2122.\u201d","GM-C8: glycerol monocaprylate, available as POEM\u2122 M-100 from Riken Vitamin LTD, Tokyo, Japan.","GM-C10: glycerol monocaprate, available as POEM\u2122 M-200 from Riken Vitamin LTD., Tokyo, Japan.","GM-C12: glycerol monolaurate, prepared as follows: A 250-mL three-necked flask equipped with thermometer, addition funnel and nitrogen inlet adapter was charged with 100.16 g (0.5 mol) of lauric acid (available from.

Modifications to the Test Method included the use of Tryptic Soy Broth as the nutrient broth and for all dilutions and Tryptic Soy Agar as the nutrient agar. Letheen Broth (VWR Scientific Products, Batavia, Ill.) was used as the neutralizing solution.","In Examples 1 to 7, the initial wettability of nonwoven webs prepared using Melt-Blown Extrusion Procedure A to extrude EOD 96-36 polypropylene with various melt additives was determined.","Examples 1 to 7 were prepared using concentrations of GML varying from 1 to 4% by weight (based on polymer weight). Examples 8-13 were prepared using various monoglycerides of relatively high purity at 3% by weight. Comparative Example C1 was prepared using glycerol monostearate at 3% by weight. Comparative Examples C5 to C8 were prepared using less pure grades of glycerol monoesters. Comparative Examples C2 and C3 were prepared using different fluorochemical nonionic surfactants and Comparative Example C4 was prepared using a silicone surfactant. Comparative Examples C9 to C13 were prepared using various other hydrocarbon surfactants, including PEG di- and monoesters, an alkylphenol ethoxylate, an alcohol ethoxylate, and a phenoxy aryl alkylphenol ethoxylate. Comparative Examples C14 and C15 were prepared without a melt additive. It should be noted that Examples 8-10 and Comparative Example C15 were prepared using the same Melt-Blown Extrusion Procedure A outlined above, but at an extrusion temperature of 220\u00b0 C. instead of 255\u00b0 C.

At the 3% level, excellent wettability to both cold and hot water resulted, and the overall performance of the sample favorably compared to samples prepared using FS-1, a more expensive hydrophilic fluorochemical additive. Even at some levels less than 3%, GML outperformed SS-1, a hydrophilic silicone surfactant.","The data also show that materials containing monoglycerides derived from C, C, C, C, Cand Ccarboxylic acids (HLB values of 8.3, 7.4, 6.3, 6.2, 5.3 and 4.5 respectively) also imparted improved wettability to nonwoven webs. However, materials containing monoglycerides derived from Ccarboxylic acid provided only slightly better hot water wetting than the control.","The effect of the concentration of monoglyceride in the surfactant material is illustrated by comparing Examples 6 and 11 (prepared from GML and GM-C 12, which have glycerol monolaurate contents of 94 and 90.5% and calculated HLB values of 6.3 and 6.2, respectively) with Comparative Example C5 (prepared with HS-1 having a glycerol monolaurate content of 44.5% and a calculated HLB value of 4.3). The samples shown in Examples 6 and 11 provided improved wettability over the control. However, the Comparative Example C5 sample did not. In part, this was attributable to the lower concentration of monoglyceride in the Comparative C5 sample. Also, even quite pure materials, like GM-C18 (87% glycerol monomyristate, HLB value of 3.0), are not as effective at imparting wettability to the nonwoven web as monoglycerides derived from carboxylic acids with optimum chain lengths. Thus, the HLB value which accounts for both monoglyceride content and type of monoglyceride can be an excellent predictor of whether commercially available monoglyceride, diglyceride, triglyceride and glycerol mixtures will function at the concentrations most desired for cost effectiveness and processability. The data show that additive materials containing monoglycerides and having HLB values of about 4.5 to 9.0 will improve wettability over the control.","HS-5 and HS-6 which are mixtures of di- and mono-fatty acid esters of polyethylene glycol, did not significantly improve the wettability of nonwoven webs over the control.","In Examples 14 to 18 and Comparative Examples C16 to C20, polybutylene (PB 0400) was evaluated as a hydrophilic enhancer for various hydrocarbon surfactants.

The lamination was carried out using hexagonal honeycomb patterned rolls heated to 132\u00b0 C. and gapped at 0.12 to 0.25 mm. The dressing was observed to immediately absorb body-temperature water on the side with the non-stick netting.","These Examples illustrate the antimicrobial activity of nonwoven webs used to prepare the absorbent devices.","Melt-blown nonwoven webs were prepared using PP3505 polypropylene and various amounts of GML using a process similar to the Melt-Blown Extrusion Process B except with a flow rate of 0.45 Kg\/hr and a temperature range of 250\u00b0 C. to 280\u00b0 C. In the case of Example 77, the resulting web was further combined with cellulose pulp using a process and a material similar to that described in Example 76. In Example 81, following extrusion of the hot polymeric fibers, an aqueous solution of LA was sprayed onto the fibers to achieve a level of 1.5% (based on the total weight of the coated and dried web). The heat of the polymer evaporated the water and left the lactic acid intimately in contact with the GML-containing fibers.","The resulting webs were then evaluated for antimicrobial activity using the Antimicrobial Test and .
