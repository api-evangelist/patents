No. 12\/355,228), and \u201cADDING NEW ATTRIBUTES TO A STRUCTURED PRESENTATION\u201d U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/355,607), all of which are filed on the same day and the contents of all of which are incorporated herein by reference.","This specification relates to accessing a search interface in a structured presentation.","An electronic document is a collection of machine-readable data. Electronic documents are generally individual files and are formatted in accordance with a defined format (e.g., PDF, TIFF, HTML, ASCII, MS Word, PCL, PostScript, or the like). Electronic documents can be electronically stored and disseminated. In some cases, electronic documents include audio content, visual content, and other information, as well as text and links to other electronic documents.","Electronic document can be collected into electronic document collections. Electronic document collections can either be unstructured or structured. The formatting of the documents in an unstructured electronic document collection is not constrained to conform with a predetermined structure and can evolve in often unforeseen ways. In other words, the formatting of individual documents in an unstructured electronic document collection is neither restrictive nor permanent across the entire document collection. Further, in an unstructured electronic document collection, there are no mechanisms for ensuring that new documents adhere to a format or that changes to a format are applied to previously existing documents. Thus, the documents in an unstructured electronic document collection cannot be expected to share a common structure that can be exploited in the extraction of information. Examples of unstructured electronic document collections include the documents available on the Internet, collections of resumes, collections of journal articles, and collections of news articles. Documents in some unstructured electronic document collections are not prohibited from including links to other documents inside and outside of the collection.","In contrast, the documents in structured electronic document collections generally conform with formats that can be both restrictive and permanent. The formats imposed on documents in structured electronic document collections can be restrictive in that common formats are applied to all of the documents in the collections, even when the applied formats are not completely appropriate. The formats can be permanent in that an upfront commitment to a particular format by the party who assembles the structured electronic document collection is generally required. Further, users of the collections\u2014in particular, programs that use the documents in the collection\u2014rely on the documents' having the expected format. As a result, format changes can be difficult to implement. Structured electronic document collections are best suited to applications where the information content lends itself to simple and stable categorizations. Thus, the documents in a structured electronic document collection generally share a common structure that can be exploited in the extraction of information. Examples of structured electronic document collections include databases that are organized and viewed through a database management system (DBMS) in accordance with hierarchical and relational data models, as well as a collections of electronic documents that are created by a single entity for presenting information consistently. For example, a collection of web pages that are provided by an online bookseller to present information about individual books can form a structured electronic document collection. As another example, a collection of web pages that is created by server-side scripts and viewed through an application server can form a structured electronic document collection. Thus, one or more structured electronic document collections can each be a subset of an unstructured electronic document collection.","This specification describes technologies relating to retrieval and display of information from an unstructured electronic document collection, for example, the electronic documents available on the Internet. Although an electronic document collection may be unstructured, the information content of the unstructured electronic document collection can be displayed in a structured presentation. In particular, the information content of an unstructured electronic document collection can be used not only to determine the values of attributes but also to identify, select, and name attributes and instances in a structured presentation. Such structured presentations can present information in a coherent manner to a user despite the diversity in sources. Examples of structured presentations include tables and other collections of records.","In general, one aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in machine-implemented methods that include the actions of displaying a structured presentation on a display device, receiving data characterizing a user interaction with the displayed structured presentation, the data including a specification of a first instance and a first attribute of the structured presentation, and displaying a formerly concealed search interface on the display device in response to receiving the data. The structured presentation visually presents information in a systematic and structured arrangement that conforms with a structured design. The structured presentation denotes associations between an instance and values that characterize attributes of the instance by virtue of an arrangement of an identifier of the instance and the values in a visual presentation of the structured presentation. The search interface includes information or an interactive element identifying location of a first value characterizing the first attribute of the first instance in an electronic document collection.","This and other aspects include one or more of the following features. Receiving the data characterizing the user interaction with the displayed structured presentation can include receiving a manual user specification of the first instance and the first attribute that are associated with a cell in the structured presentation or receiving data characterizing a user interaction with a cell in the structured presentation. The cell can be associated with the first instance and the first attribute by virtue of the arrangement of the cell relative to identifiers of the first instance and the first attribute in the structured presentation. Receiving data characterizing the user interaction with the cell can also include receiving data characterizing the user interaction with an empty cell.","Displaying the formerly concealed search interface can include one or more of the following: displaying an interactive element that can be selected by a user to trigger a search of the electronic document collection to locate the first value; displaying an interactive value entry element that can be selected by a user to specify a value characterizing the first attribute of the first instance; displaying a snippet characterizing a context of the first value in a first document of the electronic document collection; and displaying a result of a prior search of the electronic document collection to locate the first value.","The first value can appear in the structured presentation as a value characterizing the first attribute of the first instance. Displaying the formerly concealed search interface can also include displaying an identifier of a first electronic document in the electronic document collection, wherein the first value is drawn from the first electronic document. The method can also include determining that the first electronic document is inoperative to provide the first value and displaying a visual indication of the inoperativeness of the first document.","The user can be presented with an option to select the first value consistently from a first document regardless of changes in relevancy of the first document to the first instance and the first attribute or with an option to select the first value from a first document that is most relevant to the first instance and the first attribute.","The method of can also include searching an unstructured collection of electronic documents to locate the first value in response to a user interaction with the search interface and adding the first value to the structured presentation. Receiving the specification of the first instance and the first attribute can include receiving a specification of a collection of attributes or a collection of instances. The method can also include updating the display of the structured presentation in response to a passage of a time.","Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer program products.","Another aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in a system that includes one or more computers programmed to interact with client devices and to perform operations. The operations include receiving data characterizing user interaction specifying a first cell of a structured presentation displayed on a display device, determining that a prior search has been conducted to populate the first cell with a first value, and, in response to determining that a prior search was conducted, displaying information characterizing the prior search on the display device. The structured presentation visually presents information in a systematic and structured arrangement that conforms with a structured design. The structured presentation denotes associations between an instance and values that characterize attributes of the instance by virtue of an arrangement of the values in cells.","This and other aspects include one or more of the following features. The data characterizing user interaction specifying the first cell can include a manual user specification of the first instance and the first attribute that are associated with the first cell. The information characterizing the prior search can include information identifying an electronic document from which the first value is drawn.","The information characterizing the prior search can include one or more of the following: a collection of electronic documents from which the first value could have been drawn; information identifying a first electronic document in the electronic document collection from which the first value is drawn; and a snippet characterizing a context of the first value in a first document of the electronic document collection. The information characterizing the prior search can be displayed, e.g., in a display element of a formerly concealed search interface.","The operations can also include determining that the first electronic document is inoperable to provide the first value and displaying a visual indication of the inoperability of the first document. The operations can also include updating a display of a value in the first cell of the structured presentation in response to the user interaction. The collection of electronic documents can include electronic documents available on the Internet. The electronic documents can include web pages. The structured presentation can be a collection of cards.","Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding computer program products, apparatus, and computer program products.","Another aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in a system that includes one or more computers programmed to interact with a client device comprising a display device and to perform operations. The operations include displaying a structured presentation on the display device, receiving data characterizing a user interaction with the displayed structured presentation, and displaying a formerly concealed search interface on the display device in response to receiving the data.","The structured presentation visually presents information in a systematic and structured arrangement that conforms with a structured design. The structured presentation denotes associations between an instance and values that characterize attributes of the instance by virtue of an arrangement of an identifier of the instance and the values in a visual presentation of the structured presentation. The data includes a specification of a first instance and a first attribute of the structured presentation. The search interface includes information or an interactive element identifying location of a first value characterizing the first attribute of the first instance in an electronic document collection.","Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding computer program products, apparatus, and computer program products.","The details of one or more implementations are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features and advantages will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.","Like reference symbols in the various drawings indicate like elements.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","106","102","100","104","108","100","102","106","104"]},"Electronic document collection  is unstructured in that the organization of information within individual documents in electronic document collection  need not conform with a predetermined structure that can be exploited in the extraction of information. For example, consider three electronic documents in electronic document collection , namely, electronic documents , , . Documents , ,  were added to collection  by three different users who organize the content of their respective electronic documents differently. The users need not collaborate to ensure that information within documents , ,  is in a particular format. Moreover, if one user wishes to change the format of document , the user can do so without regard for the format of the documents added by the other users. There is no need for the user to inform the other users of the change. Indeed, in some cases, documents can be added to collection  by entities who not only fail to collaborate but who are also competitors who are adverse to one another, such as three different car manufacturers or three different sellers of digital cameras. Regardless of the particular alignment of the entities who add documents to collection , no mechanism (e.g., formatting software component or filtering software) is associated with collection  that ensures that the information in documents is similarly organized within the documents. Further, no mechanism is associated with collection  that ensures that the organization of information in each of each document in collection  remains unchanged.","In contrast, structured presentation  is structured and presents information drawn from documents in collection  in an organized, systematic arrangement. Thus, the grouping, segmentation, and arrangement of information in structured presentation  conforms with a structured design even when the information in the presentation is drawn from different contexts in a diverse set of documents in collection . Further, changes to any aspect of the design of structured presentation  can be propagated throughout structured presentation .","Examples of structured presentations include spreadsheet tables, collections of structured cards or other records, and other structured presentation formats. Such structured presentations can also conform with rules that specify the spatial arrangement of information in the displays, the positioning and identification of various organizational and informational aspects (e.g., column headers, row headers, unit identifiers, and the like) of the structured presentations, the graphical representation of values, and other characteristics.","The structuring of information in structured presentations generally facilitates the understanding of the information by a viewer. For example, a viewer can discern the nature of the information contained within the structured presentation by reading headers. A viewer of can easily identify and compare values presented in the structured presentation based on the arrangement and positioning of those values in the display. For example, a user can easily ascertain that certain values in a structured presentation all relate to attributes (i.e., characteristics) of different cars and can easily compare those values.","System  is not limited to merely populating structured presentation  with values drawn from documents in collection . Instead, in many implementations, system  can determine entities (i.e., \u201cinstances\u201d) that are to be described in structured presentation , values that characterize the attributes of those instances, as well as an appropriate structuring of structured presentation . Such determinations can be based on information drawn from different documents in collection  that are not restricted to having a specific format, a permanent format, or both. For example, the attributes that appear in structured presentation  can be based on the attributes used in documents in collection  to characterize certain instances, as discussed further below. As another example, the units of the values (e.g., meters, feet, inches, miles) that appear in structured presentation  can be based on the units of the values that appear in documents in collection . As another example, the instances that appear in structured presentation  can be determined based on instances that appear in documents in collection .","Further, in many implementations, such information can be drawn from previously unspecified documents in collection . For example, a search query can be used to identify documents in collection  and the information can be drawn from these documents. There need not be preexisting limits on the identity or type of documents from which information can be drawn. For example, the identified documents need not be limited to being associated with the account of a particular individual or originating from a particular retailer. Instead, the information can be drawn from previously unspecified documents.","System  can thus exploit the diverse information content of documents in collection  in a variety of different ways to present a structured presentation to a user. In cases where electronic document collection  includes a large number of documents, the amount of information that can be exploited can be very large. Moreover, in many cases, this can be done automatically or with a relatively small amount of human interaction, as discussed further below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","102","106","200","108","102","104","202","204","208","210"]},"Search engine  can be implemented on one or more computers deployed at one or more geographical locations that are programmed with one or more sets of machine-readable instructions for searching unstructured electronic document collection . Other functionality can be implemented on the one or more computers in addition to the functionality of search engine .","Crawler  can be implemented on one or more computers deployed at more or more geographical locations that are programmed with one or more sets of machine-readable instructions for crawling unstructured electronic document collection . Other functionality can be implemented on the one or more computers in addition to the functionality of crawler .","Compressing, indexing, and ranking modules  can be implemented on one or more computers deployed at more or more geographical locations that are programmed with one or more sets of machine-readable instructions for compressing, indexing, and ranking documents in collection . Other functionality can be implemented on the one or more computers in addition to the functionality of compressing, indexing, and ranking modules . The data center  stores information characterizing electronic documents in electronic document collection . The information characterizing such electronic documents can be stored in the form of an indexed database that includes indexed keywords and the locations of documents in collection  where the keywords can be found. The indexed database can be formed, e.g., by crawler .","In some implementations, the information stored in data center  can itself be organized to facilitate presentation of structured presentation  to a user. For example, information can be organized by crawler  and compressing, indexing and ranking modules  in anticipation of the need to present structured presentations  that are relevant to certain topics. The structure of information in data center  can facilitate the grouping, segmentation, and arrangement of information in structured presentations . This organization can be based on a variety of different factors. For example, an ontology can be used to organize information stored in data center . As another example, a historical record of previous structured presentations  can be used to organize information stored in data center . As another example, the data tables described in this specification can be used to organize information stored in data center .","As shown, system  includes multiple display screens  that can present structured presentations in accordance with machine-readable instructions. Display screens  can include, e.g., cathode ray tubes (CRT's), light emitting diode (LED) screens, liquid crystal displays (LCD's), gas-plasma displays, and the like. Display screens  can be an integral part of a self-contained data processing system, such as a personal data assistant (PDA) , a desktop computer , or a mobile telephone. In general, instructions for presenting structured presentations are modified to the particularities of a display screen  after receipt by such a self-contained data processing system. However, this is not always the case. For example, display screens  can also be part of more disperse systems where the processing of instructions for presenting a structured presentation is completed before the instructions are received at display screen . For example, display screens  can be incorporated into \u201cdumb\u201d devices, such as television sets or computer monitors, that receive instructions for presenting structured presentation  from a local or remote source.","In operation, system  can transform the unstructured information in collection  into structured presentation , which can be presented to a viewer. Such transformations can be performed in the context of web search in which a search engine receives and responds to information requests based on information extracted from the electronic documents in collection .","For example, personal digital assistant (PDA)  or desktop computer  can interact with a user and thereby receive a search query, e.g., by way of a web browser application. A description  of the query can be transmitted over a wireless data link  and\/or a wired data link  to search engine . In response, search engine  can use query description  to identify information in data center  that can be used in presenting structured presentation  on display screen . The identified information can be drawn from two or more unspecified electronic documents in unstructured electronic document collection . In some instances, query description  can include search terms that are used by search engine  to retrieve information for presenting a structured presentation  to a user. For example, search terms in query description  can be used to identify, in data center , a collection of related instances, attributes that characterize such instances, value that characterize the individual instances, and\/or other aspects of structured presentation .","The search engine  can also generate a response  to query description . The response  can be used to present structured presentation  for a user. In general, response  includes machine readable-instructions that can be interpreted by a data processing device in systems ,  to present structured presentation . For example, response  can be coded in HTML to specify the characteristics and content of structured presentation . In other implementations, response  can include text snippets or other information from data center  that is used in presenting structured presentation . For example, response  can include a collection of values, the name of a new attribute, or an estimate of the likelihood that a value to be displayed in structured presentation  is correct, as discussed further below.","In many cases, system  uses the information stored in data center  to identify the location of one or more documents that are relevant to the query described in query description . For example, search engine  can compare the keywords in query description  to an index of keywords stored in data center . The comparison can be used to identify documents in collection  that are relevant to query description . The locations of such identified documents can be included in responses , e.g., as a hyperlink to the documents that are that are responsive to the described query.","In some implementations, the system  can store attributes and\/or their respective values in a manner that facilitates the grouping, segmentation, and arrangement of information in structured presentations . For example, collections of instances, their attributes, and their values can be stored in data center  as structured presentations  are amended and changed by users interacting with client systems such as systems , . For example, instances, attributes, and values in one structured presentation  presented to a first viewer can be stored in the data center  and used in providing subsequent structured presentations  to other viewers.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["106","300","300"]},"The attributes of an instance can be characterized by values. The values of a particular attribute of a particular instance thus characterize that particular instance. For example, the name of an individual can have the value \u201cTom,\u201d the population of a city can have the value \u201c4 million,\u201d and the model name of a product can have the value \u201cWrangler.\u201d In some implementations, structured presentations such as table  can also include identifiers of attributes, as well as identifiers of the units in which values are expressed.","The grouping, segmentation, and arrangement of information in table  can be selected to facilitate understanding of the information by a user. In this regard, table  includes a collection of rows . Each row  includes an instance identifier  and a collection of associated attribute values . The arrangement and positioning of attribute values  and instance identifiers  in rows  thus graphically represents the associations between them. For example, a user can discern the association between attribute values  and the instance identifier  that is found in the same row .","Table  also includes a collection of columns . Each column  includes an attribute identifier  and a collection of associated attribute values . The arrangement and positioning of attribute values  and attribute identifier  in columns  thus graphically represent the associations between them. For example, a user can discern the association between attribute values  and the attribute identifier  that is found in the same column  based on their alignment.","Each row  is a structured record  in that each row  associates a single instance identifier  with a collection of associated attribute values . Further, the arrangement and positioning used to denote these associations in one structured record  is reproduced in other structured records  (i.e., in other rows ). Indeed, in many cases, all of the structured records  in a structured presentation  are restricted to having the same arrangement and positioning of information. For example, values  of the attribute \u201cATTR2\u201d are restricted to appearing in the same column  in all rows . As another example, attribute identifiers  all bear the same spatial relationship to the values  appearing in the same column . Moreover, changes to the arrangement and positioning of information in one structured record  are generally propagated to other structured record  in the structured presentation . For example, if a new attribute value  that characterizes a new attribute (e.g., \u201cATTR2\u00be\u201d) is added to one structured record , then a new column  is added to structured presentation  so that the values of attribute \u201cATTR2\u00be\u201d of all instances can be added to structured presentation .","In some implementations, values  in table  can be presented in certain units of measure. Examples of units of measure include feet, yards, inches, miles, seconds, gallons, liters, degrees Celsius, and the like. In some instances, the units of measure in which values  are presented are indicated by unit identifiers . Unit identifiers  can appear, e.g., beside values  and\/or beside relevant attribute identifiers . The association between unit identifiers  and the values  whose units of measure are indicated is indicated to a viewer by such positioning. In many cases, all of the values  associated with a single attribute (e.g., all of the values  in a single column ) are restricted to being presented in the same unit of measure.","The information extracted from electronic document collection  by systems ,  can impact the presentation of table  to a user in a variety of different ways. For example, the information extracted from electronic document collection  can be used to determine values  for populating table . As another example, the information extracted from electronic document collection  can be used to suggest new attributes and\/or new instances for addition to table .","In some implementations, instance identifiers  can be selected based on one or more search strings. For example, if the search string \u201chybrid vehicles\u201d is received from a user by search engine , systems such as system  can generate and populate table  based on information extracted from electronic document collection  using the search string. For example, system  can access data center , identify instance identifiers  in the electronic documents that are relevant to the search string, determine a set of common attributes for the identified instances\u2014as well as identifiers  of those attributes and values  for those attributes. In effect, system  can determine instance identifiers , attribute identifiers , as well as the associated values  based on the received search string.","In some implementations, one or more attribute identifiers , instance identifiers , and\/or values  can be received from a user for whom table  is to be displayed. As discussed further below, systems such as system  can generate and populate table  based on information extracted from electronic document collection  using one or more received attribute identifiers , instance identifiers , and\/or values . In effect, system  can formulate new instance identifiers , attribute identifiers , as well as the associated values  based on the received attribute identifiers , instance identifiers , and\/or values .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","308","306","307","309","302","304","400","400","405","410","415","420"]},"Instance selection widgets  are user interface components that allow a user to select structured records  in table . For example, instance selection widgets  can be a collection of one or more clickable checkboxes that are associated with a particular structured record  by virtue of arrangement and positioning relative to that structured record . Instance selection widgets  are \u201cclickable\u201d in that a user can interact with widgets  using a mouse (e.g., hovering over the component and clicking a particular mouse button), a stylus (e.g., pressing a user interface component displayed on a touch screen with the stylus), a keyboard, or other input device to invoke the functionality provided by that component.","Action triggers  are user interface components that allow a user to trigger the performance of an action on one or more structured records  in table  selected using instance selection widgets . For example, action triggers  can be clickable text phrases, each of which can be used by a user to trigger an action described in the phrase. For example, a \u201ckeep and remove others\u201d action trigger  triggers the removal of structured records  that are not selected using instance selection widgets  from the display of table . As another example, a \u201cremove selected\u201d action trigger  triggers the removal of structured records  that are selected using instance selection widgets  from the display of table . As yet another example, a \u201cshow on map\u201d action trigger  triggers display of the position of structured records  that are selected using instance selection widgets  on a geographic map. For example, if a selected instance is a car, locations of car dealerships that sell the selected car can be displayed on a map. As another example, if the selected instances are vacation destinations, these destinations can be displayed on a map.","Column action trigger widgets  are user interface components that allow a user to apply an action to all of the cells within a single column . When a user interacts with the clickable \u2018+\u2019 sign, a further user interface component is displayed which offers to the user a set of possible actions to be performed. The actions in this set can include, e.g., removing the entire column  from the structured presentation  or searching to find values for all the cells in column  which are currently blank.","Notes column  is a user interface component that allows a user to associate information with an instance identifier . In particular, notes column  includes one or more notes  that are each associated with a structured record  by virtue of arrangement and positioning relative to that structured record . The information content of notes  is unrestricted in that, unlike columns , notes  are not required to be values of any particular attribute. Instead, the information in notes  can characterize unrelated aspects of the instance identified in structured record .","In some implementations, table  can include additional information other than values of any particular attribute. For example, table  can include a collection of images  that are associated with the instance identified in a structured record  by virtue of arrangement and positioning relative to that structured record . As another example, table  can include a collection of text snippets  extracted from electronic documents in collection . The sources of the snippets can be highly ranked results in searches conducted using instance identifiers  as a search string. Text snippets  are associated with the instance identified in a structured record  by virtue of arrangement and positioning relative to that structured record .","As another example, table  can include one or more hypertext links  to individual electronic documents in collection . For example, the linked documents can be highly ranked results in searches conducted using instance identifiers  as a search string. As another example, the linked documents can be source of a value  that was extracted to populate table . In some instances, interaction with hypertext link  can trigger navigation to the source electronic document based on information embedded in hypertext link  (e.g., a web site address).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0070"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","500","500"]},"The grouping, segmentation, and arrangement of information in card collection  can be selected to facilitate an understanding of the information by a user. In this regard, card collection  includes a collection of cards . Each card  includes an instance identifier  and a collection of associated attribute values . The arrangement and positioning of attribute values  and instance identifiers  in cards  thus graphically represents the associations between them. For example, a user can discern the association between attribute values  and the instance identifier  that is found on the same card .","In the illustrated implementation, cards  in card collection  also include a collection of attribute identifiers . Attribute identifiers  are organized in a column  and attribute values  are organized in a column . Columns ,  are positioned adjacent one another and aligned so that individual attribute identifiers  are positioned next to the attribute value  that characterizes that identified attribute. This positioning and arrangement allows a viewer to discern the association between attribute identifiers  and the attribute values  that characterize those attributes.","Each card  is a structured record  in that each card  associates a single instance identifier  with a collection of associated attribute values . Further, the arrangement and positioning used to denote these associations in one card  is reproduced in other cards . Indeed, in many cases, all of the cards  are restricted to having the same arrangement and positioning of information. For example, the value  that characterizes the attribute \u201cATTR1\u201d is restricted to bearing the same spatial relationship to instance identifiers  in all cards . As another example, the order and positioning of attribute identifiers  in all of the cards  is the same.","Moreover, changes to the arrangement and positioning of information in one card  are generally propagated to other cards  in card collection . For example, if a new attribute value  that characterizes a new attribute (e.g., \u201cATTR1\u00be\u201d) is inserted between the attribute values \u201cvalue11\u201d and \u201cvalue21\u201d in one card , then the positioning of the corresponding attribute values  in other cards  is likewise changed.","In some implementations, cards  in card collection  can include other features. For example, cards  can include interactive elements for interacting with a user, such as instance selection widgets, action triggers, attribute selection widgets, a notes entry, and the like. As another example, cards  in card collection  can include additional information other than values of any particular attribute, such as images and\/or text snippets that are associated with an identified instance. As another example, cards  in card collection  can include one or more hypertext links to individual electronic documents in collection . Such features can be associated with particular instances by virtue of appearing on a card  that includes an instance identifier  that identifies that instance.","During operation, a viewer can interact with the system presenting card collection  to change the display of one or more cards . For example, a viewer can trigger the side-by-side display of two or more of the cards  so that a comparison of the particular instances identified on those cards is facilitated.

For example, the system can receive a search query specifying instances, or a category of instances, that are to be characterized in a structured presentation.","As another example, a user can interact with a preexisting structured presentation to specify an instance, and attribute, or both. User interaction with a preexisting structured presentation can specify an instance and\/or an attribute inherently or manually. Inherent specification draws upon the systematic arrangement of instance and attribute identifiers in a structured display so that user interaction with a cell specifies an instance and an attribute associated with that cell.","In contrast, in manual specification, a user manually identifies which cells include the identifiers of instances and attributes that are associated with a cell. For example, a user can enter a search query into a cell that specifies the arrangement of an instance identifier, an attribute identifier, or both within the structured presentation. For example, a search query that includes the formula \u201c(CELL1, CELL2)\u201d can specify that this cell is associated with the attribute identified in cell \u201cCELL2\u201d of the instance identified in cell \u201cCELL1\u201d and that a search for this attribute of this instance is to be conducted. Such manual specification of instance and attribute identifiers is particularly useful in structured presentations such as spreadsheet tables, where the position of instance and attribute identifiers may be apparent to a user but unknown to a data processing device that presents a structured presentation.

Value suggestions can be formulated for the specified attribute in a number of different ways. For example, in one implementation, the system can formulate value suggestions from documents in an electronic document collection  by conducting a search using a search query that is constructed using the specified instance and attribute. For example, value suggestions can be formulated by, e.g., locating documents that include structured components related to the specified instance and attribute as discussed in the commonly-owned U.S. patent application entitled \u201cPOPULATING A STRUCTURED PRESENTATION WITH NEW VALUES\u201d Ser. No. 12\/355,459, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein.","As another example, a search query can require that identifiers of the specified instance and attribute be found in a linguistic pattern indicating that a value characterizing the attribute of the instance is likely to appear. Examples of such patterns include \u201cthe <attribute> of <entity> is,\u201d \u201c<entity> with an <attribute> of,\u201d \u201c<entity> has an <attribute> of,\u201d \u201c<entity>'s <attribute> is,\u201d and the like. Such patterns can be used to extract value suggestions from textual content in electronic documents.","The system performing process  can provide one or more value suggestions to a user (step ). For example, a list of value suggestions can be displayed for the user on the same display screen that displays a preexisting structured presentation. The display of a list of value suggestions can be done before a value is selected for addition to the preexisting structured presentation.","As another example, in some implementations, the value suggestions can be concealed, along with search information and interactive elements, in a structured presentation. Examples of such implementations are discussed further below.","The system performing process  can receive a user selection of a value suggestion that is to be presented in a structured display (step ).

For example, in the illustrated implementation, error message  indicates that the value is no longer available within an electronic document that itself remains available.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0144","num":"0143"},"figref":["FIG. 23","FIG. 9"],"b":["2300","2300","2300","202","200","2300","1900","900"]},"The system performing process  can receive an update trigger triggering an update of the one or more values of one or more cells of a preexisting structured presentation (step ). The update trigger can be, e.g., generated automatically in response to the passage of a period of time since a previous update, manually in response to user interaction, or the like. For example, user interaction with a cell  (, , ) can trigger the update of that cell, as discussed above. The update trigger can trigger the update of the value or a single cell, the value of a collection of cells, or the values of all the cells in a structured presentation. The update trigger in can concomitantly specify one or more attributes of one or more instances, as discussed above.","The system performing process  can determine whether or not one or more prior searches for populating the structured presentation with values has become inoperative (step ). Such a determination can be made by seeking to access documents from which the values populating the structured presentation are to be drawn.","If the system performing process  determines that a prior search has not become inoperative, the system can update a structured presentation with the content of one or more source documents identified in the prior search (step ). A new values used to update the structured presentation need not be identical to a value previously used to populate the structured presentation. Rather, the updated structured presentation can include a value provided by the source electronic document with its current content.","If the system performing process  determines that a prior search has become inoperative, the system can inform the user of the inoperability of the prior search (step ). For example, a display element such as display element  can be used to inform the user of the operability and provide the user with the opportunity to conduct a new search to populate the structured presentation with values. In some implementations, the system can also conduct a new search and provide information characterizing one or more electronic documents in the result set yielded by the new search, as described in reference to step  of process  ().","Embodiments of the subject matter and the functional operations described in this specification may be implemented in digital electronic circuitry, or in computer software, firmware, or hardware, including the structures disclosed in this specification and their structural equivalents, or in combinations of one or more of them. Embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification may be implemented as one or more computer programs, i.e., one or more modules of computer program instructions encoded on a computer storage medium for execution by, or to control the operation of, data processing apparatus. Alternatively or in addition, the program instructions can be encoded on a propagated signal that is an artificially generated signal, e.g., a machine-generated electrical, optical, or electromagnetic signal that is generated to encode information for transmission to suitable receiver apparatus for execution by data processing apparatus. The computer storage medium can be a machine-readable storage device, a machine-readable storage substrate, a random or serial access memory device, or a combination of one or more of them.","The term \u201cdata processing apparatus\u201d encompasses all kinds of apparatus, devices, and machines for processing data, including by way of example a programmable processor, a computer, or multiple processors or computers. The apparatus can include special purpose logic circuitry, e.g., an FPGA (field programmable gate array) or an ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit). The apparatus can also include, in addition to hardware, code that creates an execution environment for the computer program in question, e.g., code that constitutes processor firmware, a protocol stack, a database management system, an operating system, or a combination of one or more of them.","A computer program (also known as a program, software, software application, script, or code) may be written in any form of programming language, including compiled or interpreted languages, or declarative or procedural languages, and it may be deployed in any form, including as a stand alone program or as a module, component, subroutine, or other unit suitable for use in a computing environment. A computer program may, but need not, correspond to a file in a file system. A program may be stored in a portion of a file that holds other programs or data (e.g., one or more scripts stored in a markup language document), in a single file dedicated to the program in question, or in multiple coordinated files (e.g., files that store one or more modules, sub programs, or portions of code). A computer program may be deployed to be executed on one computer or on multiple computers that are located at one site or distributed across multiple sites and interconnected by a communication network.","The processes and logic flows described in this specification may be performed by one or more programmable processors executing one or more computer programs to perform functions by operating on input data and generating output. The processes and logic flows may also be performed by, and apparatus may also be implemented as, special purpose logic circuitry, e.g., an FPGA (field programmable gate array) or an ASIC (application specific integrated circuit).","Processor suitable for the execution of a computer program include, by way of example, both general and special purpose microprocessors, and any one or more processors of any kind of digital computer. Generally, a processor will receive instructions and data from a read only memory or a random access memory or both. The essential elements of a computer are a processor for performing or executing instructions and one or more memory devices for storing instructions and data. Generally, a computer will also include, or be operatively coupled to receive data from or transfer data to, or both, one or more mass storage devices for storing data, e.g., magnetic, magneto optical disks, or optical disks. However, a computer need not have such devices. Moreover, a computer may be embedded in another device, e.g., a mobile telephone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a mobile audio or video player, a game console, a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, or a portable storage device (e.g., a universal serial bus (USB) flash drive), to name just a few.","Computer readable media suitable for storing computer program instructions and data include all forms of non volatile memory, media and memory devices, including by way of example semiconductor memory devices, e.g., EPROM, EEPROM, and flash memory devices; magnetic disks, e.g., internal hard disks or removable disks; magneto optical disks; and CD ROM and DVD-ROM disks. The processor and the memory may be supplemented by, or incorporated in, special purpose logic circuitry.","To provide for interaction with a user, embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification may be implemented on a computer having a display device, e.g., a CRT (cathode ray tube) or LCD (liquid crystal display) monitor, for displaying information to the user and a keyboard and a pointing device, e.g., a mouse or a trackball, by which the user may provide input to the computer. Other kinds of devices may be used to provide for interaction with a user as well; for example, feedback provided to the user may be any form of sensory feedback, e.g., visual feedback, auditory feedback, or tactile feedback; and input from the user may be received in any form, including acoustic, speech, or tactile input. In addition, a computer can interact with a user by sending documents to and receiving documents from a device that is used by the user; for example, by sending web pages to a web browser on a user's client device in response to requests received from the web browser.","While this specification contains many specific implementation details, these should not be construed as limitations on the scope of any invention or of what may be claimed, but rather as descriptions of features that may be specific to particular embodiments of particular inventions. Certain features that are described in this specification in the context of separate embodiments may also be implemented in combination in a single embodiment. Conversely, various features that are described in the context of a single embodiment may also be implemented in multiple embodiments separately or in any suitable subcombination. Moreover, although features may be described above as acting in certain combinations and even initially claimed as such, one or more features from a claimed combination may in some cases be excised from the combination, and the claimed combination may be directed to a subcombination or variation of a subcombination.","Similarly, while operations are depicted in the drawings in a particular order, this should not be understood as requiring that such operations be performed in the particular order shown or in sequential order, or that all illustrated operations be performed, to achieve desirable results. Moreover, the separation of various system components in the embodiments described above should not be understood as requiring such separation in all embodiments, and it should be understood that the described program components and systems may generally be integrated together in a single software product or packaged into multiple software products.","Particular embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification have been described. Other embodiments are within the scope of the following claims. For example, the actions recited in the claims may be performed in a different order and still achieve desirable results.
