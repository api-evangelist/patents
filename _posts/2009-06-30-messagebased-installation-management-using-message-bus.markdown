title: Message-based installation management using message bus
abstract: Embodiments relate to message-based installation management using a message bus. In embodiments, a deployment server or other provisioning host can be connected to a resource via a message bus. A processor monitors the bus message traffic to detect a message activity. The processor generates an installation command to cause a software installation in a managed network in view of the message activity detected on the message bus.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD","BACKGROUND OF RELATED ART","DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present teachings relate to systems and methods for message-based installation management using a message bus, and more particularly to platforms and techniques for initiating, monitoring, and managing installation events generated by a deployment server connected to applications, targets, and other resources in a managed network via a message bus.","Distribution servers and other deployment platforms are available for managed network applications which configure the distribution of software to target machines on a network-wide basis. In available deployment platforms, a distribution server can be set up to communicate with the target machines or other nodes of a managed network, and initiate the delivery and installation of software to those nodes. In cases, the provisioning may be the original operating system installation for a new machine, or may be software updates, including operating system or application updates, to existing targets or other hardware.","In conventional deployment platforms, the distribution server can act as a repository for the software images needed for software installations, and communicate with the target machines via application programming interfaces (APIs) and connections to supervisory hosts or target machines which are prepared to receive the installation. However, deployment platforms as currently implemented can involve certain drawbacks or limitations. For one, in general for existing deployment platforms to conduct installation activity, a set of messages must be sent on a point-to-point basis between some type of provisioning server and recipient hosts or targets. That is, installation events depend and take place based on positive communication events between deployment servers and nodes in the managed network. There is no capability in such networks for the ongoing monitoring or surveillance of all installation-related activity. As a result, for example, applications or application servers or other entities which may wish to prepare an installation package for newly-installed machines may not become aware of the existence of newly instantiated machines until a separate command arrives addressed to them that notifies them of that event. For another, in general existing deployment platforms rely upon a set of installation-related commands called via a defined API, which requires that all participating targets and other nodes in the network be configured to interpret that API. As a result, clients, devices, or other machines introduced into the managed network that do not host that API may be unable to receive installation-related services. It may be desirable to provide methods and systems for message-based installation management using a message bus, in which provisioning requests and events can be deployed as universal services across a managed network.","Embodiments of the present teachings relate to systems and methods for message-based installation management using a message bus. More particularly, embodiments related to platforms and techniques for monitoring a message bus connected between a deployment server, managed network, set of applications, and other resources to detect the occurrence of installation events, such as the installation of an operating system and\/or the instantiation of a virtual machine.","When installation events occur, applications or other logic can generate additional messaging to initiate further installation sequences, or to cause other provisioning, configuration, or management activity in the target machines. In embodiments, applications, network management platforms, and other network entities can likewise generate installation-related message commands that do not depend on detection of an in-process installation event, such as periodic software updates or refreshes. Because applications and other logic can subscribe to or monitor the installation-related traffic taking place on the message bus, installation services can be flexibly configured amongst multiple nodes and resources, without a need for point-to-point calls relying upon programmatic API commands. These and other embodiments described herein address the various noted shortcomings in known provisioning technology, and provide a user or network operator with enhanced installation services.","Reference will now be made in detail to exemplary embodiments of the present teachings, which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Where possible the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","106","102","106","102","104","106","102","102","132","106"]},"Managed network  can include or host a set of resources including a set of hosts , a set of targets , and\/or other nodes, machines, or resources. In embodiments, either of set of hosts , set of targets , and\/or other nodes or resources of managed network  can be or include virtual machines, as well as hardware-based or hardware-implemented machines. In embodiments, set of hosts, set of targets , and\/or other resources of managed network  can be or include resources instantiated from or based on cloud-based networks.","In embodiments as likewise shown, deployment server  as well as other resources or entities can be connected to, or communicate with, a message bus . In embodiments, message bus  can be exposed to deployment server, managed network , and\/or other nodes or resources on a direct basis without a necessity for an intermediate application programming interface (API). In embodiments, message bus  can be or include a message bused based on the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP). In embodiments message bus  can be or include, for instance, the Red Hat Enterprise MRG platform implementing an AMQP-based message bus, available from Red Hat Inc., Raleigh, N.C. Other AMQP-based or other message bus architectures can be used. In general, message bus  can receive and publish messages on a many-to-many, one-to-many, or other distribution basis.","In embodiments as shown, message bus  also be connected to or communicate with a set of applications , such as supervisory, management, communications, and\/or other applications. Set of applications  can in embodiments be hosted or execute in associated servers or other hosts. Message bus  can further be connected to one or more network management platform , such as a network controller or network security server. Other nodes, servers, entities, services, or resources can be connected or registered to message bus , which again, can configured to receive messages or commands from all connected entities without invoking any specific application programming interface (API), and\/or without requiring structured or rigidly structured message formats.","In terms of installation management, in embodiments as shown set of applications , one or more network management platform , and\/or other services or resources can subscribe to message bus  and monitor message traffic over that bus to detect installation events that may be initiated by or via deployment server . For example, set of applications  can detect the initiation of installation processes conducted on a set of virtual machine as part of set of targets . The installation activity can be identified, for instance, by the type of instructions or data being passed from deployment server  to set of targets  or other destination. Upon detection of an installation event, one or more application in set of applications  can transmit one or more installation command  to deployment server  based on the detected installation activity. In embodiments, for instance, one or more application in set of applications  can transmit one or more installation command  to deployment server  indicating that a set of applications, such as database or messaging applications, should be installed upon completion of the operating system installation in set of hosts  and\/or set of targets . One or more installation command  can then be communicated, or associated commands or installations can be executed, on the desired node, resource, or machine in managed network . In embodiments, other applications in set of applications , one or more network management platform , and\/or other resources can similarly transmit one or more installation command  to deployment server , for instance, in response to an original installation event. In embodiments, one or more installation command can also or instead be transmitted from set of applications , one or more network management platform , and\/or other resources at other times or based on other conditions which may or may not be based on installation events. For instance, one or more applications in set of applications  can transmit one or more installation command  to deployment server  based on a predetermined schedule, for instance, to update installed applications on a regular basis. Other conditions can be used. For instance, one or more installation command  can be triggered by the detection of message activity on message bus  from other applications in set of applications , for instance, to generate a succession of software installations to set of hosts , set of targets , and\/or other nodes or destinations, in dependency order. Other triggering events or message criteria can be used.","More particularly, and as for example shown in , deployment server  can be connected to and communicate with managed network , set of applications , network management platform , and\/or other nodes or resources via message bus . In embodiments, message bus  can comprise an exchange , such as a server or other resource, to which messages from any participating node or other source can be transmitted. Exchange  can comprise logic to receive message traffic from deployment server , set of applications , network management platform , and\/or other nodes or resources and insert received messages into one or more message queue . Message queue  can temporarily store message traffic and delivery messages to destination nodes or resources including deployment server , set of applications , one or more management platform , and managed network  along with any of its constituent nodes. In embodiments, for example, any or more of set of applications  can subscribe to message events generated by deployment server  and transmitted to, for instance, set of hosts  and\/or set of targets . In embodiments, nodes or other resources which monitor message traffic communicated by way of exchange  can registered to receive that traffic on a subscription or other basis, so that those recipients can monitor ongoing message flows without a need to communicate via an API or other programmatic interface. Upon detection of predetermined message events or at other times, set of applications  and\/or other nodes or entities can transmit one or more installation command  to deployment server . One or more installation command  can likewise be communicated via message bus , including exchange , one or more message queue , and\/or other resources, interfaces, or facilities associated with message bus . While embodiments are shown in which message bus  contains at least one exchange  and one or more message queue , it will be appreciated that other communications resources and architectures can be used by or hosted in message bus . It may be further noted that one or more installation command , as well as other message types or content, can be transmitted via message bus  in various configurations. For instance, a message transmitted to message bus  can, for instance, be sent to one destination from one source, to multiple destinations from one source, from multiple destinations from one source, and\/or multiple destinations from multiple sources. One or more installation command  and\/or other message traffic can likewise be transmitted from one or more sources to one or more destinations in sequence, in daisy-chain fashion.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["102","106","108","110","112","102","124","126","130","130","124","104","124","128","106","124","132","102","102","102","102","102"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["402","404","112","102","118","120","106","406","106","102","112","106","108","110","106","408","118","120","102","112"]},"In , set of applications , management platform , and\/or other entities or resources can generate one or more installation command  based on the detected installation activity taking place over message bus . For instance, upon detection of the installation of operating system software on a given subset of set of targets , set of applications  can initiate the installation of identified application software, communication services, and\/or other software or services. In , the set of applications , management platform , or other entity or resources can communicate the resulting one or more installation command  to deployment server  via message bus . In , deployment server  can transmit the one or more installation command  and\/or other configuration instructions to one or more target machine in managed network , such as one or more servers of other hosts in set of hosts , and\/or one or more clients or other targets in set of targets .","In , deployment server  can receive one or more other installation command  or other guest deployment order from set of applications , management platform , and\/or other entities or resources via message bus . For instance, an application in set of applications  may direct the installation of a set of applications that are not associated or directly associated with an installation event, such as installations based on periodic software updates or patches. In , deployment server  can generate and\/or transmit the additional one or more installation command  or other directed guest installation(s) or configuration instructions to target machines or resources in managed network . In , processing can repeat, return to a prior processing point, jump to a further processing point, or end.","The foregoing description is illustrative, and variations in configuration and implementation may occur to persons skilled in the art. For example, while embodiments have been described which operate in a network incorporating one deployment server  communicating with managed network , set of applications  and other resources via one message bus , in embodiments, more than one deployment server or host can be used. Likewise, in embodiments more than one message bus can be implemented to provide communications between one or more deployment servers, applications, target machines, and\/or other resources. Other resources described as singular or integrated can in embodiments be plural or distributed, and resources described as multiple or distributed can in embodiments be combined.
