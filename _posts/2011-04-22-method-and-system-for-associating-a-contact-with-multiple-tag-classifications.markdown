{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND INFORMATION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["Service providers and device manufacturers are continually challenged to deliver value and convenience to consumers by providing compelling network services and advancing the underlying technologies. One area of interest has been the development of services and technologies for enabling device users to catalog content such as e-mail, chat messaging, calendar entries, photo sharing and the like. For example, a user of a messaging or chat application may tag contacts they communicate with in various ways, such as by category or type (e.g., friend, client, prospect, etc.). By tagging, the user can more readily organize their contact lists, thereby facilitating the ease of communications with the contacts. For example, the user can send an email to all friends, or all co-workers to inform them of some relevant event. Traditionally, the capability to designate these tags are inflexible with respect to assignment of the tags, thereby likely to discourage use of such tags all together.","Based on the foregoing, there is a need for an approach to tagging that is flexible and conducive to communicating with contacts.","An apparatus, method and software for enabling multiple tag associations to be used within an application for classifying a contact identifier are described. In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It is apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details or with an equivalent arrangement. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present invention.","Although the various exemplary embodiments are described with respect to the application of tags for classifying contact identifiers for use within software applications, it is contemplated that these embodiments have applicability to any data protocols, methodologies or systems for enabling the classification of any content, including graphic content, audio content, application content, web based content and the like.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","101","101","117","117","105","105","101","101","105","105"],"i":["a","n ","a","n","a","n","a","n","a","n "]},"In certain embodiments, user devices -may be any type of mobile terminal, fixed terminal, or portable terminal including a mobile handset, station, unit, device, multimedia computer, multimedia tablet, Internet node, communicator, desktop computer, laptop computer, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), smartphone or any combination thereof. It is also contemplated that the UDs -can support any type of interface for supporting the presentment or exchanging of data. In addition, user devices -may facilitate various input means for receiving and generating information, including touch screen capability, keyboard and keypad data entry, voice-based input mechanisms and the like. Any known and future implementations of user devices  are applicable.","In certain embodiments, contact data (or contact identifier) can include any information for identifying, profiling or indicating a person, place, object or resource associated with a particular application task, process or event. By way of example, contact data may be maintained at the user device -, generated by an application -, or a combination thereof for indicating a contact number, e-mail address, user profile (e.g., a user name, location), resource profile (e.g., an IP address of a computer, name of a meeting room, details of a data service), physical address, graphic data, business data, affiliations, web-based resources, etc.","In addition, the contact data may include or is associated with additional data, i.e., metadata, for providing contextual detail regarding a person, place, object or resource, including notes, document attachments, certifications, identification numbers, entity names, department names, etc. Of note, contact data may be referenced by applications -by way of contact identifier. According to some embodiments, contact identifiers may include any portion of the contact data in whole or in part, for identifying a specific set of contact data, such as a name, address, identification value, picture, symbol, affiliation, etc. Hence, a single contact identifier may be associated with multiple different phone numbers, email addresses, mailing addresses (etc., work, home, office) and other contact data. It is noted herein, for illustration purposes, that the contact data -is inclusive of, or synonymous with, a contact identifier.","Typically, a user of a voice call application, a video call application, a messaging application or a chat application may also include or associate a tag with a particular contact identifier. In certain embodiments, tags can include data objects, labels or metadata used for classifying a set of contact data by category, type, use or context (e.g., friend, client, prospect, work related, etc.). As mentioned, the ability to associate a tag with an identifier provides contextually rich (and more readily distinguishable) contact data as compared with typical identifiers. For example, a user of a chat application may classify a contact identifier relating to a co-worker with a \u201cCo-Worker\u201d tag, an identifier for a resource such as a conference bridge with a \u201cBridge Line\u201d tag and an identifier for a meeting room with a \u201cRoom \u201d tag. Generally, tags can be customized and assigned by the user, or presented for selection as one or more default tags by the application -","As noted, traditional applications only enable a contact identifier to be classified using one tag at a time\u2014e.g., one group identifier. This one-to-one relationship between a contact identifier and a tag limits the range of use and effectiveness of the applications -, which rely upon these data to support their execution. For example, even though a contact identifier for a particular person is best classified according to multiple tags based on expertise, functional organization, interest or roles and relationship with the user of a device -, only a single tag is capable of being assigned (e.g., \u201cFriend\u201d but not \u201cCo-Worker\u201d). At best, the user can include note data, color coding or other means of denoting the unique relationship they share with that person, but is limited in their ability to quickly identify contacts based on their myriad of classifications for perform chatting, web conferencing and other applications. This inability to efficiently delineate between contacts to accommodate different roles, relationships and contexts results in the user having to select contacts individually from the contact list, increases the time and effort required of the user. This can act as a deterrence to assigning tags in the first place.","To address this issue, system  presents a tag management platform  for associating multiple tags to a single contact identifier. In addition, the system  provides an approach for enabling an application -to recommend the association of a tag with a contact identifier based on a determined relationship between the contact identifier, a tag associated with the contact identifier, or one or more tags for other contact identifiers. By way of example, the tag management platform  operates in connection with or on the user devices -, whereby applications -can assign multiple classifications with a particular contact identifier. The tag management platform  also facilitates storage of the multiple tags along with the contact identifier to the tag database . The contact identifier is then made available for access from a contact list by the applications -according to multiple classifications.","In one embodiment, a contact featuring multiple classifications by way of association with multiple tags is retrieved in response to the establishment of a communication session, group interaction session, content sharing session or the like. By way of example, a communication application such as a chat application, e-mail application, or phone application, may reference a particular one of the multiple tags associated with a contact identifier. Under this scenario, only the tag or set of tags relevant to the communication session is selected accordingly, thus streamlining the ability of the calling application to reference the most relevant contact given the context of the communication. The tag management platform  can provide any one of the user devices -with the capability to conduct sessions via multiple tagged contact identifiers over a communication network using, for example, wireless communications.","While shown as a separate entity, it is contemplated in certain embodiments that the tag management platform  may be integrated with the respective applications -of the user devices -. For example, the tag management platform  may be implemented as an executable service, one or more executable modules, or a combination thereof for direct use by the operating system (OS), application programming interfaces (APIs), libraries and\/or functional elements of the user devices -and\/or applications -. As such, the tag management platform  may generate input signals via the circuitry of the user device  for influencing operation of the device . Under this scenario, additional menu items, selection options, action buttons, data fields and other features may be included within the applications -for enabling referencing or processing of multiply tagged contact identifiers from a contact list (e.g., contact data -).","In one embodiment, the classification processing capability afforded by the tag management platform  is offered by a service provider as a managed (internal) or hosted (external) solution, such as for supporting web based or network based communication applications that are executable by respective user devices -. By way example, a company could use their corporate directory (lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP), web-based, etc.) as a tag management platform  so that employees can add logical and functional tag groups as-needed.","According to certain embodiments, user devices -, the tag management platform , the applications -operable by user devices -and other elements of system  may be configured to communicate via a service provider network . In some embodiments, one or more networks, such as data network , telephony network , and\/or wireless network , can interact with the service provider network . Networks - may be any suitable wireline and\/or wireless network, and be managed by one or more service providers. For example, telephony network  may include a circuit-switched network, such as the public switched telephone network (PSTN), an integrated services digital network (ISDN), a private branch exchange (PBX), or other like network. Wireless network  may employ various technologies including, for example, code division multiple access (CDMA), long term evolution (LTE), enhanced data rates for global evolution (EDGE), general packet radio service (GPRS), mobile ad hoc network (MANET), global system for mobile communications (GSM), Internet protocol multimedia subsystem (IMS), universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS), etc., as well as any other suitable wireless medium, e.g., microwave access (WiMAX), wireless fidelity (WiFi), satellite, and the like. Meanwhile, data network  may be any local area network (LAN), metropolitan area network (MAN), wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or any other suitable packet-switched network, such as a commercially owned, proprietary packet-switched network, such as a proprietary cable or fiber-optic network.","Although depicted as separate entities, networks - may be completely or partially contained within one another, or may embody one or more of the aforementioned infrastructures. For instance, service provider network  may embody circuit-switched and\/or packet-switched networks that include facilities to provide for transport of circuit-switched and\/or packet-based communications. It is further contemplated that networks - may include components and facilities to provide for signaling and\/or bearer communications between the various components or facilities of system . In this manner, networks - may embody or include portions of a signaling system 7 (SS7) network, Internet protocol multimedia subsystem (IMS), or other suitable infrastructure to support control and signaling functions.","It is noted, though not shown in the figure, that in certain embodiments user devices -may be configured to establish peer-to-peer communication sessions with each other using a variety of technologies\u2014near field communication (NFC), Bluetooth, ZigBee, infrared, etc. Also, connectivity can be provided via a wireless local area network (LAN). By way of example, a group of user devices -may be configured to a common LAN so that each device can be uniquely identified via any suitable network addressing scheme. For example, the LAN may utilize the dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) to dynamically assign \u201cprivate\u201d DHCP internet protocol (IP) addresses to each user device , i.e., IP addresses that are accessible to devices connected to the service provider network  as facilitated via a router. According to exemplary embodiments, user devices -may include any customer premise equipment (CPE) capable of sending and\/or receiving information over one or more of networks -\u2014e.g., set-top box. For instance, voice terminal may be any suitable plain old telephone service (POTS) device, facsimile machine, etc., whereas mobile device (or terminal) may be any cellular phone, radiophone, satellite phone, smart phone, wireless phone, or any other suitable mobile device, such as a personal digital assistant (PDA), pocket personal computer, tablet, customized hardware, etc. Further, computing device may be any suitable computing device, such as a VoIP phone, skinny client control protocol (SCCP) phone, session initiation protocol (SIP) phone, IP phone, personal computer, softphone, workstation, terminal, server, etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["103","103","201","203","205","207","209","211"]},"In addition, the tag management platform  also accesses tag data from a tag database ; the database being configured to maintain tags associated with one or more contact identifiers. The tag data  may be linked, for example, to contact data (e.g., lists, directories) as maintained by the one or more user devices -. As mentioned previously, the tag management platform  may be implemented for operation by the one or more user devices -, accessible by the user devices -via a communication link, or a combination thereof. For example, in one embodiment, a communication module  enables formation of a session over a network  between the tag management platform  and the applications of respective user devices -. The applications may formulate sessions directly or by way of a browser application or web portal via the user interface supported by the application -. In certain embodiments, the communication module  executes various protocols and data sharing techniques for enabling collaborative execution between a user device -(e.g., mobile devices, laptops, smartphones, tablet computers, desktop computers) and the tag management platform  over the network .","In one embodiment, a tag assignment module  is configured to enable users to assign, create and associate tags to a specific contact identifier maintained in a contact list (e.g., as contact data -). The tag assignment module  also facilitates storing of multiple tags of differing classification with a single contact identifier to a contact list. By way of example, the tag assignment module  is configured to interact with the operating system (OS), application programming interfaces (APIs), libraries and\/or functional elements of a user device  and\/or application  of the device for generating menu items, selection options, action buttons, data fields and other features for selecting or assigning tags to a contact identifier. The tag assignment module  may also be configured to access one or more contact lists maintained locally or remotely for facilitating an association between one or more tags and a particular contact identifier. Once assigned, tags may be forwarded to the user device  or online resource that maintains the contact list.","It is noted that the tag assignment module  may operate in conjunction with an authentication module  for managing the appropriate access rights and permissions for accessing the contact data (e.g., lists, directories) to be associated with one or more tags of varying classification. By way of example, the authentication module  can facilitate a login process for enabling a user to access a contact list maintained by a social networking service provider or customer relationship management service. The tag assignment module  then assign tags to various users within the contact list accordingly. Also of note, the tag assignment module  may operate in connection with the communication module  to enable establishment of communication sessions based on the selection of one of the assigned tags via an application. For example, when a contact identifier is assigned\/associated with five different tags per the tag assignment module \u2014each tag representing a different classification\u2014the communication module  is caused to initiate the session based on contact data associated with only the selected tag (e.g., work e-mail address versus personal e-mail address).","In one embodiment, a tag correlation module  is configured to determine a correlation between one or more contact identifiers, one or more tags of differing classifications, or a combination thereof based on various criteria, rules or corollary models. By way of example, the tag correlation module  can perform a comparison between a tag assigned to a resource such as a conference bridge or virtual meeting workspace against tags associated with one or more individuals specified in a contact list to determine affinity between the contact identifiers and\/or tags. As another example, the tag correlation module  may determine a correlation exists between a tag of a contact to be communicated with via a communication application (e.g., email editor) and another contact not similarly tagged, but copied on previous communications.","As noted in the above example, the tag correlation module  may also employ history data for enabling a correlation to be made between respective data sets. In another example, the tag correlation module can review the call history data maintained by a phone or conferencing application to distinguish between contact identifiers called during and after business hours, or based on differing area codes, or based on different dial parameters (e.g., internal dialed extension versus external full entry of a phone number). Analysis of such parameters enables the tag correlation module  to determine which contact identifiers, for examples, are work related, customer related, vendor related, personal, etc. It is noted that the tag correlation module  may employ various contextual information for performing comparison and matching (e.g., e-mail domains, IP addresses) as well as employ different statistical, event based and\/or rating based correlation techniques.","In one embodiment, a tag recommendation module  is configured to recommend the assignment of one or more tags, of differing classification, to a specific contact identifier based on a determined correlation. The recommendation may be based on any of the above described or future correlation techniques performed by the tag correlation module . For example, the tag recommendation module  can cause presentment of a prompt to a display of a user device  in response to a correlation between one or more tagged contact identifiers specified to be recipients of an e-mail message. Under this scenario, the tag recommendation module  recommends a \u201cCo-worker\u201d tag and\/or \u201cEngineering\u201d be applied to\/associated with the contact identifier of an independent contractor (tagged as \u201cContractor\u201d) that regularly interacts with or is included on e-mail communications sent to the same co-workers in the engineering department. In another example, the tag recommendation module  recommends one or more general categories of tags based on a determined correlation between the user of a user device  and an online contact list. Under this scenario, the tag recommendation module  recommends a \u201cSocial Network\u201d tag be added to each of the contacts maintained in a user's social network service account.","The tag recommendation module  may be configured to present recommendations\/suggestions to a user device - by email, SMS, tag management and other applications based on the correlations found in associated data sets. Specifics of which tags are recommended may also depend on other contextual information such as email domains.","In certain embodiments, the above described functions of the tag assignment module , tag correlation module  and tag recommendation module  are configured to operate on imported contact list data as well. For example, when one application is importing or merging contact data maintained according to a data structure of another application, the tag correlation module  may perform data mapping and translation techniques for assessing correlations between the various data fields of the different applications. As part of the importation or merge process, the tag assignment module  can prompt the user to assign a tag to a specific set of contact data that cannot automatically be resolved through mapping. Alternatively, the tag recommendation module  may recommend a particular tag be added to a specific contact identifier based on a category or field used in the other application from which the data is being retrieved. It is noted, therefore, that modules - may execute in connection with an application  of the user device for supporting extract, transform and load (ETL) processing.","Also, in one embodiment, a controller module  is configured to regulate the communication processes between the various other modules for generating and associating tags representing different classifications to a single contact identifier. For example, the controller module  generates the appropriate signals to control the communication module  for facilitating transmission of data over the network . The controller module may also operate in connection with the various modules - for initiating and enabling the storage of tag data  with respect to a given contact identifier.","The mechanism for conveniently associating multiple tags of varying classification with a contact identifier maintained by in a contact list made available by one or more user devices -is explained as follows.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIGS. 3A-3C","FIG. 6","FIG. 1"],"b":["103","300","306","312"]},"As seen in , process , per step , associates a first tag with a contact identifier for grouping into a first classification. As mentioned, the classification enables the contact identifier to be grouped according to function, role, skill set, title, activity, resource type, etc. In certain instances, the first tag may be a tag common to multiple users representing different contact identifiers comprising a common group. The tag management platform  may also recommend the first tag, such as based on a determined correlation between one or more of the contact identifiers classified via the same tag.","In step , the tag management platform  associates a second tag with the contact identifier for grouping into a second classification. Per step , the tag management platform  initiates storage of the first and second tag along with the contact identifier as part of the contact list. As mentioned, storage of the contact list (e.g., contact data ) by way of multiple different tags enables retrieval of the related contact identifier by a calling application -through direct reference to the first tag, second tag or both.","As seen in , process , per step , the tag management platform  retrieves the contract list in response to a request to establish a communication session using the contact identifier. By way of example, a user of an email or chat application for which the tag management platform  is configured may access a contact list comprising one or more contact identifiers\u2014of which one or more of the identifiers include or are associated with at least a first and second tag of different classifications. In step , module  process  facilitates selection of at least one of the tags associated with the contact identifier. Per step , a communication session is initiated involving one or more contact identifiers associated with the selected tag. For example, only the contact identifiers associated with the \u201cFootball\u201d tag, representing those who participate in the office fantasy football contest, are able to receive an email communication.","In , process , per step , correlates data of an application configured to process information relating to a plurality of users. Applications for processing information related to a plurality of users may include an email application, social networking application, phone or web conferencing application and other tools and utilities for supporting network communication, group interaction, data sharing, etc. In the case of a conferencing application, for example, it may be configured to initiate a conference communication session according to the first tag and the second tag. Likewise, the email application or social networking application may be configured to initiate a communication session according to the first and second tag. In the case of a photo sharing application, graphic data may be recalled, presented or shared according to the first tag and second tag.","Per step , a recommended tag is generated based on the correlated data. As noted before, the correlation process may be performed based on contextual, historical or other data between respective data sets capable of process by an application. In certain embodiments, it is contemplated that messaging content may also be employed for determining a correlation between a specific contact identifier and a tag. For example, regularly transmitted email messages by a Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of a company pertaining to the general subject of \u201cCompany End of Quarter Fiscal Report\u201d may be correlated to contact identifiers with a \u201cFinance,\u201d \u201cAccounting,\u201d and\/or \u201cExecutive Leadership\u201d tag. As such, only contact identifiers indicating this tag are correlated when the CFO types in the subject line of the e-mail or attempt to attach the report.","In step , process  forwards the recommended tag to a mobile device -configured to utilize the contact list, such as by way of an application . In certain embodiments, given the proper permission, access and configuration settings, it is also contemplated that the tag may be forwarded to a contact list maintained at an on-line repository, such as via an online social networking site.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIGS. 4A-4E"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"252pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Name","Tag"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"10"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"9","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"10","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["(Contact",{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},"My"]},{"entry":["ID):","Friend","Work","Family","Programmer","Legal","Security","Paramedic","Softball","Girls"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"10","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Adam",{},{},"x","x",{},{},"x","x",{}]},{"entry":["Barbara",{},"x",{},{},"x"]},{"entry":["Charlie",{},"x",{},"x",{},"x"]},{"entry":["Donna",{},{},"x",{},"x",{},"x","x","x"]},{"entry":["Edward","x","x",{},"x"]},{"entry":["Fiona","x",{},"x",{},{},{},{},"x","x"]},{"entry":["Gary",{},{},{},{},{},"x","x","x"]},{"entry":["Helen","x","x",{},"x",{},"x",{},"x","x"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"10","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Jenny also has access to a conference bridge that is configured for access within her contact list according to the parameters shown in conference bridge configuration table (Table 2) below.

In certain embodiments, while not shown, this may include presentment of a configurable\/interactive Table 1 to the display , wherein a user is given the ability to add or delete users, define additional tags\/groups or sub-tags\/groups, edit contact identifiers (e.g., Names), etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIG. 4B","FIG. 4C"],"b":["403","431","403","433","433","407","433","103","400","433","433","433","433","411"]},"Jenny selects check boxes ,  and  associated with the Friend, Work and Softball tags accordingly, then she selects the \u201cSave\u201d link  to save each of these tag classifications with the single contact identifier  for LadySoft. This results in updating of the contact identifier configuration table (Table 1\u2014not shown), and also removes highlighting of the contact identifier  pertaining to LadySoft as the identifier  is now associated with the \u201cSoftball\u201d tag\/group. While the \u201cMy Groups\u201d listing  is active, Jenny also activates the \u201cSelect Only\u201d link  for enabling selection of the tag for the identifier  that is to correspond to the SMS message  (e.g., select only the \u201cSoftball\u201d tag ). Jenny then selects the \u201cSEND\u201d button  for transmitting the message to the various individuals associated with the contact identifiers in the recipients list .","It is noted that various other means of assigning tags to a contact identifier are possible. Furthermore, in certain embodiments, it is contemplated that the tag management platform  may render to the display via an application various additional menu items, buttons, etc. for enabling selection and generation of nested or sub-tags. For example, the \u201cMy Groups\u201d listing  may present the \u201cMy Girls\u201d tag  as a sub-tag of a more broadly classified \u201cFriend\u201d tag . Under this scenario, selection of the \u201cMy Girls\u201d tag  automatically results in selection of the \u201cFriend\u201d tag .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 4D","b":["450","400"]},"Jenny receives an alert by way of e-mail asking her to join a conference bridge (IT Bridge per Table 2) due to a malfunction with a server. Jenny uses her hands-free device (e.g., Bluetooth handset) to voice-dial the IT bridge with the \u201cWork\u201d tag associated with it. While on the bridge, she learns that the system is behaving strangely because it has been hacked. Also, she learns via the call that there is a breach of sensitive information by the hackers, which requires her to notify the affected parties based on state and federal laws. She accesses an email application at her laptop computer , which is rendered to a display , and proceeds to generate a urgent meeting request . Jenny activates a tag presentment icon or action button  of the email application for selecting only those individuals most relevant to addressing the server problem. Under this scenario, Jenny selects recipients whose contact identifiers are associated with the \u201cLegal\u201d tag  and \u201cSecurity\u201d tag , corresponding to Barbara and Charlie respectively. The recipients are also restricted by way of the tags to only those associated with the \u201cWork\u201d tag . Consequently, the message for requesting a meeting and indicating conference call dial-in information  stays within her company. Neither Donna, an attorney also associated with the \u201cLegal\u201d tag , nor Gary, a network security engineer who works outside of her company that is also associated with the \u201cSecurity\u201d tag , receives the meeting request upon activation of the \u201cSend\u201d action button .","In certain embodiments, tags may be suggested based on the context or general usage of the application in question. For example, when Jenny accesses a Work related e-mail app for establishing a meeting, the application can be configured to automatically assume that contacts being selected are to be \u201cWork\u201d tagged contacts as opposed to any other classification. By way of example, contacts associated with the \u201cWork\u201d tag are presented or recommended to the user by default over personal tags, such as \u201cMy Girls.\u201d","After resolving the work related matter, Jenny accesses her smartphone  and launches a social networking application as depicted with respect to . She decides to contact her best friends to coordinate a social activity (e.g., Girls Night Out). After logging into her social networking account, she generates a message  then selects the tag presentment icon or action button  of the social networking application (e.g., instant chat) in order to select only the those individuals most relevant to attending the social event. Under this scenario, Jenny selects the \u201cMy Girls\u201d tag  to send out an invite suggesting their usual venue. As a result, \u201cMy Girls\u201d is shown to the recipient data entry field  or alternatively, the individual contact identifiers of Donna, Fiona and Helen. Also, a tag indicator  is shown. Jenny also decides to send the message to her friend and co-worker LadySoft, who is currently not associated with the \u201cMy Girls\u201d tag  but familiar with the group of friends . Upon selecting the \u201cSEND\u201d action button , she immediately receives response messages from various of her friends.","As mentioned previously, the contact identifier  for LadySoft is highlighted to indicate that the contact identifier  for LadySoft has yet to be associated with the My Girls tag. Having determined that LadySoft has been included in prior functions and announcements to the My Girls group (a correlation), the tag management platform  renders a recommendation message prompt to the display , as depicted in . The recommendation message  queries Jenny if she wants to associate LadySoft with the \u201cMy Girls\u201d tag  given the determined correlation she shares with the other contact identifiers already tagged as such. Jenny selects the \u201cNo\u201d action button  to reject the recommendation or \u201cYes\u201d action button  to proceed with the recommendation and remove the highlighting from the contact identifier  for LadySoft. The message can then be sent to her friends.","The exemplary techniques and systems presented herein enable multiple tags of different classification and\/or sub-tags to be associated with a single contact identifier. This advantageously provides a hierarchical means of tracking contacts within a list as well as supports enhanced accessing of contact identifiers by way of multiple classification types.","The processes described herein for enabling multiple tag associations to be used for classifying a contact identifier may be implemented via software, hardware (e.g., general processor, Digital Signal Processing (DSP) chip, an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), etc.), firmware or a combination thereof.

An input device , such as a keyboard including alphanumeric and other keys, is coupled to the bus  for communicating information and command selections to the processor . Another type of user input device is a cursor control , such as a mouse, a trackball, or cursor direction keys, for communicating direction information and command selections to the processor  and for adjusting cursor movement on the display .","According to an embodiment of the invention, the processes described herein are performed by the computer system , in response to the processor  executing an arrangement of instructions contained in main memory . Such instructions can be read into main memory  from another computer-readable medium, such as the storage device . Execution of the arrangement of instructions contained in main memory  causes the processor  to perform the process steps described herein. One or more processors in a multi-processing arrangement may also be employed to execute the instructions contained in main memory . In alternative embodiments, hard-wired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions to implement the embodiment of the invention. Thus, embodiments of the invention are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software.","The computer system  also includes a communication interface  coupled to bus . The communication interface  provides a two-way data communication coupling to a network link  connected to a local network . For example, the communication interface  may be a digital subscriber line (DSL) card or modem, an integrated services digital network (ISDN) card, a cable modem, a telephone modem, or any other communication interface to provide a data communication connection to a corresponding type of communication line. As another example, communication interface  may be a local area network (LAN) card (e.g. for Ethernet\u2122 or an Asynchronous Transfer Model (ATM) network) to provide a data communication connection to a compatible LAN. Wireless links can also be implemented. In any such implementation, communication interface  sends and receives electrical, electromagnetic, or optical signals that carry digital data streams representing various types of information. Further, the communication interface  can include peripheral interface devices, such as a Universal Serial Bus (USB) interface, a PCMCIA (Personal Computer Memory Card International Association) interface, etc. Although a single communication interface  is depicted in , multiple communication interfaces can also be employed.","The network link  typically provides data communication through one or more networks to other data devices. For example, the network link  may provide a connection through local network  to a host computer , which has connectivity to a network  (e.g. a wide area network (WAN) or the global packet data communication network now commonly referred to as the \u201cInternet\u201d) or to data equipment operated by a service provider. The local network  and the network  both use electrical, electromagnetic, or optical signals to convey information and instructions. The signals through the various networks and the signals on the network link  and through the communication interface , which communicate digital data with the computer system , are exemplary forms of carrier waves bearing the information and instructions.","The computer system  can send messages and receive data, including program code, through the network(s), the network link , and the communication interface . In the Internet example, a server (not shown) might transmit requested code belonging to an application program for implementing an embodiment of the invention through the network , the local network  and the communication interface . The processor  may execute the transmitted code while being received and\/or store the code in the storage device , or other non-volatile storage for later execution. In this manner, the computer system  may obtain application code in the form of a carrier wave.","The term \u201ccomputer-readable medium\u201d as used herein refers to any medium that participates in providing instructions to the processor  for execution. Such a medium may take many forms, including but not limited to computer-readable storage medium ((or non-transitory)\u2014i.e., non-volatile media and volatile media), and transmission media. Non-volatile media include, for example, optical or magnetic disks, such as the storage device . Volatile media include dynamic memory, such as main memory . Transmission media include coaxial cables, copper wire and fiber optics, including the wires that comprise the bus . Transmission media can also take the form of acoustic, optical, or electromagnetic waves, such as those generated during radio frequency (RF) and infrared (IR) data communications. Common forms of computer-readable media include, for example, a floppy disk, a flexible disk, hard disk, magnetic tape, any other magnetic medium, a CD-ROM, CDRW, DVD, any other optical medium, punch cards, paper tape, optical mark sheets, any other physical medium with patterns of holes or other optically recognizable indicia, a RAM, a PROM, and EPROM, a FLASH-EPROM, any other memory chip or cartridge, a carrier wave, or any other medium from which a computer can read.","Various forms of computer-readable media may be involved in providing instructions to a processor for execution. For example, the instructions for carrying out at least part of the embodiments of the invention may initially be borne on a magnetic disk of a remote computer. In such a scenario, the remote computer loads the instructions into main memory and sends the instructions over a telephone line using a modem. A modem of a local computer system receives the data on the telephone line and uses an infrared transmitter to convert the data to an infrared signal and transmit the infrared signal to a portable computing device, such as a personal digital assistant (PDA) or a laptop. An infrared detector on the portable computing device receives the information and instructions borne by the infrared signal and places the data on a bus. The bus conveys the data to main memory, from which a processor retrieves and executes the instructions. The instructions received by main memory can optionally be stored on storage device either before or after execution by processor.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0070"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 5"],"b":["600","600","600","600","600"]},"In one embodiment, the chip set or chip  includes a communication mechanism such as a bus  for passing information among the components of the chip set .
