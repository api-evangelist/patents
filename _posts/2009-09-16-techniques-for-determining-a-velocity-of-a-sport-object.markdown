title: Techniques for determining a velocity of a sport object
abstract: A method for determining a velocity of an object (O), such as a ball, over a span length (SL) extending from a span start (SS) to a span end (SE). An audio signal (AS) is received by a mobile terminal's (MT) microphone (MP). An approximate travel time (TT) for a traversal of the span length (SL) by the object (O) is determined, which act time comprises processing the audio signal (AS) and detecting a first shape () and a second shape () which respectively correspond to an approximate start time (T) and approximate end time (T) of the traversal, and determining the approximate travel time (TT) based on the detected first shape () and second shape (). The object's velocity is determined based on the span length (SL) and approximate travel time (TT). The velocity may be determined by the mobile terminal or by an external server.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The invention relates to techniques for determining velocity of a sport object. A representative but non-restrictive list of exemplary sport objects includes balls, pucks, arrows and comparable items.","In many games, the velocity of sport object is crucial to the athlete's performance, which is why athletes aim at improving the initial velocity, or start velocity, of the sport objects. It is customary to measure the initial velocity of sport object by means of Doppler radar. A problem with this approach is that the Doppler radar is prohibitively expensive to most amateur athletes.","Accordingly, there is a need for simpler equipment for measuring the velocity of a sport object.","An object of the invention is to develop techniques for measuring the velocity of a sport object with a simpler and less costly equipment than in conventional methods. The object of the invention is achieved by a method, apparatus and software product as specified in the attached independent claims. The dependent claims as well as the present patent specification and drawing relate to specific embodiments and implementations of the invention.","The invention is partially based on the idea of determining the object's velocity by utilizing a mobile terminal, such as a mobile telephone. Mobile telephones are ubiquitous, yet sophisticated pieces of equipment, many of which support additional program modules which can be used to direct the mobile telephone's processor to perform the necessary processing acts and calculations. The invention is also based on the idea of using the mobile telephone's built-in microphone or some microphone operatively coupled to the mobile telephone to receive an audio signal based on which the start and end times of the sport object's movement can be detected.","As used herein, a mobile telephone means an electronic apparatus which is capable of attaching to a wireless network and carrying out a bidirectional call, which is conveyed via the wireless network, at least for a portion of its distance. For instance, the call may be a voice or data call in a cellular mobile network. Alternatively, the call may be a VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) call conveyed over a cellular network or a WLAN (Wireless Local-Area Network). However, those skilled in the art will realize that the ability to participate in a call is not essential for some embodiments of the invention. Rather the invention is applicable to a wide variety of portable data processing equipment, such as palmtop or mini-laptop computers having voice input capability and the required means for bidirectional communication via the wireless network. It is to be expected, however, that the ubiquitous cellular mobile telephone will be the most popular form of wireless terminal for practicing the invention. Accordingly, the term \u201cmobile telephone\u201d is intended to refer to any mobile terminal capable of receiving a voice input via an internal or external microphone and capable of supporting bidirectional communication over the wireless network.","The audio signal is processed into a series of audio samples, each of which has an intensity and duration. The duration is normally the same for all samples. As an alternative to performing all of the processing acts and calculations by the mobile telephone's microprocessor, it is possible to send the processed audio samples via the wireless network to an external velocity calculation server. The server calculates the sport object's velocity and returns the calculated velocity via the wireless network to the mobile telephone that ultimately outputs it to the user. The mobile telephone may output the velocity either visually or audibly, or both. The common inventive idea underlining these two embodiments is that the audio samples are measured by the mobile terminal, the audio samples are conveyed to a velocity calculation unit that computes the initial velocity of the sport object, and the initial velocity is indicated to the user via the mobile terminal's user interface. In some embodiments the velocity calculation unit resides in the mobile terminal itself, while in others it may reside in an external server, The velocity calculation unit may compute the initial velocity by utilizing parameters such as flight time and span length that directly yield an average velocity, and thereafter the velocity calculation unit may apply some empirical and\/or calculated correction factor to determine the object's initial velocity.","The span length traversed by the object may be determined by the mobile telephone, by receiving this information from the mobile telephone's user interface, for example. The start and end time plus the span length suffice to provide an approximation for the object's average velocity. As an alternative to an arbitrary selection of span length, it is possible to predefine an optimal span length for any given sport, and instruct the user to position the span start at an appropriate location, such that its separation from the span end equals the predefined optimal span length for the selected sport. In addition, it is possible to maintain several different span lengths for each sport, depending on the users' age, gender, physical strength, or the like. A predefined span length provides the advantage over the arbitrary, user-selected, length that the predefined optimal length makes it easier to compensate for the deceleration of the sport object, and thus to provide a better estimate of the initial velocity.","Most athletes wish to know the object's initial (start) velocity, which can be estimated by applying some correction to the average velocity. Such a correction can be determined empirically, for example by performing a statistically sufficient number of experiments in which the object's average velocity is determined by dividing the span length traversed by the object by the travel time, while the object's initial velocity is determined with some other means, such as Doppler radar. Such a statistically sufficient number of experiments will yield an empirical correction by which the initial velocity can be determined on the basis of average velocity and span length. It is also possible to entirely bypass the determination of the average velocity and generate an empirically determined function or lookup table whose inputs are the span length and travel time and the output of the function or lookup table is the initial velocity.","Based on the preceding description of the invention alone, it would seem that the invention is merely based on performing simply physical calculations by a mobile telephone's processor. Those skilled in the art will realize, however, that implementing the invention requires solutions to several residual problems.","A first residual problem is the fact that in the application programming interface (API) of conventional mobile telephones, it is problematic to determine the time of an event with a resolution which is sufficient for accurate timing of the object's movement. For instance, the resolution of various timers varies between platforms and telephone models. For instance, Symbian\u00ae platforms provide universal timer functions with a resolution of one second, which is obviously far too coarse for accurate determination of velocity. As an alternative to the timer functions with a coarse resolution, the Symbian\u00ae platforms provide various \u201ctick\u201d functions, wherein the duration of one \u201ctick\u201d depends on the microprocessor's speed. Such \u201ctick\u201d functions are obviously incompatible with a desire to create a platform-independent program for determining velocity. The problem of how to determine time with sufficient resolution in a platform-independent manner can be solved by determining a first set and a second set of audio samples that temporally coincide with the sport object's position at the span start and span end, and determining the object's travel time on the basis of the number and duration of the audio samples between the first set and second set of audio samples. In case the terminal being used is a mobile telephone, the audio samples may be processed by means of the mobile telephone's audio codec. On the other hand, if the mobile terminal is a data processing terminal without inherent voice call capabilities, the processing of the audio signal into appropriate audio samples may be carried out by some voice recording software installed into the mobile terminal.","A second residual problem is the fact that most mobile telephones are not designed for accurate and objective measurement of sound. Nor are they designed for post-processing of measured sound within the mobile telephone. Instead, mobile telephones are designed to take audio samples called \u201ccodebook samples\u201d of human speech and transfer the codebook samples via a traffic channel to a base station in a wireless radio network. For example, it is a well-known fact that the audio circuitry of a conventional mobile telephone and the voice coding algorithm of GSM telephones are incapable of reliably trans-mitting DTMF (dual-tone, multi-frequency) sounds, which is why various bypass techniques for conveying DTMF sounds have been developed. Some features and embodiments of the invention aim at solving these residual problems.","Provided that the mobile terminal's processor has sufficient processing power, the audio samples can be captured and processed as a real-time operation. Real-time processing does not have a universally adopted definition, but for the purposes of the present invention and its embodiment, real-time processing of audio samples means that the mobile terminal, including all hardware and firmware involved, such as the processor, system firmware, application programming interface and audio processing circuitry are capable of detecting the first and second shapes that indicate the start and end times of the object movement as fast as the audio samples are captured. Typical mobile terminals built on Symbian\u00ae platforms are capable of operating in this mode. A benefit of real-time operation is that there is no need to buffer the audio samples for a longer time that what is required for the detection of the first and second shapes. This means that the audio buffer can be re-used or re-filled in a circular fashion and the mobile terminal, under control of the inventive program module, can wait indefinitely for the first shape that indicates the start time of the object's movement. In other words, the mobile terminal can buffer audio samples only as much as is required for detecting either of the first and second shapes, and then discard the audio samples, for example by re-using the buffer memory area. As far as buffer memory consumption is concerned, the mobile terminal could wait indefinitely for the second shape, ie the one that indicates the end of the object's movement, but it is reasonable to utilize some sanity check which rejects the second shape if it occurs too long after the first shape.","In case the mobile terminal, including hardware and firmware resources, is incapable of real-time operation, an embodiment of the inventive program module may cause the mobile terminal to capture and buffer all the audio samples which include the first and second shapes, and any audio samples in between, prior to detecting the first and second shapes from among the buffered audio samples. A residual problem in such environments is that the captured audio samples must be buffered in a buffer memory, and the memory may be a scarce resource in low-power mobile terminals. The buffer memory requirements can be minimized by providing the user with a signal that indicates the time when the audio buffering begins. In some implementations, the signal can even set up to precede the beginning of audio buffering by a couple of seconds. This is useful in situations like a penalty kick in soccer, wherein the player may run for a couple of second before actually kicking the ball, which results in the first shape to be detected.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["1","2"]},"The microphone MP is separated from the span start SS and span end by respective distances d and d. If the difference d\u2212d is large and\/or the typical velocity of the object is high, it is beneficial to divide d\u2212d by the speed of sound and subtract the quotient from the travel time (whose determination will be described in connection with ). A benefit of using a microphone MP which is detached from the mobile telephone MT and coupled to it via a wired or wireless connection is that the microphone can be positioned at the center point of the span length SL or close to the center point, while the mobile telephone MT is operated from a safe position farther away from the fast-moving object O.","In some implementations more than one microphone may be used. For instance, a mobile telephone may support a built-in microphone and another microphone that may be connected via a short-range wireless coupling, such as a Bluetooth coupling. One of the microphones may be positioned near the span start SS, while the other is positioned near the span end SE. Provided that the microphones are placed very close to the span start and span end, the output signals from the microphones need relatively little amplification, which helps to suppress noise.","In some embodiments of the invention, the mobile terminal comprises a velocity-calculation program, as will be described in connection with . In other embodiments, the mobile terminal may be configured to transmit audio samples derived from the microphone output signal(s) to a velocity-calculation program that resides in an external velocity-calculation server, as will be described in connection with .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","200","202","200"]},"As to the processing of \u201ctime\u201d by the mobile terminal, any times discussed herein, such as the start time T or end time T, need not be times on an absolute scale. In other words, the inventive velocity-calculation unit does not have to know the current time. It is rather the relative times that matter. In addition, the relative times need not be measured or expressed in seconds or milliseconds. Indeed, it is very difficult or virtually impossible to generate a platform-independent technique to measure the relative times in milliseconds because there are no platform-independent timer functions. Accordingly, the times and time differences are preferably processed via sample numbers. Each sample has a sample length which is the inverse of the sampling rate.","Reference numeral  denotes some reference level, such as 0 dB, but the magnitude of the reference level is insignificant. Reference numeral  denotes a noise level such that for a significant proportion of time, the sound profile  remains below the noise level .","The portion of the sound profile  shown in  comprises two major peaks, generally denoted by reference numerals  and . The first peak  is caused by the start of the object's movement (traversal of span length). Depending on the nature of sport and object, the sound may be generated by the athlete kicking a ball, hitting a puck, letting go an arrow, or the like. The second peak  is caused by the object hitting a target, such as wall, fence or the like.","The inventive velocity-calculation program being executed by the mobile telephone's processor converts the presence of the peaks  and  to start and end times, respectively. Firstly, a specific moment of time should be associated with each peak. The peaks ,  are not sharply delineated, however, and the velocity-calculation algorithm or program should be configured to detect shapes within the sound profile , such that the shapes are as similar as possible within the two peaks. In one representative but non-restrictive implementation, the time associated with each peak ,  is the time when the sound profile  exceeds a predetermined threshold  which is above the noise level . In the scenario shown in , the first peak  is detected by the crossing of the threshold  at time , while the second peak  is detected by the crossing of the threshold  at time .","In an alternative implementation, the start and end times ,  can be determined based on the presence of the peaks' maximum values. In another alternative implementation, the start and end times ,  can be determined based on times when the sound intensity increases by a predetermined step in a predetermined time window.","Sports in which the object movement is initiated by throwing a ball or other object may require some additional measures because releasing the object from the player's hand does not readily generate an impact sound, which in turn generates the first sound peak . Such sports may be handled such that the player throws the ball to the ground or a nearby wall, from which the ball bounces to a second wall. The two impacts generate the two sound peaks , , and some experimentally derived correction may be applied to yield an estimate of the ball's initial velocity.","The notations  (\u2248T) and  (\u2248T) mean that the times denoted by reference numerals  and  no not precisely coincide with the start and end times T, T of the object movement over the span length SL; rather the times  and  are the start and end times T, T as measured by the mobile telephone MP under control of the inventive velocity-calculation program. For example, the times  and  lag the true start and end times T, T at least by the propagation of sound from the start and end positions SS, SE over the distances d, d to the microphone MP. Moreover, as stated above, the inventive velocity-calculation program need not know any of the times shown in  on any absolute scale; it is only the time differences between events that matter, and such time differences can be expressed in sample numbers.","Because the sounds generated at the start and end of the object movements have finite lengths, it is beneficial to employ sleep times ,  such that crossing of the threshold  during the sleep times ,  is ignored. The sleep times ,  also help suppress echoes from nearby objects. Reference numerals A and B denote two such echoes.","Based on the preceding description alone, the inventive velocity-calculation unit cannot distinguish between the object movement's start time and end time. There are various ways to do so. In one implementation, each measurement event is triggered via the mobile telephone's user interface, for example by pressing a key. After the trigger, the first and second peaks which exceed the threshold  are considered the start and end of the object's movement, respectively. A problem with this somewhat crude approach is that the athlete or assistant must trigger each measurement event separately.","In a more user-friendly implementation a sliding time window is employed. After any period without detected sound intensity peaks, any detected peak  is assumed to correspond to the start time  of the object's movement. After that, any intensity development in the sleep time  is ignored and the next detected peak  is assumed to correspond to the end time  of the object's movement. However, a maximum time period  from the start time  is employed so as to be able to handle cases in which the end of the object movement goes undetected. For instance, the object may miss its intended target and thereby fail to produce a detectable sound. If the maximum time period  expires without the detection of the second peak  and end time , the previously-detected first peak  and start time  are ignored and the next peak to be detected will be processed as the first peak.","The time difference between the start time  and end time  may be used as the object's travel time TT. In an enhanced implementation the travel time TT may be corrected to compensate for unequal distances d, d from the span start SS and span end SE to the microphone MP.","Reference signs T, TX,  and  relate to optional features that help to reduce the effects of surrounding noise. In some embodiments, the mobile terminal may output a visual and\/or audible signal to indicate that the user may set the object in movement. Reference sign T denotes the instance of time when this signal is outputted. In soccer, for example, the user may kick the ball. It is beneficial to implement a period of time, denoted by reference numeral , during which the sound profile  must remain below the threshold level . Any noise or other spurious sounds during the time period  prevents the velocity calculation program from determining the start time  precisely. Thus, reference signs T and  denote, respectively, the beginning and duration of a period of time during which the sound signal, as measured by the mobile terminal MT, must remain below the threshold level . Otherwise the measurement is rejected.","Reference signs TX and  relate to another optional feature, which involves setting a minimum time between the start time  and end time . Reference sign TX denotes an instance of time that follows the start time  by an amount of time that equals the span length SL divided by the sport object's maximum velocity. The maximum velocity may be set to value slightly higher than the object velocity attained by the best athletes of the sport in question. In case of soccer, for example, the maximum velocity may be set to about 36 m\/s (about 130 km\/h). For a span length of 11 m, the time TX occurs about 0.3 seconds after the start time . Reference numeral  thus denotes a period of time after the start time , such that the second detected sound shape , such as a crossing of the threshold level  by the sound intensity profile , must not occur within this period of time. If the sound intensity  crosses the threshold level  sooner than at time TX, the measurement is rejected. This means that that the sound intensity  should remain below the threshold level  at least immediately before the time TX, which roughly corresponds to a world record for the object velocity. Otherwise the measurement is rejected. In addition, the velocity-calculation program may employ a criterion according to which the sound intensity  must remain below the threshold level  after time , during which the echoes die out, and before time TX.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 3A","FIG. 1","FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["305","310","315","320","325","320","325","330","335","340","345","345","340"]},"In order to solve the problems underlying the present invention, the mobile terminal's memory MEM may provided with a program module  which performs the required measurements and calculations.

The program module  uses the mobile terminal's memory MEM for storing parameters and variables, collectively denoted by reference numeral . Their significance will be described in connection with .","As an alternative to performing all of the velocity-related calculations in the mobile terminal MT, it is possible to transmit the audio samples to an external velocity calculation server VS. Such an embodiment is shown in . As regards hardware, the optional velocity calculation server VS may be a conventional network server which provides information services to mobile subscribers. In order to solve the problems underlying the present invention, the server-based implementation of the invention requires that the server is provided with software for performing the inventive velocity-related calculations.

As an alternative to making the span length user-settable, it is possible to instruct the users to implement a predefined span length. The program  detects the sound peaks corresponding to the start time T and end time T of the object's movement over the span length. As stated earlier, in connection with , it is not necessary to determine the times T, T on any absolute scale, so long as the sound peaks are detected and the duration between them in any explicit or implicit units of time, such as milliseconds or sample periods. Based on the time difference T\u2212T the program  determines the object's travel time TT over the span length SL.","In an enhanced implementation the program  may query the user for the distances d, d from the span start SS and span end SE to the microphone MP. Alternatively the program  may query the user for the difference d\u2212d. The difference d\u2212d divided by the speed of sound Vyields a time correction Twhich can be subtracted from the difference T\u2212T to obtain a more accurate value for the object's travel time TT.","The span length SL and the travel time TT are applied to a function, routine or lookup table denoted by G. In the following description, the term \u201cfunction\u201d will mean any data structure which accepts at least one input value and outputs at least one predetermined output value based on the at least one input value. Accordingly, the element G this element will be called function G although, in terms of programming, it can be implemented as calculation (sub)routine, lookup table or any comparable data structure. The input values for the function G include the span length SL and the travel time TT, and the output values include the object's velocity. In the implementation shown in , the reference sign Vdenotes the object's initial velocity. The initial velocity Vcan be calculated by calculating the object's average velocity SL\/TT and applying an appropriate correction. As stated earlier, such a correction can be determined empirically, for example by performing a statistically sufficient number of experiments in which the object's average velocity is determined by dividing the span length traversed by the object by the travel time, while the object's initial velocity is determined with some other means, such as Doppler radar. Such a statistically sufficient number of experiments will yield an empirical correction by which the initial velocity can be determined on the basis of average velocity and\/or its underlying parameters span length SL and travel time TT. Alternatively, it is possible to model the object's flight by conventional physics and calculate appropriate corrections for determining the initial velocity on the basis of the average velocity. The two most important factor for such physical modelling are the object's air resistance and weight, as these determine the object's deceleration rate.","Regardless of whether the correction from average velocity to initial velocity is determined empirically or by physical modelling, it is also possible to implement the program  such that it entirely bypasses the determination of the average velocity and employs such an empirically-determined or physically-modelled function G whose inputs are the span length SL and travel time TT and the output of the function is the initial velocity V.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 3A","FIG. 5","FIG. 3B","FIG. 3B","FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 4"],"b":["350","352","502","350","1","2","2","1","504","350","502","504","506","508","520","510","518","508","350","510","518","510","512","506","514","516","518","350","350","520","522"]},"In order to eliminate a need for the mobile terminal user to read the determined object velocity for each attempt, the mobile terminal may maintain a top-n list of velocities, wherein \u201cn\u201d stands for some convenient number of best scores, such as a number from 1 to 20. The top-n list may be maintained separately for each sport and user. In case the object velocity just determined exceeds the previous record, the mobile terminal may produce some audible and\/or visible alert, such as a recognizable tone or flashing of its display. The user may be given an opportunity to accept or reject the new record or a new entry into the top-n list. For instance, new records or top-n entries may be rejected in situations wherein a spurious sound has been detected as one of the shapes ,  corresponding to the start and end times T, T of the object's traversal of the span length SL.

Specifically, steps  to  of the flowchart of  are replaced by steps  through , after which the process is similar to the one defined by steps  through  of . The flowchart begins with a parameter-querying step , which is similar to step  and will not be described again. In step , the mobile terminal, under control of the Java applet, waits for some trigger action via the mobile terminal's user interface. For example, the trigger action may be a key press or the utterance of sound exceeding a predetermined intensity threshold. In step  the mobile terminal initializes its audio buffer and audio processing circuitry. The trigger action also triggers a short wait period, step , during which the user can move to a safe distance from the mobile terminal. This is useful in situations wherein the mobile terminal is left to monitor a hard, heavy or fast object, such as a tennis ball or ice hockey puck. After the expiry of the safe time, the mobile terminal signals the start of the audio capturing period in step . For example, the mobile terminal may output a sound and\/or flash a light on its display, to indicate the start of the audio capturing period. In step  the mobile terminal captures audio data for the duration of a predetermined capturing period.","As stated earlier, the application programming interface (API) of mobile terminals may not offer programming functions for measuring time with sufficient accuracy. Accordingly, time-related quantities, such as the length of the audio capturing period, may be determined indirectly. For instance, the inventive Java applet may direct the mobile terminal's processor to capture a predetermined number of audio samples. Alternatively, an appropriate maximum length may be assigned to the capture buffer, wherein the maximum length may be defined as the number of audio samples that the capture buffer can hold. An overflow condition of the capture buffer may then indicate of the expiry of the audio capturing period.","Execution of step  involves an operation which solves another residual problem of typical mobile terminals, namely the fact that the beginning of the capture buffer, ie, a few first audio samples, are frequently noisy. This phenomenon may be caused by a finite settling time of the various components of the audio processing circuitry. For instance, if automatic gain control (AGC) is being utilized, the AGC circuitry may need some time to settle. Accordingly, the noisy beginning of the audio capture buffer should be ignored and the shape detection operation in step  should only be performed on the relatively noiseless part of the audio capture buffer. In one implementation, the Java applet may automatically determine an appropriate length of time (number of audio samples) that should be ignored, by requesting the user of the mobile terminal to place the mobile terminal into a quiet location, after which the Java applet captures that relative silence and detects the number of noisy audio samples in the beginning of the buffer. As this is a terminal-specific calibration operation, it only has to be performed once for each terminal (or terminal type) and stored as one of the operating parameters (see item  in ). The shape detection process in step  is very similar to the one described in connection with  (step ), and a detailed description is omitted. There are two differences between step  of  and step  of . One difference is that the shape-detection operation of step  is performed on a captured and buffered (temporarily stored) set of audio samples, while the operation of step  is performed on a real-time audio stream. This means that, at least in theory, the process described in connection with  can wait indefinitely for the first shape (item  in ) that corresponds to the start of the object's movement, and the detection of the second shape (item ) can trigger the termination of the capturing process. In contrast, the process described in connection with  must capture audio samples for the whole length of the capture buffer and only afterwards search the capture buffer for the occurrence of the first and second shapes ,  that respectively correspond to the start and end times T, T, of the object's traversal of the span length SL. The other difference between the shape-detection operations of  is that step  of  should disregard the noisy beginning of the capture buffer.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["716","716","718","720","718","512","720","514","522"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["704","706","706","704","706","702"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 8","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["802","804","806","808","810","812","818","1","2","814","816","210","212"]},"A benefit of the algorithm described herein is that any constant level of background noise is ignored, provided that the background noise remains below the intensity of the audio signal at the start and end of the traversal over the span length.","Provided that the background noise remains below the intensity of the audio signal, an adaptive threshold may be determined by the following algorithm: first compute the RMS value over a signal buffer that includes both the start and end of the traversal of the span length. An optimal threshold level resides somewhere between the maximum intensity value (which corresponds to the start or end of the object traversal) and the RMS calculated over the signal buffer. For example, the threshold may be set to halfway between two extreme levels, one of which represents an average RMS value calculated over a few recent buffers, while the other is an average RMS value of a few maxima detected within the few recent buffers.","Those skilled in the art will realize that functions like average or RMS need not be construed in a strictly mathematical sense. Average values or RMS values are elegant mathematical concepts, but many approximations of these concepts can be substituted for the mathematically accurate values. Indeed, the algorithm described herein can be generalized by stating that the detection of the first shape and\/or second shape, which temporally coincide with the start and end of the object's traversal over the span length, comprises maintaining two sliding windows which partially overlap one another. The presence of the first shape and\/or second shape within the partially overlapping windows is indicated by determining that f(INT) over one of the sliding windows exceeds f(INT) over the other sliding window by a predefined margin. Herein INT represents the audio signal's intensity or its derivative, such as the RMS function employed in the algorithm shown in , while f stands for any statistically representative function, such as average, mean, percentile, or the like. The detection is completed by searching for an onset of the audio signal within the at least two partially overlapping windows.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 3B","FIGS. 1"],"b":["900","900","910","910","2","4","8"]},"The server system  is dimensioned such that it is capable of serving a large number of mobile terminal MT and their users. The users may become members of one or more communities. For instance, soccer players may be registered as members of a soccer community, tennis players may be registered as members of a tennis community, and so on. Players within a country or region may form sub-communities. As used herein, \u201cplayer\u201d or \u201cmember\u201d is largely interchangeable with a \u201cmobile terminal user\u201d, but \u201cplayer\u201d also implies that the person is a member of a community within the meaning of the present embodiment.","A community maintenance section  keeps track of the players (mobile terminal users as members of a specific community). The community maintenance section  may allocate a virtual player card for each registered player. The players may register via their mobile terminals MT and\/or via Internet browsers (not shown separately). A player's registration process establishes a membership of a community as well as an identity and password for the player\/member. The identity and password are required for further log-in procedures. The community maintenance section  keeps track of each player's top scores and, optionally, their history.","In an advantageous implementation, the server system  assigns a trusted user status to some players. For instance, the community maintenance section  may keep track of trusted users. A trusted user status is required to report or confirm a score that may qualify as \u201cofficial\u201d. Without confirmation by a trusted user, any player's mobile terminal can relay scores or sound samples that yield the scores, but such scores lack an official status. This means that the scores may be entered, stored in the user's history log and shown to the other members of the community, but it is up to the other members to decide how reliable the scores are. Reports confirmed by trusted users have an official status, and other community members may find it easier to believe that the scores in question were made under comparable conditions. In other words, the logic sections relating to the trusted users alleviates the technical problem that scores (velocities) attained by the players may be made in conditions that are not comparable.","There may be a hierarchy of trusted users and official status levels. For instance, a lowest level of trust may be earned by being a community member long enough and\/or by earning the support of a certain number of community members, whereas the topmost level of trust may require certification from a nation-wide organization of the sport in question. In one implementation, the trusted users may confirm scores in the following manner. The velocity calculation logic  calculates the velocity for a player's performance and reports It to the community maintenance section  for record-keeping. The community maintenance section  detects that the velocity is such that it merits an entry in one or more logs. At this point the community maintenance section  may send the mobile terminal MT a request to confirm that score. The trusted user may confirm the score with their user identity and password. If the community maintenance section  receives the confirmation via the trusted user's identity and password, the score is recorded as official. Otherwise it is recorded as unofficial. In an alternative implementation, the trusted user status is linked to the identity of the trusted user's mobile terminal or mobile subscription. An IMEI or IMSI (International Mobile Equipment Identity, International Mobile Subscriber Identity) code may be used for this purpose. A multi-level hierarchy of trusted users and official status levels may be employed in connection with different result-confirmation techniques. For instance, merely utilizing a trusted user's mobile terminal to enter a score may suffice for a low level of trust, whereas the top level of trust may require a separate authentication via password.","An advertisement section  may be employed to make the upkeep of the server system  financially viable. For example, the advertisement section  may be responsive to an indication of a new score of a player, or to a general improvement in the player's score history. The advertisement section  may respond to an indication of a players new score by advertising equipment that correspond to the player's new performance level. The operator of the server system  may finance the upkeep of the system by charging advertisers for each delivered advertisement.","Technically speaking, the various sections of the server system  may cooperate as follows. Reference numeral  denotes a set of audio samples from the mobile terminal MT, and more specifically, from the program  configured to transmit the recorded audio samples to the server system . The audio samples are conveyed to the velocity calculation section , which calculates the velocity and reports it to the community maintenance section . Such reporting is indicated by arrow . The community maintenance section  may detect that the score is a good score or top score for the player and report the fact to the advertisement section , as indicated by arrow . The advertisement section  may select an advertisement which is relevant for the sport and score, and sends the selected advertisement, as indicated by arrow . In addition to the advertisement selected by the advertisement section , the velocity calculation section  reports the player's actual score to the player, and community maintenance section  may report the player's progress, statistics or some other useful information.","In cases wherein the player's mobile terminal has an associated position-determination device, such as a GPS system, the mobile terminal's position may be conveyed to the server system . The server system  can use the player's position in several ways. In some implementations, the server system  may use the player's position and a three-dimensional map to determine the player's elevation above sea level. The elevation, in turn, corresponds to air pressure that may be used to derive an appropriate correction for determining the initial velocity from data (span length and travel time) that directly yield an average velocity. Additionally or alternatively, the server system may record the position of the player's score and\/or select advertisements on the basis of the player's current position.","It is readily apparent to a person skilled in the art that, as the technology advances, the inventive concept can be implemented in various ways.
