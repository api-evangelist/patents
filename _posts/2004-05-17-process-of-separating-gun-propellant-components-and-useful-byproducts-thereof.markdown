{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION","Example 1","Example 2"],"p":["Funding for the present invention was obtained from the Government of the United States by virtue of Contract No. W15QKN-04-C-1012 from the U.S. Department of Defense, United States Army. Thus, the Government of the United States has certain rights in and to the invention claimed herein.","This invention relates to a method of separating one or more targeted components from gun propellant formulations to yield useful products. More particularly, the methods are directed to the separation of nitrocellulose, nitroguanidine and\/or nitroglycerine from gun propellant formulations.","The U.S. military has stockpiled thousands of tons of surplus gun propellant materials that are now obsolete and either will not or cannot be used for future applications. It is estimated that the Department of Defense has an inventory of obsolete, excess, and off-spec munitions exceeding 400,000 tons. Reduction of this obsolete surplus is of economic and environmental necessity. However, the traditional means of open burning, open detonation or dumping are not acceptable. They yield no useable materials, contribute to pollution and increase disposal site remediation costs. In particular, these methods result in incomplete mineralization. Complete oxidation of organic materials is difficult and emissions from these methods include hydrogen chloride gas and nitrogen oxides. Further, these methods require further waste disposal. Hazardous solid wastes, that amount to over 12,000 metric tons annually, have to be contained and monitored indefinitely. Further, such methods are not economical. The basic cost of open burning\/open detonation is in the region of $900\/ton. To this must be added the ongoing cost of maintaining the disposal sites.","Nitrocellulose-based gun propellants and materials containing nitrate ester plasticizers have not previously been considered suitable feedstock for resource recovery and reuse technology because of their long-term instability. Consequently, demilitarization processes for nitrocellulose-based propellants have been directed at benign destruction. Processes involving acid or alkaline hydrolysis of the nitrocellulose and other components are currently being developed.","Various chemical separation methods have been proposed to separate ingredients of explosive materials. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,098,627 describes the solvolytic degradation of pyrotechnic materials containing crosslinked polymers. The '627 patent uses a crosslinked polymer, such as polyurethane and the like, as a component which is decomposed by heating to a temperature of up to 160\u00b0 C. in a solvent comprising an active hydrogen containing compound. However, the process utilizes hazardous solvents such as ethylene diamine, benzene and the like. Further, the process yields no usable products.","Accordingly, what is needed is a cost effective, environmentally friendly and safe method for separating one or more components of gun propellant wastes. It would further be desirable to provide a method wherein the separated components are in a usable\/useful form.","The present invention provides methods for the separation of one or more targeted components from gun propellant formulations. Targeted components discussed in connection with the present methods include any of the core constituents typically found in these formulations such as, for example, nitroguanidine (NQ), nitrocellulose (NC), and nitroglycerine (NG), 3,6-diamino-s-tetrazine, 3,6-bis(3,5-dimethylpyrazol-1-yl)-1,2-dihydro-1,2,4,5-tetrazine, and all other amino-s-tetrazines, hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine, triethylene glycol dinitrate, 1,1,1-trimethylethane trinitrate, bis-(2,2-dinitropropyl acetal\/formal, 2,4-Dinitro-2,4-diazapentane, 2,4-Dinitro-2,4-diazahexane, 3,5-Dinitro-3,5-diazaheptane and mixtures thereof. The gun propellants of the present invention can include any combination of these typical core constituents and the methods can be used to separate one or more of these core constituents. However, it is to be understood that methods of the present invention can also be used to separate other components out of such formulations.","In one embodiment, the methods of the present invention comprise recovering or breaking down one or more targeted components of gun propellant formulations by separating out the components such that the separated components are useful\/usable. In preferred embodiments, nitroguanidine, nitrocellulose, and\/or nitroglycerine are separated from a formulation by using solvent extraction, resin adsorption, and\/or reactive extraction. In particular, the methods comprise utilizing crosslinkers and\/or non-hazardous solvents to separate at least one component from the gun propellant formulation. More particularly, methods of the present invention comprise separating nitrocellulose, nitroguanidine and\/or nitroglycerine from gun propellant formulations by adding crosslinkers and\/or non-hazardous solvents to the gun propellant formulations to yield useful\/usable forms of nitrocellulose, nitroguanidine and\/or nitroglycerine.","In an exemplary embodiment, the gun propellant formulation contains nitrocellulose and, in accordance with the methods of the present invention, nitrocellulose is separated from the formulation to yield a useful\/usable product of nitrocellulose. More particularly, the nitrocellulose is separated out of the formulation by adding a crosslinker to the formulation. The crosslinker can be any known crosslinker and, to effectively separate nitrocellulose from the formulation, is any crosslinker that preferentially reacts with the nitrocellulose. The nitrocellulose is preferably separated as a cross-linked nitrocellulose. In one embodiment, the cross-linker is a multifunctional isocyanate such as diisocyanates, polyisocyanates and mixtures thereof. Preferred multifunctional isocyanates are selected from aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, araliphatic, aromatic and heterocyclic polyisocyanates. Particularly preferred multifunctional isocyanate is selected from, but not limited to hexamethylediisocyanate, tetramethylxylylene diisocyanate, 4-methyl-1,3-phenylene diisocyanate, TDI and its dimers, 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate and its oligomers, 1-isocyanato-3-isocyanatomethyl-3,5,5-trimethyl-cyclohexane, 4,4\u2032-diisocyanato dicyclohexylmethane and its oligomers, 1,5-diisocyanato-2-methylpentane and its oligomers, 1,12-diisocyanatododecane and its oligomers, 1,4-diisocyanatobutane and its oligomers, isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI), 1,4-cyclohexane diisocyanate, 1-methyl-2,4-cyclohexane diisocyanate, 4,4\u2032-, 2,2\u2032- and 2,4\u2032-diphenylmethane diisocyanate, mixtures of 2,4- and 4,4\u2032-diphenylmethane diisocyanate, urethane-modified, liquid 2,4- and\/or 4,4\u2032-diphenylmethane diisocyanates, 4,4\u2032-diisocyanato-1,2-diphenylethane and 1,5-naphthylene diisocyanate, 1-methyl-2,6-cyclohexane diisocyanate and isomer mixtures thereof, 4,4\u2032-, 2,4\u2032- and 2,2\u2032-dicyclohexylmethane diisocyanate and isomer mixtures thereof. A particularly preferred crosslinker for use with the present methods is 1,6-diisocyanatohexane. In some embodiments, the crosslinker is selected so as to yield a specific crosslinked nitrocellulose product.","If desired, the crosslinker may be added in the presence of a catalyst. Preferably, the catalyst is an organic or organometallic catalyst, capable of catalyzing a crosslinking reaction. Such catalysts may be selected from organic metal compounds such as titanic acid esters, iron compounds and tin compounds, which may include, for example, tin diacetate, tin dioctoate and tin dilaurate. The catalyst may also be a dialkyltin salt of aliphatic carboxylic acids such as, for example, dibutyltin diacetate, dibutyltin dilaurate or similar types of catalysts. One particularly preferred catalyst for use in the present methods is dibutyltin dilaurate.","In one exemplary embodiment, the nitrocellulose is separated from a gun propellant formulation by adding a crosslinker to the formulation, allowing the crosslinker to react with the nitrocellulose in the formulation, allowing a viscous gel to form, and drying the viscous gel to yield cross-linked nitrocellulose network. The nitrocellulose is separated from the formulation as a useful\/usable product. In one embodiment, the nitrocellulose is separated as a polyurethane product. The polyurethane product may be in the form of a powder, paste, viscous or elastic solution, or gel. If desired, the nitrocellulose can be separated from the formulation as a precursor for coating compositions.","In an exemplary embodiment, the gun propellant formulation contains nitroguanidine and, in accordance with the methods of the present invention, the nitroguanidine can be separated from the formulation to yield a useful\/usable product. Preferably, the nitroguanidine is separated by using a non-hazardous solvent that selectively precipitates nitroguanidine from the formulation. The solvent is selected from any conventional solvents that will not react with crosslinker(s) used in the method. Preferably, the solvent is an organic solvent. Some examples of suitable solvents include, but are not limited to, ethers, alcohols, ketones, nitriles, nitro compounds, unsubstituted or substituted aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbons, and mixtures thereof. Particularly preferred solvents include acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, ethyl acetate, n-butyl acetate, and cyclohexanone. One particularly preferred solvent is acetone. Other typical solvents that can be used in the present methods are known to the skilled artisan and can be found in handbooks, such as Techniques of Chemistry, vol. II Organic Solvents, 3.sup.rd ed. Arnold Weissberger, Wiley-Interscience 1970. It is noted that particularly suitable solvents are those in which the crosslinked nitrocellulose formed in the process is not totally soluble.","In some embodiments, after the nitroguanidine is separated from the formulation using a non-hazardous solvent, remaining amounts of nitroguanidine remaining in the formulation are further separated. The remaining amounts of nitroguanidine can be separated, for example, by using one or more reactive resins such as aldehyde-functionalized resins. Such aldehyde-functionalized resins preferably have an active aldehyde content of not less than 1 mmol per gram. For example, StratoSpheres\u2122 PL-CHO, StratoSpheres\u2122 PL-ICHO and the like may be used. Preferably, the ratio of resin to nitroguanidine (CHO\/NQ) is greater than or equal to 1.3. Nitroguanidine is preferably separated from the formulation as a pure product suitable for reprocessing by the military.","In some embodiments, the propellant formulation includes both nitrocellulose and nitroguanidine. As such, nitrocellulose and\/or nitroguanidine can be separated from the formulation using the methods generally set forth herein. To separate both nitrocellulose and nitroguanidine, nitroguanidine is preferably separated from the formulation prior to separating the nitrocellulose out of the formulation.","In an exemplary embodiment, the gun propellant formulation contains nitroglycerine and, in accordance with the methods of the present invention, the nitroglycerine can be separated from the formulation to yield a useful\/usable product. Preferably, the nitroguanidine is separated by purifying the nitroguanidine in the formulation. The nitroglycerine is preferably separated by extraction. For example, when the formulation contains both nitrocellulose and nitroguanidine, the nitroguanidine is preferably separated from the crosslinked nitrocellulose using a suitable solvent. Any solvent capable of separating nitroglycerine from the formulation may be used and can include, for example, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, cyclohexanone, dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, tetrahydrofuran and mixtures thereof. The nitroglycerine is preferably separated out of the formulation in a form usable in pharmaceutical compositions or as a composition suitable as blasting industry feedstock. In some embodiments, the nitroglycerine can be separated in a form that can be safely disposed of after hydrolysis.","In some embodiments, the propellant formulation includes nitroguanidine and can further include nitroglycerine and\/or nitrocellulose. As such, nitroglycerine, nitrocellulose and\/or nitroguanidine can be separated from the formulation using the methods set forth herein. In particular, nitroguanidine is preferably separated from the formulation first, followed by the nitrocellulose. Nitroglycerine remaining in the formulation is then purified as set forth herein. In accordance with a preferred method, nitroguanidine, nitroglycerine and nitrocellulose are separated from gun propellant formulations by extracting nitroguanidine from the formulation using a solvent that selectively precipitates nitroguanidine from the formulation, adding a crosslinker to the formulation, allowing the crosslinker to crosslink with the nitrocellulose in the formulation and separating the crosslinked nitrocellulose from the formulation.","In another embodiment, methods of the present invention comprise separating nitroguanidine, nitrocellulose and nitroglycerine from triple-based gun propellant formulations by solubilizing the gun propellant formulation in a solution of recyclable organic solvent, separating the insoluble nitroguanidine to yield a mixture of nitrocellulose and nitroglycerine, reacting the nitrocellulose with a cross-linker to yield an insoluble nitrocellulose product and separating the nitroglycerine from the cross-linked nitrocellulose.","Methods of the present invention are capable of separating one or more targeted component (e.g. nitrocellulose, nitroglycerine, and\/or nitroguanadine) from the formulation in an amount of at least about 50% of the targeted component present in the formulation, more preferably at least about 60%, more preferably at least about 70%, more preferably at least about 75%, more preferably at least about 80%, more preferably at least about 85%, more preferably at least about 90%, more preferably at least about 95%, more preferably at least about 98%, more preferably at least about 99%, and even more preferably essentially all (i.e. at least about 99.9% or 100%) of the targeted component present in the formulation.","Methods of the present invention further comprise the separation of targeted components from gun propellant formulations to yield reusable removed components. In one embodiment, the targeted components are separated by reactive extraction. In some embodiments, the targeted components are selected from energetic compounds. Preferred energetic compounds separated using the methods of the present invention are cyclic nitramines, such as hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX), octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine (HMX), hexahydro-1-nitroso-3,5-dinitro-1,3,5-triazine (MNX) and 2,4,6,8,10,12-hexanitro-2,4,6,8,10,12-hexaazaisowurtzitane (CL-20).","Other aspects and embodiments of the invention are discussed below.","The present invention provides safe, cost-effective, environmentally friendly methods for addressing the continuously mounting stockpile of surplus gun propellant materials. In particular, the present invention provides methods for separating out targeted components from gun propellant formulations in such a way that the separated components are reusable. The methods are further capable of providing high throughput for bulk processing if desired.","Typical components of gun propellant formulations include nitroguanidine, nitrocellulose and\/or nitroglycerine, 3,6-diamino-s-tetrazine, hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine, triethylene glycol dinitrate, 1,1,1-trimethylethane trinitrate, bis-(2,2-dinitropropyl acetal\/formal, 2,4-Dinitro-2,4-diazapentane, 2,4-Dinitro-2,4-diazahexane, and the like. The methods of the present invention are directed towards separating one or more of these components from a gun propellant formulation to yield usable\/useful products. For example, nitroguanidine, nitrocellulose and nitroglycerine can be separated from a propellant formulation in a form suitable for subsequent use as coatings ingredients, nutrient additives for fertilizers, latexes, binders and as pharmaceutical composition ingredients. In some embodiments, nitroguanidine is separated as a pure product suitable for reprocessing by the military. If desired, nitroglycerin can be separated in a form that is safely disposed of after hydrolysis.","In preferred methods of the present invention, the gun propellant formulations contain nitrocellulose, nitroguanidine and\/or nitroglycerine and methods of the invention include the separation of one or more of these components.","The present methods for the separation of nitrocellulose from a formulation comprise the use of one or more crosslinker that preferentially reacts with the nitrocellulose. For best results, the crosslinkers should not react with other components in the formulation so as to prevent the formation of by-products. The crosslinkers are preferably multifunctional isocyanates, which are well-known to one of skill in the art. Such multifunctional isocyanates include, for example, hexamethylediisocyanate, isophorone diisocyanate, tetramethylxylylene diisocyanate, and the like, as shown below:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"110.66mm","wi":"74.76mm","file":"US07604705-20091020-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},"Separation of the nitrocellulose by use of a crosslinker yields a cross-linked nitrocellulose. In particular, reaction of propellant formulations containing nitrocellulose with suitable crosslinkers results in the precipitation of a cross-linked nitrocellulose product. Specific crosslinked nitrocellulose products can be produced by careful selection of the crosslinker utilized. In particular, a variety of crosslinkers, such as commercially available diisocyanates, can be used to form a nitrocellulose product having properties dependent upon the diisocyanate chosen and the ratio of NCO groups to OH groups in the reaction. One of skill in the art can readily determine which type of crosslinker can be used to provide products having the desired properties. Without being bound by any theory, the ratio of NCO groups to OH groups in the reaction described above will typically result in powderous or paste-like materials with well-developed particulates. The ratio of NCO groups to OH groups in the reaction that is below will result in flowable materials easily dispersible in organic solvents such as acetone and the like. Aliphatic isocyanates such as 1,6-diisocyanatohexane, when added at the ratio of NCO groups to OH groups in the reaction that is above result in brittle, small particulates that produce pastes when dispersed in organic solvents.","The nitrocellulose product is preferably a polyurethane product in a form of powders, pastes, viscous or elastic solutions, or gels, as depicted below by a preferred cross-linking reaction of nitrocellulose with diisocyanate. Further, it may be desirable, in some applications, for the product to contain residual curable, reactive groups, such as isocyanate, amine, epoxy, alkyd, ester, acid, and the like.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"75.35mm","wi":"140.63mm","file":"US07604705-20091020-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"In some embodiments, the crosslinker is added in the presence of a catalyst.

According to the present methods, the nitrocellulose is separated from the formulation in a form that is useful\/usable. In one embodiment, the nitrocellulose is removed as a polyurethane product. The polyurethane product may be in the form of a powder, paste, viscous or elastic solution, or gel. If desired, the nitrocellulose can be separated from the formulation as a precursor for coating compositions.","The present methods for the separation of nitroguanidine from a formulation comprise the use of one or more solvents that selectively separate nitroguanidine from the formulation. In addition to separation of the nitroguanidine, the use of a solvent provides a means of wetting the propellant formulation, thereby rendering the formulation safer to work with.","Any solvents capable of selectively separating nitroguanidine from the formulation can be used. Preferably the solvents are non-hazardous and do not react with other components in the formulation. For example, customary organic solvents, such as ethers, alcohols, ketones, nitrites, nitro compounds, unsubstituted or substituted aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbons, and mixtures thereof may be used. Some exemplary solvents useful in the practice of the present invention include, but are not limited to acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, ethyl acetate, n-butyl acetate, and cyclohexanone. However, any conventional solvents known to the skilled artisan can be used. See, for example, Techniques of Chemistry, vol II Organic Solvents, 3rd ed. Arnold Weissberger, Wiley-Interscience 1970. Where the gun propellant formulation includes both nitrocellulose and nitroguanidine, and the nitrocellulose is separated from the formulation using one or more crosslinker, particularly suitable solvents are those in which the crosslinked nitrocellulose is not totally soluble. One particularly preferred solvent is acetone. However, other similar solvents in which the solubility of nitroguanidine is significantly less than that of nitrocellulose may be similarly used. In some embodiments, acetone has been shown to separate nitroguanidine from a gun propellant formulation with greater than 90% efficiency.","The methods of the present invention can further include the selective separation of remaining nitroguanidine in the formulation following separation by solvent. In particular, reactive resins can be used to separate\/adsorb nitroguanidine in solution with organics and\/or organic solvents. The reactive resins are preferably selected from aldehyde-functionalized resins. Particularly preferred aldehyde-functionalized resins have an active aldehyde content of not less than 1 mmol per gram. Some examples of suitable reactive resins include, but are not limited to StratoSpheres\u2122 PL-CHO, StratoSpheres\u2122 PL-ICHO available from Polymer Laboratories Ltd (Amherst Fields Research Park, 160 Old Farm Road, Amherst, Mass. 01002, USA).

Due to this high yield, the resin adsorption stage is optional, and may be included based on desired recovery.","The present methods for the separation of nitroglycerine from a formulation comprises extraction of nitroglycerine using acetone and other solvents capable of nitroglycerine separation. In embodiments wherein the formulation includes nitroglycerine and nitrocellulose, after nitrocellulose is separated out of the formulation, nitroglycerine remaining in the formulation is purified by extraction using acetone and the like. The nitroglycerine is preferably separated out of the formulation in a form usable in pharmaceutical compositions and, thus, the materials used in extraction of the nitroglycerine are selected with this in mind.","Methods of the present invention can be used to separate one or more components from a gun propellant formulation. In one embodiment, methods of the present invention separate nitroguanidine and nitrocellulose from triple-base propellant formulations containing nitroguanidine, nitrocellulose and nitroglycerine. Nitroglycerine can further be separated from the formulations if desired. The methods provide particular benefits in that they provide one or more usable product from a demilitarization process. In particular, nitroguanidine is preferably separated as a pure product, while nitrocellulose is preferably separated as an intermediate or end product having commercial viability (e.g. as an ingredient in coating compositions). The ability to produce commercially-viable products, while reducing the environmental and economic burden of stockpiling obsolete munitions, has significant economic benefits.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"The methods of the present invention will be further illustrated with reference to the following Examples which are intended to aid in the understanding of the present invention, but which are not to be construed as a limitation thereof.","Preliminary analysis of the present methods was carried out using surrogate materials. The use of surrogates permitted a more economical and safe means of assessing each stage of the process, while also presenting a means of assessing the interaction of the reagents with individual propellant constituents. Surrogate studies were performed on pure nitrocellulose and nitroguanidine, and mixtures thereof.","Nitroguanidine was obtained from Acros Chemical as a 75% water-wetted product having a molecular weight of 104 g\/mol. Nitrocellulose was obtained from Aldrich Chemical as a 70% isopropanol-wetted product having a unit molecular weight of approximately 250 g\/mol and having 11.8 to 12.2% nitrogen. This product was replaced in subsequent experiments by a water-wetted version distributed by Filo Chemical for Hagedorn Company, as the presence of hydroxyl groups from the alcohol will interfere with subsequent stages of the process. HPLC acetone was obtained from Aldrich Chemical.","In order to formulate a mixture of nitroguanidine and nitrocellulose, it was desirable to dry both materials. Nitroguanidine was dried through suspension of the water-wetted product in acetone. 800 mg of nitroguanidine in water was suspended in 50 mL of HPLC grade acetone. The suspension was passed through a filter, yielding 575 mg of dry nitroguanidine. Similarly, nitrocellulose was dried through removal of the isopropanol by slurrying 900 mg of the product in glass distilled and deionized water [17.3 mOhm], which yielded 600 mg of dry nitrocellulose.","One potential means of quantifying the recovery of nitroguanidine from a nitroguanidine\/nitrocellulose mixture was the use of UV\/Vis spectroscopy. The efficacy of this technique for the purposes of the current program was dependent upon the presence of chromophores for both nitroguanidine and nitrocellulose. As such, preliminary studies were performed on dilute solutions of these materials to obtain baseline spectra.","Nitroguanidine was prepared at 0.04M in 1M HCl and was in turn diluted 1:100 in 1M HCl, resulting in a final concentration of 0.0004M. UV\/Vis spectral analysis led to \u03bb=264 nm for nitroguanidine in HCl and a \u03b5=\u02dc9000, calculated according to Beers Law [A=\u03b5cb]. Similarly, UV\/Vis spectral analysis was performed on nitroguanidine in 1M NaOH (\u03bb32 252 nm, \u03b5=\u02dc9000) and acetone (\u03bb=328, \u03b5=\u02dc9000). NMR analysis was run to verify the presence of nitroguanidine in acetone, which was substantiated by the presence of a peak at 207.489 corresponding to the single spcarbon in nitroguanidine. The absence of additional carbon peaks indicated the presence of nitroguanidine as the sole material dissolved in acetone.","Nitrocellulose was prepared at 0.04M in acetone. UV\/Vis spectral analysis led to \u03bb=220 nm with \u03b5=20. This low epsilon value presents some difficulty in the determination of the presence of nitrocellulose.","Resin Extraction of Nitroguanidine","Resin extraction was carried out to analyze the process step for the removal of remaining nitroguanidine from the formulation. Nitroguanidine (Lot #A011274701, CAS #556-88-7, nominal water contents, 25%) was obtained from Acros Organics. The nitroguanidine was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (spectrophotometric grade, 99.9%) and the residual water content was measured by Karl-Fischer titration (Mettler-Toledo DL31 Titrator). The water content was traced back to the nitroguanidine concentration and, thus, 25.0% of water content in the original nitroguanidine was determined. Reactive resins StratoSpheres\u2122 PL-CHO (benzaldehyde, nominal loading 3.0 mmol\/g) and StratoSpheres\u2122 PL-ICHO (formyl indole, nominal loading 1.4 mmol\/g) were obtained from Aldrich Chemical Co. (Milwaukee, Wis.) and used as received.","Calibration curves were generated by dissolving NQ in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and measuring electronic absorbance of the resulting solutions using a Hewlett Packard Model 8452A UV-Vis Spectrophotometer and a quartz cell (path length, 1 cm). Resins samples of known weight were dispersed in corresponding nitroguanidine solutions and the resulting suspensions were gently shaken at ambient temperature overnight. The resins were removed from the samples by centrifugation (1000\u00d7g, 5 min) and the supernatant was assayed spectrophotometrically for the content of residual nitroguanidine.","Reactive Extraction of Nitrocellulose","A reactive extraction stage was analyzed as a means of recovering nitrocellulose from triple-base gun propellant formulations as a polyurethane product of commercial interest. A variety of commercially-available diisocyanates were identified and the product of their reaction with nitrocellulose evaluated.","Military grade nitrocellulose (CAS #9004-70-0, nominal nitrogen contents, 12.6%) was obtained from HAGEDORN Aktiengesellschaft (Osnabrick, Germany) in a form of water-containing flakes (nitrocellulose content, 65-75%; the rest is water). The polymer was dissolved in acetone at 20 wt % level and the solution was dried by 3 \u212b molecular sieves (Fluka Chemie GmbH). The residual water content in acetone solution was below 0.2 wt % as measured by Karl-Fischer titration (Mettler-Toledo DL31 Titrator). m-tetramethylxylene diisocyanate (TMXDI, CAS# 002778-42-9) was obtained from Cytec Industries, Inc. (West Paterson, N.J.), while hexamethylenediisocyanate (HMDI, 98%), isophorone diisocyanate (98%), and dibutyltin dilaurate (95%) were all obtained from Aldrich Chemical Co. (Milwaukee, Wis.) and used as received.","Polyurethanes were synthesized by adding an appropriate amount of liquid isocyanate to a 20 wt % dried solution of nitrocellulose in acetone containing 0.2 wt % of dibutyltin dilaurate. The resulting mixture was kept at 60\u00b0 C. with reflux, and 0.5-mL samples were withdrawn intermittently for analysis. Depending on the isocyanate used and the nitrocellulose-isocyanate ratio, some samples rapidly solidified, as set forth in the results below. The reaction analysis and polymer characterization were performed in KBr tablets using a Perkin Elmer 1720 Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrophotometer. The spectra were taken under nitrogen atmosphere in the 400-4000 cmregion. Sixty-four scans were collected with each sample with a resolution of 2 cmand signal-averaged.","FTIR spectrum of the original nitrocellulose sample is shown in  and peak assignments are collected in Table 1. Due to the large amount of water present, OH stretching in the area 3500-3300 cmis not apparent.

It is also noted that the extraction and the slurry is rather thick at the 10% level.","If desired, further refinement of the nitroguanidine product, thereby removing the inorganic salts, is possible through acid rinsing.","The remaining constituents of the M30A1 propellant were further processed for the removal of nitrocellulose. The isolated material from the 1% study was re-dissolved in acetone, resulting in an approximate 5% [w\/v] solution. 100 \u03bcL of 1,6-diisocyanatohexane was added to the solution in the presence of 25 \u03bcL dibutyltin dilaurate. The reaction was permitted to proceed for one hour, after which time a viscous gel had formed. The process yielded (upon drying) 262 mg of cross-linked nitrocellulose gel and 237 mg of residuals, which contained excess isocyanate, uncross-linked nitrocellulose, and nitroglycerine.","Based on the composition specifications for M30A1, it is assumed that 56% of the dried film product (total weight=466 mg) is nitrocellulose (molecular weight \u02dc278 g\/cc). Therefore, a 100% yield would result in 294 mg of cross-linked nitrocellulose (molecular weight \u02dc316 g\/cc).
