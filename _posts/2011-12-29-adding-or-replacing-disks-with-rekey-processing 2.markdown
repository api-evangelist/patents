title: Adding or replacing disks with re-key processing
abstract: In a network of multiple storage devices, a storage device may become faulty and need to be replaced or additional capacity may need to be added through additional storage devices. When the storage devices communicate through a secure communications link using an encryption key for cryptographically splitting data, replacement or new storage devices may be re-keyed using an encryption key from an existing or prior storage device on the secure data network. After the storage device is re-keyed, the new or replacement storage device may continue to function on the secure data network without requiring changes to clients accessing the secure data network.

This acts to restrict access to data available on computers and databases used in such networks. For example, the physical segregation prevents a user in engineering from gaining access to data in the payroll department's network and vice versa. While separate local network infrastructures help to maintain security of data, superfluous equipment and maintenance is required to maintain these segregated networks.

In this embodiment, the user interface device  may be a computer or phone executing a Java application making requests to a JBOSS server executing on a Linux server, which fulfills the requests by accessing a relational database management system (RDMS) on a mainframe server.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0088","num":"0090"},"figref":"FIG. 14","b":["1400","1302","1310","1402","1404","1402","1402","1402","1402"]},"The computer system  also may include random access memory (RAM) , which may be synchronous RAM (SRAM), dynamic RAM (DRAM), and\/or synchronous dynamic RAM (SDRAM). The computer system  may utilize RAM  to store the various data structures used by a software application. The computer system  may also include read only memory (ROM)  which may be PROM, EPROM, EEPROM, optical storage, or the like. The ROM may store configuration information for booting the computer system . The RAM  and the ROM  hold user and system data.","The computer system  may also include an input\/output (I\/O) adapter , a communications adapter , a user interface adapter , and a display adapter . The I\/O adapter  and\/or the user interface adapter  may, in certain embodiments, enable a user to interact with the computer system . In a further embodiment, the display adapter  may display a graphical user interface (GUI) associated with a software or web-based application on a display device , such as a monitor or touch screen.","The I\/O adapter  may couple one or more storage devices , such as one or more of a hard drive, a flash drive, a compact disc (CD) drive, a floppy disk drive, and a tape drive, to the computer system . The communications adapter  may be adapted to couple the computer system  to the network , which may be one or more of a LAN, WAN, and\/or the Internet. The communications adapter  may also be adapted to couple the computer system  to other networks such as a global positioning system (GPS) or a Bluetooth network. The user interface adapter  couples user input devices, such as a keyboard , a pointing device , and\/or a touch screen (not shown) to the computer system . The keyboard  may be an on-screen keyboard displayed on a touch panel. Additional devices (not shown) such as a camera, microphone, video camera, accelerometer, compass, and or a gyroscope may be coupled to the user interface adapter . The display adapter  may be driven by the CPU  to control the display on the display device .","The applications of the present disclosure are not limited to the architecture of computer system . Rather the computer system  is provided as an example of one type of computing device that may be adapted to perform the functions of a server  and\/or the user interface device . For example, any suitable processor-based device may be utilized including, without limitation, personal data assistants (PDAs), tablet computers, smartphones, computer game consoles, and multi-processor servers. Moreover, the systems and methods of the present disclosure may be implemented on application specific integrated circuits (ASIC), very large scale integrated (VLSI) circuits, or other circuitry. In fact, persons of ordinary skill in the art may utilize any number of suitable structures capable of executing logical operations according to the described embodiments.","If implemented in firmware and\/or software, the functions described above may be stored as one or more instructions or code on a computer-readable medium. Examples include non-transitory computer-readable media encoded with a data structure and computer-readable media encoded with a computer program. Computer-readable media includes physical computer storage media. A storage medium may be any available medium that can be accessed by a computer. By way of example, and not limitation, such computer-readable media can comprise RAM, ROM, EEPROM, CD-ROM or other optical disk storage, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium that can be used to store desired program code in the form of instructions or data structures and that can be accessed by a computer; disk and disc, as used herein, includes compact disc (CD), laser disc, optical disc, digital versatile disc (DVD), floppy disk and blu-ray disc where disks usually reproduce data magnetically, while discs reproduce data optically with lasers. Combinations of the above should also be included within the scope of computer-readable media.","In addition to storage on computer readable medium, instructions and\/or data may be provided as signals on transmission media included in a communication apparatus. For example, a communication apparatus may include a transceiver having signals indicative of instructions and data. The instructions and data are configured to cause one or more processors to implement the functions outlined in the claims.","Although the present disclosure and its advantages have been described in detail, it should be understood that various changes, substitutions and alterations can be made herein without departing from the spirit and scope of the disclosure as defined by the appended claims. Moreover, the scope of the present application is not intended to be limited to the particular embodiments of the process, machine, manufacture, composition of matter, means, methods and steps described in the specification. As one of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate from the present invention, disclosure, machines, manufacture, compositions of matter, means, methods, or steps, presently existing or later to be developed that perform substantially the same function or achieve substantially the same result as the corresponding embodiments described herein may be utilized according to the present disclosure.
