{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Nos. 61\/103,714 and 61\/103,718, filed Oct. 8, 2008, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. This application also claims benefit of priority under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119 to French Patent Application Nos. FR 0856597 and FR 0856598, filed Sep. 30, 2008, the contents of which are also incorporated herein by reference.","The present disclosure relates to a ready-to-use cosmetic composition for treating keratin fibers, including human keratin fibers such as the hair, comprising at least one specific organosilicon compound, at least one hydrophobic film-forming polymer, at least one pigment and at least one volatile solvent. The disclosure also relates to a cosmetic process for treating keratin fibers and also to a method for making a composition for dyeing keratin fibers.","The present disclosure similarly relates to the use of a cosmetic composition comprising, in a cosmetically acceptable medium, at least one specific organosilicon compound as described herein, as a pretreatment to a composition comprising at least one hydrophobic film-forming polymer, at least one pigment, and at least one volatile solvent.","Hair is generally damaged and embrittled by the action of external atmospheric agents such as light and bad weather, and mechanical or chemical treatments such as blow-drying, combing, bleaching, permanent-waving, and\/or dyeing. As a result, the hair may be difficult to manage, such as it may be difficult to disentangle or to style, and a head of hair, even a thick head of hair, can have difficulty in maintaining a pleasant-looking style due to the fact that the hair lacks vigour, body, and liveliness.","This degradation of hair is moreover accentuated by repetition of hair permanent dyeing treatments, which consist in applying to the hair at least one dye precursor and an oxidizing agent.","Thus, to overcome this, it is now common practice to apply styling products that condition the hair while also giving it body, mass, or volume.","These styling products are generally cosmetic haircare compositions comprising at least one polymer that has strong affinity for the hair and that usually has the function of forming a film on the surface of the hair in order to modify its surface properties, for example to condition it or to give it particular optical properties.","One drawback associated with the use of these haircare compositions lies in the fact that the cosmetic effects imparted by such compositions have a tendency to disappear, for example from the first shampoo wash.","Moreover, in the field of dyeing keratin fibers, it is already known practice to dye keratin fibers via various techniques using direct dyes for non-permanent colorations or dye precursors for permanent colorations.","Non-permanent dyeing or direct dyeing consists in dyeing keratin fibers with dye compositions comprising direct dyes. These dyes are colored and coloring molecules that have affinity for keratin fibers. They are applied to the keratin fibers for the time required to obtain the desired coloration, and are then rinsed out.","The standard dyes that are used include, for example, dyes of the nitrobenzene, anthraquinone, nitropyridine, azo, xanthene, acridine, azine, or triarylmethane type, or natural dyes.","Some of these dyes may be used under lightening conditions, which enables the production of colorations that are visible on dark hair.","It is also known practice to dye keratin fibers permanently via oxidation dyeing. This dyeing technique consists in applying to the keratin fibers a composition comprising dye precursors such as oxidation bases and couplers. These precursors, under the action of an oxidizing agent, form at least one colored substance in the hair.","The variety of molecules used as oxidation bases and couplers allows a wide range of colors to be obtained, and the colorations resulting therefrom may be strong and resistant to external agents, such as to light, bad weather, washing, perspiration, and rubbing.","In order to be visible on dark hair, these two dyeing techniques may require prior or simultaneous bleaching of the keratin fibers. This bleaching step, performed with an oxidizing agent such as hydrogen peroxide or persalts, can result in appreciable degradation of the keratin fibers, which impairs their cosmetic properties. The hair then has a tendency to become coarse, more difficult to disentangle, and more brittle.","Another dyeing method consists in using pigments. For example, the use of pigment at the surface of the keratin fibers generally makes it possible to obtain visible colorations on dark hair, since the surface pigment may mask the natural color of the fiber. The use of pigment for dyeing keratin fibers is described, for example, in patent application FR 2 741 530, which discloses using for the temporary dyeing of keratin fibers a composition comprising at least one dispersion of film-forming polymer particles comprising at least one acid function and at least one pigment dispersed in the continuous phase of the dispersion.","The colorations obtained via this dyeing method may have the drawback of being removed from the first shampoo wash.","To overcome these drawbacks, it has been proposed to perform coating by applying to the hair a composition comprising a hydrophobic film-forming polymer, such as a polysiloxane\/polyurea block copolymer, in patent application FR 2 907 677. Such a composition may produce well-coated, non-greasy hair. The coatings obtained may show good resistance to shampooing, but may have the drawback of having poor staying power if the hair is sensitized.","There is thus a need to develop cosmetic compositions for treating keratin fibers and for example for dyeing human keratin fibers such as the hair and to use a hair dyeing process that can lead to colored coatings that are at least one of shampoo-fast and resistant to external attacking factors, while at the same time maintaining good cosmetic properties (giving the hair body, mass, or volume), in a long-lasting manner, irrespective of the sensitization of the treated hair.","It has been found that the use of a cosmetic composition for treating keratin fibers, such as human keratin fibers such as the hair, comprising at least one specific organosilicon compound, at least one hydrophobic film-forming polymer, at least one pigment, and at least one volatile solvent can lead to a colored coating that is at least one of shampoo-fast and resistant to external attacking factors, while at the same time maintaining good cosmetic properties, irrespective of the sensitization of the treated hair.","In addition, it has been found that it is possible to use on keratin fibers cosmetic compositions comprising at least one specific organosilicon compound as defined herein as a pretreatment to a cosmetic composition comprising at least one hydrophobic film-forming polymer, at least one pigment, and at least one volatile solvent in order also to obtain a colored hair coating that shows satisfactory fastness with respect to external attacking factors, such as blow-drying, friction, or perspiration.","The coatings thus obtained generally are in the form of a smooth, uniform deposit that shows excellent adhesion to the hair.","Moreover, it has been found that the hairs can remain individualized.","The term \u201cindividualized hairs\u201d means hairs which, after application of the composition and drying, are not stuck together (e.g., are separate from each other) and therefore do not form clumps of hair, since the coating is formed around virtually every hair.","Furthermore, it has been found that the application to keratin fibers of a cosmetic composition comprising at least one suitably selected organosilicon compound as a pretreatment to a cosmetic composition comprising at least one hydrophobic film-forming polymer, at least one pigment and at least one volatile solvent can improve the affinity between the keratin fibers and the hydrophobic film-forming polymer\/pigment complex, irrespective of the sensitization of the hair.","It has also been observed that the application to keratin fibers of a cosmetic composition comprising at least one suitably selected organosilicon compound as defined herein as a pretreatment to a composition comprising at least one hydrophobic film-forming polymer, at least one pigment and at least one volatile solvent can make it possible to give the hair mass and body that are long-lasting, for example with respect to shampooing.","Moreover, without being bound by theory, when the pretreatment composition comprises water or when it is applied in the presence of water, for example to wet hair, the at least one organosilicon compound can become hydrolysed and then condensed to form a hybrid prepolymer that promotes the adhesion of the at least one organosilane compound to the hair.","It has also been observed that the shampoo-fastness of the coloration is improved compared with that obtained with cosmetic compositions based on hydrophobic film-forming polymers and volatile solvent used alone.","The present disclosure thus relates to a ready-to-use cosmetic composition for treating keratin fibers, for example human keratin fibers such as the hair, comprising:\n\n","The present disclosure also relates to a process for treating keratin fibers, comprising applying, to the keratin fibers, a cosmetic composition comprising\n\n","Similarly, the present disclosure relates to the use of the composition according to the disclosure for dyeing keratin fibers, for example human keratin fibers such as the hair.","The present disclosure also relates to a method for making a composition for dyeing keratin fibers comprising combining, in a cosmetically acceptable medium:\n\n","Moreover, the present disclosure relates to the use of a cosmetic composition comprising, in a cosmetically acceptable medium, at least one organosilicon compound chosen from silanes comprising one, two or three silicon atoms, the at least one organosilicon compound also comprising at least one basic chemical function and at least one group chosen from hydroxyl and hydrolysable groups per molecule, as a pretreatment to be followed by a cosmetic composition comprising at least one hydrophobic film-forming polymer, at least one pigment and at least one volatile solvent.","Thus, the cosmetic composition comprising the at least one suitably selected organosilicon compound as described herein is used for the pretreatment of the keratin fibers before the application of the cosmetic composition comprising the at least one hydrophobic film-forming polymer, the at least one pigment and the at least one volatile solvent.","The present disclosure thus relates to a process for treating keratin fibers, comprising\n\n","Other

The at least one basic chemical function of the at least one organosilicon compound according to the disclosure may optionally comprise other functions, for instance another amine function, an acid function, or a halogen function.","The at least one organosilicon compound used according to the disclosure also comprises at least one group chosen from hydrolysable and hydroxyl groups per molecule. The hydrolysable groups can be, for example alkoxy, aryloxy, or halogen groups.
