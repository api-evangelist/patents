The present invention uses a VoIP gateway  having FXO port for being connected with FXS port of the Private Branch Exchange .","The present invention is limited in the function for dialing from internet extension to conventional extension.","The VoIP gateway  has to set up parameters at the beginning as below:\n\n","When the Internet extension  dials the conventional extension , for message part (SIP and SS7 messages): the Internet extension  sends the Internet telephone messages for passing through the SIP proxy server  to the Internet port of the VoIP gateway , and then the VoIP gateway  analyzes the dialing number for passing through the telephone port to the Private Branch Exchange  and then to the conventional extension ; on the contrary, the conventional extension  returns with the conventional telephone message for passing through the telephone port, and then being converted into a corresponding Internet telephone message for sending to the Internet extension . For voice part: the voice packets received from the Internet port by the VoIP gateway  will be converted into voice signals for sending out through the telephone port; on the contrary, the voice signals received from the telephone port will be converted into voice packets for sending out through the Internet port.","Referring to , which is the functional flow chart between the SIP proxy server  and the VoIP gateway  with FXO interface. When the SIP proxy server  receives INVITE message issued from the Internet extension  (step ); the dialing number is analyzed to see if it belongs to a conventional extension (step ); if the dialing number does not belong to a conventional extension, then it is analyzed to see if it belongs to an Internet extension (step ), if yes, then the SIP proxy server  issues the INVITE message to the Internet extension (step ), and finishes ringing, offhook, communication, onhook procedures (step ), and then ends up the communication (step ); if the dialing number is not a number of an Internet extension, then the SIP proxy server  responds that there is no such extension (step ), and ends up the communication (step ).","If the dialing number is a conventional extension number, then the SIP proxy server  will issue INVITE message to the VoIP gateway  (step ). When the VoIP gateway  receives the message from the Internet port, an OFFHOOK message will be issued through the telephone port, and then the dialing number will be converted into DTMF signals for sending out through the telephone port (step ), thereafter finish ringing, offhook, communication, onhook procedures (step ), and then end up the communication (step ).","Description of the IP Auto Attendants","The VoIP gateway  can be replaced by an IP auto attendants. IP auto attendants is a computer-telephone integration system (CTI) comprised of a computer, an network interface controller and a telephone voice card (EVS (Electronic Voice Services) Dialogic D\/4PCI-UFW). The telephone voice card is an interface card used for processing the voice on the telephone, having functions of OFFHOOK, ONHOOK, DTMF, Busy Tone, Disconnected Tone, Flash, etc. The IP auto attendants connects to the Internet through the network interface controller for sending or receiving Internet packets, including SIP messages and RTP voice packets of VoIP. The IP auto attendants connects to the conventional telephone network (PSTN) through the telephone voice card for detecting or issuing SS7 (Signaling System No. 7) messages and voice signals. An application program can be designed for the IP auto attendants to control the API (Application Programming Interface) of the network interface controller and the telephone voice card so as to achieve integration function for the Internet and telephone.","As to the function design thereof, as shown in , the IP auto attendants has to have an network interface controller  and a telephone voice card , and an application program  is designed for controlling the network interface controller  and the telephone voice card . The message between Internet and telephone used in the present invention is SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) , the voice transmission used in the present invention is RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol) . The Internet packets are transmitted and received through an operating system  by the network interface controller ; the telephone module  uses the API provided by the telephone voice card  through the operating system  to control messages and voice of the telephone voice card ","The IP auto attendants has the function to process Internet telephone and conventional telephone, so it can provide four aspects for communication: 1. dialing between the Internet extensions, 2. dialing between the conventional telephones, 3. dialing from Internet extension to conventional extension, 4. dialing from conventional extension to Internet extension.","The present invention only adopts the third aspect of dialing from Internet extension to conventional extension. When an Internet extension  dials a conventional extension , for message part: IP auto attendants receives Internet telephone messages sent from the Internet extension  through the SIP proxy server  by the network interface controller , analyzes the dialing number from the Internet packets, and then sends message by the telephone voice card  to the Private Branch Exchange ; on the contrary, when the telephone voice card  receives conventional telephone messages returned from the conventional extension , the conventional telephone messages will be converted into corresponding Internet telephone messages and sent to the Internet extension  by the network interface controller . For voice part: voice packets received from the network interface controller  by IP auto attendants will be converted into voice signals for transmission through the telephone voice card , while the voice signals received from the telephone voice card  will be converted into voice packets for transmission through the network interface controller .","Dialing from Internet Extension of Other SIP Proxy Server to Conventional Extension","Referring to , it is a system diagram for dialing from Internet extension  of other SIP proxy server  to conventional extension . The telephone number of the SIP proxy server  is 0227710888. A user picks up telephone at the Internet extension  for dialing the conventional extension  of the SIP proxy server  (with telephone number 0227712171).  and  show the flow charts thereof.","The user picks up telephone at the Internet extension  and dials 0227712171-30, it means that the user wants to dial the conventional extension  under the SIP proxy server  with telephone number 0227712171), so the Internet extension  issues INVITE message to the SIP proxy server . The SIP proxy server  knows that the dialing belongs to the SIP proxy server , so transmits the message packet to an upper SIP proxy server  of Taipei Education Bureau, and changes the parameter of \u201cFrom\u201d in the INVITE packet from \u201c20\u201d to \u201c0227710888-20\u201d, it means that the call is from the Internet extension  under the switchboard telephone number 0227710888. SIP proxy server  determines a route by the telephone number and sends the packet to the SIP proxy server . After the SIP proxy server  receives the packet, it determines that the dialing is to the conventional extension , and changes the dialing number from \u201c0227712171-30\u201d to \u201c30\u201d, and transmits to the VoIP gateway . Thereafter the flow chart is the same as that of dialing from Internet extension to conventional extension, the only difference is that the SIP proxy server  has to process the number 022771271 in receiving or transmitting packet. When the SIP proxy server  receives packet from the SIP proxy server , the \u201c0227712171-\u201d part of the dialing number has to be deleted and then sent to the VoIP gateway ; when the SIP proxy server  receives packet from the VoIP gateway , the \u201c0227712171-\u201d has to be added into the dialing number.","The scope of the present invention depends upon the following claims, and is not limited by the above embodiments."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 9","FIG. 7"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
