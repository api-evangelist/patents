{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application claims priority to U.S. provisional patent application Ser. 60\/493,061, entitled \u201cSystem And Method For Transmitting Real-Time Business Analytical Data And Information From A Business Entity To Remote Users On A Secure Basis,\u201d (Hall et al.) and filed Aug. 6, 2003, the subject matter of which is incorporated by reference herein and assigned to the assignee of the present application.","This application is related to co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/913,078 entitled \u201cSystem and Wireless Device for Providing in Real-Time, Contextually-Based, Business Operational Data and Business Intelligence Information\u201d (Hall et al.), filed concomitantly herewith, the subject mat of which is also incorporated by reference herein and assigned to the assignee of the present application.","The present invention relates to business analytics and business intelligence services. More specifically, the present invention relates to a system and method for providing in real time, contextually-based, business operational data and other business intelligence information from a business entity to remote users of wireless devices.","Historically, due to the uncertainty of certain industry-level business conditions, business entities have largely managed for short-term competitiveness. Competitive changes that have been instituted, such as cost-reduction and technology enhancements, have mostly resulted in incremental changes to the business entity rather than transformational changes.","In the last several years, in order to effect a long-term strategic and competitive vision, industry analysts have been advocating that business entities move towards the concept of a \u201creal-time enterprise.\u201d Although given slightly varying definitions throughout industry, a real-time enterprise may be defined as an organization that leverages technology in order to reduce the time between when data is recorded in a system and when it is available for information processing. Essentially, a real-time enterprise strives to reduce the time taken for critical business processes by providing the relevant information to its decision-makers as soon as possible. Reducing the time that it takes for up-to-date critical business information to reach the decision-maker dramatically increases the effectiveness of the decision that he or she makes.","The importance of becoming a real-time enterprise may be applied across all industries. For example, in the banking industry, banks are liable for heavy fines and penalties if found not to be in compliance with laws requiring minimum cash ratios. In order to evaluate and preclude non-compliance, the current state of financials and critical ratios should be available throughout the day for immediate notification and mediation of problems before they exceed regulatory tolerances. Similarly, in the airline industry, critical performance metrics such as airline operations, sales and marketing, and corporate financials must be assessed continuously. Critical operations that require immediate, actionable information might include response to flight incidents, mechanical failures and repair times, and route\/reroute management required for bad weather and\/or similar unexpected events. Likewise, in the health insurance industry, a major health event can result in a significant claim to the insurance provider. Immediate information about the associated cost and future impact of cash flow is an important part of the provider's risk management program.","While the benefits of becoming a real-time enterprise are readily understood, the demands on a business to move towards this real-time enterprise concept are tremendous. The forces of short-term competitiveness as well as the requirements under recent legislation such as the Sarbanes-Oxley legislation in the United States, which requires, inter alia, real-time reporting of events that affect a public company's financial situation as well as operational \u2018transparency,\u2019 and the similar Basel II law in Europe, Australia and Canada, are pushing both business and technology to maintain pace and adapt to exponential rates of change. Furthermore, the complexities of aligning the various functions, processes, and business units of a business entity, as well as the associated costs and business cultural, or institutionalized, thinking within the entity, may appear insurmountable. For example, referring back to the banking industry example, while having up-to-date information on the status of the minimum cash ratio balance for financial institution is crucial, the information is extremely dynamic and fluctuates daily in response to customer activities such as promotions and loan approvals, as well as in response to market swings and interest rate changes. In the health insurance industry example, claims for major health incidents consist of numerous and multiple filings by all of the various care providers (doctors, hospitals, anesthesia etc). These claims are received at different times over what can be an extended period of time, which militates against a real-time decision.","Another major obstacle to the real-time enterprise\u2014and perhaps the largest obstacle\u2014is the business entity's level of information technology readiness and the problem of the integration of all of the disparate data and information sources across all levels and functions of the enterprise.","Although solutions exist that endeavor to overcome these aforementioned obstacles, the combined dynamics of these changing business requirements and rapidly evolving technologies cause most solutions and applications to become obsolete soon after their implementation (and, in some instances, prior to their implementation).","In addition, while prior solutions recognize the need to provide to the executives, managers, and other decision-makers critical business metrics or key performance indicators (KPI) on a timely basis, such metrics by themselves do not necessarily provide to the decision-maker the proper viewpoint from which to evaluate the particular situation and make the most informed and effective decision.","Thus, there is a need to improve the timing and enhance the effectiveness of critical decision-making in a business enterprise.","There is also a need for providing real-time notification of critical operational data and business statistics affecting corporate performance to executives, managers and the mobile workforce of the business enterprise.","A further need exists for providing real-time alert notification of changes in critical operational data and business statistics affecting corporate performance to executives, managers and the mobile workforce of the business enterprise.","There is an additional need for a solution that is capable of providing business operational data and performance management, business intelligence information, and other focused operational activity measures that may be used to determine overall business efficiency in a dynamic, real-time, mobile environment in order that a decision-maker can effectively evaluate and then act on this information in a timely manner.","There is a further need to provide this critical business information in the context of important historical, analytical, competitive analytics, trends, and performance objectives, the critical business information being selected by the business entity so that the action that the decision-maker makes is more informed and timely, and thus more effective.","An added need exists to provide this contextually-based real-time business operational data and business intelligence information over a platform-independent, services-oriented architecture (SOA) that will allow applications executing within the solution environment to be changed, modified, upgraded, enhanced or deleted without requiring change or replacement of the underlying solution infrastructure.","Finally, there is a need to provide this contextually-based real-time business operational data and business intelligence information over a platform-independent, services-oriented architecture (SOA) that will allow for the ready interchange of legacy software and applications within solution infrastructure.","In accordance with a first aspect of an embodiment of the invention, a system for providing in response to changes within current operational data of a business enterprise, alert information including an alert over a communications network to a wireless device, wherein the system has an architecture comprising: an enterprise application integration services component for accessing the cut operational data and other business intelligence information of the business enterprise stored in at least one data source and for condition the current operational data and other business intelligence inflation for an analytics services component;

and, a delivery services component for recoding the formatted current operational data, alert and alert information, and the first and second sets of critical business information in accordance with the data delivery protocol requirements of the wireless device, wherein the alert and alert information will be displayed in the context of the current operational data and first and second sets of critical business information.","In accordance with another aspect of an embodiment of the invention, the conditioned operational data and at least a first set of the other business intelligence information have a defined relationship, and wherein the analytics services component further comprises an analytics engine, including a multi-dimensional database, the analytics engine allowing for the modification of the conditioned operational data without affecting the defined relationship between the conditioned operational data and the at least a first set of other business intelligence information; and, a mobile integration engine application, including a custom data abstraction layer for accessing the multi-dimensional database of the analytics engine services component and converting the data elements and relational rules of the multi-dimensional database into a markup language customized for the wireless device.","In yet another aspect of an embodiment of the present invention, the mobile integration engine application further comprises: an orthogonal drill logic and database access component for reading and translating \u201cdrill-down\u201d and \u201cdrill-across\u201d rules of the multi-dimensional database and for identifying and authenticating the critical business information, including at least one critical business metric extracted from the analytics services component; a web application component for creating custom markup language code for the read and translated \u201cdrill-down\u201d and \u201cdrill-across\u201d rules of the multi-dimensional database, and for monitoring the orthogonal drill logic and database access component for changes within the current operational data, and communicating the alert and alert information to the delivery services component if a change is detected; and, an administration application component for providing a secure interface between the analytics engine services component and personalization and authentication application services included in the enterprise data source and for controlling access to the current operational data and first and second sets of critical business information.","In still another aspect of an embodiment of the present invention, a web-enabled wireless device is provided comprising a receiver adapted to receive from the business enterprise over a communications network, current operational data of the business enterprise, and alert and alert information in response to changes in the current operational data, and further adapted to receive business intelligence information from the business enterprise, wherein the current operational data includes the current state of at least one critical business metric of the business enterprise, and wherein the business intelligence information includes the at least one critical business metric and additional data that provides a business context for the current operational data and the at least one critical business metric; and, a mobile browser adapted to configure for display on a display of the wireless device, the received alert and alert information and current operational data in the context of the at least one critical business metric and other business intelligence information.","In a further aspect of an embodiment of the present invention, the web-enabled wireless device is adapted to configure for display on a display of the wireless device, the received operational data and other business intelligence information for the at least one critical business metric in at least one of a plurality of pages. In addition, at least one of the plurality of pages may include at least one user-actionable link to at least a second page, wherein the second page includes received operational data and other business intelligence information that is contextually-related to the at least one critical business metric. Further, at least one of the plurality of pages includes at least one user-actionable link to allow a user of the web-enabled wireless device to initiate communications over the wireless communications network to a predetermined contact.","Still other features and advantages of the present invention will become readily apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description, wherein there is shown and described only the preferred embodiment of the invention, simply by way of illustration of the best mode contemplated for carrying out the invention. As will be realized, the invention is capable of other and different embodiments, and its several details are capable of modifications in various obvious respects, all without departing from the invention. Accordingly, the drawings and description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature, and not as restrictive, and what is intended to be protected by Letters Patent is set forth in the appended claims. The present invention will become apparent when taken in conjunction with the following description and attached drawings, wherein like characters indicate like parts, and which drawings form a part of this application.","Preferred features of selected embodiments of this invention will now be described with reference to the figures. It will be appreciated that the spirit and scope of the invention is not limited to the embodiments selected for illustration. Also, it should be noted that the drawings are not rendered to any particular scale or proportion. Finally, it is contemplated that any of the configurations and materials described hereafter can be modified within the scope of this invention.","I. System Architecture",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"10","sup":"SM"},"The framework of the solution of the present invention is designed around an n-, or multi-tier, client\/server architecture where each of the tiers, or abstraction layers, is independent. As understood by those skilled in the art, an n-tier architecture is essentially an extension of a 3-tier client\/server architecture\u2014the three tiers generally agreed to comprise presentation, business logic or application (\u201cbusiness rules\u201d), and data storage and data access. The tiers are generally developed and maintained as independent modules or components, and often on separate platforms. In one typical environment, the presentation layer implements the \u201clook and feel\u201d of an application. It is responsible for the presentation of data, receiving user events and controlling the user interface, such as a graphical user interface (GUI). The application layer may consist of one or more separate modules running on an application server or workstation server and serves to implement the business logic of the applications. The application component is often powered by a Java Application Server (e.g., WebLogic or WebSphere). Finally, the data storage and access layer is contained on a relational database management system (RDBMS), database server, and\/or mainframe computer, and manages the persistence of application information. It is usually powered by a relational database server (e.g., Oracles\u00ae RDBMS or Microsoft's SQL Server). In the case of an n-tier architecture, the middle tier (i.e., the application layer) is multi-tiered itself. The client in the 3-tier or n-tier client\/server architecture is sometimes referred to as \u201cthin\u201d client, because the bulk of processing occurs on the server side and thus the components in the presentation layer require much less code.","One of the intended purposes, and main benefits, of n-tier architecture is that it allows for any of the tiers to be modified, upgraded, or replaced independently\u2014that is, without affecting the other tiers\u2014as business requirements and technology changes. Thus, for example, as a component in the business layer can be accessed by any number of components in the presentation layer, any changes to business logic can be made in one place and be automatically inherited by all other components without having to duplicate the change in those other components.","As seen in , in one embodiment of the present invention, the solution comprises four independent tiers and an optional fifth tier. However, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the designation of the number of tiers is relatively arbitrary and that the architecture of the solution of the present invention may have any number of tiers as long as it is consistent with the principles of an n-tier architecture as discussed above. That is each tier is fully encapsulated, and therefore there are no dependencies between any of the layers. In addition, each of these layers may be implemented in J2EE (Microsoft) or Net (e.g., UNIX\/Linux, etc.) architectures depending upon the preferred architecture of the business enterprise.","A. Operating Systems Layer ","The bottom tier, or operating systems layer , is actually not part of the solution of the present invention but rather represents an enterprise's operational systems with which the solution operates, such as CRM and financial back office systems, and including web servers, custom\/legacy applications and the numerous diverse data source and stores spread throughout the enterprise. The diverse data sources may include multiple databases managed by a relational database management system (RDBMS). It is included here merely for clarity of understanding of the invention.","B. Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) Services Layer ","The next tier, the enterprise application integration (EAI) services layer , is a layer that provides the connectivity between the aforementioned back-end data systems of operation systems layer  and the analytics engine  of the third tier, the analytics layer  (discussed in more detail below). EAI services layer  links all of the enterprise's applications, links all of enterprise's databases, and channels the enterprise data, which is typically stored in a variety of data sources throughout the enterprise, into a specific database for analysis. Most importantly, EAI services layer  \u201cties\u201d all these aspects together so that they appear as one virtual, unified application.","Thus, EAI services layer  pulls together the appropriate information sources for operational, analytical and historical data necessary for the creation of critical business metrics, or key performance indicators (KPI) by the analytics engine . (As known to those skilled in the art, a Key Performance Indicator, or KPI, is a critical, unambiguous and quantifiable measurement of the performance of an enterprise, group, service, or subset thereof, and which is critical to the success of the enterprise).","Using business rules, data transformation rules, and object technologies, the EAI services layer  can be adapted to integrate new sources of information as the business adds\/changes\/removes various systems. This functionality is especially valuable to leverage information across systems (e.g., sales force automation software (SFA), financials & marketing, etc.), departments and across companies (partnerships, business-to-business operations (B2B), and acquisitions). In a preferred embodiment of the present solution EAI service layer  provides services through industry standard software and protocols, and in one embodiment of the present invention, EAI services layer  provides its services through the Turbo Integrator module of Applix's TM1 analytics server software product, commercially available from Applix, Inc., 289 Turnpike Road, Westborough, Mass. 01581. However, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that other solutions providing similar connectivity may be used instead; for example, EAI solutions products available from TIBCO Software, and SeeBeyond Technology Corporation. Other alternatives are available as will be understood by one skilled in the art.","The EAI services layer  includes a common application programming interface (API) to allow the MIE application services  of the solution of the present invention (discussed in more detail in the following paragraphs) to subscribe to any implementation thereof. EAI services layer  further includes a robust, rules-driven integration engine (not shown), which can also be integrated with or substituted by a number of commonly available EAI engines such as available in IBM Corporation's WebSphere and BEA's System Inc.'s WebLogic software solutions.","C. Analytics Services Layer ","In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the third tier, or analytics services layer , comprises two sub-tiers: analytics engine services layer  and mobile integration engine (MIE) application services .","As set forth above, the present solution provides the delivery of real-time operational data and information that is used to age daily business operations (consistent with the define workflow and processes of the business enterprise) to decision makers regardless of their location, and does this in a contextually-based environment. That is, the current operational data and state statistics of this data is compared and presented against history, trends, competitive analytics and\/or objectives that are relevant to an aspect of the business enterprise i.e., some function, service or operation thereof. It was discovered that by ensuring that decision makers have the most current state of the business enterprise combined with traditional decision support analytics\u2014including representations of the indications on the strength of that status and on its transitional state as the business enterprise moved against performance plans, competition and market fluctuations\u2014more accurate and timely decisions would be possible. This could be seen, for example, when sales executives could easily track the current status of team and client performance versus specified target numbers, marketing executives could track product launch information compared against targeted expectations to identify campaign effectiveness, and customer service and operations managers could monitor trends in call volume and cross-channel utilization to more effectively manage resources. It will be understood for purposes of the present invention that \u201craal-time\u201d is defined to mean that output is generated nearly simultaneously with the corresponding inputs.","The analytics engine services layer  and mobile integration engine application services  of the solution of the present invention are core to providing this feature.","1. Analytics Engine Services Layer ","Analytics engine services layer  may be viewed as a multi-dimensional data mart, in that this services layer both extracts essential information from the numerous and diverse data sources and stores spread throughout the enterprise based on integrated data rules definitions, and further acts as a single, consolidated point for gathering and manipulating data from these different sources and stores. Analytics engine services layer  is a \u201cdata cube\u201d\u2014i.e., a collection of one or more tables of data, assembled in a fashion that allows for dynamic analysis through indexing to be conducted on the joins, intersections, and overall integration of these predefined tables. By way of background, and as known to those skilled in the art, a \u201cdata cube\u201d or \u201ccube\u201d is a highly indexed data construction comprising a logical organization of multidimensional data, where the side represents a business dimension, edges of the cube contain dimension members, and the body of the cube contains measure values related to the dimension and dimension members. The indexing technique used to navigate the \u201ccube\u201d creates a series of logical \u201chierarchies,\u201d and the process of navigating up and down through the levels in a hierarchy from one item to a set of related items is referred to as \u201cdrilling.\u201d As further understood by those skilled in the art, \u201cdrill down\u201d generally refers to an analytical technique that queries data from a summary row and navigates through a hierarchy of data to reach the detail-level rows; \u201cdrill up\u201d refers to an analytical technique that navigates from detail to header rows of data used to view summarized or aggregated data; and, \u201cdrill across\u201d generally refers to an analytical technique that queries data from two or more fact tables in a single report.","Analytics engine services layer  includes a dynamic, multi-dimensional database that supports analytics, traditional drill-paths, and enhanced functionality to enable information updates and changes without rebuilding the database environment. This functionality enables operational data to be continuously updated while preserving the relationship between current data updates and historical trends and analytics. In one embodiment of the present invention, analytics engine services layer  provides its functionality through the Integra module of Applix's TM1 analytics server software product. However, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that similar solutions may be substituted. This may be important, for example, if an enterprise desires to preserve the value of its prior investments. Alternatives that may be used include, but are not limited to, similar applications from Oracle\u00ae, Cognos Inc., Business Objects SA, Hyperion Solutions Corporation and MicroStrategies. Other alternatives are available as will be understood by one skilled in the art.","2. Mobile Integration Engine (MIE) Application Services ","Based on the concepts of rules-driven, object-oriented middleware applications, mobile integration engine (MIE) application services  is an adaptable middleware component built to access the data and information stored in an enterprise's multi-dimensional databases via the analytics engine services layer , and then transform it into a variety of industry standard data formats common in message-oriented, web-enabled environments so that the data can be delivered to the end mobile device by the delivery services layer  (discussed in more detail in the forthcoming paragraphs). Although a layer within the solution of the present invention, it may also function as a standalone (i.e., not connected with delivery services layer ), web-based, application, enabling the delivery of data from multi-dimensional databases and analytics engine services layer  to browser-based presentation applications.","The MIE business rules of the MIE application services  access the database(s) via a standard API abstracting (i.e., wrappering\/translating the custom data interfaces of any multi-dimensional data store in order to provide the novel orthogonal drill behavior of the solution of the present invention (described in more detail below). This then manages how the drill path is navigated, which drill path is selected, current operational state information, and the eventual production of the markup language text (e.g., HTML or XML) describing both the data elements as well as relational rules (how these elements relate to be properly presented). As the functionality provided by the MIE application services  includes aspects of portal and personalization and is well suited for the limited screen real estate common to mobile device application, it is also a viable solution for interfacing to more traditional PC-based browsers.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["44","50","52","54"]},"a. Orthogonal Drill Logic and Database Access Component ","The orthogonal drill logic and database access component  is a middleware component that provides an innovative orthogonal drill mechanism optimized for mobile applications. As used herein, \u201corthogonality\u201d refers to the ability to read and translate the informational \u2018drill-down\u2019 and \u2018drill-across\u2019 rules as defined within a multi-dimensional database. Details of the orthogonal drill mechanism are set forth in the following paragraphs.","In prior systems, navigation of multi-dimensional databases has been geared towards analysis\u2014that is, the emphasis has been on giving the database application's user as much information as possible either through a nested spreadsheet (e.g., Applix's TM1 analytics server software product) or through a cross-tabbed matrix (e.g., Analytic Modules commercially available from MicroStrategy, Inc.). According to one embodiment of the preferred solution of the present invention, the orthogonal drilling mechanism \u201cunwinds\u201d the nested dimensions and provides to the database application those dimensions that are based upon the possible choices related to a particular cell (vertex of all specific dimensional information for a single given metric) of information, rather than all information related to all dimensions at a particular level (analysis view). Orthogonal drilling is only available when a drilling dimension has other metrics associated with it.","In one embodiment of the preferred solution of the present invention, the metadata describing the cube structure must be entered via a personalization and authentication application services  when creating a critical business metric definition. When a user drills down through a dimension hierarchy, the Controller Component of web application component  (discussed in more detail below) checks the personalization and authentication application services  to see if there is any other metric associated with the current dimension. If there is, then the Controller Component applies the associated metadata to construct an HTML link on the display of the wireless device  allowing the user of the wireless device  to link to that metric for that dimension level. Application of this novel feature will be discussed further with reference to .","Thus, the orthogonal drill logic and database access component  provides the functionality for drilling down into an enterprise data source from the root of the primary critical business datum or KPI through an associated acyclic child structure and further provides for orthogonal drilling of an arbitrary number of dimensions while maintaining a persistent record of the vertex of the current drill path, even if multiple dimensions are crossed. Finally, orthogonal drill logic and database access component  provides the functionality of allowing for the walking backwards along a current drill path.","In addition to the innovative orthogonal drill mechanism described above, orthogonal drill logic and database access component  provides a secure interface for identifying and authenticating the critical business data and KPI from the analytics engine services layer  to the MIE application services , and interfaces to that layer  through at least one of several sub-components (discussed in more detail below). In addition, component  provides secure identification of each individual KPI that is communicated from the analytics engine services layer , querying personalization and authentication application services  to determine whether the user of wireless device  is within a defined group or profile of users who have authority to access that critical business metric. (The operation of querying personalization and authentication application services  is described in more detail below).","Furthermore, the orthogonal drill logic and database access component  provides the functionality for drilling down into an enterprise data source from the root of the primary critical business datum or KPI through an associated acyclic child structure and further provides for orthogonal drilling of an arbitrary number of dimensions while maintaining a persistent record of the vertex of the current drill path, even if multiple dimensions are crossed. Finally, orthogonal drill logic and database access component  provides the functionality of allowing for the walking backwards along a current drill path.","In one embodiment of the solution of the present invention, the orthogonal drill logic and database access component  is implemented using Java Factory and Data Access Object design patterns to create a simple, abstracted API, and comprises the following three sub-components, the selection of which, it will be understood those skilled in the art, is dependent upon the API presented to it by the analytics engine layer , for example: a Java-Call Interface component for interacting with multi-dimensional data structures; a Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) component for allowing Java programs to interact with any SQL-compliant database, and a Java Message Service (JMS) Interface component for supporting enterprise messaging systems such as those based on ARM-based processors.","b. Web Application Component ","The web application component  provides various functionalities in the solution of the present invention. First, once the orthogonal drill logic and database access component  reads and translates the informational \u2018drill-down\u2019 and \u2018drill-across\u2019 rules, web application component  creates custom HTML or XML code defined for the particular mobile device's application, describing the metrics at each level of each group of indicators for every vertex in multi-dimensional drill path. Web application component  \u201cstops\u201d or \u201chalts\u201d the orthogonal drill at the vertex for metric consolidation while the drill continues along a new dimensional path. Finally, it prevents confusion by disallowing recurrent multi-dimensional cycles within a single path.","Web application component  also monitors event changes within the operational data and critical business and KPI data that is received from the orthogonal drill mechanism component and database access component , and then acts accordingly, pushing dynamic alerts and messaging based on these event changes. That is, if there is an event change in orthogonal drill mechanism component and database access component , web application component  will \u201cpush\u201d an custom HTML or XML coded alert to the delivery services layer  via an HTTP Post. A markup may be also be pushed via an HTTP Post to delivery services layer  even where the wireless device  has not requested it. The pushed data will be stored preferably in the wireless device  cache (not shown), where it may be viewed at any time. This is particularly useful where the user of the wireless device  is not, or cannot, connect to the wireless network . In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, web application component  supports Web Services for Remote Portlets (WSRP) portal server integration.","Web application component  is preferably compliant with the Model-View-Controller (MVC) paradigm (see also, ). Thus, the components act in accordance with its generally known principles. More specifically, the \u201cModel Component\u201d (e.g., Business Tier Module ) includes the business process logic, business data entities, business rules that govern access to and updates of data, and defines the interfaces for business data entities. It responds to state queries from the \u201cView Component\u201d (discussed below) and notifies the \u201cView Component\u201d of changes in data.","The \u201cView Component,\u201d (e.g., Java Server Page (JSP) View Module ), which renders the content of the \u201cModel Component\u201d (Business Tier Module  in ), is responsible for specifying how data should be presented and for generating the pages displayed on the mobile, portable devices. These pages use a combination of text, hyperlinks, icons and graphics to convey the information. It is also the \u201cView Component's\u201d responsibility to maintain consistency in its presentation when the \u201cModel Component\u201d changes. In one embodiment of the solution of the present invention, as described above, this is achieved by using a \u201cpush\u201d model, where the \u201cView Component\u201d registers itself with the \u201cModel Component\u201d for change notifications. Alternatively, a \u201cpull\u201d model may be used, where the \u201cView Component\u201d is responsible for calling the \u201cModel Component\u201d when it needs to retrieve the most current data.","There are two main categories of pages generated by the View Component: measures and alerts. Measure pages display the descriptive information concerning the drill path, the current dimensional vertex, and related summary information. Additional elements, such as trending graphs and basic application navigation links are present as well. Alerts comprise messages that are triggered to the delivery services layer  based on thresholds established in the data repository. Alert pages display detailed information concerning critical events related to the summary data on the Measure pages. They also provide a set of mechanisms enabling an active response to an alert. Email and portal links are available, with phone call response provided for devices supporting voice communications. Additionally, the Measure pages contain graphics indicating which measures have alerts associated with them. These will be discussed in more detail in the forthcoming paragraphs with regard to .","Finally, there is the \u201cController Component\u201d (e.g., Java Servlet Controller Module ). In accordance with the MVC paradigm, the \u201cController Component\u201d controls user interaction flow for the solution of the present invention. This component translates interactions with the \u201cView Component\u201d into actions to be performed by the \u201cModel Component.\u201d In one embodiment of the solution of the present invention, where the MIE application services  comprises one of the tiers, or layers, they preferably appear as \u201cGET\u201d and \u201cPOST HTTP\u201d requests. In the case where MIE application services  is a stand-alone application, user interactions could be button clicks or menu selections. Based on the user interactions and the outcome of the \u201cModel Component\u201d actions, the \u201cController Component\u201d responds by selecting an appropriate view from the \u201cView Component.\u201d","c. Administration Application Component ","The administration application component  provides the critical business metric definitions to the web application component , and provides a secure interface between the analytics engine services layer  and the enterprise's personalization and authentication application services  (which is typically part of an enterprise's underlying operational systems). The personalization and authentication application services  provides several functions. It manages the critical business metric information including information about the critical business metric and the alert threshold. Further, personalization and authentication application services  provides administration and access level security for deter who would be authorized to access which critical business metrics and who would be alerted for a change in the cursed operation status of these critical business metrics. Thus, for enable, personalization and authentication application services  manages the creation or deletion of a user and assignation of a user to a particular group and\/or groups. A person having administrative rights to the personalization and authentication application services  can assign a critical business metric to a user or a group. If the critical business metric is assigned to a user, only that user can access that critical business metric. However, in certain instances, for example where a number of users are to be allowed access to a critical business metric, the administrator can assign the critical business metric to a group in order to simplify security access. In addition, the security for profile and login may be made via any of several directory services for accessing information directories, such as e-mail and public encryption keys. For example, interface  supports the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) directory service, Microsoft's Active rectory directory service (for the Windows\u00ae 2000 operating system) and, any customer database-driven profile management system (e.g., Microsoft's SQL Server Database or Systems available from Oracle Corporation).","It will be appreciated that the MIE application services  is unique as a middleware component in that it is able to read and translate both the information and the related business rules maintained in a traditional \u2018data mart\u2019 (multi-dimensional database). This is a significant advancement over standard data translation tools represented in the market, generally known as Extract, Transformation & Load (ETL) tools. The ability to read data and the rules governing that data enables the full separation of the information and presentation tiers. This provides new dimensions in architectural flexibility not previously possible in traditional data mart and data mining solutions. The MIE application services  is commercially available from Unisys Corporation at the address set forth above.","D. Delivery Services Layer ","Referring again to , the fourth tier, the delivery services layer , is a middleware component that creates and manages mobile devices' custom browsers and their related functionality. This layer thus allows an enterprise to elect to support more than one type of wireless device, such as a combination of a Blackberry\u00ae handheld device and PalmOS-based wireless PDA\/cell phone. Delivery services layer  also provides transcode rendering support, by taking the device-independent markup language output from the mobile integration engine (MIE) application services  and re-rendering it into wireless markup language (WML), and further transmitting the data in accordance with the requirements of the target mobile device as to how the data should be delivered. In one embodiment of the present invention, delivery services layer  provides its services trough Novarra Inc.'s Engines for Wireless Data (EWD) Product Suite, commercially available from Novarra Incorporated, Suite 500E, One Pierce Place Itasca, Ill. 60143. However, the delivery services layer  of the solution of the present invention is not so limited, and other product solutions that provide the same functionality may be substituted. For example, any similar node renderer that can provide additional markup translation services beyond HTML may be used, such as those that can reformat HTML elements (e.g., tables) or produce other markup (e.g. WAP) optimized for a specific mobile device's screen real estate or compensate for a wireless device's lack of support for standard web application services such as javascript.","E. Physical Transmission Tier ","Physical transmission tier  is an optional layer that may be incorporated into an embodiment of the solution of the present invention for those business entities that do not have any form of mobile enterprise. This tier  preferably includes two sub-tiers: the wireless network application component , which includes the wireless network, and a mobile browser component , which resides on the wireless device .","II. Functional Diagram",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0087","num":"0086"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["20","94","82","30","84","40","86"]},"As discussed above, the web application component  of MIE application services tier  is preferably designed around the MVC paradigm and includes three components: a Business Tier Module  (\u201cModel Component\u201d) that includes the business process logic, business data entities and defines the interfaces for business data entities; a Java Server Page (JSP) View Module  (\u201cView Component\u201d), which is responsible for generating the pages displayed on the mobile, portable devices; and the Servlet Controller Module  (\u201cController Component\u201d) for controlling user interaction flow. It will be appreciated that, although a J2EE embodiment is shown in , the solution of the present invention encompasses similar environments. For example, a NET embodiment is similar to that shown in , with the JSP View Module being replaced by an Active Server Pages (ASP) View Module.","III. Portable Mobile Device","In one embodiment of the present invention, the business operational data and other business intelligence information is communicated from the physical transmission tier  of the solution to a web-enabled, mobile device . In that embodiment, mobile device  comprises a portable or hand-held device such as a Palm-Pilot, BlackBerry\u00ae handheld, Pocket PC, device running on the Java 2 Platform, Micro Edition (J2ME) platform, or any other similar personal digital assistant (PDA), mobile\/cellular phone, laptop, notebook or any other similar portable device that is, or is adaptable to become, web-enabled.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0090","num":"0089"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["100","102","104","54","44","54"]},"Once the user is authenticated, the browser in mobile device  displays an industry selection screen  (), which preferably comprises a number of icons including hyperlinks to informational screens relating to the selected industry. For ease of understanding the present invention, the following discussion will be limited to the airline industry and its critical business metrics, or KPI. It will of course be understood that the present invention is not so limited and that the solution of the present invention is application to each and any other industry (including, but not limited to, manufacturing, banking, pharmaceutical, health insurance, government, wired and wireless telecommunications, etc.) and\/or corporate division, unit, role, or function within a business enterprise (including, but not limited to, corporate financials, Sarbane-Oxley, etc.) Furthermore, the display screens shown herein and discussed below are merely examples. Although in one embodiment of the present invention, the portable or hand-held device is a Palm-Pilot, BlackBerry\u00ae handheld or Pocket PC, it will be appreciated that different form factors, operating systems, browser applications and graphical user interfaces (GUI) may be used without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention.","After selecting the airline industry icon  from industry selection screen , the industry home screen  will be displayed (). Industry home screen  displays the critical metric, or KPI, categories for a particular industry that have been previously selected and defined by the business enterprise. As shown in , critical metric, or KPI, categories for a business enterprise in the airline industry might include baggage operations , flight operations  and utilization . Of course, these categories are merely exemplary of KPI categories, and these categories might be relabeled, modified, eliminated or appended to, depending on the particular business enterprise.","If the mobile device user were to select the flight operations icon , for example, he\/she would be hyperlinked to a screen that would show all of the dimensions related to flight operations (screen not shown) As used herein, a \u201cdimension\u201d means a side of a multidimensional cube. Each dimension represents a different category that the business enterprise chooses to measure, such as customer, region, product, and time. One of the dimensions for the flight operations category might be \u201cNation,\u201d which might show the number of on-time departures for the airline at all of its hubs throughout the United States. If the user were to select the \u201cNation\u201d link, in one embodiment of the present invention, the \u201cNation\u201d dimension screen  of in  would be displayed on the mobile device .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0094","num":"0093"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 7","FIG. 7"],"b":["132","134","132","134","132","134","132","134"]},"While the current operational status of any of these metrics is critical to the decision-maker, as discussed above, an important feature of the solution of the present invention not found in prior solutions is the presentation for a critical business metric category, the current operational data and state statistics of this data as compared and presented against history, trends, competitive analytics and\/or objectives that are relevant to the business enterprise or some function, service or operation thereof. This ensures that decision makers have the most current state of the business enterprise combined with traditional decision support analytics and thus ensures more accurate and timely decisions.","Thus, as shown in , in addition to the current operational status of any of this metric, historical and business target objectives are shown. Thus, \u201cTarget\u201d  might reflect the business target objectives for the airline for both the Phoenix Sky Harbor International (PHX) and Cincinnati\/Northern Kentucky International (CVG) Airports, and \u201cDeviation\u201d  reflects the percentage that the \u201cMeasure\u201d  deviates from the business target objective \u201cTarget\u201d . In addition to numerical information, textual information is provided to guide the decision-maker. For example, as shown in , textual messages such as \u201cAcceptable values [for \u201cMeasure\u201d ] are 6696 or better,\u201d \u201cHigher numbers [for \u201cMeasure\u201d ] are better,\u201d and \u201cStatus is On-Target.\u201d In one embodiment of the present invention, the \u201cComponent Measures\u201d are also graphically re at  as a segmented bar graph using a dot, an arrow right, or an arrow left indicating no change, trend up or trend down, respectively.","Of course, other critical business metrics for the same category of critical business metrics could be used. Thus, instead of Phoenix Sky Harbor International (PHX) and Cincinnati\/Northern Kentucky International (CVG) Airports, any other combination or permutation of hubs within the \u201cNation\u201d dimension could be displayed. In addition, other information such an industry targets, national and business enterprise trends might be displayed in addition to, or instead of this information, subject to the selection of the business entity and limited only by the real estate of the mobile device . Furthermore, other textual and graphical representations may be used to present the same information without departing from the scope and spirit of the present invention.","If the user of the mobile device  wanted to be apprised of current, up-to-date business metrics specifically pertaining to Phoenix Sky Harbor International (PHX) Hub operations, he could select the PHX Hub sub-metric  link, which would bring up PHX Hub Metric screen  (). (The term \u201cmetric\u201d and \u201csub-metric\u201d are essentially interchangeable in that they both represent critical business metrics to a business entity. A \u201cmetric\u201d may have one or more \u201csub-metrics\u201d and further itself be a \u201csub-metric\u201d to another \u201cmetric.\u201d)","It will be appreciated that PHX Hub Metric screen  and \u201cNation\u201d dimension screen  are similar in providing \u201cMeasure,\u201d \u201cComponent Measures,\u201d \u201cTarget,\u201d and \u201cDeviation\u201d as well as associated text and graphics. However, PHX Hub Metric screen  displays only that real-time critical operational data and contextual information that is directly relevant to it. For example, \u201cMeasure\u201d  shows the same current value for on-time departures as was shown in the PHX Hub sub-metric  on screen  (i.e., 2940),\u201d but the \u201cComponent Measures\u201d on screen  provides a breakdown of the on-time departures to and from the PHX Hub by originating\/destination airport (e.g., as shown in , Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport (PHX); Los Angeles International Airport (LAX); San Francisco International Airport (SFO); Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA); Las Vegas McCarran International Airport (LAS); Salt Lake City International Airport (SLC); Denver International Airport (DEN); San Diego\u2014Lindbergh Field (SAN))","In addition to these current operational states, historical and business target objectives are also shown. As with \u201cNation\u201d dimension screen , historical and business target objectives are shown on PHX Hub Metric screen . For example, the \u201cTarget\u201d for on-time departures is shown as \u201c3240,\u201d and the \u201cDeviation\u201d is shown as \u201c\u22129%,\u201d where deviation again represents the percentage that the \u201cMeasure\u201d deviates from the business target objective \u201cTarget.\u201d In addition, similar to the \u201cNation\u201d dimension screen , textual and graphical information are provided to guide the decision-maker.","Should the user of the mobile device \/decision-maker want further information on the specifics of the critical metrics of Phoenix Sky Harbor International (PHX) that, for example, negatively affect on-time departures from that airport, he\/she could select the PHX sub-metric  link, which would result in sub-metrics of the PHX sub-metric being displayed on screen  (). As send therein, the sub-metrics of PHX sub-metric might include current data on ground hold sub-metric  (e.g., number of delays due to non-mechanical-related ground holds), mechanical sub-metric  (e.g., number of mechanically-related delays), and crew sub-metric  (e.g., number of crew unavailable), each of which can impact on-time departures from that airport. Of course, it will be recognized that other metrics could be used in addition to, or instead of, those shown in . Selection of any of these links will bring up a screen providing further details about that sub-metric.","For example, should the crew sub-metric  link be selected, the solution of the present invention will cause the mobile device  to display crew sub-metric screen  () that provides detail about the alerted crew sub-metric . Again, \u201cMeasure,\u201d \u201cTarget,\u201d and \u201cDeviation\u201d information is provided; however there are not \u201cComponent Measures\u201d that comprise the crew sub-metric , nor are they any further sub-metrics. As will be seen from the \u201cDeviation\u201d number and textual information accompanying it, the status of this metric is off by 48%.","In addition to the above information, as seen in screen , an \u201c!\u201d icon  is displayed alongside crew sub-metric . In one embodiment of the present invention, this is used to indicate that there is an alert in the crew sub-metric (that is, web application component  has detected a change within the critical business and KPI data related to this sub-metric, and accordingly, pushed a dynamic custom HTML or XML coded alert to the delivery services layer  via an HTTP Post, which in turn, is communicated via delivery services layer  physical transmission tier  to the mobile device ). Additionally, an \u201cAlert information\u201d link  is provided, the selection of which will cause Alert Information screen  () to be displayed.","In one embodiment of the present invention, Alert Information screen  provides several levels of information. First, it provides textual information explaining why the alert was generated. As seen in , although thirty-six (36) flight crewmembers were scheduled for duty, twenty-four (24) called in sick. Alert Information screen  also provides additional direction to the decision-maker to contact Phoenix Crew Operations for more information. Finally, in one embodiment of the present invention, Alert Information screen  provides three avenues of contact: Phone number link  for a contact person (landline or mobile); an e-mail address link  for that person; and, a portal link  to an outside web page for further information (e.g., a home web page such as shown in ). If user selects any of these links, the solution of the present invention will automatically initiate the communications depending on the chosen link. It will be appreciated, that any other communications links could be, including but not limited to, paging, messaging, walkie-talkie, and facsimile communications.","An important feature of the solution of the present invention is that web application component  can \u201cpush\u201d an alert to the mobile device  at any time, regardless of in what screen the device  is in, which allows the user to more quickly access and assess the affected critical business metric. For example, while an alert related to the crew sub-metric was displayed in, and alert information accessible, from screen sub-metric , the alert and related alert information may be displayed in, and alert information accessible from, any other screen. For example, as shown in , after the user has logged in, he\/she might find that the home screen  indicates that two of the dimensions have associated alerts: Baggage Operations and Flight Operations. An important additional feature of the solution of the present invention is that, not only is it adapted to indicate that there is an alert with each of these dimensions, but it is further adapted to modify the icon to reflect in which critical business metric the alert has occurred. Thus, in , the Baggage Operations icon is modified to indicate an alerted \u201cMishandled Baggage\u201d critical business metric , while Flight Operations is modified to indicate an alerted \u201cOn-Time Departure\u201d critical business metric . Further, in one embodiment, the number of alerts is provided along with a link .","If the user selected the \u201cMishandled Baggage\u201d icon , he\/she would be brought to a page providing details of the mishandled baggage (e.g., ). Alternatively, if he\/she selected the link associated with textual statement , a Status Alert screen  () would be displayed which simply sets out each of the critical business metrics that has been alerted, their relation to other metrics, dimensions, and sub-metrics, in what hub and airport the alert occurred, and a graphical representation indicating (in this instance) a trend downwards. As seen in , of the three alerts, one alert  is related to the mishandled baggage business at the Phoenix Sky Harbor International (PHZ) Airport (the baggage being misconnected between flights), while two are related to the on-time departure critical business metric (one  related to a security breach at Los Angeles International (LAX) Airport; the other  to insufficient crew members for flights out of the Phoenix airport).","Should any of the links associated with the alerted critical business metric be selected, the solution of the present invention will cause the mobile device  to display a screen that provides detail about the alerted critical business metric. Thus, for example, should the user select crew alert , the solution of the present invention would cause the mobile device  to display a display screen such as seen in .","Finally,  illustrates a contact screen  which, in one embodiment of solution of the present invention, is accessible from any of the login screen , industry selection screen , or the industry home screen , although it will be appreciated that the solution of the present invention may be modified so that this screen  is accessible from any of the other screens as well. The information provided is similar to that provided on the Alert Information screen , and in one embodiment of the solution of the present invention includes at least one name, phone number link  for that contact person (landline or mobile) as well as an e-mail address link . If user selects either of these links, the solution of the present invention will automatically initiate the communications depending on the chosen link. It will be appreciated, that any other communications links could be, including but not limited to, paging, messaging, walkie-talkie, and facsimile communications.","Although one embodiment of the screens of the present invention is shown in , they are merely exemplary. The display hardware, firmware and software may be configured in other ways to convey the information conveyed therein, without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Further, one skilled in the art will recognize that any icon, textual or graphical representation may be used to represent an alert without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention, and that the icon, textual or graphical representation may be displayed anywhere on the display screen","Enterprise System Deployment",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0110","num":"0109"},"figref":"FIG. 17","b":["300","342","340"]},"Enterprise  generally includes a number of business intelligence servers , which may be data warehouses that function to integrate with, and capture data from, diverse data sources within the enterprise (e.g., corporate systems , corporate-wide databases , and additional corporate data ).
