Field of the Invention","This invention relates to a developer carrying member used in a developing apparatus by means of which an electrostatic latent image formed on an electrostatic latent image bearing member such as an electrophotographic photosensitive member or an electrostatic recoding dielectric is developed with a developer to form a toner image in electrophotography, and also relates to a developing apparatus making use of the developer carrying member. This invention still also relates to a developer carrying member whose resin coat layer provided on a substrate of the developer carrying member has been improved, and further relates to a developing apparatus making use of such a developer carrying member.","2. Related Background Art","Conventionally, in electrophotography, copies or prints are obtained by forming an electrostatic latent image on an electrostatic latent image bearing member (photosensitive drum) by utilizing a photoconductive material and by various means, subsequently developing the electrostatic latent image by the use of a developer having a toner, to form a toner image, transferring the toner image to a transfer medium such as paper as occasion calls, and then fixing the toner image to the transfer medium by the action of heat, pressure or heat-and-pressure. Developing systems in electrophotography are grouped into a one-component developing system, which requires no carrier, and a two-component developing system, which makes use of a carrier.","The one-component developing system includes a powder cloud method, in which the toner is used in an atomized state; a contact developing method, in which a toner held on a developer carrying member having a flexibility or elasticity is directly brought into contact with the surface of an electrostatic latent image bearing member to perform development; and a jumping developing method, in which the toner is not brought into direct contact but the toner is caused to fly toward the surface of an electrostatic latent image bearing member by the action of an electric field formed between the electrostatic latent image bearing member and the developer carrying member. A contact one-component developing method or a one-component jumping developing method is commonly used.","Developing apparatus employing the one-component developing system have advantages that they require no carrier and require no mechanism for controlling the concentration of toners and carriers and hence the developing assemblies themselves can be made compact and light-weight.","As toners used in such a developing system, toners with small particle diameter are recently used so that electrophotographic apparatus can be made digital and can be made much higher in image quality. For example, in order to improve resolution and character sharpness to reproduce electrostatic latent images faithfully, toners having a weight-average particle diameter of about 4 to 10 \u03bcm are used. It is demanded, for the purpose of more reducing power consumption of apparatus from the viewpoint of ecology, to lower fixing temperature of toners in order to improve fixing performance of the toners, or, for the purpose of making electrophotographic apparatus more compact and light-weight, to improve transfer efficiency of toners in order to reduce waste toner. In order to improve fixing performance of toners, glass transition temperature (Tg) of binder resins used in the toners are made lower, or low-molecular weight components are made larger in proportion in molecular weight distribution of binder resins. Also, in order to improve anti-offset properties of toners, a method is known in which a wax capable of improving plasticity of binder resins is added to toner particles. Still also, in order to improve transfer efficiency of toners, a method is known in which a transfer efficiency improver having an average particle diameter of 0.1 to 3 \u03bcm and a hydrophobic silica fine powder having a BET specific surface area of 50 to 300 m\/g are added to toner particles, or in which toner particles are spherical-treated by mechanical impact force.","As a first method for controlling charge quantity of toners, it is prevalent to add a charge control agent to toner particles. However, dyes or pigments used as charge control agents have a tendency of adhering to various members when added to toner particles in a large quantity.","As a second method for controlling charge quantity of toners, a method is proposed in which a suitable material is used in triboelectric charge-providing members so as to make toners have proper charge quantity.","In the developing apparatus employing the one-component developing system, the toner comes into contact with a developer carrying member and a developer layer thickness control member when it is passed through the part between the developer carrying member and the developer layer thickness control member so as to be made into a thin layer, and hence these members have a great influence on making the toner have proper charge quantity. In particular, in the case of a developing apparatus employing a magnetic one-component developing system, which makes use of a magnetic toner, the magnetic toner moves on the developer carrying member by the action of a magnetic force of a magnet built in the developer carrying member, and hence the magnetic toner is frequently rubbed against the developer carrying member. Accordingly, the selection of materials for the developer carrying member has a great influence on the charging performance of the magnetic toner.","As developer carrying members used in the one-component developing system, commonly used are, in the contact developing method, one in which an elastic member of urethane rubber, EPDM rubber, silicone rubber or the like is molded on a shaft made of a metal such as stainless steel, and one in which a layer of an elastomer is formed on the surface of a cylindrical member of aluminum or stainless steel. In this case, the elastic member is incorporated therein with components such as a plasticizer, a vulcanizing agent, a release agent and a low-molecular weight component. It is proposed to provide a barrier layer or a protective layer on the layer surface of the elastic member so that these components can be prevented from bleeding out of the elastic member to affect members adversely. It is further proposed to form at the outermost surface a surface layer using a resin using a material having good release properties or using a resin having good charge-providing properties to toners.","As disclosed in Japanese Patent Applications Laid-Open No. H02-105181 and No. H03-036570, proposed is, as a developer carrying member (developing sleeve) used in a non-contact one-component developing method, a developing sleeve comprising a developing-sleeve substrate on the surface of which a resin coat layer is formed in which a conductive material such as carbon black or graphite and a solid lubricant stand dispersed in a binder resin having good charge-providing properties. However, the surface profile of the developing sleeve has a great influence. Hence, if the surface profile of the developing sleeve has changed as a result of repeated use, the coat level of the toner can not easily be made stable, and the developing performance tends to become unstable. A sufficient performance may be achievable in low-volume process cartridges, which are not required to have durability (running performance) so much. However, in the case of high-volume process cartridges, which are required to have a high durability, the surface profile of the developing sleeve may greatly change because of scrape of the resin coat layer to tend to result in a great change in toner's coat level as well. Such a change in coat level of the toner has an influence also on the chargeability of the toner because the frequency of rubbing between the toner and the developing sleeve changes.","As disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. H03-200986, a developing sleeve is proposed to the surface of which spherical fine particles have been added to form unevenness on the developing-sleeve surface. Such a method in which spherical particles are added is a good means in order to form a surface profile with uniform unevenness and make stable the coat level of the toner. However, when the developing sleeve is repeatedly used over a long period of time, or in a developing method in which a strong stress is applied to the surface of the developing sleeve, the use of spherical resin particles as the spherical fine particles may cause scrape during repeated use over a long period of time to make the resin coat layer of the developing sleeve have a low surface roughness, so that the coat level of the toner may decrease and also the melt adhesion of toner tends to occur.","As disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. H08-240981, a developing sleeve is proposed in which conductive spherical particles having a true density of 3 g\/cmor less have been added to a resin layer of the developing sleeve to form unevenness on the surface of the developing sleeve. Such a developing sleeve makes stable the coat level of the toner and also the conductive spherical particles themselves haves a good wear resistance. Hence, the stress applied to the toner between the developing sleeve and the developer layer thickness control member is relaxed to bring an improvement in durability of the resin coat layer itself. However, at resin portions present between conductive spherical particles, the scrape may selectively progress because of the repeated use over a long period of time and the rubbing with the toner, so that the resin coat layer may change in surface roughness to therefore tend to cause a change in coat level of the toner.","In the developing apparatus employing the one-component developing system, it is long awaited to provide a developing sleeve whose resin coat layer which forms the surface layer of the developing sleeve has been more improved.","An object of the present invention is to provide a developer carrying member at the surface of which a resin coat layer having a uniform surface profile is formed and in which the resin coat layer has a good durability even when used repeatedly over a long period of time in every environment, and the resin coat layer can not easily selectively be scraped, so that it can keep its surface roughness from changing, can control the coat level of the toner in a constant quantity and also can provide the toner with a proper charge quantity; and to provide a developing apparatus making use of such a developer carrying member.","Another object of the present invention is to provide a developer carrying member that can not easily cause problems such as image density decrease, fog and spots around character images, can stably obtain images at a high quality level, can not easily cause melt-adhesion of the toner or rub scratches on the surface of the developer layer thickness control member and can not easily cause lines or non-uniformity on toner images, even when used repeatedly over a long period of time in every environment; and to provide a developing apparatus making use of such a developer carrying member.","To achieve the above objects, the present invention provides a developer carrying member for carrying a developer, comprising a substrate and a resin coat layer formed on the surface of the substrate, wherein;","the resin coat layer contains at least a binder resin and graphitized particles;","the graphitized particles have a degree of graphitization p (002) of 0.20\u2266p (002)\u22660.95; and","the surface of the resin coat layer has an average value A and a standard deviation \u03c3 of:\n\n100\u2266800(N\/mm); and\n\n\u03c3<30(N\/mm);\n\nwhich are determined from the hardness distribution of measured values HU of universal hardness in a surface physical-property test, calculated according to the following expression (1):\n\nUniversal hardness value (N\/mm)\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nwhere K represents a constant, F represents a test load (N), and h represents the maximum indentation depth (mm) of an indenter.\n","The present invention further provides a developing apparatus comprising a developer container, a developer carrying member for carrying and transporting thereon a developer held in the developer container, and a developer layer thickness control member for forming a thin layer of the developer on the developer carrying member, provided in proximity to or in pressure contact with the developer carrying member;","the developing apparatus being an apparatus by means of which the developer is carried and transported by the developer carrying member to a developing zone facing an electrostatic latent image bearing member and an electrostatic latent image formed on the electrostatic latent image bearing member is developed with the developer to form a toner image; and","the developer carrying member comprising a substrate and a resin coat layer formed on the surface of the substrate, wherein;","the resin coat layer contains at least a binder resin and graphitized particles;","the graphitized particles have a degree of graphitization p (002) of 0.20\u2266p (002)\u22660.95; and","the surface of the resin coat layer has an average value A and a standard deviation \u03c3 of:\n\n100\u2266800(N\/mm); and\n\n\u03c3<30(N\/mm);\n\nwhich are determined from the hardness distribution of measured values HU of universal hardness in a surface physical-property test, calculated according to the following expression (1):\n\nUniversal hardness value (N\/mm)\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nwhere K represents a constant, F represents a test load (N), and h represents the maximum indentation depth (mm) of an indenter.\n","The present inventors have discovered that the construction taken as described above brings the following effect: the profile of the coat layer surface of the resin coat layer of the developer carrying member surface at the initial stage of many-sheet running can be made uniform, and, even when many-sheet running is performed, the change in surface roughness of the resin coat layer can be made small and the change in coat level of the toner can also be made small, the toner can properly uniformly be charged even at the latter stage of many-sheet running, and also good images can be obtained over a long period of time in every environment.","The present invention is described below in detail with reference to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["5","4","4","3","1","2"]},"The graphitized particles  used in the resin coat layer  of the surface of the developing sleeve according to the present invention have a degree of graphitization p (002) of 0.20\u2266p (002)\u22660.95, and can make proper the charge quantity of the toner because they exhibit good conductivity. They also can keep the resin coat layer from being scraped, even when used repeatedly over a long period of time, because they have superior wear resistance compared with conventional graphite particles. Thus, the coat level of the toner can be made stable over a long period of time.","The resin coat layer  of the surface of the developing sleeve according to the present invention contains at least graphitized particles  having superior wear resistance, and also its surface has an average value A and a standard deviation \u03c3 of 100\u2266A\u2266800 (N\/mm) and \u03c3<30 (N\/mm), respectively, which are determined from the hardness distribution of measured values HU of universal hardness. The resin coat layer  of the surface of the developing sleeve according to the present invention may preferably have an arithmetic-mean roughness Ra of from 0.20 \u03bcm to 0.70 \u03bcm according to JIS B 0601 (hereinafter also simply \u201clow-Ra system\u201d). Compared with a low-Ra system of the conventional graphite particles, the developing sleeve of the present invention does not cause any selective scrape in the resin coat layer, and the coat layer surface is uniformly scraped even when scraped as a result of repeated use over a long period of time, and at the same time the surface has micro-unevenness for maintaining the low Ra. Hence, the effect can be brought out such that the resin coat layer can be kept from changing in surface profile and the toner charge quantity and toner coat level can be made stabler.","The developer carrying member of the present invention and the developing apparatus making use of the same are described below in greater detail.","The graphitized particles  used in the resin coat layer  of the developer carrying member of the present invention are described.","The graphitized particles  used in the present invention have the degree of graphitization p (002) of 0.20\u2266p (002)\u22660.95.","The degree of graphitization p (002) is a value called Franklin's p-value, and is determined as d (002)=3.440-0.086 (1\u2212P) by measuring the lattice spacing d (002) obtained from an X-ray diffraction pattern of graphite. This p-value shows the proportion of disorderly portions among stacks of hexagonal network planes of carbon. The smaller the value is, the larger the degree of graphitization is.","The graphitized particles  used in the present invention differ in raw materials and production steps, from crystallizable graphite particles composed of artificial graphite or natural graphite obtained by hardening an aggregate such as coke with a tar pitch, and molding the hardened matter, followed by firing at approximately from 1,000\u00b0 C. to 1,300\u00b0 C. and then graphitization at approximately from 2,500\u00b0 C. to 3,000\u00b0 C., which are used in the resin coat layer of the developer carrying member surface as disclosed in Japanese Patent Applications Laid-Open No. H02-105181 and No. H03-036570. The graphitized particles  used in the present invention have a little lower degree of graphitization than the crystallizable graphite particles conventionally used, but have the same high conductivity and lubricity as the crystallizable graphite particles conventionally used, and further have a characteristic feature that they are substantially spherical and besides the hardness of particles themselves is relatively high, as being different from the scaly shape or acicular shape of the crystallizable graphite particles conventionally used. Hence, inasmuch as the developer carrying member of the present invention has the resin coat layer containing such graphitized particles having good conductivity and high lubricity, the charge quantity of the toner can be made proper and also the toner can be kept from melt-adhering to the resin coat layer surface. Moreover, the graphitized particles having the shape as described above can readily uniformly be dispersed in the resin coat layer, and hence provide the resin coat layer surface with uniform surface profile and wear resistance. In addition, the shape of the graphitized particles themselves can not easily change, and hence the resin coat layer can be kept from being scraped, even when used repeatedly over a long period of time, and the toner charge quantity and toner coat level can be made stable over a long period of time.","The graphitized particles used in the present invention have the degree of graphitization p (002) of 0.20\u2266p (002)\u22660.95, which may preferably be 0.25\u2266p (002)\u22660.75.","If they have a degree of graphitization p (002) of more than 0.95, they have good wear resistance, but may have low conductivity and lubricity to cause image density decrease and blotches because of a phenomenon of charge-up of the toner, and may further cause rub scratches on the developer layer thickness control member when an elastic member is used in the control member, tending to cause lines or non-uniformity in solid images. If they have a degree of graphitization p (002) of less than 0.20, the resin coat layer may have a low mechanical strength because of a lowering of wear resistance of the graphitized particles to cause the selective scrape of the resin coat layer, tending to cause faulty images.","The graphitized particles used in the present invention, as being set to have the degree of graphitization p (002) of 0.20\u2266p (002)\u22660.95, has the effect that they have good conductivity and high lubricity and also can prevent the mechanical strength of the resin coat layer from lowering to keep the resin coat layer from being selectively scraped. Moreover, setting the degree of graphitization p (002) of the graphitized particles within the specific range makes the graphitized particles have a hardness close to the hardness of the resin. Hence, the resin coat layer is uniformly scraped even when the surface of the resin coat layer wears, so that the graphitized particles again come exposed from the interior of the resin coat layer. Hence, the surface composition may less change, and the surface profile as well can retain uniform micro-unevenness.","The graphitized particles used in the present invention may preferably have a volume-average particle diameter of from 0.5 \u03bcm to 4.0 \u03bcm. Since the resin coat layer in the present invention may preferably have the JIS B 0601 arithmetic-mean roughness Ra of from 0.20 \u03bcm to 0.70 \u03bcm, if the graphitized particles have a volume-average particle diameter of less than 0.5 \u03bcm, the effect of providing the resin coat layer surface with uniform roughness may be so small as to make it difficult to set the surface roughness Ra to 0.20 \u03bcm or more. This may lower rapid and uniform charge-providing properties to the developer, and also tends to cause image density decrease and blotches because of the phenomenon of charge-up of the toner. If the graphitized particles have a volume-average particle diameter of more than 4.0 \u03bcm, such particles may make it difficult to set the surface roughness Ra of the resin coat layer to 0.70 \u03bcm or less. Also, such particles may make the resin coat layer have a higher surface roughness depending on repeated use over a long period of time, resulting in a large coat level of the toner to tend to cause an image density decrease due to lack of charge of the toner, and faulty images such as fog and spots around character images. The graphitized particles used in the present invention, as being set to have the volume-average particle diameter of from 0.5 \u03bcm to 4.0 \u03bcm, can make it easy to control the surface roughness of the resin coat layer, and can make stabler the toner charge quantity and toner coat level.","As a method for obtaining the graphitized particles used in the present invention, a method as shown below is preferable. The method is not necessarily limited to the following.","As the method for obtaining the graphitized particles used in the present invention, graphitization is effected using, as a raw material, particles which are optically anisotropic and formed of a single phase, such as mesocarbon microbeads or bulk-mesophase pitch. This is preferable in order to make the graphitized particles have a high degree of graphitization and also retain their spherical shape. Optical anisotropy of the raw material comes from stacks of aromatic molecules, and its orderliness develops further by graphitization treatment, so that the graphitized particles having a high degree of graphitization can be obtained.","In the case when the bulk-mesophase pitch is used as the raw material from which the graphitized particles used in the present invention are to be obtained, a bulk-mesophase pitch capable of softening and melting upon heating may preferably be used in order to obtain graphitized particles which are spherical and have a high degree of graphitization. For example, the bulk-mesophase pitch is mesophase pitch obtained by extracting \u03b2-resin from coal-tar pitch by solvent fractionation and hydrogenating the \u03b2-resin to carry out heavy-duty treatment. Also usable is mesophase pitch obtained by finely pulverizing the \u03b2-resin after its heavy-duty treatment and then removing the solvent-soluble matter using benzene or toluene. The bulk-mesophase pitch may preferably have 95% by weight or more of quinoline-soluble matter. If one having less than 95% by weight of the same is used, the interiors of particles can not easily be liquid-phase carbonized, and hence may come solid-phase carbonized to form carbonized particles whose shape is kept in a crushed state, making it difficult to obtain spherical particles.","Next, as a method for graphitizing the mesophase pitch, the bulk-mesophase pitch is finely pulverized into a size of from 1 \u03bcm to 6 \u03bcm in volume-average particle diameter to obtain particles, and the particles obtained are subjected to heat treatment in air at about 200\u00b0 C. to about 350\u00b0 C. to carry out oxidation treatment lightly. This oxidation treatment makes the bulk-mesophase pitch particles infusible only at their surfaces, and the particles are prevented from melting or fusing at the time of heat treatment for graphitization in the next step. The bulk-mesophase pitch particles having been subjected to oxidation treatment may preferably have an oxygen content of from 5% by weight to 15% by weight. If they have an oxygen content of less than 5% by weight, particles tend to fuse one another at the time of heat treatment, undesirably. If they have an oxygen content of more than 15% by weight, particles may be oxidized up to their interiors, and may be graphitized as their shape is in a crushed state, making it difficult to obtain spherical particles. Next, the bulk-mesophase pitch particles having been subjected to oxidation treatment are subjected to heat treatment at 2,000\u00b0 C. to 3,500\u00b0 C. in an inert atmosphere of nitrogen or argon to obtain the desired graphitized particles.","A method for obtaining the mesocarbon microbeads, another preferable raw material for obtaining the graphitized particles used in the present invention, is a method in which coal type heavy oil or petroleum type heavy oil is subjected to heat treatment at a temperature of from 300\u00b0 C. to 500\u00b0 C. to effect polycondensation to form crude mesocarbon microbeads, then the reaction product is subjected to treatment such as filtration, sedimentation by leaving at rest, or centrifugation, to separate mesocarbon microbeads, and thereafter the mesocarbon microbeads are washed with a solvent such as benzene, toluene or xylene, further followed by drying to obtain the desired mesocarbon microbeads.","As a method for effecting graphitization using the mesocarbon microbeads, the mesocarbon microbeads having been dried are kept mechanically primarily dispersed by a force mild enough not to break them. This is preferable in order to prevent particles from coalescing after graphitization or obtain uniform particles. The mesocarbon microbeads having been thus kept primarily dispersed are subjected to primary heat treatment at a temperature of from 200\u00b0 C. to 1,500\u00b0 C. in an inert atmosphere to undergo carbonization. The particles of the carbonized product thus obtained by this primary heat treatment are mechanically dispersed by a force mild enough not to break them. This is preferable in order to prevent particles from coalescing after graphitization or obtain uniform particles. The carbonized-product particles having been subjected to secondary dispersion treatment are subjected to secondary heat treatment at a temperature of from 2,000\u00b0 C. to 3,500\u00b0 C. in an inert atmosphere to obtain the desired graphitized particles.","The graphitized particles thus obtained are also kept to have a uniform particle size distribution to a certain extent by classification. This is preferable in order to make the resin coat layer have a uniform surface profile.","The graphitized particles may also preferably be fired at a temperature of from 2,000\u00b0 C. to 3,500\u00b0 C., and more preferably from 2,300\u00b0 C. to 3,200\u00b0 C. If the graphitized particles are fired at a temperature lower than 2,000\u00b0 C., they may have a low degree of graphitization, and may have low conductivity and lubricity to cause image density decrease and blotches because of the phenomenon of charge-up of the toner. Such particles may further cause rub scratches on the developer layer thickness control member when an elastic member is used in the control member, tending to cause lines or non-uniformity in solid images. If they are fired at a temperature higher than 3,500\u00b0 C., the graphitized particles may have a too high degree of graphitization, and hence the graphitized particles may have a low hardness to make the resin coat layer have a low mechanical strength because of a lowering of wear resistance of the graphitized particles to cause the selective scrape of the resin coat layer, tending to cause faulty images.","The graphitized particles standing dispersed in the resin coat layer may preferably be in a content of from 2 to 150 parts by weight, and more preferably from 4 to 100 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the binder resin in the resin coat layer, within the range of which they give especially preferable results. If the graphitized particles are in a content of less than 2 parts by weight, the addition of the graphitized particles may be less effective. If they are in a content of more than 150 parts by weight, the resin coat layer may have a low adherence, resulting in a low wear resistance.","The surface roughness, hardness, average value A determined from its hardness distribution, and standard deviation \u03c3 of the resin coat layer in the present invention are described below.","The surface of the resin coat layer is set to have an average value A and a standard deviation a of:\n\n100\u2266800(N\/mm); and\n\n\u03c3\u226630(N\/mm);\n\nwhich are determined from the hardness distribution of measured values HU of universal hardness in a surface physical-property test, calculated according to the following expression (1):\n\nUniversal hardness value (N\/mm)\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nwhere K represents a constant, F represents a test load (N), and h represents the maximum indentation depth (mm) of an indenter.\n","The surface of the resin coat layer may preferably be set to have an arithmetic-mean roughness Ra of from 0.20 \u03bcm to 0.70 \u03bcm according to JIS B 0601.","As to the surface roughness Ra, preferable surface roughness may differ depending on the developing system. In a developing apparatus having, as a developer layer thickness control member  as shown in , a magnetic blade disposed facing the developing sleeve and leaving a gap between them, or in a developing apparatus having, as a developer layer thickness control member  as shown in , an elastic blade provided in pressure contact with the developing sleeve at a stated pressure, the surface roughness of the resin coat layer surface may preferably be the low-Ra system and the Ra may preferably be from 0.20 \u03bcm to 0.70 \u03bcm, in the thin-layer system in which the magnetic toner with a microscopic particle diameter is thin coated on the developing sleeve. If the Ra is smaller than 0.20 \u03bcm, the toner may be in a small coat level to tend to cause image density decrease, toner charge-up phenomenon or blotches because of the fact that the toner is in a small coat level. If on the other hand the Ra is larger than 0.70 \u03bcm, the toner tends to be in a large coat level, so that the uniformity of triboelectric charging to the toner may lower to tend to cause spots around character images, fog, and image density decrease due to lack of charge of the toner.","If the average value A determined from the hardness distribution of measured values HU of universal hardness of the resin coat layer surface is smaller than 100 N\/mm, the resin coat layer tends to be easily scraped to have a low wear resistance, tending to cause faulty images. If the average value A is larger than 800 N\/mm, when applied to the developing apparatus of the type the developer layer thickness control member is elastically brought into pressure contact with the developing sleeve (via the toner) (i.e., a type of an elastic control blade), the surface of the elastic control blade tends to be rub-scratched at the initial stage of many-sheet running, and hence the toner coat tends to become non-uniform, tending to cause lines or non-uniformity in solid images to tend to result in a low image quality.","The average value A determined from the hardness distribution of the resin coat layer surface may preferably be within the range of 100\u2266A\u2266800 (N\/mm). In order to restrain the lowering of image quality over a longer period of time, the average value A may more preferably be within the range of 200\u2266A\u2266700 (N\/mm).","If the standard deviation a determined from the hardness distribution of measured values HU of universal hardness of the resin coat layer surface is 30 N\/mmor more, although the surface profile of the resin coat layer is made uniform at the initial stage of many-sheet running, the surface of the resin coat layer may come to wear selectively at its part having a small hardness, with progress of the many-sheet running, and hence the resin coat layer tends to come to have a large surface roughness. This may make the toner have a large coat level at the latter stage of many-sheet running, tending to cause fog or spots around character images especially in a low-temperature and low-humidity environment. Also, even in the case when the standard deviation \u03c3 is smaller than 30 N\/mm, in the resin coat layer making use of the conventional graphite particles the resin coat layer may come to wear selectively at hill portions of the resin coat layer surface, and hence the resin coat layer tends to come to have a small surface roughness. Hence, the toner charge-up phenomenon and blotches tend to occur especially in a low-temperature and low-humidity environment, and the image density decrease and image deterioration such as lines or non-uniformity in solid images which are due to the lack of coat level of the toner tend to occur especially in a high-temperature and high-humidity environment. Also, such a resin coat layer tends to cause the melt adhesion of toner to the developing sleeve when a low-temperature fixable toner is used.","Next, in the present invention, the binder resin used in the resin coat layer may include phenolic resins, epoxy resins, polyamide resins, polyester resins, polycarbonate resins, polyolefin resins, silicone resins, fluorine resins, styrene resins, vinyl resins, cellulose resins, melamine resins, urea resins, polyurethane resins, polyimide resins and acrylic resins. Taking account of mechanical strength, thermosetting or photosetting resins are more preferred. However, thermoplastic resins may also be used as long as they are those having a sufficient mechanical strength.","In the present invention, the resin coat layer formed at the surface of the developing sleeve by using the above forming materials may preferably be conductive in order to keep the toner from clinging to the developing sleeve surface because of charge-up of the toner, or keep the toner from being faultily provided with charge from the developing sleeve surface, which may be caused by charge-up of the toner. The resin coat layer may preferably have, as volume resistivity, a value of 10\u03a9\u00b7cm or less, and more preferably 103 \u03a9\u00b7cm or less. If the resin coat layer of the developing sleeve surface has a volume resistivity of more than 10\u03a9\u00b7cm, the toner tends to be faultily provided with charge, consequently tending to cause the toner charge-up phenomenon and blotches.","In the present invention, in order to control the resistivity of the resin coat layer to the above value, any of conductive materials as enumerated below may be incorporated in the resin coat layer. As a conductive fine powder used in such a case, it may include, e.g., fine powders of metals such as aluminum, copper, nickel and silver; fine powders of metal oxides such as antimony oxide, indium oxide, tin oxide, titanium oxide, zinc oxide, molybdenum oxide and potassium titanate; carbon fibers; carbon black such as furnace black, lamp black, thermal black, acetylene black and channel black; fine powders of carbon materials such as graphite; and metal fibers. Of these, the carbon black, in particular, conductive amorphous carbon may preferably be used because it has good electric conductivity and can obtain certain arbitrary conductance by filling the resin with it to impart conductivity or by controlling the amount in which it is added. It can also improve dispersion stability required when a resin composition is made into a coating material.","In the present invention, in the case when any of these conductive fine powders is used, the conductive fine powder may preferably be added in an amount ranging from 1 to 100 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the binder resin. If it is in an amount of less than 1 part by weight, the resistivity of the resin coat layer can not easily be lowered to the desired level, and also the toner tends to melt-adhere to the binder resin used in the resin coat layer of the developing sleeve. If it is in an amount of more than 100 parts by weight, the resin coat layer tends to have a low strength (wear resistance) especially when a fine powder having particle size on the order of submicrons is used.","In the present invention, a solid lubricant may be dispersed in the resin coat layer. Commonly known solid lubricants may be used. For example, the solid lubricant may include particles of graphite, molybdenum disulfide, boron nitride, mica, graphite fluoride, silver-niobium selenide, calcium chloride-graphite, talc, and fatty acid metal salts such as zinc stearate. In particular, graphite particles may particularly preferably be used because the conductivity of the resin coat layer is not damaged. The solid lubricant may preferably be added in an amount ranging from 1 to 100 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the binder resin. If it is in an amount of less than 1 part by weight, the melt adhesion of toner to the binder resin surface of the resin coat layer may less effectively be remedied. If on the other hand it is in an amount of more than 100 parts by weight, the resin coat layer tends to have a low strength (wear resistance) especially when a fine powder having particle size on the order of submicrons is used.","As these solid lubricants, those having a volume-average particle diameter of preferably from 0.5 to 4.0 \u03bcm may be used. Solid lubricants having a volume-average particle diameter of less than 0.5 \u03bcm are undesirable because it is difficult to attain sufficient lubricating properties. Those having a volume-average particle diameter of more than 4.0 \u03bcm are undesirable in view of uniform triboelectric charging of the toner and strength of the resin coat layer, because they may greatly affect the surface profile of the resin coat layer to tend to make its surface properties non-uniform.","In the present invention, in order to make the toner have much stabler chargeability, a charge control agent may optionally be used in combination with the graphitized particles by its addition to the resin coat layer.","As negative-charging charge control agents, organic metal salts, organic metal complexes or chelate compounds are effective, which may include, e.g., monoazo metal complexes, acetylacetone metal complexes, metal complexes or metal salts of aromatic hydroxycarboxylic acids or aromatic dicarboxylic acids. Besides, they may include aromatic mono- or polycarboxylic acids and metal salts thereof, anhydrides thereof or esters thereof, and phenol derivatives such as bisphenol. Any of these may be used alone or in combination of two or more types.","As positive-charging charge control agents, they may include Nigrosine and modified products of Nigrosine, modified with a fatty acid metal salt; quaternary ammonium salts such as tributylbenzylammonium 1-hydroxy-4-naphthosulfonate and tetrabutylammonium teterafluoroborate; phosphonium salts such as tributyl benzylphosphonium-1-hydroxy-4-naphthosulfonate and tetrabutylphosphonium tetrafluoroborate, and lake pigments of these; triphenylmethane dyes and lake pigments of these (lake-forming agents may include tungstophosphoric acid, molybdophosphoric acid, tungstomolybdophosphoric acid, tannic acid, lauric acid, gallic acid, ferricyanides and ferrocyanides); metal salts of higher fatty acids; diorganotin oxides such as dibutyltin oxide, dioctyltin oxide and dicyclohexyltin oxide; and diorganotin borates such as dibutyltin borate, dioctyltin borate and dicyclohexyltin borate.","In the present invention, as charge control agents used for the purposes of improving the chargeability of negatively chargeable toners and restraining the chargeability of positively chargeable toners, preferably usable are nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds as disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. H10-293454. As methods for controlling the chargeability of toners for the purposes of restraining the chargeability of negatively chargeable toners and improving the chargeability of positively chargeable toners, preferably usable are combinations of resins having a nitrogen-containing group with quaternary ammonium salt compounds as disclosed in Japanese Patent Applications Laid-Open No. H10-326040, No. H11-052711 and No. H11-249414.","In the present invention, spherical particles for forming unevenness on the resin coat layer surface (hereinafter \u201cunevenness formative particles\u201d) may also be used in combination with the graphitized particles.","Such unevenness formative particles may include, e.g., resin particles of vinyl polymers such as polymethyl methacrylate, polyethyl acrylate, polybutadiene, polyethylene, polypropylene and polystyrene, or vinyl copolymers; resin particles of benzoguanamine resins, phenol resins, polyamide resins, fluorine resins, silicone resins, epoxy resins and polyester resins; particles of oxides such as alumina, zinc oxide, silica, titanium oxide and tin oxide; carbon particles; and conductive particles such as conductive-treated resin particles. It is also possible to use in the form of particles an organic compound such as a charge control agent described later.","Of these unevenness formative particles, as the resin particles, spherical resin particles may preferably be used which have been produced by suspension polymerization or dispersion polymerization. Here, the \u201cspherical\u201d refers to particles having a length\/breadth ratio of from 1.0 to 1.5. It is preferable to use particles having a length\/breadth ratio of from 1.0 to 1.2. It is more preferable to use truly spherical particles. Spherical resin particles can provide a preferable surface roughness by its addition in a smaller quantity, and makes it easy to obtain a more uniform surface profile. Such spherical resin particles may include particles of acrylic resins such as polyacrylate and polymethacrylate, particles of polyamide resins such as nylon, particles of polyolefin resins such as polyethylene and polypropylene, silicone resin particles, phenol resin particles, polyurethane resin particles, styrene resin particles, and benzoguanamine particles. Resin particles obtained by pulverization may also be used after they have been subjected to physical spherical treatment.","Where the unevenness formative particles are spherical, the area of contact with the developer layer thickness control member with which the particles are brought into pressure contact is made smaller. Hence, such particles are more preferred because an increase in sleeve rotational torque due to frictional force can be restrained and toner adhesion can be lessened.","Such spherical resin particles may also be used after an inorganic fine powder has been made to adhere or cling to their surfaces. The inorganic fine powder may include fine powders of oxides such as SiO, SrTiO, CeO, CrO, AlO, ZnO, MgO and TiO; nitrides such as SiN; carbides such as SiC; sulfates such as CaSOand BaSO; and carbonates such as CaCO.","The inorganic fine powder may be used after it has been treated with a coupling agent. In order to improve its adherence to the binder resin, or in order to impart hydrophobicity to its particles, the coupling agent may preferably be used. Such a coupling agent may include a silane coupling agent, a titanium coupling agent and a zircoaluminate coupling agent. Stated more specifically, the silane coupling agent may include hexamethyldisilazane, trimethylsilane, trimethylchlorosilane, trimethylethoxysilane, dimethyldichlorosilane, methyltrichlorosilane, allyldimethylchlorosilane, allylphenyldichlorosilane, benzyldimethylchlorosilane, bromomethyldimethylchlorosilane, \u03b1-chloroethyltri-chlorosilane, \u03b2-chloroethyltrichlorosilane, chloromethyldimethylchlorosilane, triorganosilyl mercaptan, trimethylsilyl mercaptan, triorganosilyl acrylate, vinyldimethylacetoxysilane, dimethyldiethoxysilane, dimethyldimethoxysilane, diphenyldiethoxysilane, hexamethyldisiloxane, 1,3-divinyltetramethyldisiloxane, 1,3-diphenyltetramethyldisiloxane, and a dimethylpolysiloxane having 2 to 12 siloxane units per molecule and containing a hydroxyl group bonded to each silicon atom in its units positioned at the terminals.","Such treatment with the inorganic fine powder in respect to the surfaces of the spherical resin particles enables improvements of dispersibility in coating materials, uniformity of coated surfaces, stain resistance of the resin coat layer surface, charge-providing properties to the toner, wear resistance of the coat layer, and so forth.","In order to more improve the stain resistance and wear resistance of the resin coat layer surface, it is more preferable to provide the unevenness formative particles with conductivity. As conductivity-provided spherical particles, they may include spherical particles conductive-treated by coating the surfaces of particles of a metal oxide such as titanium oxide, niobium oxide, manganese oxide or lead oxide, or particles of a pigment such as barium sulfate, with a good conductive material such as tin oxide; spherical particles endowed with conductivity by doping an insulating metal oxide such as zinc oxide, copper oxide or iridium oxide with a metal having a different oxidation number; and also conductive spherical particles disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. H8-240981.","Such conductive spherical particles may preferably have a volume resistivity of 10\u03a9\u00b7cm or less, and more preferably from 10to 10\u03a9\u00b7cm. If the conductive spherical particles have a volume resistivity of more than 10\u03a9\u00b7cm, spherical particles laid bare to the surface of the resin coat layer as a result of wear may serve as nuclei around which toner contamination and melt-adhesion tend to occur and also make it difficult to achieve rapid and uniform charging. Making the spherical particles endowed with conductivity makes it not easy for the charge to be accumulated on the surfaces of the spherical particles, and enables reduction of toner adhesion and improvement of charge-providing properties to the toner.","The unevenness formative particles to be added may have a true density of 3 g\/cmor less. If the unevenness formative particles have a true density of more than 3 g\/cm, they tend to be dispersed in a non-uniform state when a coating material for forming the resin coat layer is prepared, and therefore the state of dispersion of the unevenness formative particles in the resin coat layer tends to be non-uniform. Hence, this may make it difficult to impart a uniform roughness to the surface of the resin coat layer, may make charge-providing properties and resin coat layer strength insufficient, and also may makes the stain resistance and wear resistance unable to be exhibited that are advantages the unevenness formative particles can bring.","The unevenness formative particles may include spherical carbon particles, spherical resin particles surface-treated with a conductive material, and spherical resin particles in which conductive particles have been dispersed.","The unevenness formative particles may preferably have a particle diameter of from 0.5 \u03bcm to 4.0 \u03bcm in volume-average particle diameter. If they have a volume-average particle diameter of less than 0.5 \u03bcm, it may be difficult to form uniform surface unevenness, and, in an attempt to make the surface roughness large, they must be added in an excessive quantity, so that the resin coat layer tends to be brittle to have a low wear resistance. If on the other hand they have a volume-average particle diameter of more than 4.0 \u03bcm, the unevenness formative particles may excessively protrude from the resin coat layer surface. Hence, the toner coat layer may have an excessively large thickness to make the toner low charged, or the surface roughness may become large with progress of many-sheet running, resulting in changes in the toner coat level.","In the present invention, the resin coat layer may be formed by coating on a substrate described later a coating material prepared by dispersing and mixing the respective components in a solvent. To disperse and mix the respective components, a known dispersion machine that utilizes beads may preferably be used, as exemplified by a sand mill, a paint shaker, a Daino mill or a pearl mill. The coating material may be coated by dipping, spraying or roll coating.","The resin coat layer may preferably have a layer thickness of 25 \u03bcm or less, more preferably 20 \u03bcm or less, and still more preferably from 4 \u03bcm to 20 \u03bcm. Such a thickness is preferable for obtaining a uniform layer thickness.","In the present invention, as the substrate of the developing sleeve having the resin coat layer, a metal, an alloy thereof or a compound thereof may preferably be used. In particular, one obtained by molding stainless steel, or aluminum or an alloy thereof, in a cylindrical shape may preferably be used. In particular, aluminum is preferred because it has a good workability. For example, in the case of a cylindrical substrate, aluminum is particularly preferred because the substrate can be free of run-out in the axial direction, and can be improved in roundness in the peripheral direction and mechanical precision. The surfaces of these substrates may further be treated by blasting, filing or cutting so as to have a stated surface roughness, or may also be treated by electrolytic plating or electroless plating.","In the present invention, as the substrate of the developing sleeve having the resin coat layer, it may also be one comprising a stainless-steel mandrel and provided on its periphery an elastic layer. As the elastic layer provided on the periphery of the mandrel, one obtained by molding a rubber such as silicone rubber or urethane rubber may preferably be used. Particularly preferred is one further incorporated with a conducting agent for controlling electrical resistance. The elastic layer may preferably be one having a stated hardness and a stated surface roughness in order to improve the adherence of the resin coat layer serving as the surface layer. An intermediate layer may further be provided on the surface of the elastic layer, and the resin coat layer may be formed on the intermediate layer. Also, the surface of the mandrel-shaped substrate may be treated by blasting, filing or cutting so as to have a stated surface roughness. The surface of the mandrel-shaped substrate may also be treated by electrolytic plating or electroless plating.","The developing apparatus making use of the developing sleeve having the resin coat layer is described below in detail.","The developing apparatus may include developing apparatus illustrated diagrammatically in . In those shown in , an electrostatic latent image bearing member (e.g., a photosensitive drum)  holding an electrostatic latent image formed by a known process is rotated in the direction of an arrow A. A developing sleeve  as the developer carrying member carries a one-component type developer  having a magnetic toner, held in a developer container , and is rotated in the direction of an arrow B. Thus, the developer  is transported to a developing zone D where the developing sleeve  and the photosensitive drum  face each other. As shown in , the developing sleeve  has a resin coat layer  formed on a metallic cylinder  serving as the substrate. Inside the developing sleeve , a magnet roller  is provided so that the developer  is magnetically attracted and held onto the developing sleeve . The magnet roller  is set stationary. The developing sleeve  and the magnet roller  stands non-contact.","The developer container  is provided therein with agitating blades  and , and  (), which agitates the developer  by their rotation in the direction of arrows C, a screw  which feeds the developer  into the developer container , and an agitation wall  which controls the quantity of the developer in the developer container .","The developer  gains triboelectric charges that enable development of the electrostatic latent image formed on the photosensitive drum , as a result of the friction between the particles themselves of the magnetic toner and between the toner particles and the resin coat layer  on the developing sleeve . In the example shown in , in order to control the layer thickness of the developer  transported to the developing zone D, an elastic control blade  is used as the developer layer thickness control member, which is formed of an elastic plate made of a material having a rubber elasticity, such as urethane rubber or silicone rubber, or a material having a metal elasticity, such as bronze or stainless steel. This elastic control blade  is brought into pressure contact with the developing sleeve  in a posture reverse to the latter's rotational direction, thus a thin layer of the developer  is formed on the developing sleeve . As the elastic control blade , in order to stably control the layer thickness and stably impart (negative) charge to the toner, it is preferable to use one having a structure wherein a polyamide elastomer (PAE) is stuck to the surface of a phosphor bronze plate, which can attain a stable pressure. The polyamide elastomer (PAE) may include, e.g., copolymers of polyamides with polyethers.","The developer layer thickness control member  may be in contact with the developing sleeve  at a pressure of from 5 to 50 N\/m as a linear pressure. This is preferable in view of stable control of the developer and preferable developer layer thickness.","If the developer layer-thickness control member  is in contact at a linear pressure of less than 5 N\/m, the developer control may be so weak as to cause fog or toner leak. If it is in contact at a linear pressure of more than 50 N\/m, the toner tends to be greatly damaged to tend to cause deterioration of toner or melt-adhesion of toner to the sleeve and the elastic control blade.","In the present invention, in place of the elastic control blade, as shown in  a magnetic control blade  made of a ferromagnetic metal may be set to extend downwards from the developer container  in such a way that it faces on the developing sleeve , leaving a gap width of about 50 to 500 \u03bcm from the surface of the developing sleeve  so that the magnetic line of force exerted from the pole N of the magnet roller  is converged to the magnetic control blade  to thereby form on the developing sleeve  a thin layer of the developer .","The thickness of the thin layer of the developer , thus formed on the developing sleeve , may preferably be much smaller than the minimum gap between the developing sleeve  and the photosensitive drum  in the developing zone D.","It is especially effective for the developing sleeve of the present invention to be set in a developing apparatus of the type the electrostatic latent image is developed through such a developer thin layer (e.g., a non-contact type developing apparatus). The developer carrying member of the present invention may also be applied in a developing apparatus of the type the thickness of the developer layer is larger than the minimum gap between the developing sleeve  and the photosensitive drum  in the developing zone D (i.e., a contact type developing apparatus).","In the developing apparatus shown in , an electrostatic latent image bearing member (e.g., a photosensitive drum)  holding an electrostatic latent image formed by a known process is rotated in the direction of an arrow A. A developing roller  as the developer carrying member carries a one-component type developer  formed of a non-magnetic toner, held in a developer container , and is rotated in the direction of an arrow B. Thus, the developer  is transported to a developing zone D where the developing roller  and the photosensitive drum  are kept in contact with each other. As shown in , the developing roller  has an elastic layer  and a surface layer  (the resin coat layer described above) which are formed on a metallic support  serving as the substrate.","The developer  gains triboelectric charges that enable development of the electrostatic latent image formed on the photosensitive drum , as a result of the friction between the particles themselves of the non-magnetic toner and between the toner particles and the surface layer (resin coat layer)  of the developing roller  surface. In the example shown in , in order to control the layer thickness of the developer  transported to the developing zone D, the same developer layer thickness control member  as that shown in  is used. Further, as shown in , a developer feed\/stripping roller  is used which is to feed the developer to the developing roller  surface and\/or to strip off the developer present on the developing roller  surface.","In the case when a developer feed\/stripping roller  formed of an elastic roller is used as the developer feed\/stripping roller  and when the surface is moved in the counter direction, the developer feed\/stripping roller  may preferably be rotated at a peripheral speed of from 20% to 120%, and more preferably from 30% to 100%, with respect to the peripheral speed of the developing roller  regarded as 100%.","If the developer feed\/stripping roller  is rotated at a peripheral speed of less than 20%, the developer may be fed insufficiently, so that follow-up performance for solid images may lower to cause ghost images. If it is rotated at a peripheral speed of more than 120%, the developer may be fed in a large quantity, so that the developer layer thickness may poorly be controlled or the charge quantity may be insufficient to cause fog. Moreover, the toner tends to be damaged to tend to cause fog or toner-melt adhesion due to deterioration of toner.","Where the developer feed\/stripping roller  is rotated in the same (regular) direction as the rotation of the developing roller  surface, the developer feed\/stripping roller  may preferably be rotated at a peripheral speed of from 100% to 300%, and more preferably from 101% to 200%, with respect to the peripheral speed of the developing roller , in view of the above toner feed quantity.","In view of stripping performance and feed performance, the developer feed\/stripping roller  may more preferably be rotated in the counter direction of the surface movement of the developing roller .","The developer feed\/stripping roller  may have a penetration to the developing roller , of from 0.5 mm to 2.5 mm. This is preferable in view of the feed performance and stripping performance of the developer.","If the developer feed\/stripping roller  has a penetration of less than 0.5 mm, ghost tends to occur because of insufficient stripping. If it has a penetration of more than 2.5 mm, the toner may greatly be damaged, so that the toner may deteriorate to tend to cause melt-adhesion or fog.","In the following description, an example of the non-contact developing assembly is described with reference to .","In order to cause to fly the one-component developer  having a magnetic toner, carried on the developing sleeve , a development bias voltage is applied to the developing sleeve  through a development bias power source  as a bias means. When a DC voltage is used as the development bias voltage, a voltage having a value intermediate between the potential at electrostatic latent image areas (the region where a toner image is formed upon attraction of the developer ) and the potential at back ground areas may preferably be applied to the developing sleeve .","In order to enhance the density of developed images or improve the gradation thereof, an alternating bias voltage may be applied to the developing sleeve  to form in the developing zone D a vibrating electric field whose direction reverses alternately. In such an instance, an alternating bias voltage formed by superimposing the above DC voltage component having a value intermediate between the potential at image areas to be developed and the potential at back ground areas may preferably be applied to the developing sleeve .","In the case of what is called regular development, where the toner is attracted to high-potential areas of an electrostatic latent image having high-potential areas and low-potential areas, a toner chargeable to a polarity reverse to the polarity of the electrostatic latent image is used. In the case of what is called reverse development, where the toner is attracted to low-potential areas of the electrostatic latent image having high-potential areas and low-potential areas, a toner chargeable to the same polarity as the polarity of the electrostatic latent image is used. The high-potential and low-potential are expressions in terms of the absolute values. In either case, the developer  is charged upon its friction with the developing sleeve .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0111","num":"0110"},"figref":"FIGS. 2 to 4","b":["303","309","310"]},"An example of the image forming apparatus of the present invention which employs any of the developing apparatus exemplified in  is described below with reference to .","The surface of a photosensitive drum  as the electrostatic latent image bearing member is negatively charged by a contact (roller) charging means  as a primary charging means, and exposed to laser light  to form on the photosensitive drum  a digital latent image by image scanning. Then, the digital latent image thus formed is developed by reversal development using a one-component developer  having a non-magnetic toner, held in a hopper , and by means of a developing apparatus having an elastic control blade  as the developer layer thickness control member and equipped with a developing sleeve  as a developer carrying member provided internally with a multiple-pole permanent magnet . As shown in , in a developing zone D, a conductive substrate of the photosensitive drum  is earthed, and an alternating bias, a pulse bias and\/or a DC bias is\/are applied to the developing sleeve  through a bias applying means . Then, a recording medium P such as paper is come transported to a transfer zone, where the recording medium P is electrostatically charged by a contact (roller) transfer means  serving as a transfer means, on its back surface (the surface opposite to the photosensitive drum side) through a voltage applying means , so that the developed image (toner image) kept formed on the surface of the photosensitive drum  is transferred onto the recording medium P through the contact transfer means . Next, the recording medium P separated from the photosensitive drum  is transported to a heat-and-pressure roller fixing assembly  serving as a fixing means, and the toner image on the recording medium P is fixing-treated by means of the fixing assembly .","The one-component developer  remaining on the photosensitive drum  after the step of transfer is removed by a cleaning means  having a cleaning blade . When the remaining one-component developer  is in a small quantity, the cleaning step may be omitted. After the cleaning, the surface of the photosensitive drum  is optionally subjected to charge elimination by erase exposure , and thus the above procedure again starting from the charging step using the contact (roller) charging means  as the primary charging means is repeated.","In a series of the above steps, the photosensitive drum (i.e., the latent image bearing member)  has a photosensitive layer and a conductive substrate, and is rotated in the direction of an arrow. In the developing zone D, the developing sleeve  formed of a non-magnetic cylinder, which is the developer carrying member, is rotated so as to move in the same direction as the surface movement of the photosensitive drum . Inside the developing sleeve , a multi-polar permanent magnet (magnet roll)  serving as a magnetic field generating means is provided in an unrotatable state. The one-component type developer  held in the developer container  is coated on the surface of the developing sleeve , and triboelectric charges (e.g., negative triboelectric charges) are imparted to the magnetic toner as a result of the friction between its toner particles and the surface of the developing sleeve  and between particles themselves of the magnetic toner. An elastic control blade  is further disposed so as to press the developing sleeve  elastically. Thus, the thickness of developer layer is controlled to be small (30 \u03bcm to 300 \u03bcm) and uniform so that a developer layer with a thickness smaller than the gap between the photosensitive drum  and the developing sleeve  in the developing zone is formed. The rotational speed of the developing sleeve  is controlled so that the peripheral speed of the developing sleeve  can be substantially equal or close to the peripheral speed of the photosensitive drum . In the developing zone D, an AC bias or a pulse bias may be applied as development bias voltage, to the developing sleeve  through a bias application means . This AC bias may have a frequency (f) of 200 to 4,000 Hz and a Vpp (peak-to-peak voltage) of 500 to 3,000 V.","When the developer (magnetic toner) is moved in the developing zone D, the magnetic toner moves to the electrostatic latent image side by the electrostatic force of the surface of the photosensitive drum  and the action of the development bias voltage such as AC bias or pulse bias.","In place of the elastic control blade , it is also possible to use a magnetic doctor blade made of a material such as iron. As the primary charging means, the charging roller  is used as the contact charging means in the above description. It may also be a contact charging means such as a charging blade or a charging brush. It may still also be a non-contact corona charging means. However, the contact charging means is preferred in view of less ozone caused by charging. As the transfer means, a contact charging means such as the transfer roller  is used in the above description. It may also be a non-contact corona transfer means. However, the contact transfer means is preferred in view of less ozone caused by charging.","The toner used in the developing apparatus of the present invention is described below. Toner is prepared from a fine powder obtained by melt-kneading a binder resin, a release agent, a charge control agent, a colorant and so forth, cooling the kneaded product to solidify, followed by pulverization, and classifying the pulverized product to make particle size distribution uniform.

Especially in the case of positive toners, those having been treated with the nitrogen-containing silane coupling agent are preferred. The nitrogen-containing silane coupling agent may include aminopropyltrimethoxysilane, aminopropyltriethoxysilane, dimethylaminopropyltrimethoxysilane, dimethylaminopropylmethyldiethoxysilane, diethylaminopropyltrimethoxysilane, dipropylaminopropyltrimethoxysilane, dibutylaminopropyltrimethoxysilane, monobutylaminopropyltrimethoxysilane, dioctylaminopropyltrimethoxysilane, dibutylaminopropyldimethoxysilane, dibutylaminopropylmonomethoxysilane, dimethylaminophenyltriethoxysilane, trimethoxylsilyl-\u03b3-propylphenylamine, trimethoxylsilyl-\u03b3-propylbenzylamine, trimethoxylsilyl-\u03b3-propylpiperidine, trimethoxylsilyl-\u03b3-propylmorpholine, and trimethoxylsilyl-\u03b3-propylimidazole.","The inorganic fine powder may be treated with the above silane coupling agent by a method including 1) spraying, 2) organic solvent treatment and 2) aqueous solution treatment. The treatment by spraying is commonly a method in which the inorganic fine powder is agitated and an aqueous solution or solvent solution of the coupling agent is sprayed on the powder being agitated, followed by drying at about 120\u00b0 C. to 130\u00b0 C. to remove the water or solvent. Also, the treatment by the organic solvent treatment is a method in which the coupling agent is dissolved in an organic solvent (e.g., alcohol, benzene, halogenated hydrocarbons) containing a hydrolysis catalyst together with a small quantity of water, and the inorganic fine powder is immersed in the resultant solution, followed by filtration or pressing to effect solid-liquid separation and then drying at about 120\u00b0 C. to 130\u00b0 C. The aqueous solution treatment is a method in which about 0.5% of the coupling agent is hydrolyzed in water or in a water-solvent mixture with a stated pH and the inorganic fine powder is immersed in the resultant hydrolyzate, similarly followed by solid-liquid separation and then drying.","As other organic treatment, a fine powder treated with a silicone oil may also be used. As a preferred silicone oil, a silicone oil having a viscosity at 25\u00b0 C. of from about 0.5 to 10,000 mm\/s, and preferably from 1 to 1,000 mm\/s, may be used. It may include, e.g., methylhydrogensilicone oil, dimethylsilicone oil, phenylmethylsilicone oil, chlorophenylmethylsilicone oil, alkyl-modified silicone oil, fatty-acid-modified silicone oil, polyoxyalkylene-modified silicone oil and fluorine-modified silicone oil. A silicone oil having a nitrogen atom in the side chain may also be used. Especially in the case of positive toners, it is preferable to use the silicone oil having a nitrogen atom in the side chain.","The treatment with silicone oil may be carried out in the following way. The inorganic fine powder is vigorously agitated with heating, and the above silicone oil or its solution is sprayed, or vaporized and then sprayed, or the inorganic fine powder is made into a slurry and the silicone oil or its solution is dropwise added thereto while stirring the slurry. Any of these silicone oils may be used alone or in the form of a mixture, or in combination, of two or more, or after their multiple treatment. This treatment may also be carried out in combination with treatment with the silane coupling agent.","The toner particles may be used after they have been subjected to spherical treatment or surface-smoothing treatment. This is preferable because its transfer performance is improved. Such a method may include a method in which, using an apparatus having an agitation element or blade and a liner or casing, toner particles are made to pass through a micro-gap between the blade and the liner, where the surfaces of toner particles are made smooth, or toner particles are made spherical, by a mechanical force; a method in which toner particles are suspended in hot water to make them spherical; and a method in which toner particles are exposed to a hot-air stream to make them spherical. Also, a method for making spherical toner particles directly may include a method in which a mixture composed chiefly of monomers for forming the binder resin of toner particles is suspended in an aqueous medium and the monomer is polymerized to prepare toner particles. A commonly available method is a method in which a polymerizable monomer, a colorant, a polymerization initiator, and optionally a cross-linking agent, a charge control agent, a release agent and other additives are uniformly dissolved or dispersed to prepare a monomer composition, and thereafter this monomer composition is dispersed by means of a suitable stirrer in an aqueous medium containing a dispersion stabilizer, to have a proper particle diameter, where polymerization reaction is further carried out to obtain toner particles having the desired particle diameter.","The toner may be blended with a carrier so as to be used as a two-component developer.","The carrier may include particles of iron type oxides such as hematite, magnetite, manganese-zinc type ferrite, nickel-zinc type ferrite, manganese-magnesium type ferrite, lithium type ferrite and copper-zinc type ferrite, mixtures of any of these, and resin powders containing a magnetic material. The carrier to be used may have an average particle diameter of from 20 \u03bcm to 200 \u03bcm, preferably 20 \u03bcm to 80 \u03bcm.","For such a carrier, any of the above particulate matter may directly be used as carrier particles. In order to control triboelectric charges of the toner or prevent toner-spent to the carrier, a carrier may also be used the particle surfaces of which have been coated with resin using a coating agent such as silicone resin, fluorine resin, acrylic resin or phenolic resin.","Methods for measuring physical properties concerning the present invention are described below.","\u2014Measuring Methods\u2014","(1) Degree of Graphitization P (002) of Graphitized Particles:","The degree of graphitization p (002) may be known by measuring the lattice spacing d (002) obtained from an X-ray diffraction spectrum of graphite, and is found by d (002)=3.440-0.086 (1\u2212p (002)).","The lattice spacing d (002) is determined by X-ray diffraction using CuK\u03b1 as an X-ray source, where CuK\u03b2 rays are kept removed using a nickel filter. High-purity silicon is used as the standard substance. The lattice spacing d (002) is calculated from peak positions of C (002) and Si (111) diffraction patterns. Chief measuring conditions are as follows:\n\n","(2) Measurement of Surface Roughness of Resin Coat Layer Surface:","The arithmetic-mean roughness Ra of the resin coat layer surface is measured according to JIS B 0601 \u201cSurface Roughness,\u201d using, e.g., SURFCORDER SE-3500, manufactured by Kosaka Laboratory, Ltd. It is measured under conditions of a cut-off of 0.8 mm, an evaluation length of 4 mm and a feed rate of 0.5 mm\/s, and is measured at (3 spots in axial direction)\u00d7(3 spots in peripheral direction)=9 spots each, where their average value is found.","(3) Measurement of Hardness of Resin Coat Layer Surface:","The hardness of the resin coat layer surface is a hardness value obtained from a surface physical-property test conducted using, e.g., FISCHER SCOPE H100V, manufactured by Fischer Instruments K.K. In the measurement, a quadrangular pyramidal diamond indenter whose angle between the opposite surfaces is defined to be 136\u00b0 is used, and this is indented on into the film under stepwise application of a measurement load, where the depth of indentation in the state the load is applied is electrically detected and read. The value of hardness is displayed in the percentage found when a test load is divided by the surface area of a dent produced by the test load. The universal hardness value HU is represented by the value of hardness at the maximum indentation depth of the indenter, as shown by the following expression (1):\n\nUniversal hardness value (N\/mm)\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nwhere K represents a constant (1\/26.43), F represents a test load (N), and h represents the maximum indentation depth (mm) of the indenter.\n","The value of hardness is measurable at a load very smaller than any other hardness measurement, and also hardness inclusive of elastic deformation and plastic deformation levels is obtainable also in regard to materials having elasticity and plasticity. Hence, this value is preferably used.","As the sample prepared for the measurement of hardness, a sample is used in which the resin coat layer has been formed on the surface of a substrate. In regard to the surface of the resin coat layer, a smoother sample brings more improvement in measurement precision. Accordingly, it is more preferable to make measurement after the sample has been subjected to smoothing by polishing. In the present invention, the surface of the resin coat layer is subjected to polishing with use of a #2000 polishing tape, and the surface roughness Ra is so set as to be 0.2 or less after the polishing.","The test load and the maximum indentation depth of the indenter may preferably be made to be in a range to such an extent that they are not affected by the surface roughness of the resin coat layer and also not affected by the underlying substrate. In the present invention, the surface roughness is measured so applying the test load that the maximum indentation depth of the indenter comes to 1 to 2 \u03bcm. Also, it is measured in an environment of a temperature of 23\u00b0 C. and a humidity of 50% RH, and is measured 100 times at different measurement spots, where the average value found from the resultant hardness distribution is represented by A, and its standard deviation by a.","(4) Measurement of Volume Resistivity of Resin Coat Layer:","A conductive resin coat layer is formed in a thickness of 7 to 20 \u03bcm on a PET sheet of 100 \u03bcm in thickness, and its volume resistivity is measured with, e.g., a resistivity meter LORESTAR AP or HIRESTAR AP (both manufactured by Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation), using a four-terminal probe.
