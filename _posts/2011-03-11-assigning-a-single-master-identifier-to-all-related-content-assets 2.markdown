{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This disclosure relates in general to the management of content in a distribution network, and more particularly to assigning a single master identifier to all related content assets.","Movies and titles may be received from video on-demand (VOD) content providers with different identifiers. When a movie is received, the metadata associated with the content is being recorded. The metadata may include a title, a list of crew involved with the creation of the content, the release year, etc. An identifier is also provided with the particular content.","Currently, service providers assign the same program that is available from different content providers with different Asset IDs when received. For example if the same title from the same provider, who is offering a title in both HD and SD format, is received two Asset IDs are assigned. If there is a change in the parental ratings, the database receives two Asset IDs for the title. Therefore, the database may contain information that causes confusion or is redundant. For example, a user may receive an episode of Friends on VOD HBO. The same episode may also be provided from ABC. The database will identify the program with the same episode information, the same title, etc. The only difference will be the metadata that identifies each copy of the episode will identify two different providers thereby causing the two episodes to be processed separately.","Users may additionally be searching for content that they have purchased. Such content may be obtained from a DVD that the user purchased or a movie that the user purchased online and downloaded. Consumers expect to be able to access content that they own from anywhere. If On Demand assets are offered on other platforms, then each asset will have different Access IDs so there is no unique way to tie these assets together.","Accordingly, it can be seen that there is a need to assign a single master identifier to all related content assets.","To overcome the limitations described above, and to overcome other limitations that will become apparent upon reading and understanding the present specification, embodiments for assigning a single master identifier to all related content assets are disclosed.","The above-described problems are solved by assigning the same unique Access ID to different versions of the same content. This solution helps with identifying programs to recommend to users, such as sequels to movies with the same title or different formats of the same movie.","In one embodiment, a system for assigning a single master identifier to all related content assets is provided. The system includes memory for storing content assets and metadata associated with each of the content assets, the metadata comprising a plurality of metadata field entries and a processor, coupled to the memory, the processor analyzing the metadata associated with each of the content assets to produce correlations between metadata field entries associated therewith, identifying related content assets by determining content assets having a predetermined correlation between metadata field entries and assigning a single, unique asset identifier to the related content assets.","In another embodiment, a method for identifying related content assets is provided. The method includes receiving content assets at an asset server, storing received content assets in memory, extracting metadata from the received content assets for analysis, analyzing the extracted metadata associated with each of the content assets to produce correlations between metadata field entries associated therewith, identifying related content assets by determining content assets having a predetermined correlation between metadata field entries and assigning a single, unique asset identifier to the related content assets.","In another embodiment, a computer readable medium is provided. The computer readable medium includes executable instructions which, when executed by a processor, identifies related content assets, by receiving content assets at an asset server, storing received content assets in memory, extracting metadata from the received content assets for analysis, analyzing the extracted metadata associated with each of the content assets to produce correlations between metadata field entries associated therewith, identifying related content assets by determining content assets having a predetermined correlation between metadata field entries and assigning a single, unique asset identifier to the related content assets.","These and various other advantages and features of novelty are pointed out with particularity in the claims annexed hereto and form a part hereof. However, for a better understanding of the disclosed embodiments, the advantages, and the objects obtained, reference should be made to the drawings which form a further part hereof, and to accompanying descriptive matter, in which there are illustrated and described specific examples of the disclosed embodiments.","Embodiments are directed to assigning a single master identifier to all related content assets. By assigning the same unique Access ID to different versions of the same content, programs may be identified reliably to recommend to users, such as sequels to movies with the same title or different formats of the same movie.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","115","120","115","110","115","105","140"]},"According to embodiments, the CATV system  is in the form of a distributed client-server computing system for providing video and data flow across the HFC network  between server-side services providers (e.g., cable television\/services providers) via a server-side head end  and a client-side customer via a client-side set-top box (STB)  functionally connected to a customer receiving device, such as the television set . As is understood by those skilled in the art, modem CATV systems  may provide a variety of services across the HFC network  including traditional digital and analog video programming, telephone services, high speed Internet access, video-on-demand, and information services. According to embodiments, CATV systems  assign a single master identifier to all related content assets. Storage , which may be a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) server, may be used to store the assets and data associated with the assets. However, those skilled in the art will recognize that embodiments are not meant to be limited to a LDAP server.","On the client side of the CATV system , digital and analog video programming and digital and analog data are provided to the customer television set  via the set-top box (STB) . Interactive television services that allow a customer to input data to the CATV system  likewise are provided by the STB . As illustrated in , the STB  is a multipurpose computing device having a computer processor, memory, and an input\/output mechanism. The input\/output mechanism receives input from server-side processes via the HFC network  and from customers via input devices such as the remote control device  and the keyboard . The remote control device  and the keyboard  may communicate with the STB  via a suitable communication transport such as the infrared connection . The remote control device  may include a biometric input module . The STB  also includes a video processor for processing and providing digital and analog video signaling to the television set  via a cable communication transport . A multi-channel tuner is provided for processing video and data to and from the STB  and the server-side head end system , described below.","The STB  also includes an operating system  for directing the functions of the STB  in conjunction with a variety of client applications . For example, if a client application  requires a news flash from a third-party news source to be displayed on the television , the operating system  may cause the graphics functionality and video processor of the STB , for example, to output the news flash to the television  at the direction of the client application  responsible for displaying news items. Those skilled in the art will recognize that a STB  is provided for illustration only and that other devices may be implemented instead, such as a DVR, Smart Encoder, Digital TV Converter, Media Center or other computing device.","Because a variety of different operating systems  may be utilized by a variety of different brands and types of set-top boxes, a middleware layer  is provided to allow a given software application to be executed by a variety of different operating systems. According to an embodiment, the middleware layer  may include a set of application programming interfaces (APIs) that are exposed to client applications  and operating systems  that allow the client applications to communicate with the operating systems through common data calls understood via the API set. As described below, a corresponding middleware layer is included on the server side of the CATV system  for facilitating communication between the server-side application server and the client-side STB . According to one embodiment; the middleware layer  of the server-side application server and the middleware layer  of the client-side STB  format data passed between the client side and server side according to the Extensible Markup Language (XML).","The set-top box  passes digital and analog video and data signaling to the television  via a one-way communication transport . The STB  may receive video and data from the server side of the CATV system  via the HFC network  through a video\/data downlink and data via a data downlink. The STB  may transmit data from the client side of the CATV system  to the server side of the CATV system  via the HFC network  via one data uplink. The video\/data downlink is an \u201cin band\u201d downlink that allows for digital and analog video and data signaling from the server side of the CATV system  through the HFC network  to the set-top box  for use by the STB  and for distribution to the television set .","The data downlink and the data uplink, illustrated in , between the HFC network  and the set-top box  comprise \u201cout of band\u201d data links. According to embodiments, data flow between the client-side set-top box  and the server-side application server  is typically passed through the \u201cout of band\u201d data links. Alternatively, an \u201cin band\u201d data carousel may be positioned in an \u201cin band\u201d channel into which a data feed may be processed from the server-side application server  through the HFC network  to the client-side STB . Operation of data transport between components of the CATV system , described with reference to , is well known to those skilled in the art.","Referring still to , the head end  of the CATV system  is positioned on the server side of the CATV system and includes hardware and software systems responsible for originating and managing content for distributing through the HFC network  to client-side STBs  for presentation to customers via televisions . As described above, a number of services may be provided by the CATV system , including digital and analog video programming, interactive television services, telephone services, video-on-demand services, targeted advertising, and provision of information content. Further, according to embodiments, CATV systems  assign a single master identifier to all related content assets.","The application server  is a general-purpose computing system operative to assemble and manage data sent to and received from the client-side set-top box  via the HFC network . As described above with reference to the set-top box , the application server  includes a middleware layer  for processing and preparing data from the head end of the CATV system  for receipt and use by the client-side set-top box . For example, the application server  via the middleware layer  may obtain data from third-party services  via the Internet  for transmitting to a customer through the HFC network  and the set-top box . For example, a weather report from a third-party weather service may be downloaded by the application server via the Internet . When the application server  receives the downloaded weather report, the middleware layer  may be utilized to format the weather report for receipt and use by the set-top box .","According to one embodiment, data obtained and managed by the middleware layer  of the application server  is formatted according to the Extensible Markup Language and is passed to the set-top box  through the HFC network  where the XML-formatted data may be utilized by a client application  in concert with the middleware layer , as described above. As should be appreciated by those skilled in the art, a variety of third-party services data, including news data, weather data, sports data and other information content may be obtained by the application server  via distributed computing environments such as the Internet  for provision to customers via the HFC network  and the set-top box .","According to embodiments, the application server  obtains customer support services data, including billing data, information on customer work order status, answers to frequently asked questions, services provider contact information, and the like from data services  for provision to the customer via an interactive television session. As illustrated in , the services provider data services  include a number of services operated by the services provider of the CATV system  which may include data on a given customer.","A billing system  may include information such as a customer's name, street address, business identification number, Social Security number, credit history, and information regarding services and products subscribed to by the customer. According to embodiments, the billing system  may also include billing data for services and products subscribed to by the customer for bill processing billing presentment and payment receipt.","A customer information database  may include general information about customers such as place of employment, business address, business telephone number, and demographic information such as age, gender, educational level, and the like. The customer information database  may also include information on pending work orders for services or products ordered by the customer. The customer information database  may also include general customer information such as answers to frequently asked customer questions and contact information for various service provider offices\/departments. As should be understood, this information may be stored in a variety of disparate databases operated by the cable services provider.","A cross-platform mobile application server  may contain information such as electronic mail addresses, high-speed Internet access subscription information, and electronic mail usage data. An authentication system  may include information such as secure user names and passwords utilized by customers for access to network services. As should be understood by those skilled in the art, the disparate data services systems , , ,  are illustrated as a collection of data services for purposes of example only. The example data services systems comprising the data services  may operate as separate data services systems, which communicate with a web services system (described below) along a number of different communication paths and according to a number of different communication protocols.","Referring still to , a web services system  is illustrated between the application server  and the data services . According to embodiments, the web services system  serves as a collection point for data requested from each of the disparate data services systems comprising the data services . According to embodiments, when the application server  requires customer services data from one or more of the data services , the application server  passes a data query to the web services system . The web services system formulates a data query to each of the available data services systems for obtaining any required data for a requesting customer as identified by a set-top box identification associated with the customer. The web services system  serves as an abstraction layer between the various data services systems and the application server . That is, the application server  is not required to communicate with the disparate data services systems, nor is the application server  required to understand the data structures or data types utilized by the disparate data services systems. The web services system  is operative to communicate with each of the disparate data services systems for obtaining necessary customer data. The customer data obtained by the web services system is assembled and is returned to the application server  for ultimate processing via the middleware layer , as described above.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","210","220","220"]},"A processor may scan the system on a continual basis, detecting any new updates that come into the system. If the SD version was provided first, the master ID creation algorithm (see ) would identify the SD version as a new title and a new Access ID would be created and associated with the SD title . Next, a HD version is provided to the server. The master ID creation algorithm identifies the first SD version and determines the HD version is merely a different format since everything associated with the SD version appears to be the same as the HD version. Thus, the HD version is associated with the same master ID created for the SD version . The same process would be carried out for the 3D version. All of the versions will be associated at the high level metadata perspective, i.e., the master Access ID. The metadata identifying the content as being a different version from the premium channel is just another bit of information that is added to a sub-set of the Access ID.","Accordingly, a common access ID is assigned for all of the related programs . Within the master Access ID field, a separate field  or sub-field will be provided to identify the particular \u201cProgram\u201d and associate the program with its particularity, e.g., it is a sequel, it is in 3D, it is in HD, or it is SD. This could be the Most Significant Byte(s) (MSB) to include this additional information. The master access ID field may consist of the Access ID, ratings, sequel, different formats of the same asset, and producing a newer version of the same asset. This metadata will be provided to mobile devices, PCs, etc. Thus, the \u201cProgram\u201d will be identified as the same content  but with a different format . Content formatted differently for different devices would be identifiable via the metadata and access IDs. If a customer searches for \u201cProgram\u201d or if the user wants to recommend \u201cProgram\u201d, now all of the available programs associated with \u201cProgram\u201d will be shown, e.g., \u201cProgram in SD\u201d, \u201cProgram in HD\u201d, and \u201cProgram in 3D.\u201d So when a recommendation engine is used for the customers and a customer watches \u201cProgram\u201d formatted for a mobile device, the \u201cProgram\u201d will have the same information\/metadata as if the customer watched the \u201cProgram\u201d on HD, SD, 3D, etc. The metadata will indicate where the \u201cProgram\u201d was watched, the title, and that it was formatted for mobile, TV, or other specific devices.","An asset may be accessed four or five different times over a period of a year and each may be from different providers. Using the access ID allows statistical correlation to be performed by a processor (see ) thereby enabling the service provider to extract pertinent data associated with the content asset. For example, the service provider may determine how many people access the content, how many times a program was viewed, break down the data into different sub-categories, e.g., how many times the content was viewed in HD, how many times the content was viewed in 3D, etc. In addition, the access ID allows the monitoring of how many times content was viewed regardless of what platform was used to view the content.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","390","350"]},"A single, unique asset identifier is assigned to the related content assets. If the same program already exists, i.e., the new asset is determined to have metadata having a predetermined correlation with metadata of existing content assets. In other words, the same Access ID would be used or associated with that particular program. If the program is not within the database and the program represents a new asset, then a new Access ID is assigned for the program. Thus, a series or a sequel will be associated together when shown to the user. Manual intervention might be required if there are errors in the metadata.","The first step is to receive the content assets and metadata from the content provider and extract the crucial information in the metadata . These include, but are not limited to: Title , Cast and crew  (directors, actors, actresses, etc), Genre , Release year , Movie Provider, and Description of the movie. Additional metadata fields which make the movie unique, such as formats of 3D, HD etc. are also extracted .","A continuous scan is performed to detect the receipt of new content assets. When a new content asset is received, a comparison is performed to match  the extracted metadata fields - by searching the Database  that includes all the titles that are currently airing or the data that was collected for previously stored content assets. If there is full match as determined by identifying a predetermined correlation in Title , Cast and crew , Genre , Release year , and part of Movie Provider; then the same Access ID that exists in the Database is assigned to the new movie . If there is no match because a predetermined correlation with metadata field entries of stored content assets was not found, a new Master Access ID is assigned to the movie .","If there is a partial match, assign the asset for human interaction to correct errors or to compare manually . There may be a partial match because the cast and the crew metadata do not result in a match because there might be an error in the spelling or the way the name has been typed. A manual intervention may be requested because the content is flagged as a partial match and verification by an operator may be performed to determine whether the content is actually a match. The operator will have the new title, the title from the matching algorithm, and the title that is in the database. Given an Access ID, the operator will be able to readily compare this information without requiring an extensive manual search. The flags can be used to identify the information with the new title plus the information that is stored in the database.","Once the Access ID is assigned  (match) or  (no match), additional information about the asset such as format, sequel, rating, is assigned to the Sub-asset ID. For example, if the rating is different, the new rating is assigned to the MSB of the master access ID to reflect the difference(s). Therefore, the user could see all the sequels associated with the title or all assets with the same title but with different ratings. The user could also see all the formats available to view for the same title.","In the future, the comparison algorithm could apply to match the poster art when available. This is an automated process where the same poster art item would be a match even if the format of the image is different.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIGS. 1-3","FIG. 4"],"b":"400"},"a content management system  for assigning a single master identifier to all related content assets includes a processor  and memory . Those skilled in the art will recognize that the content management system  may be implemented in a head end module, a subscriber receiving device, such as a set-top box, an interactive TV, a portable media device, etc., and other data\/content receiving devices. Embodiments may also be implemented in combination with other types of computer systems and program modules. Generally, program modules include routines, programs, components, data structures, and other types of structures that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. By way of example, computer readable media  can include computer storage media or other tangible media. Computer storage media  includes volatile and nonvolatile, removable and non-removable media implemented in any method or technology for storage of information , such as computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules or other data. Moreover, those skilled in the art will appreciate that embodiments may be practiced with other computer system configurations, including hand-held devices, multiprocessor systems, microprocessor-based or programmable consumer electronics, minicomputers, mainframe computers, and the like. Embodiments may also be practiced in distributed computing environments where tasks are performed by remote processing devices that are linked through a communications network.","Embodiments implemented on computer-readable media  may refer to a mass storage device, such as a hard disk or CD-ROM drive. However, it should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that tangible computer-readable media can be any available media that can be accessed or utilized by a processing device, e.g., server or communications network provider infrastructure.","By way of example, and not limitation, computer-readable media  may include, but is not limited to, RAM, ROM, EPROM, EEPROM, flash memory or other solid state memory technology, CD-ROM, digital versatile disks (\u201cDVD\u201d), or other optical storage, magnetic cassettes, magnetic tape, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other tangible medium which can be used to store the desired information and which can be accessed by a processing device.","As mentioned briefly above, a number of program modules and data files may be stored and arranged for controlling the operation of processing devices. Thus, one or more processing devices  may be configured to execute instructions that perform the operations of the embodiments described herein.","It should also be appreciated that various embodiments can be implemented (1) as a sequence of computer implemented acts or program modules running on a processing device and\/or (2) as interconnected machine logic circuits or circuit modules within the processing devices. The implementation is a matter of choice dependent on the performance requirements. Accordingly, logical operations including related algorithms can be referred to variously as operations, structural devices, acts or modules. It will be recognized by one skilled in the art that these operations, structural devices, acts and modules may be implemented in software, firmware, special purpose digital logic, and any combination thereof without deviating from the spirit and scope of the present embodiments as recited within the claims set forth herein.","Memory  thus may store the computer-executable instructions that, when executed by processor , cause the processor  to implement an Assign Master Access ID Module  according to an embodiment as described above with reference to . However, memory  may also be configured to provide the database  for storing metadata including ratings and other content data, programs, and other content, which is processed by processor .","The foregoing description of the embodiments has been presented for the purposes of illustration and description.
