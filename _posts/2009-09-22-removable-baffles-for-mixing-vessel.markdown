{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for Governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","The invention relates, in general, to mixing vessels, and, in particular, to mixing vessels with easily interchangeable baffles.","Mixing vessels may be used in a variety of commercial and industrial processes. A variety of materials may be mixed in a mixing vessel. Different materials and different processes may require different amounts of shear and flow patterns to properly mix the ingredients, maintain the ingredients in suspension, and circulate the ingredients within the vessel. The size, shape, location, orientation, and rotational speed of the mixing vessel impeller may be factors in producing specific flow patterns tailored for a particular product.","A mixing vessel without baffles may not produce enough shear or turbulence to mix the ingredients. Therefore, many mixing vessels may include fixed baffles that may influence the mixing action and flow patterns. The number, size, location and geometry of baffles may vary widely, generating both localized high shear between the baffle and impeller blades, and generating circulating currents that may promote the homogeneity and suspension of ingredients. A configuration of impeller and baffles that may be optimized to produce one product may be unsuitable for a different product.","The flow patterns and circulating currents may also be influenced by the shape of the vessel itself. Typically, a vessel having a concave bottom may produce better vertical dispersion because the liquid may be slung out radially from the impeller and may be gently turned upward when the liquid moves toward the vessel wall. Flat-bottomed mixing vessels may not do this function nearly as well, and may have very poor flow patterns. Acceptable flow patterns and methods of mixing a material may be discovered by adding and experimenting with various types of baffles.","In the past, new mixing vessels with optimized geometry were constructed for, and exclusively dedicated to, a specific process or product. As an alternative, existing plain mixing vessels that were, at first, completely unsuitable for a particular process, were retrofitted by adding permanently welded baffles. In such mixing vessels, it may be relatively easy and common practice to make small variations in the mixing action and fine tune it to slightly different processes by changing the impeller or its rotational speed. Changing the baffling may have a much larger effect, but it may be costly to construct a new mixing vessel each time one wishes to alter a baffle arrangement. It may also be costly to remove welded baffles and reweld new baffles in a mixing vessel.","In a manufacturing scenario where more than one product is made, for instance, the manufacturer may set up a single production line, and simply switch baffles in the mixing vessels. In a research and development scenario, the effect that each element of geometry has on the mixing process itself, or the effect that each element of geometry has on the quality of the product being produced, may be explored using many physical variations. Baffles that are easily removed and replaced in a mixing vessel may save time, money, and storage space (for multiple variations of mixing vessels), and simplify cleaning and repair of baffles. Thus, a need exists for mixing vessels having easily interchangeable baffles.","In some cases, such as laboratory bench top and glassware size vessels, a mixing vessel having the desired baffle arrangement may not be available commercially. Formulations and mixing procedures for products may be developed and tested in both small and medium scale laboratory mixers before transitioning to high rate production in full size mixing vessels. A manufacturing plant that uses 3000 gallon baffled mixers may have a laboratory where procedures are developed in quart or gallon sized mixers. Thus, there is a need to be able to adapt standard laboratory glassware mixing vessels, for instance, into scale models of larger mixing vessels, by adding baffle kits.","An aspect of the invention may be a mixing vessel including a container having a bottom. The bottom may include a removable plate fixed thereto. The removable plate may include at least one slot formed therein. A baffle may be inserted in at least one slot.","Another aspect of the invention may be a flexible baffle insert including a retaining band having inner and outer opposing surfaces, and a plurality of baffles extending inwardly from the inner surface of the retaining band. Each baffle may include first and second edges proximate the inner surface of the retaining band. The first proximate edge may form a support joint with the inner surface of the retaining band and the second proximate edge may be displaced inwardly from the first proximate edge.","A further aspect of the invention may be a mixing vessel including a container having a bottom and a generally circular side wall, and a flexible baffle insert disposed in the container.","Another aspect of the invention may be a method of making a flexible baffle insert. The method may include providing a thin, flexible material having a retaining band and a plurality of baffles, where the retaining band and the baffles are substantially coplanar. The related method may include bending the baffles along an edge such that the baffles are angled with respect to the retaining band.","The invention will be better understood, and further objects, features, and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the exemplary embodiments, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["10","10","10","12","14","18","16","15"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIGS. 3A and 3B","b":["20","20","26","20","22","20","42","20","26"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 2"],"b":["10","28","14","26","20","28","14"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIGS. 5A and 5B","b":["30","30","30","32","34","32","22","20","32","22","32","34"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIGS. 6A and 6B","FIG. 6B"],"b":["36","36","40","38","40","22","20","40","22","38","40"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 7A","FIG. 4"],"b":["42","42","43","44","43","46","28","14","42"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 7B","b":["24","47","48","49","47","48","46","43","42"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 7C","FIG. 4"],"b":["45","48","44","47","24","14"]},"For clarity, in , , and , the side walls  of container  are not shown.  is a perspective view of a container bottom  having a removable plate  with baffles  as shown in .  is a perspective view of a container bottom  having a removable plate  with baffles  as shown in .
