Improvements to such photovoltaic systems are continuously sought after. The present teachings address the foregoing concerns.","Introduction","Methods and apparatus related to photovoltaic power systems are provided. A device includes electrically conductive supports in electrical contact with one or more photovoltaic cells. The photovoltaic (PV) cells are secured with respect to the supports by a clamping force, soldering or other electrically conductive means.

Specifically,  is an isometric view of an assembled device .  is an isometric view of top and bottom sides of a photovoltaic cell of the device .  is an end elevation view of the device . The device  is illustrative and non-limiting in nature. Thus, other devices, apparatus and systems are contemplated by the present teachings. The device  is also referred to as a photovoltaic device  for purposes herein.","The device  includes a support . The support  is formed from an electrically conductive material such as metal. Non-limiting examples of such materials include aluminum, brass, copper, and so on. Each support  can also have one or more areas selectively plated using gold, and so on. The support  is also defined by a thermally conductive characteristic in accordance with the material from which it is formed. The support  is in the form of an elongated conduit having a rectangular cross-sectional shape. The support  thus defines an internal fluid passageway  through the length thereof. Other supports having other cross-sectional shapes can also be used. The support  is also referred to as a first support  or first metallic support  for purposes herein.","The device  includes a support . The support  is also formed from an electrically conductive material such as aluminum, brass, copper, and so on. Each support  can also have one or more areas selectively plated using gold, and so on. The support  is also defined by a thermally conductive characteristic accordingly. The support  is in the form of an elongated channel having a generally rectangular cross-section. The support  is further defined by an aperture (i.e., slot or \u201cwindow\u201d)  that extends along the length of the support . The support  is also referred to as a second support  or second metallic support  for purposes herein.","The device  also includes a plurality of photovoltaic (PV) cells . Each of the PV cells  is defined by a pair of top electrodes  of a first electrical polarity (e.g., positive). Each of the PV cells  is also defined by a bottom electrode  of a second electrical polarity (e.g., negative) opposite to the first polarity. Each of the PV cells  is configured to generate electrical energy in response to incident light. That is, each PV cell  directly converts incident photonic energy  into electrical energy. In one example, each PV cell  is defined by a gallium-arsenide (GaAs), two-junction type available from Emcore Corporation, Albuquerque, N. Mex., USA. Other PV cell types can also be used.","All of the PV cells  are held in place with respect to the supports  and  by way of a clamping force supplied by one or more jack screws . Each jack screw  is formed from an electrically non-conductive material such as, for non-limiting example, plastic, and so on. Each jack screw  is treadably received within a corresponding aperture or bore of the second support  and can be rotatably driven in to and out of force contact with the first support . In one example, each jack screw  is defined by an M2\u00d70.4 size, nylon screw with pan-head, available from McMaster-Carr, Santa. Fe Springs, Calif., USA. Other jack screw types can also be used.","Thus, each PV cell  is held in a removably fixed position within the device , having its electrodes  in electrical contact with (or coupled to) the metallic support  and its electrode  in electrical contact (or coupling) with the metallic support . The supports  and  therefore act as electrical buss-bars of respectively opposite polarities, the PV cells  being electrically coupled in parallel circuit relationship with one another.","The PV cells  are disposed within the device  so as to receive incident photonic energy (i.e., sunlight) through the aperture  of the second support . Additionally, it is noted that the first support  is disposed or received within the second support . The device  also includes respective isolators  that separate the first support  from the second support . The isolators  are formed from electrically non-conductive material such as plastic, phenolic, fiberglass, and so on. In one example, each isolator  is formed from a strip of zero-point-zero-one-five inch thick nylon sheet material, available from McMaster-Carr, Santa Fe Springs, Calif., USA.","In one example, each of the isolators  has a compliant characteristic so as to exert an expansion force against the respective portions of the supports  and  that it is in contact with. It is noted that the first support  does not make direct electrical contact with the second support  by virtue of the jack screw(s)  and the isolators .","Normal, illustrative operations involving the device  are as follows: several PV cells  are disposed in resting, electrically-conductive contact with the first support . Specifically, the PV cells  are arranged in end-to-end orientation along a lengthwise aspect of the first support , having their respective electrodes  in electrical contact therewith.","The second support  is then disposed about the first support  such that the PV cells  face outward through the aperture . Two respective isolators  are inserted or disposed on opposite sides of the first support  so as to separate it from the second support . The first support  is thus generally laterally centered within the second support .","One or more jack screws  are then manipulated (i.e., tightened) so as to drive the first support  toward the second support  in the direction of the aperture . The PV cells  are thus mechanically clamped between the first support  and the second support . The PV cells  are, also in electrical contact with the first and second supports  and , respectively. However, the first and second supports  and  are isolated against direct electrical contact with each other by virtue of the PV cells  and the jack screws  and the isolators .","Photonic energy  is then incident upon the PV cells . In turn, the PV cells generate electrical energy that is directly coupled to the first support  by way of the electrodes , and to the second support  by way of the electrodes , respectively. The electrical energy generated by the PV cells  can be coupled to an electrical load (e.g.,  of ) or used in some other suitable way.","Heat is transferred away from the PV cells  by way of a fluid flow \u201cF\u201d through the internal passageway  of the first support . Such a fluid flow can be, for non-limiting example, a forced flow of ambient air, cooled air, nitrogen gas, a liquid such as de-ionized water, and so on. Other suitable heat-transfer fluids (liquid or gas) can also be used. Thus, heat is rejected from the PV cells  by way of thermal conduction through the first support  and convective heat transfer to the fluid flow F.","In the illustrative example above, the PV cells  are held in place by clamping force between the respective supports  and . The PV cells  can be removed for repair or replacement by disassembling the first support  from the second support . Specifically; the jack screws  can be manipulated (loosened) so as to allow the first support  to be slidably removed from the second support , enabling individual or collective removal or replacement of the PV cells .","In another example, some or all of the PV cells  can be held in place by soldering the respective electrodes  to the first support . In yet another example, the PV cells  are held in place by soldering the respective electrodes  to the second support . Such soldering can be done using solder paste that is then reflowed by way of brief hot-bar contact with the corresponding support. Other suitable, electrically conductive bonding methods can also be used. The apparatus  includes a total of four PV cells  in the interest of clarity. However, it is to be understood that other devices and apparatus can include any suitable number of PV cells in accordance with the present teachings.","Table 1 below includes illustrative and non-limiting characteristics for a photovoltaic device .

In another example, the heat transfer apparatus  is defined by a source of pressurized nitrogen gas that flows through or around the first support . In yet another example, the heat transfer apparatus  is a heat sink thermally bonded to the first support  and configured to dissipate heat to the ambient environment by way of convention or radiation. Other forms of heat transfer apparatus  can also be used.","First Illustrative Method","Reference is now made to , which depicts a flow diagram of a method according to another example of the present teachings. The method of  includes particular steps and proceeds in a particular order of execution. However, it is to be understood that other respective methods including other steps, omitting one or more of the depicted steps, or proceeding in other orders of execution can also be used. Thus, the method of  is illustrative and non-limiting with respect to the present teachings. Reference is also made to  in the interest of understanding the method of .","At , one or more photovoltaic cells are secured in electrical coupling with first and second supports. For purposes of a present example, a number of PV cells  are placed in contact with a first support  and a second support  is disposed thereabout. A number of jack screws  then tightened so as to drive the first support  toward the second support . The PV cells  are now removably fixed (secured) in place and in electrical contact with the first and second supports  and .","At , art electrical load is coupled to the first and second supports. For purposes of the present example, the first and second supports  and  are electrically coupled to an electrical load . Thus, the first and second supports  and  are represented by the first and second supports  and , respectively.","At , solar energy is concentrated on the photovoltaic cells by way of primary and secondary optics. For purposes of the present example, a primary optic  concentrates solar energy (e.g., rays -) toward a secondary optic . The secondary optic  guides the concentrated solar energy onto the PV cells .","At , heat is transferred away from the photovoltaic cells by way of a fluid flow through the first support. Within the present example, a flow (e.g., F) of cooled air is forcibly driven or blown through an internal passageway  of the first support . This flow of chilled air is provided by a heat transfer apparatus  that is fluidly coupled to the first support . Heat is thus rejected from the PV cells  by way of the flow of chilled air.","At , electrical energy generated by the photovoltaic cells is provided to the electrical load. For purposes of the present example, the PV cells  generate an electrical potential (voltage) in response to the concentrated solar energy and a corresponding electrical current (amperage) is conveyed through the electrical load .","In general and without limitation, the present teachings contemplate various photovoltaic devices and systems and methods of their use. A device includes a first support and a second support, each formed from an electrically conductive material. At least a portion of the first support is received within a portion of the second support. That is, the first support is at least partially surrounded by the some portion of the second support.","One or more photovoltaic cells are secured in place with respect to the first and second conductive supports by way of a clamping force, soldering, conductive adhesive, or some combination of these. Positive and negative electrodes of the photovoltaic cells are electrically coupled to respective ones of the first and second supports such that the first and second supports serve as electrical buss-bars. The first and second supports are isolated against direct, electrical-shorting contact with one another by way of non-conductive isolators, jack screws, and the like.","A primary optic concentrates solar energy and such concentrated energy is guided onto the photovoltaic cells by way of secondary optic. The secondary optic can be defined by respective portions of the second or first support. Additionally, the first support functions to reject heat away from the photovoltaic cells by way of direct thermal conduction, or by thermal convection using a fluid flow through an internal passageway. Such a heat-rejecting fluid flow can be by way of forced ambient air flow, a chilled gas or liquid flow through a heat exchanger, by way of one or more heat sinks, and so on.","The present teachings, thus contemplate various solar energy systems that can be readily assembled and dissembled for servicing and repair, replacement or upgrade of photovoltaic cells, and so on.","In general, the foregoing, description is, intended to be illustrative and not restrictive.
