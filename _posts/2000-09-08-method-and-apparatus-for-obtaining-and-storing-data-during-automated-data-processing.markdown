title: Method and apparatus for obtaining and storing data during automated data processing
abstract: A number of items of data from a data source () can be processed and then supplied to a data destination (). The data may include image data, text data, numeric data or other types of data, or a combination of these types of data. The processing of the data is controlled by a project definition (), which includes a plurality of modules selected from a variety of available modules (Tables 1-4). The modules have input and output ports which are interrelated by binding information. The data source may be located in a remote system, and the data may be obtained from that data source in an automated manner through a computer network. Similarly, the data destination may be a remote system, and the processed data may be deposited in the data destination in an automated manner through a computer network.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This invention relates in general to automated processing of multiple items of data and, more particularly, to a method and apparatus for obtaining and\/or storing data during such automated data processing.","There are a variety of situations in which automated processing of a number of data items is desirable. One specific example of such an application is product catalogs. Product catalogs, whether in the form of a paper catalog or an Internet \u201cWeb\u201d site, frequently have numerous pictures which each depict a respective one of the various items that are available for sale. Many years ago, these pictures were prepared using optical negatives and photographs. Currently, however, the trend is to maintain and process these pictures in the form of computer files containing digital images.","A given paper or on-line catalog will usually include products from a variety of different manufacturers, and it is common for each manufacturer to provide its own digital images. There will typically be variation between the form of images provided by different manufacturers, for example in terms of characteristics such as the size, shape, resolution, tint, and so forth. It is even possible that the images from a single given manufacturer may have different forms. Accordingly, in order for the images throughout a catalog to have a generally similar appearance, the various images from various sources need to be processed to adjust characteristics such as size, shape, resolution, and\/or tint, so as to bring them into general conformity with each other.","A further consideration is that a manufacturer's images do not represent a static situation, because manufacturers are constantly adding new products with new images, discontinuing existing products and associated images, and providing updated images for existing products. Moreover, there may be other reasons for adjusting images. For example, with respect to a paper or on-line catalog intended for use during the Christmas season, there may be a desire to put a festive frame around each image, such as a frame of holly leaves and berries. Moreover, stylistic changes in the images are often desirable.","The traditional approach for carrying out these various types of image processing tasks has involved manual adjustments effected on an image-by-image basis, through use of image processing software requiring extensive operator interaction. However, this is extremely time consuming and expensive. Many organizations currently employ a number of graphic artists to do this work, at great expense.","A less common approach has been the preparation of a hard-coded software routine to process images, written in line-by-line source code. However, these routines are time-consuming and expensive to generate, are likely to include errors or \u201cbugs\u201d, and have little flexibility because they cannot be modified quickly and cheaply. Moreover, they can only be prepared and executed by a skilled programmer, rather than by a graphic artist who is skilled in image processing but has limited computer skills. It is difficult to find persons who have both artistic and computer skills, and they command large salaries.","Thus, while these traditional approaches have been generally adequate for their intended purposes, they have not been satisfactory in all respects. In this regard, to the extent that traditional approaches have involved automated processing of data, for example with hard-coded software routines, the routines typically expect the raw data to be present locally, and expect to store this data locally after it has been processed. If the data is not originally stored locally, or if the processed data needs to be delivered to a non-local location, human interaction is usually needed to effect the transfer of data from a remote system to the local system, or from the local system to the remote system.","This means that it is necessary for a person to remember to effect the transfer of the data, before and\/or after the automated processing of the data. Potential problems include the fact that the need to relocate the data may be inadvertently overlooked, as well as the fact that, even where the relocation is carried out, there is the potential for inadvertent human error, particularly where the person effecting the relocation does not have strong computer skills.","From the foregoing, it may be appreciated that a need has arisen for a method and apparatus for obtaining and\/or storing data used in automated data processing. According to the present invention, a method and apparatus are provided to address this need.","In particular, one form of the present invention involves providing a set of predetermined function definitions which are different, and preparing a project definition. The project definition includes: a plurality of function portions which each correspond to one of the function definitions in the set, and which each define at least one input port and at least one output port that are functionally related according to the corresponding function definition; a further portion which includes a source portion identifying a data source and defining an output port through which data from the data source can be produced, and which includes a destination portion identifying a data destination and defining an input port through which data can be supplied to the data destination, data from the data source being transferred to the source portion through a network; and binding information which includes binding portions that each associate a respective input port with one of the output ports.","Another form of the invention involves providing a set of predetermined function definitions which are different, and preparing a project definition. The project definition includes: a plurality of function portions which each correspond to one of the function definitions in the set, and which each define at least one input port and at least one output port that are functionally related according to the corresponding function definition; a further portion which includes a source portion identifying a data source and defining an output port through which data from the data source can be produced, and which includes a destination portion identifying a data destination and defining an input port through which data can be supplied to the data destination, data received through the input port of the destination portion being transferred from the destination portion to the data destination through a network; and binding information which includes binding portions that each associate a respective input port with one of the output ports.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00027","num":"00027"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","12","14","12","16","17","14","12","12","16","17","12"]},"The specific project definition  shown in  has been designed to be relatively simple for purposes of illustrating some basic concepts of the present invention, and basically will do two things. First, it will take each file obtained from the subdirectory , and evaluate the size of the file. With respect to size, it is important to remember the distinction between the size of an image, which is measured in pixels in each of the height and width directions, and the size of the file containing the image, which is typically measured in kilobytes (KB). In , files above a certain size are to be placed in the subdirectory  after processing, whereas all other files are to be placed in the subdirectory  after processing. Second, the project definition  will take the name of each file, and superimpose this name on top of the image in the file. For example, if a given file is named \u201celephant\u201d and contains an image of an elephant, the word \u201celephant\u201d will be superimposed on top of the image of the elephant.","The subdirectory  is not itself a part of the project definition . Subdirectory  may be local to the computer executing the project definition , may be disposed in another nearby computer accessible through a local area network (LAN), may be disposed in a remote computer many miles away which must be accessed through the Internet, or may be accessed in some other manner. The project definition  thus needs to know where to find the subdirectory  and the data therein. Accordingly, the project definition  includes a source module , which includes a definition of where to locate the subdirectory , and how to access it. The source module  successively obtains the files from the subdirectory . Each time the source module  receives a file from the subdirectory , it outputs the image data from the file through a first output port, as indicated diagrammatically at , and outputs a text string representing the file name through a second output port, as indicated diagrammatically at .","Lines of the type shown at  and  are referred to herein as binding lines. For convenience, image data is indicated by a wide double-line binding line, as shown in , whereas other types of data are indicated by a thin single-line binding line, as shown at . Alternatively, different types of binding lines could be distinguished in some other manner, for example by presenting them in different colors. Where an input port and an output port are associated with each other by a binding line, they are said to be bound to each other.","In the embodiments disclosed herein, an image or other data element obtained from a data source by a project definition is processed to completion by the project definition before the next successive image or data item from that data source is provided to the project definition. However, it will be recognized that it would alternatively be possible for a project definition to simultaneously have several successive images or data elements at various levels of processing, for example through the use of appropriate pipelining techniques. Conceptually, one way to view the project definition  of  is that execution proceeds on a module-by-module basis through the project definition along the double-line image data binding lines, from the source module  to the branch module , and then to either the action module  followed by the destination module , or alternatively to the action module  followed by the destination module . Another way to view the project definition  is that each of the modules is ready at all times to carry out its respective function, and does so as soon as all data needed to carry out that function arrives at the input port(s) of that module.","Image data that is output at  by the source module  flows to an input port of a branch module . The branch module  checks the size of the file associated with each image that arrives at its input port. If the file size for a given image is above a predetermined size, then the branch module  outputs the image data at  through a first output port. Otherwise, it outputs the image data at  through a second output port. The image data at  flows to an input port of an action module , whereas the image data at  flows to an input port of an action module .","For the sake of simplicity, the action modules  and  in the example of  have identical functions. More specifically, each has a further input port which receives the text string represented by binding line . As mentioned above, this text string contains the name of the file associated with the image data. The action modules  and  each have the capability to take the text string and superimpose it on the associated image data, and then output the result at  or  through an output port. The data at  flows to an input port of a destination module , and data at  flows to an input port of a destination module . Again, for simplicity, destination modules  and  are functionally identical.","In this regard, and as was the case with the subdirectory , the subdirectories  and  may each be local or remote, and may be accessed in different ways. Further, one or both of the subdirectories  and  may be located in proximity to the subdirectory , or may be remote from the subdirectory . Consequently, since the subdirectories  and  are not part of the project definition , the project definition  needs to know where to find them and how to access them, so that it knows where to deposit processed data. Accordingly, the destination modules  and  each include a definition of where to find the associated subdirectory  or , and how to access it. Thus, when the project definition  has finished processing all of the files from the subdirectory , the subdirectory  will contain a processed version of the files which are larger than a specified size, and the subdirectory  will contain a processed version of the remaining files. Further, each of the files in subdirectories  and  will contain an image which has the associated file name superimposed on it.","A brief comment regarding the use of the terms \u201cprocess\u201d and \u201csub-process\u201d will help to avoid confusion. A project definition of the general type shown at  in  may include two or more mutually exclusive sets of modules, which are each referred to as a process. In the particular example of , for the sake of simplicity, the project definition  includes only one process, which contains all of the modules , , -, and -. This process has two portions, which are respectively disposed above and below the broken line  in FIG. .","The modules , ,  and  which are above the broken line  are referred to herein as a main process, and the modules  and  which are below the broken line  are referred to as a sub-process. Technically, the main process and the sub-process are each a respective sub-process of the overall process. However, the first sub-process in every process is mandatory, and is always the starting point for execution of the process, and thus it is referred to as the main \u201cprocess\u201d rather than as the main \u201csub-process\u201d, even though it is actually a sub-process of the overall process. The presence of one or more additional sub-processes is entirely optional, and execution may or may not be transferred to each, depending upon factors such as whether branch modules are present and the particular data which is being processed. Consequently, they are referred to as sub-processes. An input or output port of a given module can be bound to ports of other modules within any of the sub-processes of the same process, but cannot be directly bound to ports of modules in other processes of the same project definition.","Where a branch module in a main process is capable of routing data to a sub-process, the data is always transferred to the first module in that sub-process, rather than to an intermediate module partway along the sub-process. The same is true where a branch module in a sub-process is capable of transferring data to a different sub-process. A further characteristic in the disclosed embodiments is that branch modules are allowed to route data to a later sub-process, but never to an earlier sub-process or the main process. Moreover, while one output port of a branch module can route data to the next successive module in the current sub-process (which may be the main process), the other output port is not permitted to route data to a module in the current sub-process, but must route data to a different sub-process. However, it will be recognized that an alternative embodiment could accommodate branch modules having the capability to route data to an earlier sub-process (which may be the main process), to a module partway along a different sub-process (which may be the main process), or to two modules which are both within the current sub-process. In fact, the alternative embodiment need not conceptually organize modules of an overall process into groups treated as respective sub-processes.","As discussed above, the branch module  will route each image either at  to the action module  or at  to the action module . If the data is routed to action module , then action module  and destination module  operate on the image data, while action module  and destination module  remain idle. Alternatively, if an image were instead to be routed at  to the action module , then action module  and destination module  would operate on the image data, while action module  and destination module  remained idle. Thus, in the example of , the branch module  determines whether processing of each image will be carried out by continuing along the main process, namely in action module  and destination module , or will be carried out in the sub-process, namely in action module  and destination module .","The project definition  in  is a simple example, but has been configured to show at least one example of each of the four types of modules that are recognized in the disclosed embodiments of the present invention. In other words, the disclosed embodiments of the present invention recognize source modules, one example of which appears at , branch modules, one example of which appears at , action modules, two examples of which appear at  and , and destination modules, two examples of which appear at  and . As reflected by the brackets along the bottom of , branch modules and action modules are sometimes referred to collectively herein as function modules. Source modules deal with the question of where to find the data to be processed, branch modules deal with the question of which data should and should not be processed in a specified manner, action modules deal with the question of what processing should be performed on the data, and destination modules deal with the question of where to put the processed data.","In order to put the present invention into perspective, it is helpful to understand one possible application for a project definition of the type shown at  in FIG. . Product catalogs, whether in the form of a paper catalog or an Internet \u201cWeb\u201d site, frequently have numerous pictures each depicting a respective one of the various items that are available for sale. Many years ago, these pictures were prepared using optical negatives and photographs. Currently, however, the trend is to maintain and process these pictures in the form of computer files containing digital images.","A given paper or on-line catalog will usually include products from a variety of different manufacturers, and it is common for each manufacturer to provide its own digital images. There will typically be variation between the form of images provided by different manufacturers, for example in terms of characteristics such as the size, shape, resolution, tint, and so forth. It is even possible that the images from a given manufacturer may have different forms. Accordingly, in order for the images throughout a catalog to have a generally similar appearance, the various images from various sources need to be processed to adjust characteristics such as size, shape, resolution, and\/or tint, so as to bring them into general conformity with each other. A further consideration is that a manufacturer's images do not represent a static situation, because manufacturers are constantly adding new products with new images, discontinuing existing products and their images, and providing updated images for existing products. Moreover, there may be other reasons for adjusting images. For example, with respect to a paper or on-line catalog intended for use during the Christmas season, there may be a desire to put a festive frame around each image, such as a frame of holly leaves and berries. Moreover, stylistic changes in the images are often desirable.","The traditional approach for carrying out these various types of image processing tasks has involved manual adjustments effected on an image-by-image basis, through use of image processing software requiring extensive operator interaction. However, this is extremely time consuming and expensive. Many organizations employ a number of graphic artists to do this work, at great expense.","A less common approach has been preparation of a hard-coded software routine to process images, written in line-by-line source code. However, these routines are time-consuming and expensive to generate, are likely to include errors or \u201cbugs\u201d, and have little flexibility because they cannot be modified quickly and cheaply. Moreover, they can only be prepared and executed by a skilled programmer, rather than by a graphic artist who is skilled in image processing but has limited computer skills. It is difficult to find persons who have both artistic and computer skills, and they command large salaries.","In contrast to these known approaches, a project definition of the type shown at  in  provides the capability to automate image processing so that a large number of images can be automatically and rapidly processed in a defined manner, and at far less expense than would be involved with the traditional and common approach of manual processing. Further, and as described in more detail later, the present invention provides a simple and user-friendly approach for creating and modifying project definitions of the type shown at  in , thereby permitting graphic artists who have limited computer skills to easily and accurately create a project definition while substantially avoiding the likelihood of bugs, with far less overall time and expense than is involved with the known approaches discussed above. The advantages of the present invention over the known approaches will become even more apparent as the present invention is discussed in greater detail below. While the foregoing example of catalog preparation focused on processing of image data, and while the disclosed embodiments involve primarily the processing of image data, the present invention is also advantageous for applications which involve processing of other types of data.","The foregoing discussion of  described one specific example of each of the source, branch, action and destination categories of modules. The present invention actually recognizes several types of modules in each category. More specifically, TABLE 1 describes several different types of source modules, TABLE 2 describes several different types of branch modules, TABLE 3 describes several different types of action modules, and TABLE 4 describes several different types of destination modules. Some of the module types set forth in TABLES 1-4 could be omitted, or additional module types could be included, without departing from the present invention. The module types set forth in TABLES 1-4 are referred to herein as standard module types. As discussed later, the present invention also provides for the creation of custom module types, for example through modification of one of the standard module types set forth in TABLEs 1-4. The resulting custom module type can either be substituted for the standard module type from which it was derived, using the same name, or can be used to supplement the standard module types, using a unique new name.","A few comments are appropriate regarding TABLEs 1-4. First, the present invention permits the use of virtual paths, where a table is provided to associate each virtual path with an actual path. Where a project definition uses a virtual path term, each computer on which that project definition may be executed would include a respective table entry to associate that virtual path with a respective actual path. Thus, the project definition can be executed without change on each such computer, but will use a different actual path on each computer wherever the virtual path term appears, without any need to actually modify the path information within the project definition itself.","A further consideration is that, in the disclosed embodiments, project definitions recognize various types of data, including image data, numeric data in a floating point or \u201cfloat\u201d format, and string data in the form of a series of text characters. In the discussion which follows, references to data types are typically preceded by the prefix \u201cem\u201d, such as \u201cemImage\u201d, \u201cemFloat\u201d, or \u201cemString\u201d. This is an arbitrary prefix, which has been used to facilitate implementation of the disclosed embodiments. For example, if data is received from an external source with an indication that it includes data of a type \u201cemFloat\u201d, it can be assumed that it conforms to the appropriate format. In contrast, if the data type is merely indicated to be \u201cfloat\u201d, it would be necessary to evaluate the associated data in an attempt to determine which of various formats for floating point data it conforms to, but even then it may not be possible to tell.","A feature of the present invention is that many of the module definitions in TABLEs 2 through 4 have input ports configured so that the input port will accept data in various formats and, if that data is not in the format preferred by that input port, the input port will automatically convert the data to its preferred format. This feature is referred to as data matching. For example, if a number in a floating point format is supplied to an input port which expects data in a string format, the floating point value will be converted to a text string which represents the number. Input ports which have this capability are identified in TABLES 1-4 as having a data type of \u201cemVariant\u201d. This does not mean that actual data can be formatted in the \u201cemVariant\u201d format. Instead, \u201cemVariant\u201d refers only to the capability of the input port to be bound to an output port that produces data conforming to other valid data types, such as \u201cemFloat\u201d or \u201cemString\u201d.","With respect to image data, it should be understood that data for a given image may include two or more objects and\/or layers. For example, an image may have two layers which are each an object. Similarly, if a mask is created for an image, the mask will be added to the image data in the form of a separate layer. Also, if text is superimposed onto an image, for example as discussed above in association with the action modules - in , the text will be added as an object, separate from other pre-existing objects of the image data. All the objects associated with a given image can be combined into a single object, through use of a \u201cFlatten Image\u201d definition which is set forth in TABLE 3.","In general, the definitions of source, branching, action and destination modules in TABLEs 1-4 are believed to be self-explanatory. However, there is one definition as to which a supplementary comment may be helpful. In this regard, the \u201cDatabase Access\u201d definition in TABLE 1 is a source module which obtains data in a manner that includes accessing a database. The database will include a table that has a plurality of rows called records, which each include a plurality of columns called fields. If the data being retrieved is string data, it may be retrieved directly from one of the fields in the table of the database. On the other hand, if the data being retrieved includes image data, the image data will typically be stored separately from the database, for example within files in a subdirectory, and one field in the table must contain a string with a complete path to the image data.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-d0e3920","num":"00002"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"SOURCE DEFIFINITIONS"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":"DATABASE ACCESS"}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"196pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Uses a database table or query to identify data to"]},{"entry":[{},"process.

Alternatively, however, within the scope of the present invention, these module types may each be visually represented by a respective icon. For example,  show icons respectively representing a source module, a branch module, an action module, and a destination module. The particular icons shown in  are exemplary icons used in the disclosed embodiments, and it will be recognized that a variety of other icons could alternatively be used.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00052","num":"00052"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["71","71","72","73","74","77","78","79","71"]},"In the project definition , the source module  is a Database Access module. This particular Database Access module obtains image data by effecting a predefined query to a table in a database, and by obtaining from respective fields in each record of the table a first string which defines the path to the actual location of a file containing a respective image, and a second string which represents a corresponding price. The Database Access module  then uses each first string to retrieve the corresponding image, which is output at , while outputting at  for each image the corresponding second string which represents a price. Thus, the module  successively outputs a number of images and associated prices.","The action module  is a Fill module, which adds color to an active object of the image, and then outputs at  the modified image data. The action module  is a Text Stamper module, which superimposes onto the image data received at  the text string received at . As noted above, this text string represents a price. The text will be added as a new and further object in the image data, which thereafter becomes the active object.","The project definition  of  can be represented visually in other ways. For example,  is a diagrammatic view showing the same project definition , but with a different visual appearance. In , there are three pipe sections - arranged end-to-end, so as to collectively give the appearance of a pipeline through which image data and\/or other data can flow. The pipe section  represents the Database Access module, the pipe section  represents the Fill module, and the pipe section  represents the Text Stamper module. With respect to the binding lines - in , which represent image data, there are no corresponding binding lines in , because the end-to-end relationship of the pipe sections is representative of the flow of image data from module to module. With respect to the binding line  of , which represents text string data, it has been arbitrarily omitted in , in order to emphasize that this type of binding line can optionally be included or excluded from a view such as that shown in FIG. . Where the binding line is excluded, the text string data may be considered to be flowing through the pipeline with the image data. The modules - of  each have in the middle thereof an icon which is different from the icons shown in ,  and , in order to make the point that the invention permits the use of various different icons.","One feature of the present invention is that each project definition, such as those shown at  and  in , is stored in a form which is expressed in a public communication protocol. The public communication protocol used in the disclosed embodiments is the extensible Markup Language (XML) protocol, which is well known in the industry. However, some other public communication protocol could alternatively be used. Referring to TABLE 5, the right column shows how the project definition  of  would be expressed in the XML protocol, according to the disclosed embodiments of the invention. For convenience, various levels of indentation have been provided in order to make the XML information more readable, but the indentation is not intended to suggest that the actual XML file includes characters to effect such indentation. The line numbers presented in the left column of TABLE 5 are not part of the XML expression of the project definition, but instead have been added to sequentially number the lines of the XML definition, in order to facilitate an explanation of the XML information, which is set forth below. For readability and convenience, some single lines of the XML file are shown as two or more lines in TABLE 5, and the line numbers added in the left column help show where this has occurred. Much of TABLE 5 is believed to be generally self-explanatory. Accordingly, the following discussion does not address every line in TABLE 5, but instead offers comments regarding only selected lines, as appropriate.","In this regard, line  shows that the project definition  has been arbitrarily given the name \u201cProject Name\u201d. Line  refers to a group name, but the concept of groups has been included for a future purpose which is not relevant to an understanding of the present invention, and groups are therefore not discussed here.","Line  indicates that the process name has arbitrarily been set to be \u201cFirst Process\u201d. In an XML definition of the type shown in , one process is defined first in its entirety, and then any other processes are each defined in their entirety, in a sequence. Within each process, the sub-processes are defined in sequence, with the main process being defined first in its entirety, after which the sub-processes (if any) are each being defined in their entirety, in sequence. In the simple project definition  shown in , of course, the project definition includes only one process, which in turn includes only one sub-process, namely the main process.","Line  of TABLE 5 identifies the beginning of a module list, which is a sequential listing of all modules in the main process portion of the process. As shown in , the main process of the project definition  has only the three modules -. The Database Access module  is defined in lines - of TABLE 5, the Fill module  is defined in lines - of TABLE 5, and the Text Stamper module  is defined in lines - of TABLE 5. Line  identifies the end of the modules for the main process. Line  is a heading which identifies where other sub-processes would be defined, if this process included any sub-processes other than the main process. Line  identifies the end of the first process. Lines - are headers which identify where one or more other processes of the project definition would be defined, if the project definition included more than one process. Lines - of TABLE 5 identify the end of the project definition.","Turning in more detail to lines - of TABLE 5, which define the Database Access module , line  includes an \u201cId\u201d of \u201ccom.image2web.databaseaccess\u201d which, in the disclosed embodiments, is an internal code identifying a segment of object code that implements the functionality of the Database Access module. The next portion of line  refers to an \u201cInstance\u201d, which in this example is set to the numeral \u201c1\u201d. This indicates that this is the first occurrence of the Database Access type of module in the project definition . If the project definition  included two or more Database Access modules, they would be respectively identified by successive integer instance numbers, corresponding to the order in which they appear in the XML file.","Lines - in TABLE 5 identify the database which should be accessed in order to retrieve image data, which in this case is a database named \u201cphotography\u201d. As noted in the explanation in TABLE 1 of the Database Access definition, the connection for this database must already exist and be defined as an Open DataBase Connectivity (ODBC) connection. This permits the Database Access module to easily interact with pre-existing databases through the use of public communication protocols, without any need to make any change to the databases. In the specific example of TABLE 5, the word \u201cphotography\u201d in line  provides a unique link to an existing ODBC connection, which in turn provides the link to and query for the specified database. Lines - of TABLE 5 define the particular table within the database which is to be accessed. In this particular example, the \u201cphotography\u201d database has several tables which are each named after a respective photographer, and that each relate to photographs taken by that particular photographer. Each table has a name which corresponds to the name of the associated photographer, which in this example is \u201cRobert Shutterbug\u201d. Lines - and lines - of TABLE 5 each define a respective field within the indicated table, the contents of which are to be obtained by and output from the Database Access module .","Lines - of TABLE 5 define the various output ports of the Database Access module . In particular, line  defines an output port for the image data, which is associated with the binding line  in FIG. . Line  in TABLE 5 defines an output port for a string which represents a price, and which is associated with binding line  in FIG. . Line  defines an output port for the filename of the image, but this output port is not used in FIG. .","Turning to the Fill module , line  in TABLE 5 defines an input port for image data, and includes a term \u201cBoundTo\u201d, which effectively defines the binding line  of , by identifying the output port of the module  to which the input port of the module  is bound.","Turning to the Text Stamper module  of , its definition in TABLE 5 appears at lines -. Within this definition, lines - define a number of parameters, which are collectively referred to herein as control information, and which may be specified by a user in order to define the particular operational characteristics which this particular instance of the Text Stamper module is to have. For example, to the extent that the Text Stamper module  is superimposing onto an image some text which represents a price, the parameters define characteristics of that text, such as its location, font, size, color, and so forth. Line  of TABLE 5 defines the input port of the text stamper module at which it receives the image data, and includes a \u201cBoundTo\u201d term which defines its association with an output port of the Fill module . In other words, the \u201cBoundTo\u201d term defines the binding line  of FIG. . Similarly, line  of TABLE 5 defines for the Text Stamper module  an input port for text, which in this case represents a price. Line  also includes a \u201cBoundTo\u201d term which defines the association of this input port with an output port of the data access module , or in other words the binding line .",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-d0e16510","num":"00002"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00005","num":"00005"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE

project definitions discussed above in association with FIGS.  and - are relatively simple.  is a diagrammatic view of a further project definition , which is more sophisticated. It includes a single process which is shown in its entirety in , and which includes three sub-processes -, namely a main process , and two further sub-processes  and . It also includes a feature which has not previously been discussed, which is a global portion  having a plurality of global ports -.","The ports - of the global portion  can be accessed by modules within the main process  or by modules within either of the sub-processes -. The ports - can each act as an input port and\/or an output port, depending on the particular operational configuration. More specifically, the ports - can each act as a form of register or memory location, in which one module can store information, and from which another module can later read it. The data in the port can thus change dynamically during project execution. The port  in  is configured to operate in this manner, and thus acts as both an input port and an output port. Further, the ports - can each be initialized to a predetermined value. If no module changes the initial value stored in that port, then that initial value serves as a form of data constant which does not change, and which can be accessed by any module throughout execution of the project definition. In , the port  is configured to act in this manner, and thus acts as an output port. In more detail, the port  is initialized to a string value which is superimposed onto images, as explained later.","If, in addition to the process defined by the main process  and the sub-processes -, the project definition  included an additional process, then each process would have its own global portion . The ports of each global portion  would be global to the associated process, but not the other process. In addition to the two global portions , a further global portion would appear in  adjacent the global portion . The ports of the further global portion would be global to both processes, or in other words the entire project definition. The ports of the further global portion could be referred to as project level ports, and the ports of each of the global portions  could be referred to as process level ports.","The various types of modules which make up the project definition  of  are each described in TABLES 1-4. However, for purposes of clarity and completeness, each is also briefly discussed below. More specifically, the main process  includes a Database Access module , which obtains and outputs a plurality of successive images from a not-illustrated database, in a manner similar to that discussed above in association with the Database Access module  of FIG. . These images are supplied at  to an Image Info module .","The Image Info module  does not change the image data, but does output certain information about the image data, including the height of the image at  and the width of the image at . The height and width are each output in the form of a string representation of a numeric value which is the number of pixels in the height or width. The height is supplied at  to the port  of the global portion , and is saved there for later use. The width is output at . The binding line  is a special type of binding line known as a conditional binding, which is explained later. The module  outputs the unchanged image data at , where it flows to a Send Email module .","The module  does not change the image data, but sends an email (electronic mail message) in response to the occurrence of a predefined condition, where the email is a predefined text message that is sent to a predefined email address. In the Send Email module  of the project definition , the condition that causes the module  to send an email is met when the last image produced by the Database Access module  is being processed. There are various ways in which this could be detected, for example by counting images if the number of images to be processed is known in advance, or by detecting a predetermined file name assigned to the last image. Alternatively, as a process completes, an \u201cexecution finished\u201d message could be provided to all modules of the process, or at least to each Send Email module in the process, thereby causing each Send Email module to proceed to send its email. The text of the email might notify a person that all of the image data in question has been processed by the project definition , and is available for use.","The unchanged image data from the module  flows at  to a String Builder module , which does not change the image data. As explained in TABLE 3, the String Builder module  can generate a sequence of names, where each name in the sequence is generated when a respective one of the images passes through the module . In the project definition , the module  is configured to generate a sequence of names which are \u201cImage01\u201d \u201cImage02\u201d, \u201cImage03\u201d, and so forth. These sequential names are successively supplied through an output port of the String Builder module , which is associated with a binding line .","The unchanged image data from the Stringer Builder module  flows at  to a File Size module . The module  does not change the image data. It outputs the image data at either  or , depending on the size of the file which contains the image data, in a manner already discussed above. Image data that is output at  flows to the sub-process , as discussed later. Image data that is output at  flows to an Interactive module  of the main process .","The Interactive module  does not change the image data. It does pause execution of the project definition , while requesting that a person manually specify where the current image is to be sent. In particular, the person can specify that the current image is to be sent at  to the sub-process , or that the image can continue at  along the main process . In view of the fact that the Interactive module  has the effect of pausing execution for each image processed by the project definition , and in view of the fact that an important application of the present invention is automated processing of data, modules of the Interactive type would typically be omitted from most project definitions. However, the Interactive module  has been included in the exemplary project definition  of  in order to facilitate a better understanding of this feature of the present invention. With reference to TABLE 2, and as discussed in more detail later, the Interactive module  provides a user with the capability to manually and interactively specify whether data is to be directed to  or . In addition, it provides the user with the capability to specify that the Interactive module  should automatically take a specified action for all subsequent images which are processed during the current execution of the project definition . Assuming that, in response to a query from the Interactive module , a person indicates that image data from the module  is to continue along the main process , the module  causes the unchanged image data to flow at  to a Text Stamper module .","The Text Stamper module  has an additional input port, which is associated by the binding line  with the image width output from the Image Info module , and also with the port  of the global portion . As mentioned above, the binding line  is a conditional binding. This means that the binding  can selectively supply data to the input port of the Text Stamper module  from either of two different output ports, which in  are the image width output of the module , and the port  of the global portion . Conceptually, the condition should be viewed as an internal part of the binding  itself, rather than as a part of the global portion , the module , or the module . Considered this way, it will be recognized that the condition can be based on data which is available to the binding  from either of the associated output ports, which in  include the image height information and image width information that it respectively receives from the output ports of the global portion  and the module . For example, the condition might be set to specify that the binding  is to compare the height and width values, and to supply the larger of the two values to the Text Stamper module .","The Text Stamper module  takes the height or width value received from the conditional binding , and superimposes it on the image received at . The height or width information becomes a separate object which is part of the overall image data. All of the objects of the image data are supplied at  to a File Namer module .","The module  associates with the image data a file name, under which the image data will eventually be stored. For this purpose, the File Namer module  has an input port coupled through the binding  to module . As discussed above, the module  generates a unique sequenced name as each respective image is processed. Accordingly, module  associates the unique name from binding  with the image currently passing through the module , and then forwards the image data and newly associated name at  to a Destination Folder module . Aside from associating a name with the image data, the file namer module  does not change the image data itself.","The Destination Folder module  defines the name of a folder or subdirectory into which images processed by the main process  are to be deposited. In essence, the File Namer module  associates with the image data a file name, and the Destination Folder module  associates with the image data a path to a subdirectory. The module  does not change the image data itself. The image data with its associated information is supplied at  to a File Saver module .","The File Saver module  is responsible for actually saving the data, and can also specify which of several common image formats the image data is to be saved in. The File Saver module  saves the image data in the folder or subdirectory specified by module , under the file name specified by module , and in the format specified by the File Saver module  itself. The File Saver module  is configured to save the data locally with respect to the computer which is executing the project definition , for example within the context of an intranet or LAN, but not to a remote location that can only be accessed through a non-local network such as the Internet.","Returning to the File Size module , it was explained above that, depending on file size, certain images would be routed at  to the sub-process . In particular, these images will be routed to an input port of a Text Stamper module . The module  superimposes on each such image a non-changing text string, which it obtains through an input port from the output port  of the global portion . This superimposed text is added to the image data in the form of an additional object, which becomes a part of the image data. All of the objects of the image data are supplied at  to a File Namer module .","The File Namer module  operates in the same manner as described above for the File Namer module , and then supplies the image data and associated information at  to a Destination Folder module . The module  operates in the same manner as the Destination Folder module , except that it uses a different name for the destination folder. The image data and associated information are then supplied at  to an FTP Save module .","The FTP Save module  uses the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) to transfer the processed image data and associated information through a network to a specified destination, where it is saved in a folder having the name specified by the Destination Folder module , under a name specified by the File Namer , and in a format specified by the FTP Save module . The module  is capable of saving data to a remote location, for example through the Internet.","Returning to the Interactive module , it was explained above that a user can selectively specify that a current image is to continue at  along the main process , or is to be routed at  to the sub-process . In the sub-process , this image is received at an input port of an External Action module . The module  is designed to cooperate with a separately and independently executing application program, which in the disclosed embodiments is an image processing program, such as the program that is commercially available under the tradename PHOTOSHOP from Adobe Systems Incorporated of San Jose, Calif. It is to be understood that this separate application program is operative only when accessed through an External Action module. Thus, for example, where this application program is an image processing program, it only performs image processing functions initiated through an External Action module. The image processing functions implemented by other modules are implemented by other software, as discussed in more detail later.","The External Action module  includes a command which was specified by the person who created the project definition , and which is a command that the separate image processing program is capable of executing. The module  supplies the current image and also the command to the image processing program, which then executes the command while processing the image in the manner specified by the command. The image processing program then returns the processed image to the External Action module , which supplies the processed image at  to a File Namer module .","The File Namer module  operates in the same manner as described above for the modules  and , and then outputs image data and an associated name at  to a Database Output module . The Database Output module  operates in a manner similar to the Database Access module , except that it saves data rather than reading data. The data is saved under the file name specified by module .",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00085","num":"00085"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 9"],"b":["201","201","201","206","207","208","206","211","212","216","217","221","223","208","226","227","231","232","232","208","206","206","208"]},"The computers and related hardware shown in  are all of a type known in the art. For purposes of explaining the present invention, the following discussion will focus on the manner in which these known hardware components are configured into a system, and the various software programs which are executed by the various computers of FIG. .","The file server  can receive data files from portable media such as a standard floppy disk , or a standard compact disk , and can store this data at , for example in a hard disk drive. Conversely, some or all of the data stored at  can be offloaded onto a floppy disk  and\/or a read\/write compact disk . The data stored on the floppy disk  or the compact disk  will typically be in a compressed format, which conforms to an industry-standard compression technique. Consequently, the file server  has the capability to uncompress data that is read from the floppy disk  or the compact disk , before that data is stored at . Similarly, the file server  has the capability to compress data obtained from  before writing it to the floppy disk  or the compact disk .","The imaging servers - are all effectively identical, and therefore only the imaging server  is illustrated and described here in detail. The imaging server  includes a processor  and a memory . The processor  runs an operating system , which in the disclosed embodiments is one of the versions of an operating system that is commercially available under the tradename WINDOWS from Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash. However, it could be some other operating system. Running on the operating system  within the processor  is a program which is an imaging server module . The memory  stores two tasks  and , which each include a project definition , selected executables , and data .","With respect to the imaging server , as well as other servers and workstations discussed later, it will be recognized that the dividing line between what is in the processor in FIG.  and what is in the memory has been drawn somewhat arbitrarily. For example, programs such as the operating system  and the imaging server module  are each depicted in the processor, but also use a certain amount of the memory . Conversely, the memory  is depicted as containing some executable code at , but the actual execution of this code will ultimately occur within the processor . Nevertheless, it is believed that those skilled in the art will readily comprehend these distinctions, and the breakdown shown in  has been selected to facilitate a clear understanding of the present invention.","In the imaging server , the imaging server module  executes project definitions of the type discussed above with respect to FIGS.  and -B. In particular, it obtains data through the intranet  and\/or the Internet , processes the data in the manner specified by the project definition, and then deposits the processed data to a data destination through the intranet  and\/or the Internet . If the data arrives at the imaging server  in a compressed format, the imaging server can uncompress the data before processing it. Similarly, where appropriate, the imaging server  can compress data before saving it to a data destination. Transmission of data from data sources and to data destinations through the networks is effected according to an appropriate public communication protocol, such as the FTP protocol, the XML protocol, the HyperText Transport Protocol (HTTP), or some other suitable protocol.  shows several examples of devices that the imaging server module  can write data to and\/or read data from. These include the FTP site , the database , the ERM , and the file server .","In general, and as discussed later, the information contained in tasks  and  is a copy of information that is also present elsewhere in the system . The copy of this information is supplied to the memory  of the server  on a temporary basis, for purposes of permitting the server  to execute a project definition associated with each such task. In more detail, the project definition  in each of the tasks  and  is a respective project definition of the general type discussed above in association with FIGS.  and -, and is stored in an XML format consistent with the example shown in TABLE 5. The data  represents temporary storage for data that is being processed by the associated project definition . One example of such data is images that have been obtained from a source such as the FTP site , and that will be returned to a destination such as the FTP site  after they have been processed. The selected executables  are selected object code files, which may or may not be present in a given task  or . Whether or not there are executables stored at  is a function of the above-mentioned capability for creating custom modules.","In this regard, the imaging server module  knows how to execute definitions for standard modules, including those set forth in TABLEs 1-4. However, it cannot inherently know how to execute definitions for custom modules. Accordingly, if a given project definition  happens to include one or more custom modules, then object code files that are capable of implementing those custom modules are included at  in the task  or  for that project definition, so that the imaging server module  will have the additional intelligence that it needs to execute the custom modules in the project definition.","Although the tasks  and  in the disclosed embodiments each include a project definition at  and selected executables at , it would alternatively be possible to use pointers rather than the actual data. That is, the tasks  and  could include at  a pointer to the pertinent project definition as stored in the process server , and could include at  one or more pointers to the selected executables as stored within the process server . The imaging server  could then use the pointers to download from the process server  only the information which it needed.","Although  shows that the imaging server  has been supplied with two tasks  and , which each correspond to a respective project definition, the number of tasks being handled by the imaging server  at any given point in time could be higher or lower. In particular, the imaging server  might be handling only one task, or might be handling several tasks. In general, to the extent that the imaging server  has two or more task at any given point in time, it will be executing the tasks in parallel, for example by supplying slices of processor time to each task in a manner which keeps each task moving along as efficiently as possible. In this regard, if one of the tasks is processing image data obtained from the FTP site  through the Internet  and intranet , there are likely to be times when that task is essentially idle, because it is waiting for more image data, and thus the processor can be concentrating on execution of one or more other tasks. The same is true when any other task becomes idle for some reason, because the processor will concentrate on remaining tasks which are currently active. If the set of tasks assigned to a given processor are not cumulatively keeping the processor busy almost all of the time, still another task can be assigned to the processor, in a manner described later.","In the embodiment of , a single instance of the imaging server module  is used in each of the imaging servers -, and can execute multiple project definitions. However, it would alternatively be possible for each imaging server - to execute two or more instances of the project server module , where each such instance was responsible for executing a respective one of the project definitions.","The auxiliary server  executes an operating system , which in the disclosed embodiments is a version of the operating system available under the trade name WINDOWS. Running on the operating system  within the auxiliary server  is an image processing application program , which in the disclosed embodiments is a program commercially available under the tradename PHOTOSHOP from Adobe Systems Incorporated of San Jose, Calif. However, some other image processing application program, or some other type of application program, could alternatively be used. Moreover, even though the embodiment of  has the application program  running on a computer  which is physically separate from other computers in the system , it would alternatively be possible for the application program  to run on one of the other computers in the system , such as the process server  or one of the imaging servers -.","If one of the imaging servers - is executing a project definition which includes an External Action module, then in order to execute that External Action module, the imaging server passes the current image and a specified command through the intranet  to the auxiliary server . The image processing application  in the auxiliary server  then executes the command so as to effect the specified processing of the image, and then returns the processed image through the intranet  to the imaging server. When the system  is operational, the auxiliary server  and the image processing application  normally run all of the time, and are thus typically ready and waiting when an image and associated command arrive through the intranet . As noted above, the application program  is effective only as to functions initiated through an External Action module, such as the External Action module shown at  in FIG. . Thus, where the application program  is an image processing program, it implements only image processing functions initiated by an External Action module. Image processing functions initiated by all other types of modules are implemented by other software, such as the imaging server program  that runs on each imaging server -.","The process server , which may alternatively be referred to as a load balancing server, is responsible for monitoring the imaging servers -, and allocating tasks to the imaging servers - in dependence on factors such as their current level of efficiency, which reflects their availability to take on execution of additional project definitions. The manner in which this occurs is described below. The various software programs that run on the process server  may be referred to collectively as a process server framework.","The process server  includes a processor  and a memory . The memory stores a number of sets of user data, which are each associated with a particular person. For the sake of example, four sets of such user data are shown at -, but in practice the process server  will store a much larger number of sets of user data. Each set of user data includes one or more project definitions , and one or more custom definitions . It is possible for a user, for example at one of the workstations  or , to store a project definition in his or her portion  of the memory . This can also be referred to as \u201cpublishing\u201d the project definition to the process server . Whenever a project definition is published to the process server , the object code for any custom modules used in that project definition will automatically and simultaneously be published with it, and in particular will be stored in that user's custom definition portion  of the memory . Further, when a project definition is published to the process server , the local copy of the project definition in the workstation  will be automatically deleted, unless the user specifically indicates that it should be saved.","Although a user has access to his or her own project definitions  and any associated custom definitions , others will not have access to them, except to the extent that the user elects to give them access. In this regard, the user data - in  is organized into two groups  and , where the group  includes the user data  and , and the group  includes the user data  and . In this disclosed embodiment, the groups  and  each correspond to a respective different entity. For example, the group  may correspond to a first corporation, where the user data  and the user data  respectively correspond to two different employees of that corporation, and the group  may correspond to a second corporation, where the user data  and the user data  respectively correspond to two different employees of the second corporation.","When a user publishes project definitions and any associated custom definitions to the process server , it is possible to do so in a manner so that other users within the same organization or entity can have access to specified project definitions and\/or custom definitions. Thus, for example, the user associated with the data  may be given access to some or all of the project definitions at , which will automatically include access to any custom definitions used by those project definitions. Also, the user associated with data  may separately be given access to some or all of the custom definitions at , even if the user has not been given access to any of the project definitions at . The disclosed embodiment contemplates that this cross access to project definitions and custom definitions will be limited to users within a given entity, such as the entity  or the entity , and that users in one entity such as the entity  will not be able to have access to data of users in another entity such as the entity . However, in an alternative embodiment, cross access to user data could occur between users in two different entities.","A user at one of the workstations  or  may upload to that workstation any project definition from the process server  to which that user has access. In doing so, the user may either make a copy of the project definition, such that the original in the imaging server remains available to anyone that has access to it. Alternatively, the user may upload a project definition through a \u201ccheck out\u201d procedure which makes the project definition in the process server unavailable to everyone until the user checks the copy back in (along with any changes that the user may have made to the copy).","The memory  also stores a request queue . Execution of one of the project definitions  is initiated in response to receipt by the process server  of a request. Such a request may arrive through the intranet  and\/or Internet , for example from a user at one of the workstations  and . When the request arrives, the request is temporarily placed in the queue , which implements a first-in, first-out stack. Typically, the request will identify one of the project definitions stored at  in one of the sets of user data -. Alternatively, however, the request may be accompanied by a project definition and any custom definitions used by that project definition, which are then temporarily stored in the user data  for that user, until execution of that project definition has been completed.","Requests for the queue  may also originate in some other manner. For example, assume that a given project definition stored in one of the portions  of the memory  processes data from the database . The database  may include a script or other intelligence which, in response to a change to the pertinent source data in the database , automatically generates and sends to the process server  a request for execution of the given project definition, so that the modified data will be automatically processed. According to a feature of the invention, each request sent from any source to the process server  is expressed in a public communication protocol, which in the disclosed embodiments is the XML protocol. The manner in which the process server  handles the requests in the queue  will be discussed later.","The processor  of the process server  executes an operating system  which, in the disclosed embodiments, is one of the versions of the operating system available under the tradename WINDOWS. Running on the operating system  are three watchdog programs -, which each serve as an interface to a respective one of the imaging servers -, and which each have the additional responsibility of monitoring operation of the associated imaging server -, as discussed in more detail later.","Also running on the operating system  is a load balancing module program , which monitors the workloads and efficiency of each of the imaging servers -. The load balancing module  allocates execution of project definitions among the servers - on the basis of their workloads and efficiency, in a manner described below. The load balancing module  is interfaced to the intranet  by a network interface program , by an email program , and by a Web site program . It will be recognized that the functions of the programs - are interrelated, in that they each implement capability to communicate through the intranet . Thus, they could conceivably be implemented as respective portions of a single program. However, they are shown separately in  for purposes of clarity in presenting the present invention.","The Web site program  implements one or more Internet Web sites, which can be accessed through the intranet  and\/or Internet , for example by a network browser program running on either of the workstations  or . The purpose of the Web site program  is discussed in more detail later. The email program  provides the load balancing module  with the capability to send and receive emails. For example, if one of the imaging servers - is executing a project definition which includes a Send Email module (TABLE 3), that imaging server will send appropriate information from this module across the intranet  and through the associated watchdog - to the load balancing module , which will then cause the email program  to transmit the email. It will be recognized that this email capability could alternatively be provided directly in each of the imaging server modules , so that imaging servers - can directly send such emails. The network interface program  is used to facilitate other types of communication through the intranet  and\/or Internet  by the process server  with respect to other systems on the network, such as one of the workstations  and .","Certain aspects of the operation of the process server  will now be described with reference to , each of which is a flowchart. More specifically,  is a flowchart showing what happens when the process server  receives a request, for example through one of the network interface program , email program  and Web site . Receipt of the request at  causes control to proceed to block , where the request is put into the queue . Control then returns to whatever was in progress at the time the request was received.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00109","num":"00109"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 11","FIG. 11"],"b":["309","296","221","223","361","277","296","361","277","10"]},"When it is determined at block  that the queue  includes at least one request, then control proceeds from block  to block . In block , the processor  retrieves from the queue  the request which has been in the queue the longest. Then, at block , the load balancing module  in the processor  interacts with the imaging servers - through the watchdogs - and the intranet , in order to determine the extent to which each has available capacity for additional work. If none of them has any significant amount of available capacity, then at block  control is returned to block , in order to continue to evaluate availability of the processors in the imaging servers, until it is determined at block  that at least one of the imaging servers - has some available processing capability.","Control then proceeds from block  to block , where the load balancing module  evaluates the project definition  associated with the request which was retrieved from the queue at block . This evaluation may include inspection not only of the project definition itself, but also some of the data which is slated to be processed by that project definition. The evaluated characteristics may include the complexity of the project definition, and also the type and amount of data which that project definition is slated to process. For example, in the case of image data, the amount of image data depends on both the number of images and also the size of the images.","Control then proceeds to block , where the evaluations made in block  and  are used to determine whether it is possible to launch execution the project definition which is identified by the request drawn from the queue at . In this regard, there are several different ways in which a given project definition can be launched. First, if one of the imaging servers - has a level of availability which will permit it to take on execution of the project definition in question, execution of the project definition can be launched on that imaging server alone. However, if the project definition itself is relatively complex, and\/or if there is a relatively large amount of data which it must process, two or more instances of the project definition may be launched, each configured to process a respective mutually exclusive portion of the specified data. A decision needs to be made as to whether to launch them on the same processor or on different processors.","In more detail, where it appears that two or more instances of the same project definition should be launched, the load balancing server must also factor in the available capacity of the imaging servers -. Assuming that there is a satisfactory level of capacity in the imaging servers, each instance of the given project definition will typically be launched on a respective different one of the imaging servers -. However, where one of the imaging servers - has significant capacity, it is possible that two or more instances of the same project definition could be launched on the same processor, if it appeared that the project definition and associated data were such that both instances could be efficiently processed at the same time. In this regard, and as noted above, there will be points in time when the execution of a project definition is temporarily idle, for example because it is waiting for data to arrive through a network, or because it includes an Interactive module (TABLE 2) and is waiting for a user response. When one instance of the project definition is idle, the other instance (s) can be active, as a result of which it is possible for a single processor to more quickly execute two instances of the same project definition handling respective portion of the data than to execute a single instance handling all the data.","If it is determined at block  that there is an appropriate way to launch the project definition in question, control proceeds from block  to block , where the project definition is launched in the form of one or more instances on one or more imaging servers. Each such instance is launched by having the load balancing module  configure a task of the type shown at  or  (FIG. ), including the project definition at , and including at  any executables that correspond to any custom definitions which are used in that project definition. Control then proceeds from block  to block , where the load balancing module  provides to one or more of the watchdogs -, as appropriate, information regarding the instance(s) of the project definition which have just been launched, and which the watchdog(s) will need to monitor. In this regard, the watchdogs - will already be running, but are initialized with information specific to the new project definition, so that each watchdog monitoring an imaging server that is executing an instance of the project definition will be fully aware of all project definitions that are being executed by that imaging server. From block , control returns to block , to handle the next successive request in the queue.","As evident from the foregoing discussion, the embodiment of  has the imaging server modules  located in respective processors  which are each separate from the processor  that executes the load balancing module . Alternatively, however, it would be possible for the system  to include an additional imaging server module  which is executed by the processor . In other words, the processor  would simultaneously execute both the load balancing module  and an imaging server module .","In order to understand the watchdog programs -, it is helpful to first understand certain characteristics of the imaging server module  in each of the imaging servers -. Many computer programs are developed for situations in which the execution of the program is terminated at the end of each workday, and is then re-started at the beginning of the next workday. Minor problems may sometimes slowly develop as such a program is executed, but then disappear when execution is terminated and restarted. This type of problem is typically due to a minor error which is not noticeable when the program is restarted frequently, for example on a daily basis, and which has thus not previously been identified and fixed. However, if the same program is shifted to a different operational situation where it is run for long periods of time, such as weeks or months, then these errors can create serious problems.","For example, when the application program is done with a segment of memory and attempts to turn it back over to the operating system, the handoff back to the operating system may not be fully completed, such that each program thinks the other currently has control of the memory segment. This is one example of what is commonly known as memory leakage. It does not affect proper operation of either program, but does result in a progressively decreasing quantity of memory that is available for active use by executing programs. Where the system is powered down and re-started on a daily basis, the \u201clost\u201d memory is recovered during the rebooting process, and may never become large enough during the course of a single day to noticeably affect the efficiency of the system. However, if the same system is run continuously for many months, the amount of lost memory could slowly and progressively increase over the course of several weeks to the point where the system was running very inefficiently, because it was being choked by a lack of sufficient memory.","Another type of problem which can occur is that, on rare occasion, something may take place that can cause the application program to lock up and\/or cause the operating system to experience a \u201ccrash\u201d. Still another type of problem involves a situation where there is a degradation in performance characteristics or activity response of the imaging server, for example where a project definition is executing and there is a progressive increase in the average amount of time needed to process successive images. The average time for the project definition to process an image might, for example, initially be one second per image but slowly degrade to ten seconds per image. Writing a program which can run for months at a time while reliably avoiding these types of problems can be very time consuming and extremely expensive.","In the disclosed embodiments, the imaging server modules  are expected to run continuously for many months at a time. In order to deal effectively and efficiently with potential problems of the type just discussed, the disclosed embodiments provide the watchdog programs - with the capability to monitor the imaging server modules  for various problems, such as a memory leakage problem similar to that discussed above. Each of the watchdog programs - has the capability to respond to detection of such a problem by automatically taking appropriate remedial action, as discussed below. The watchdog programs - are somewhat simpler than the imaging server modules , and it is much less expensive to write the watchdogs to meet a desired level of dependability and accuracy than to do so with the imaging server modules .",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00120","num":"00120"},"figref":"FIG. 12","b":["306","308","382","247","246","382","383","306","308","296","386","247","246","387"]},"Thereafter, at block , programs within the imaging server are each restarted, including the operating system  and the imaging server module . Further, the task  or  for each project definition is reconfigured to the extent necessary to ensure that execution of the project definition will continue with the first data item after the one that was identified in block . Then, after the imaging server and its imaging server module  are up and running again, the queued input information is supplied at block  to the imaging server module . Control then returns from block  to block .","Returning to block , if the result of the determination here is that the monitored imaging server has not entered an abnormal state of execution, then control proceeds from block  to block , where the watchdog program evaluates the efficiency of memory use by the imaging server that it monitors. If it determines that the efficiency of memory use is within acceptable bounds, then at block  control is routed back to block . Otherwise, control proceeds from block  to block , where the watchdog program determines whether it can wait for normal completion of the project definitions which are currently being executed by the monitored imaging server. If so, then the watchdog waits at  for execution of all such project definitions to end. Otherwise, or in due course, control will proceed from block  to block , where the watch dog program will initiate queuing of incoming information. If the imaging server was allowed to complete execution of all assigned project definitions at block , then there will typically be little or no incoming information to be queued. On the other hand, if it was necessary to take action prior to completion of a project definition, then there may be incoming information which needs to be queued.","Next, at block , the watchdog program interrupts execution of any project definitions that have not been completed. Then, at , the watchdog cooperates with the associated imaging server -, in a manner which effects a reorganization of memory use. (If the memory use has become extremely inefficient, then it may be appropriate to restart the imaging server in a manner similar to that discussed above in association with blocks , - and , but this option is not expressly illustrated in the flowchart of FIG. ). After memory use has been reorganized in block , the imaging server is instructed by the watchdog at block  to continue execution of interrupted project definitions from where each was interrupted. Then, at block , the queued input information is supplied to the imaging server. Control then returns to block .","Although the disclosed embodiments provide the watchdogs - with the capability to queue incoming information, for example as discussed above in association with blocks , ,  and  of , an alternative approach could be used. In particular, if incoming information could not be immediately delivered to the appropriate imaging server -, then the associated watchdog could return that information to its source, along with a message indicating that the imaging server was currently busy or unavailable.","Returning to , and as mentioned above, the Web server  interfaces the intranet  to the Internet . The Web server  executes an operating system , which in the disclosed embodiments is one of the versions of the operating system available under the trade name WINDOWS. Running on the operating system  is a Web interface module program , which effects the appropriate interface between the intranet  and the Internet , in a known manner.","In the embodiment of , the workstations  and  are effectively identical, except for the fact that the workstation  is a local workstation coupled to the intranet , whereas the workstation  is at a remote location and is coupled to the intranet  through the Internet . Although only two workstations  and  are shown in , it will be recognized that the system  of  could include a large number of similar workstations. Since the illustrated workstations  and  are equivalent, only the workstation  is described below in detail.","The workstation  provides the capability for a person to create project definitions, to upload or \u201cpublish\u201d project definitions and\/or custom definitions to the process server , to download project definitions and\/or custom definitions from the process server , and to effect execution of project definitions within the workstation or within one of the imaging servers - under control of the process server . The workstation  includes a processor  and a memory . The processor  is coupled to a cathode ray tube (CRT) display , in order to permit the workstation  to present information to a person. A keyboard  and a pointing device such as a mouse  are each coupled to the processor , to permit a person to provide input to the workstation .","Stored within the memory  are a plurality of standard definitions , including all of the definitions set forth in TABLEs 1-4. The standard definitions at  include not only the executable object code for each definition, but also a separate file which contains the corresponding source code. In the disclosed embodiments, the source code for each standard definition is expressed in a language known as VISUAL BASIC, which was developed by Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash.","As mentioned above, the present invention does not restrict the user to the standard definitions shown in TABLEs 1-4, but instead gives the user the capability to create additional definitions called custom definitions. To the extent that any custom definitions have been created locally within the workstation , or have been uploaded to the workstation  from the process server , they are stored at  in the memory . The custom definitions stored at  include not only object code files, but also corresponding source code files for custom definitions that were created locally. One convenient technique for creating a custom definition is to take source code for one of the standard definitions , modify the source code as appropriate, compile the modified source code to create a corresponding object code file, and then store the modified source code file and associated object code file at .","As mentioned above, the workstation  can be used to create project definitions, which are then stored at  in the memory , and can optionally be uploaded to the process server , along with any associated custom definitions. Project definitions from the process server  can be downloaded and stored at , with any associated custom definitions being simultaneously downloaded and stored at . Further, the workstation  can be used to modify existing project definitions that are stored locally at , whether they were created locally or downloaded from the process server . The manner in which project definitions and\/or custom definitions and be created and\/or modified are discussed below.","In this regard, the processor  executes an operating system , which in the disclosed embodiments is one of the versions of the operating system available under the tradename WINDOWS. A user at the workstation  may optionally use the operating system  to run a program development environment , which in the disclosed embodiments is a program commercially available under the trade name VISUAL BASIC from Microsoft Corporation. The development environment  is used to create custom definitions, typically by retrieving the source code for a standard definition from , making desired modifications to this source code within the development environment, storing the modified source code at , compiling the modified source code within the development environment, and then storing at  the object code which results from the compilation. The program  does not interact with any other application program within the workstation , or with programs in other parts of the system. Thus, in the disclosed embodiments, creation of a custom definition using the program  is effectively an offline procedure.","The workstation  also executes a standard email program , which has the capability to send and receive emails in a known manner. Thus, for example, if a person has used the workstation  to initiate execution of a project definition within one of the imaging servers -, and if that project definition includes a Send Email module (TABLE 3), execution of the Send Email module will cause an email to be sent to the email program  in the workstation . This can provide the user of the workstation  with appropriate information, such as notice that execution of a project definition has been completed by one of the imaging servers -.","A standard network browser program  also runs on the operating system  in the processor . A person using the workstation  may use the browser  to link to a Web site provided by the Web site program  in the process server , for example to present a request for execution of one of the project definitions stored at  in the memory . Further, while that project definition is being executed in one of the imaging servers -, the project definition may interact with the person at workstation  through the Web site at  and the browser . Alternatively, through use of the browser program , the workstation  may request execution of a project definition which was created at the other workstation  by another user, and which was then uploaded to the process server with an indication that it would be accessible to other users. The browser program  and the Web site  interact with each other using a public communication protocol conforming to standards for the portion of the Internet known as the World Wide Web (WWW), such as the XML protocol or the HTTP protocol.","In particular, as one specific example, it was explained above that the Interactive module  of  pauses execution of the project definition  to request user input.  is a diagrammatic view of an example of a window or dialog box that might be configured as a Web page in the Web site , and displayed on the display  of the workstation  through the browser . The dialog box  includes a portion  which displays the image that is currently in the interactive module of the project definition. It also includes a list box  containing several options. In , the options include \u201cContinue\u201d, which would cause execution to continue along the current main process or sub-process, \u201cOnSale\u201d, which is one sub-process to which a branch can be effected, \u201cOutOfStock\u201d, which is a second sub-process to which a branch can be effected, and \u201cEnd\u201d, which will completely terminate execution of the project definition that contains the Interactive module. Using the keyboard  and\/or the mouse , the user can select one of the items in the list box , and then click an \u201cOK\u201d button  in order to cause the selected option to be implemented. Instead of clicking the \u201cOK\u201d button , the user could alternatively click a \u201cCancel\u201d button , which has the same effect as clicking the \u201cOK\u201d button  while the \u201cEnd\u201d option is selected in list box .","Before clicking the \u201cOK\u201d button , the user has the option to click a \u201cDon't show me this again\u201d box , so as to toggle a check mark on or off in the box . If the check mark is present when the \u201cOK\u201d button is clicked, then the project definition will not pause and display the window  each time the Interactive module is thereafter encountered during the current execution of the project definition. Instead, the option in list box  which is currently selected will thereafter be automatically used for every subsequent execution of that particular Interactive module.","An author module program  and\/or another program  may also be running on the operating system  in the processor . The author module  is discussed in more detail below, and may be used to create, modify, upload, download, and execute project definitions. The other application program  is shown in  to emphasize that some or all functions of the author module  could alternatively be implemented by some other application program. For example, the author module has the capability to create a new project definition, which includes the capability to express the project definition in an XML format comparable to the example shown in TABLE 5. However, it is possible that some other application program, such as the program , could also prepare a project definition in this XML format. Similarly, the program  might have the capability to generate and send a request for execution of one of the project definitions  stored in the memory , and may have the capability to express this request in a public communication protocol such as XML. The program  may communicate with the process server  through the network interface program .","Turning now in more detail to the author module ,  is a diagrammatic view of a typical screen which the author module  might present on the display  in order to permit a user to create or modify a project definition, or to perform related functions. At the left side of the screen is a vertical column which includes a projects area  and a modules area . The projects area  includes a \u201cdesign\u201d icon , a \u201cpublish\u201d icon , an \u201cexecute\u201d icon , a \u201ccreate\u201d icon , and a \u201cdelete\u201d icon . The design icon  is used to initiate modification of a project definition which is already open. The publish icon  is used to transfer to the process server  a selected project definition in an XML format comparable to , along with the object code for any custom definitions that are used by that project definition.","The execute icon  permits the user to initiate execution of a specified project definition. This may be a project definition stored within the memory  of process server , in which case the author module generates and sends to the process server  a request for execution of the project definition. In the disclosed embodiments, the request is expressed in a public communication protocol, such as the XML protocol. If the project definition to be executed is stored locally, the user can control whether that project definition is to be executed locally within the workstation , or sent to the process server  so that it can be executed in one of the imaging servers -. If it is to be sent to the process server, then the author module generates and sends a request in the same basic manner just described, except that the XML definition of the project definition, along with object code for any custom definitions used by that project definition, are transmitted with the request.","With respect to local execution of a project definition, the author module  has essentially the same capabilities as the imaging servers -, with one exception. The author module  in the disclosed embodiments has been developed with the expectation that it may be distributed at a reduced price or even free of charge, in order to encourage development of project definitions through use of the author module . In conjunction with this, the author module  in the disclosed embodiments has been designed so that, during each execution of any project definition, it will process no more than five items of data, such as five images. This permits a user to carry out limited execution for the purpose of testing a new project definition, but does not permit the user to process a large quantity of data. In order to process a large quantity of data, the user is expected to instruct the process server  to have an imaging server - carry out the execution of the project definition, for which the user will be charged a fee by the process server .","The author module  could alternatively be configured to have full capability in all respects to execute project definitions, including the capability to process any number of items of data. However, such a version of the author module would likely be sold for a much higher price, which could involve significantly greater overall expense for some infrequent users.","In , the create icon  is used to initiate creation of a new project definition. This includes creation of a new XML file of the type shown in TABLE 5, which will be progressively expanded as the project definition is created. The delete icon  permits a user to delete a selected project definition which is stored locally at . It does not permit the user to delete a project definition which is stored in the process server .","The modules area  of the screen  includes a \u201csources\u201d icon , a \u201cbranches\u201d , an \u201cactions\u201d icon  and a \u201cdestination\u201d icon . It will be noted that these four icons each correspond to a respective one of the types of modules that were discussed above in association with FIG. . The purpose and operation of the icons - will be discussed later.","To the right of the column containing areas  and  is a further column , which contains a list, in a standard tree format , of available source, branch, action and destination definitions. In this regard, the tree  includes nodes - adjacent each category of definitions. Each node - can be clicked to expand or contract the amount of information shown for that category. For example, in  the \u201csources\u201d category is expanded, and lists various specific source definitions which are available for use in creating a project definition. In contrast, the \u201cactions\u201d category is contracted, and shows a subheading but does not specifically list each of the action definitions which are available.","The previously-mentioned icons - in the area  of the screen  can be used to expedite the expansion and contraction process. For example, if the sources icon  is clicked, the sources category of the tree  will be expanded, while each of the other three categories will be simultaneously contracted. Similarly, if the branches icon  is clicked, the branches category in the tree  will be expanded, whereas the sources, actions and destination categories will all be contracted. The actions icon  and the destinations icon  each operate in a comparable manner.","In the center right portion of the screen  is a process view area , where one process of a project definition can be displayed. For the sake of example, the process view area  of  is presenting the project definition  that was discussed above in association with FIG. . If a process was so big that the entire process could not be conveniently shown all at once in the process view area , a portion could be shown, and standard scroll bars could be provided along the bottom and right sides of the area , so that the user could scroll to other portions of the process. The process view area  in  includes broken lines defining several horizontal strips that respectively contain the global portion , the main process , the sub-process  and the sub-process . Although broken lines are used in , the horizontal strips could alternatively be delimited by light solid lines and\/or lines of a selected color, or could be identified by the use of a different background color for each strip.","In order to add a module to a process shown in the process view area , a user can use a pointing device such as the mouse  to select the desired type of module in the tree . Then, the user can use the mouse to indicate where to put the module in the process, for example by clicking at the location where the new module is to be inserted. Binding of the new module to other modules can then be effected in a manner described later.","As discussed above, the main process  and the sub-processes  and  collectively define a single overall process. The title of the overall process appears in the global process portion , and in this case is a default title of \u201cUntitled(0)\u201d, because the process has not yet been given a specific name. Within this process, the main process  and sub-processes  and  may each be given a unique name, and these names are displayed at the left side of the project view area . In the depicted example, default titles are shown, which are \u201cUntitled(0)\u201d, \u201cSub(1)\u201d and \u201cSub(2)\u201d.","In the lower right portion of the screen  is a binding view area . A user is permitted to select one of the modules shown in the process view area . That selected module will then be displayed in the binding view area , along with each module to which it is bound, with all of the binding lines which extend between the illustrated modules. All other modules and binding lines will be omitted. In the specific example shown in , the user selected the File Namer module  in the process view area . Consequently, the File Namer module  appears in the binding view area , along with each of the binding lines ,  and  relating to it, as well as each of the other modules ,  and  that are associated with those binding lines. All other modules and binding lines are omitted from the binding view area .","The author module  provides the user with the capability to selectively display the project definition  in different forms within the process view area . One such alternative form is shown in , where it will be noted that only the main process  is shown in complete detail. Each of the sub-processes  and  is represented by only a single block. In the case of a relatively complex process, this permits a portion of interest to be more easily viewed.","Another capability of the author module  is to permit a user to create and modify binding definitions in a graphical manner, for example through use of a pointing device such as the mouse  (FIG. ). In this regard,  is a diagrammatic view of a portion of a process as it might appear in the binding view area  of the screen  of FIG. . This example includes an Image Info module , and a Text Stamper module . In order to create two bindings between these two modules, a user has brought up for each module a display of a respective binding menu  or . The binding menu  lists each of the output ports of the Image Info module , and the user has invoked its display by using the pointing device to place the cursor over the right portion of the module , and by then right-clicking. The binding menu  lists the input ports of the text stamper module , and its display has been invoked by using the pointing device to place the cursor over the left portion of the module , and by then right clicking.","Two binding lines  and  each extend between a respective entry in the menu  and a respective entry in the menu . The binding line  corresponds to image data, and links the \u201cImageOut\u201d output port of the Image Info module  to the \u201cImageIn\u201d input port of the Text Stamper module . Similarly, the binding line  links the \u201cImageName\u201d output port of module  to the \u201cTextIn\u201d input port of the module . Each of these binding line was created by clicking on an output port in one menu and then clicking on an input port in the other menu, or by clicking on an input port and then an output port. One end of a binding line may be changed from one output port to another output port by clicking and dragging that end of the binding line from its current output port to the new output port, which may be in the same menu or in a different menu. A binding line can be deleted by clicking and dragging one end to a point spaced from any of the binding menus.","It will be recognized that, in general, a given module cannot execute properly if an input port of that module has been bound to an output port of another module which does not have valid data at a time when the given module needs to be executed. For example, it would not be appropriate for the first module in a sub-process to have an input port which is bound to an output port of another module that is disposed later in the same sub-process. Consequently, the author module  will reject such an invalid binding if a user attempts to create one in a project definition, and will display for the user a suitable explanatory message as to why the binding cannot be accepted.","As discussed above, the development environment program  is essentially used in an off-line manner with respect to other programs shown in , in that it is executed separately and independently and does not interact with any of the other programs. Alternatively, however, the program  could be omitted in favor of a different form of development environment program that could be integrated into the author module , where its functionality would always be readily available while the author module was executing, without any need to separately start it. One suitable example of such a development environment program is a program that is commercially available from Microsoft Corporation under the trade name VISUAL BASIC FOR APPLICATIONS.","As discussed above in association with the binding line  of , the present invention contemplates conditional binding lines, which can associate a given input port with a selected one of two or more output ports, based on a specified condition. Moreover, as also discussed above, the condition is effectively associated with the binding line, rather than with any of the specific modules that have input and output ports associated by the binding line. In order to define or change the condition associated with a conditional binding, a dialog box is presented to the user, for example by superimposing it on a portion of the screen  of FIG. . An example of such a dialog box is shown at  in FIG. . One way to invoke the display of the dialog box  is to right click on a conditional binding line in the binding view area  of the screen .","In , the dialog box  relates to a conditional binding which associates an input port with one of two different output ports. The dialog box  includes two areas  and , which each identify a respective one of these two output ports. If this conditional binding had the capability to associate the input port with more than two output ports, then the dialog box  would include for each such output port a respective area similar to the areas  and . The areas  and  each identify the associated output port by setting forth the name of the process in which that output port is disposed, the name of a sub-process if the output port is not in the main process, the name of a particular module within that process, including its instance number (as discussed above in association with TABLE 5), and the word \u201cOutput\u201d to indicate that the port in question is an output port. Finally, each area identifies any name associated with the particular output port. In the case of area , this name is \u201cMSRP\u201d, which stands for Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price, because the data in question is a representation of a price. In the case of area , this name is \u201cPrice\u201d, and indicates that the data at the indicated output port represents a price. For convenience, the dialog box  gives each of these two output ports a shorthand label. In the illustrated example, these shorthand labels are \u201cB1\u201d and \u201cB2\u201d, and appear immediately to the left of the areas  and .","In the lower portion of the dialog box  are three areas - which are used to set the actual condition. In particular, area  is used to enter an equation which can include a combination of Boolean and algebraic terms. Area  is used to specify which output port will be associated with the input port if the condition specified in area  is true. Area  specifies which output port will be coupled to the input port if the condition specified in area  is false.","The dialog box  also includes an \u201cOK\u201d button , which can be clicked to close the dialog box  and set the conditional binding to operate according to the information which is currently set forth in the dialog box. In addition, there is a \u201cCancel\u201d button , which can be clicked to close the dialog box  without making any change to the pre-existing state of the conditional binding.","As discussed above, the example of an XML project definition set forth in TABLE 5 includes at lines - a Text Stamper module, of which lines - define a number of parameters that control various characteristics of the text which is superimposed onto an image by the Text Stamper module. These parameters are specified by a user who is creating a project definition, at the time that the Text Stamper module is added to the project definition. The user also has the capability to subsequently adjust these parameters. In order to set or adjust these parameters, the user is presented with a dialog box, an example of which is shown at  in FIG. . The dialog box  will be automatically presented when the Text Stamper module is initially being added to the project definition. Thereafter, if a user wishes to modify the settings, the user can invoke the display of the dialog box , for example by using a pointing device to right-click on the center of the module. When opened, the dialog box  may, for example, be superimposed over a portion of the screen  shown in FIG. . The information shown in the dialog box of  corresponds directly to the parametric control information set forth at lines - in TABLE 5, as discussed below.","In this regard, the user has two ways in which to obtain the text which is to be stamped on the image. First, the text can be defined internally to the Text Stamper module as a literal string, in which case the text does not change during execution of the project definition. Alternatively, the text can be obtained from an output port of another module, in which case it is possible for the text to change during execution of the project definition, such that each processed image has different text superimposed on it. The selection of one of these approaches is controlled by the setting of a \u201cBind to\u201d box  disposed within the dialog box . If there is no check mark in the box , then the text string is configured as an internal literal string, which is specified in a box . In the example of , however, there is a check mark in the box , as a result of which the box  is effectively ignored. The box  simply includes a grayed-out string \u201cBound to Price\u201d, which is an indication to the user that the text is being obtained externally from an output port named \u201cPrice\u201d.","Since there is a check mark in the box , the text string to be superimposed on the image is to be obtained from an output port of another module. Therefore, available output ports are listed in a box , and the user highlights one of them in order to select it. In the illustrated example, the \u201cPrice\u201d output of another module has been highlighted in order to select it. In the XML definition of TABLE , lines - define a \u201cBound\u201d parameter which indicates whether the box  contains a checkmark, and lines - indicate the particular output port which the user has selected in box . Since the text box  is not used in the illustrated example, the XML definition in TABLE 5 does not include an entry corresponding to box , but it would include such an entry if there was no checkmark in box . Alternatively, the XML definition in TABLE 5 could include such an entry for box , even though there is a checkmark in box .","In addition to defining what text to use, the dialog box  permits certain characteristics of the appearance of the text to be controlled. In this regard, box  permits selection of a font, and corresponds to lines - in TABLE 5. Button  specifies whether or not the text is to be in a bold font and corresponds to lines - in TABLE 5. Button  indicates whether the font is to be presented in regular or italics style, and corresponds to lines - of TABLE 5. Button  controls whether or not the text is to be underlined, and corresponds to lines - in TABLE 5. The color of the text can be selected using button , which calls up a not-illustrated dialog box that offers a choice of colors. After selection of a color, that color is displayed on the face of button . Button  corresponds to lines - of TABLE 5. The size of the font can be selected at , which corresponds to lines - of TABLE 5.","A merge mode can be selected at , which corresponds to lines - in TABLE 5. This permits control over the combination or mixture of colors in an image, using additive or subtractive color theory. In this regard, an image can be selectively changed according to hue, saturation or lightness, and modifications can be made to the red, green or blue channel of an image. The manner in which the superimposed text is associated with the image, or in other words a merge mode, is selected at , which corresponds to lines - in TABLE 5. The degree of transparency of the superimposed text can be adjusted on a scale from 0 to 100 using a simulated slide control  that can be dragged by a mouse, where a numeric value for the current setting is displayed at . A value of 0 means that the text is opaque, whereas a value of 100 means that the text is completely invisible. Lines - of TABLE 5 correspond to the transparency setting.","The dialog box  also provides the capability to control the positional relationship between the superimposed text and the image. In this regard, the text can be placed at a selected angle with respect to the image by entering an appropriate value in degrees in box , ranging from 0 to 360. Box  corresponds to lines - in TABLE 5. The user can-select one of two different ways to specify the position of the text relative to the image, by checking one of two boxes  and . Only one of these boxes can be checked, and placing a check mark in one removes the check mark from the other. Lines - of TABLE 5 contain a value indicating which of the boxes  and  has been checked.","If the box  is checked, then the position of the text is defined on a precise basis using a Cartesian coordinate system, based on a count of pixels within the image. The \u201cX\u201d position value is specified in a box , and the \u201cY\u201d value is specified in a box . The boxes  and  respectively correspond to lines - and lines - in TABLE 5. Alternatively, if the box  is checked, then the user can set the position more rapidly but less accurately, in particular by selecting one of nine \u201cradio\u201d buttons disposed within a box . In the example of , the center radio button has been selected, to indicate that the text is to be centered in both the X and Y directions within the image. The box  corresponds to lines - in TABLE 5.","If text reaches the border of the image, the user has the option of deciding whether to place text outside the image. This is controlled by whether or not the user places a check mark in a box . The box  corresponds to lines - of TABLE 5. A further option is that, if the text is too large in relation to the image, the user has the option of indicating whether the size of the image should be expanded. This is controlled by whether or not the user places a check mark in a box , which corresponds to lines - in TABLE 5. If box  is checked, and if the image is therefore expanded, the expansion will occur through the addition of pixels at one or more edges of the image. The color for these additional pixels needs to be defined, and this is controlled by a button . Like the button , the button  calls up a further dialog box which permits the selection of a color. Once a color has been selected, the face of the button  is thereafter displayed in that color. Button  corresponds to lines - of TABLE 5.","It is frequently helpful to a user to be able to see a sample of how the text might appear on an image, based on the current settings of the various parameters that can be set using dialog box  in the manner described above. Accordingly, the user can click a preview button , which causes a display at  of a sample image with sample text superimposed on it in a manner conforming to the current parameter settings in box . In the example of , the sample image is a camera, and the sample text is \u201c$150\u201d. The preview image in box  is not actual data or actual text which would be used during execution of the project definition, because the project definition is not currently being executed.","When the user is satisfied with all of the settings in dialog box , the user can click an \u201cOK\u201d button , which causes the current information in the dialog box  to be converted into XML form and saved within the associated project definition. Alternatively, the user can click a \u201cCancel\u201d button , causing all of the information in the dialog box  to be discarded without any change to the XML definition of the project definition. Clicking either of the buttons  or  causes the dialog box  to be closed.","The present invention provides a number of technical advantages. One such technical advantage results from the fact that data subject to automated processing is obtained from a remote location or system, and\/or is deposited to a remote location or system after being processed. A related advantage is realized where the data is obtained and\/or deposited through a network. The approach of the invention reduces human involvement and the associated risk of human error, thereby obtaining more efficient and reliable processing of the data. This in turn permits a project definition to be executed by a person having limited computer skills, while reducing or eliminating the risk of inadvertent human error.","Although several selected embodiments have been illustrated and described in detail, it will be understood that various substitutions and alterations are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention, as defined by the following claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["A better understanding of the present invention will be realized from the detailed description which follows, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00014","num":"00014"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00015","num":"00015"},"figref":["FIGS. 2-5","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00016","num":"00016"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00017","num":"00017"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 6"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00018","num":"00018"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00019","num":"00019"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["1","6","8"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00020","num":"00020"},"figref":["FIGS. 10-12","FIG. 9"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00021","num":"00021"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIG. 9"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00022","num":"00022"},"figref":["FIG. 14","FIG. 9"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00023","num":"00023"},"figref":["FIG. 15","FIG. 8"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00024","num":"00024"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00025","num":"00025"},"figref":["FIG. 17","FIG. 9"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00026","num":"00026"},"figref":["FIG. 18","FIG. 9"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
