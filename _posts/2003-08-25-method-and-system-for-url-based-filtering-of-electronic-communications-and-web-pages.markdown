{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["Embodiments of the present invention relate to the field of communications filtering based on content and web page management and control based on content. In particular, embodiments of this invention relate to evaluating the appropriateness of a particular electronic communication or a web page of a website based on its content.","Any internet application is a candidate for abuse and annoyance by spammers who solicit visitors for their websites. In addition to sending email and other communications, spammers also target chat rooms and instant messaging programs by writing \u201cbots\u201d (programs designed to act like a person) that try to solicit visitors to websites. In addition, solicitors disguise the actual content of their websites by giving the site a front or look which would appear to be more appropriate in order to sell products and\/or services that are inappropriate.","Pornographic email and spam are becoming increasingly offensive to clients, with hypertext markup language (HTML) based messages containing graphic images and descriptions sent to millions of users regardless of their age or interests. Similarly, chat rooms and instant messaging programs are targeted by spammers, who write \u201cbots\u201d (programs designed to act like a person) that try to solicit visitors to websites. The solicitations are not always pornographic\u2014they may be any type of unsolicited commercial offering\u2014offers to purchase Viagra or other prescription drugs, applications for credit cards, or weight loss programs for example.","Some known systems develop lists of appropriate and inappropriate website and sources of electronic communication. However, these systems can be circumvented by spammers that vary their source address or hide the content that they are offering.","Usability studies indicate pornographic email, spam, and pornographic solicitations in messaging applications and in chat rooms are a major cause of dissatisfaction and churn to users. There is a need to address this problem in order to improve the user's experience. Controlling such electronic communications and websites translates into lower chum and higher revenues for internet service providers.","Accordingly, a system for filtering electronic communications and websites is desired to address one or more of these and other disadvantages.","Electronic communications and web pages of inappropriate content tend to share a common characteristic: they contain URLs (uniform resource locators) that, when selected, deliver the client to the spammer's web page. One embodiment of the invention involves parsing electronic communications and web pages in applications that are not primarily for the function of viewing web pages, searching for URLs, and using a software development kit called the Online Lookup Toolkit to look up the URLs. If a sufficient number, rating or percentage of the URLs are categorized as \u201cinappropriate,\u201d such a electronic communication is either blocked or logged for parental examination. If a sufficient number, rating or percentage of the URLs of a web page are categorized as \u201cinappropriate,\u201d such URLs are either segregated, removed or blocked.","Microsoft Corporation owns a very large database of categorized URLs, used for MSN's Parental Controls and web content filtering. The database contains nearly 30 million URLs, representing public web pages on the World Wide Web, and category labels indicating membership in \u201cinappropriate\u201d categories, i.e. categories of content inappropriate for viewing by children. These categories include pornography, hate speech, mature content, drugs, etc. In the future, the categories may include those favored by spammers, such as Viagra sales, credit card offers, etc. The contents of the database are served up online through custom lookup servers, called Category Name Service servers, or CNS servers. Applications access the lookup servers with a software development kit (SDK) called the Online Lookup Toolkit. The system is called the Online Lookup Service, or OLS.","In the case of email, one embodiment of the invention involves scanning email messages at either the mail server or mail client, before delivering them to the addressee. For instant messaging or chat rooms, individual test messages can be intercepted either at the time a client (or a bot masquerading as a client) sends the message, or before delivery to the message's recipient. In the case of web pages, one embodiment of the invention involves evaluating the content of the web page. If the text message or web page contains one or more URLs, they can be extracted and looked up against the OLS, and the message can be blocked as inappropriate or allowed as appropriate.","In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, a system provides for handling an electronic communication. The system includes instructions for:","receiving the communication;","parsing the received communication;","identifying URLs within the parsed communication;","categorizing the identified URLs; and","routing the communication as a function of the categorized URLs.","In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, a system provides for controlling access by third parties to web pages of a website. The system includes instructions for:","parsing pages within a website;","identifying URLs within the parsed web pages;","categorizing the identified URLs; and","permitting third parties to access the web pages as a function of the categorized URLs.","In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, a system provides for handling an email. The system includes instructions for:","receiving the email;","parsing the received email;","identifying URLs within the parsed email;","looking up a rating for each of the identified URLs;","designating certain of the identified URLs as inappropriate assigning a number to each identified URL based on its appropriateness; and","permitting the client to access the email when the assigned number or the number of inappropriate URLs is below a threshold.","In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, a system provides for handling an email. The system includes instructions for:","receiving the email;","parsing the received email;","identifying URLs within the parsed email;","looking up a rating for each of the identified URLs;","designating certain of the identified URLs as inappropriate or assigning a number to each identified URL based on its inappropriateness; and","inhibiting the client to access the email when the assigned number or the number of inappropriate URLs is at or above the threshold.","In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, a client side hardware system is provided. The system includes a client computer having a memory and having capability for receiving electronic communications from a source for presentation to a client. The system further includes:","instructions for receiving electronic communications from a source and storing the received electronic communications in the memory while initially inhibiting client access to the electronic communications;","instructions for categorizing the stored electronic communications based on the URLs therein; and","instructions for permitting client access to a particular electronic communication as a function of the category of the electronic communication.","In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, a server side hardware system is provided. The system includes a server computer having a memory and having capability for receiving electronic communications from a source for presentation to a client. The system further includes:","instructions for receiving electronic communications from a source and storing the received electronic communications in the memory;","instructions for categorizing the stored electronic communications based on the URLs therein; and","instructions for selectively sending a particular electronic communication to the client as a function of the categorization of the electronic communication.","In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, a server side hardware system is provided. The system includes a server computer presenting a plurality of websites having web pages on a network and having the capability of controlling a client's access to the pages of the websites. The system further includes:","instructions for periodically categorizing the web pages based on URLs therein; and","instructions for permitting client access to a particular web page as a function of the categorization of the web page.","In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, a computer readable medium for handling an electronic communication is provided. The medium includes instructions for:","receiving the communication;","parsing the received communication;","identifying URLs within the parsed communication;","categorizing the identified URLs; and","routing the communication as a function of the categorized URLs.","In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, a computer readable medium for controlling access by third parties to web pages of a website is proved. The medium includes instructions for:","parsing pages within a website;","identifying URLs within the parsed web pages;","categorizing the identified URLs; and","permitting third parties to access the web pages as a function of the categorized URLs.","In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, a computer readable medium for handling an email is provided. The medium includes instructions for:","receiving the email;","parsing the received email;","identifying URLs within the parsed email;","looking up a rating for each of the identified URLs;","designating certain of the identified URLs as inappropriate or assigning a number to each identified URL based on its inappropriateness; and","permitting the client to access the email when the assigned number or the number of inappropriate URLs is below a threshold or inhibiting the client to access the email when the assigned number or the number of inappropriate URLs is at or above the threshold.","Alternatively, one embodiment of the invention may comprise various other methods and apparatuses.","Other features will be in part apparent and in part pointed out hereinafter.","Corresponding reference characters indicate corresponding parts throughout the drawings.","Referring to , a system  handles an electronic communication  such as an email, an instant message or a chat room statement provided by a server  over a network. The system  is illustrated as implemented on a client's computer and controls whether an electronic communication which names the client as an addressee should be provided to the client. As indicated herein and as is known by those skilled in the art, the system  may also be implemented on a server (as shown in ) or in any other configuration that allows it to evaluate the electronic communication  and control its routing.","As part of the software instructions operating the client computer , included are instructions for receiving the electronic communication . Depending on the type of electronic communication, this may be an email application, an instant messaging program or a chat room program or any other application for receiving a electronic communication. A URL parser  breaks up each received electronic communication into smaller chunks to identify the URLs within the electronic communication. URL parsers are well known and are applied to the electronic communication to identify the URLs therein.","The software also includes instructions for categorizing the identified URLs. For example, the client computer  may include an on line lookup tool kit (OLTK)  for communicating with a category name service (CNS) server . The OLTK is an SDK that presents an application programming interface (API) that allows looking up one or more URLs and returns back category rating information for those URLs. The OLTK opens a socket to the CNS server and uses the HTTP protocol to transmit the URL(s) and receive the ratings. In one form, it is implemented as a. NET web service, so that it transmits and receives XML over HTTP.","The server  is connected to a URL database  which includes a list of URLs and a rating (such as an assigned number) or category for each URL in the database . In one embodiment, the assigned number is a rating value for a given category. For example, it may be an assigned number between 0 and 100 representing a confidence value or probability that the URL is a member of the inappropriate category in question. Further, there may be an assigned number for each supported category. For example, a URL that has a sexually oriented word within it might have ratings of PORN:100, ALCOHOL 0, MATURE CONTENT 75, VIOLENCE 0, etc.","In one embodiment, the URL parser  presents each URL found in the electronic communication to the tool kit , which passes the URLs to the server , which, in turn, looks up the category or rating in the database  and provides the category or rating information to the tool kit . In the event that the database does not have the URL listed or a category or rating for it, the server  will indicate that the URL is unrated. Alternatively, the CNS server  may attempt to rate the URL before responding or after responding, depending on the amount of time required to complete the rating.","The rating provided to each electronic communication depends on the purpose of the filtering. In one aspect relating to the control of content to minors, it is contemplated that each URL can have a zero or more category rating. For each application, a category might be considered appropriate or inappropriate. The CNS server does not necessarily return a rating of appropriate or inappropriate. It may assign a number to each identified URL based on its inappropriateness. The application decides which categories (or assigned number or total number) are inappropriate based on the information provided. The extent to which a particular URL falls into one category or other depends on the rating criteria. For example, the percentage of inappropriate URLs may determine the handling of the electronic communication. If the percentage of inappropriate URLs meets or exceeds a threshold level (e.g., 50% or 10% or some other percentage), access to the electronic communication is limited to system administrators (e.g. parents) only and the electronic communication would be routed to the system administrator to a location where the administrator could access it but where client could not access it. In other words, the electronic communication is not routed to an addressee when the percentage of inappropriate URLs relative to the total of inappropriate and appropriate URLs of the electronic communication is greater than a threshold amount. It is also contemplated that the threshold amount may be a dynamic or weighted amount based on various factors and\/or past experience. Also, the threshold may vary depend on the desires of the system administrator and it may be varied based on the profile of the client.","Another factor which may affect rating is subject matter. For example, the following categories of subject matter could be designated as unacceptable:\n\n","Additionally, the software includes instructions for routing the electronic communication as a function of the categorized URLs. For example, if all URLs of a particular electronic communication are inappropriate, access to the electronic communication is limited to system administrators and the electronic communication would be routed to the system administrator to a location where the administrator could access it but where client could not access it. As another example, if all URLs of a particular electronic communication are appropriate, access to the electronic communication is provided to the client or the electronic communication is routed to the client or to a location where the client can access the electronic communication.","Embodiments of the invention encompass other rating scenarios. For example, each URL may have a numerical rating and whether an electronic communication is routed to a client or inhibited may depend on the numerical ratings. For example, appropriate URLs may carry a zero rating and inappropriate URLs may carry a rating of 1 to 10. The total ratings of the URLs of an electronic communication would determine its handling. For example, if the total was greater than a threshold of 5, the electronic communication would not be available to the client.","In summary, the electronic communication is rated as a function of its identified URLs therein and the electronic communication is routed a function of the rating of the electronic communication. Electronic communications without URLs are considered appropriate and otherwise routed to the addressee.","The system includes a policy  including an allow\/block logic. The policy determines when to route the electronic communication to the addressee when the policy indicates that the electronic communication passes the allow logic and fails the block logic. The policy  also determines when to inhibit routing of an electronic communication to an addressee when the policy indicates that the electronic communication fails the allow logic and passes the block logic.","The following is an example of a policy for an application that filters email:","messages that do not contain URLs are routed to the end-user;","messages that come from a trusted source are routed to the end-user;","messages that contain ANY pornographic URLs are blocked for children;","messages that contain more than 10% pornographic URLs are blocked for adult users;","messages that contain more than 20% of URLs that belong to some other inappropriate category are blocked for all users;","etc.","In summary, a client system  as illustrated in  includes a client computer  having a memory M and having electronic communications capability for receiving electronic communications  from a source (server ) for presentation to the client. The system  further includes instructions for receiving the electronic communications  from the server  and storing the received electronic communications  in the memory M while initially inhibiting client access to the electronic communications. The system  further includes instructions for categorizing the electronic communications  stored in the memory M based on the URLs in the electronic communication. The system  further includes instructions for routing the electronic communication to the client and\/or permitting client access to a particular electronic communication  as a function of the category of the electronic communication. In one embodiment, the instructions are stored on a computer readable medium and accessed by the client computer .","One embodiment of the invention may also be implemented by a server system  as illustrated in . System  includes a server computer  having a memory M and having communications capability for receiving electronic communications  from a source (such as a network; not shown) for presentation to the client . The system  further includes instructions for receiving electronic communications from the source and for categorizing the electronic communications based on the URLs therein. As noted above, the URL parser  parses the electronic communication for URLs, the URLs are categorized by OLTK  via CNS server  accessing URL database , and the electronic communication is rated by policy  based on the categories of the URLs. The system  further includes instructions for selectively sending a particular electronic communication  to the client  as a function of the rating or category of the electronic communication. In one embodiment, the instructions are stored on a computer readable medium and accessed by the server .","Referring to , operation of both the client system  and the server system  is illustrated. Specifically, both systems receive an electronic communication at . The electronic communication is parsed at . URLs within the parsed electronic communication are identified at . The policy is applied at . The electronic communication is routed to the client at  if the electronic communication passes the policy or is routed to a controlled area or deleted at  if the electronic communication fails the policy. For example, an email to a child may be routed to an adult whereas a chat message may be blocked (i.e., deleted).","The system and method according to one embodiment of the invention is also applicable to a web server which manages web pages of a website. In this embodiment, the invention controls the content of the web pages and controls access to the pages when the content of the pages is created by third parties independent of the control of the web server. Referring to , a system  is illustrated for controlling access by third parties to web pages  under the control of a web server . This system  is particularly useful for managing a group website or a home page website. As described herein, one embodiment of the invention relates to the parsing and access control of web pages. Other embodiments includes parsing and control of part of or an entire website or controlling access to a website based on the parsing and rating of one or more pages of the website.","The system includes instructions  for parsing each web page . URLs within the parsed web page are identified and categorized, as noted above, by a OLTK , CNS server  and URL database . Third party users  are permitted to access the web page as a function of the categorized URLs. As noted above with regard to electronic communications, each web page may be rated as a function of its identified URLs and third parties are permitted to access the web page as a function of the rating of the web page. Similarly, the rating may include rating each identified URL as appropriate or inappropriate. For example, a third party is blocked from accessing the web page (or website, as noted above) when the rating of the page based on its URLs is considered inappropriate (e.g., higher than a threshold amount) or when the percentage of inappropriate URLs relative to the total of inappropriate and appropriate URLs of the web page (or website) is greater than a threshold amount. The threshold amount may be a dynamic or weighted amount based on various factors. For example, the threshold amount may be a numerical total or a percentage such as approximately 50% or more, at least 10% or another amount.","With specific reference to , the server side hardware system  comprises a server computer  presenting a plurality of web pages  on a network  and having the capability of controlling access by third party users . The system  periodically parses each web page at  and identifies URLs within the web page at . The system  includes instructions for categorizing the web pages based on URLs therein by applying a policy at . The system  includes instructions  for permitting client access to a particular web page as a function of the categorization of the web page or for limiting access at . In one embodiment, the instructions are in the form of an allow\/block logic (policy)  and are stored on a computer readable medium and accessed by the server .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0099","num":"0107"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","602","604","606","608","610","608","616","108"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0100","num":"0108"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["130","130","130","132","134","136","134","132","136"]},"The computer  typically has at least some form of computer readable media. Computer readable media, which include both volatile and nonvolatile media, removable and non-removable media, may be any available medium that can be accessed by computer . By way of example and not limitation, computer readable media comprise computer storage media and communication media. Computer storage media include volatile and nonvolatile, removable and non-removable media implemented in any method or technology for storage of information such as computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules or other data. For example, computer storage media include RAM, ROM, EEPROM, flash memory or other memory technology, CD-ROM, digital versatile disks (DVD) or other optical disk storage, magnetic cassettes, magnetic tape, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium that can be used to store the desired information and that can be accessed by computer . Communication media typically embody computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules, or other data in a modulated data signal such as a carrier wave or other transport mechanism and include any information delivery media. Those skilled in the art are familiar with the modulated data signal, which has one or more of its characteristics set or changed in such a manner as to encode information in the signal. Wired media, such as a wired network or direct-wired connection, and wireless media, such as acoustic, RF, infrared, and other wireless media, are examples of communication media. Combinations of the any of the above are also included within the scope of computer readable media.","The system memory  includes computer storage media in the form of removable and\/or non-removable, volatile and\/or nonvolatile memory. In the illustrated embodiment, system memory  includes read only memory (ROM)  and random access memory (RAM) . A basic input\/output system  (BIOS), containing the basic routines that help to transfer information between elements within computer , such as during start-up, is typically stored in ROM . RAM  typically contains data and\/or program modules that are immediately accessible to and\/or presently being operated on by processing unit . By way of example, and not limitation,  illustrates operating system , application programs , other program modules , and program data .","The computer  may also include other removable\/non-removable, volatile\/nonvolatile computer storage media. For example,  illustrates a hard disk drive  that reads from or writes to non-removable, nonvolatile magnetic media.  also shows a magnetic disk drive  that reads from or writes to a removable, nonvolatile magnetic disk , and an optical disk drive  that reads from or writes to a removable, nonvolatile optical disk  such as a CD-ROM or other optical media. Other removable\/non-removable, volatile\/nonvolatile computer storage media that can be used in the exemplary operating environment include, but are not limited to, magnetic tape cassettes, flash memory cards, digital versatile disks, digital video tape, solid state RAM, solid state ROM, and the like. The hard disk drive , and magnetic disk drive  and optical disk drive  are typically connected to the system bus  by a non-volatile memory interface, such as interface .","The drives or other mass storage devices and their associated computer storage media discussed above and illustrated in , provide storage of computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules and other data for the computer . In , for example, hard disk drive  is illustrated as storing operating system , application programs , other program modules , and program data . Note that these components can either be the same as or different from operating system , application programs , other program modules , and program data . Operating system , application programs , other program modules , and program data  are given different numbers here to illustrate that, at a minimum, they are different copies.","A user may enter commands and information into computer  through input devices or user interface selection devices such as a keyboard  and a pointing device  (e.g., a mouse, trackball, pen, or touch pad). Other input devices (not shown) may include a microphone, joystick, game pad, satellite dish, scanner, or the like. These and other input devices are connected to processing unit  through a user input interface  that is coupled to system bus , but may be connected by other interface and bus structures, such as a parallel port, game port, or a Universal Serial Bus (USB). A monitor  or other type of display device is also connected to system bus  via an interface, such as a video interface . In addition to the monitor , computers often include other peripheral output devices (not shown) such as a printer and speakers, which may be connected through an output peripheral interface (not shown).","The computer  may operate in a networked environment using logical connections to one or more remote computers, such as a remote computer .
