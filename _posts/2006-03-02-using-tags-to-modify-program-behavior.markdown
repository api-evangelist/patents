{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["The invention relates to the field of controlling electronic devices and to modifying their behavior responsive to the environment.","US 2002\/0174025 shows a method and system for providing targeted advertising and personalized customer services. This system envisions a shopping cart with RFID-tagged products. The RFID tags trigger a wireless communication device such as a PDA, mobile phone, pager, or special shopping cart attachment device to deliver customized advertising based on what products are in the shopping cart.","It would be desirable to use transmitters attached to devices to influence behavior of devices in other ways.","For instance, a group of electronic devices premises might communicate with each other in order to affect application behavior, especially devices co-located within a user premises. Such communication might result in changes in program behavior; or changes in state of the devices; or changes in program content.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["101","102","103","103","102","101","106","107","105","103","104","101"]},"One option for wireless communication is to use passive or active RF tags on the consumer devices . Preferably, the type of tag used is readable within the common dimensions of a large room, or an apartment. Such tags are preferably affixed by the manufacturer of a device, such as a consumer device, and programmed to contain an identification of the device. Manufacturers may do this for their own reasons. Alternatively, the tags may be affixed at the request of someone who wishes to implement the invention. This identification preferably includes brand name, type of product, and a serial or model number. The processor could then access some sort of database, whether local or remote, to get other information about the device. This database might be as simple as a table within the receiving device, or as complex as a remote server.","Examples of information the tag could provide are:\n\n","Purchase date, color, shape and value can all be regarded as examples of states of the device. If privacy of the owner of the device is desired, the tags could omit any personal identifying information relating to the owner.","Various changes in program behavior might result from such states.","For example, if the application, see  discussed below, is running inside a television and detects both that one of the devices  is a telephone and that the state of the telephone is ringing, the application  might issue a control command to lower the volume of the television so that the user can hear the ringing. This is an example of an audio output device changing its audio output in response to a state of another device.","Similarly, if the application  is running within a television and detects that a microwave oven is on in the user premises, the application  might signal the television to tune to a cooking program. This is an example of a consumer device choosing a transmitted signal in response to a state of anther device.","In still another example, if a video game player is detected in the room, the application  could make its skin, or other visual attribute, to look like the video game that is currently playing. More about skin can be found at http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Skin %28computing%29 Similarly, suppose the application  has several skins and wants to select one for every specific user. For this, it scans the status of all tags around the receiver. Suppose it finds two black phones, a metallic microwave and a silver game console. It could use this color information to select a skin that has a metallic look. This might be expected to be aesthetically pleasing to the user, since the user has other devices with metallic looks. Analogously, if several oval devices are in the room, a skin with oval theme can be selected. These are examples of a device changing a visual attribute in response to a state of another device.","If a transmitted program has selectable plot or character options, those might also be selected responsive to devices in the room. For instance, if children's toys are detected, plot or character options more suitable to children might be presented.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["201","206","208","204","207","209","1","201","202","203"]},"The antenna  receives RF signals from all three tags , , and , i.e. including from the tag of its own device. Accordingly, the RF reader  can act on all of this data.","The receiver  will need to distinguish its own tag  from the tags ,  of the other devices. There are several ways in which this might be accomplished.\n\n","The SW portion includes several modules.","One is a Multimedia Home Platform (MHP)  or OpenCable Applications Platform (OCAP). More information about MHP can be found at http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/MHP OCAP is a similar system to MHP, but intended for the US market.","A second is the MHP application , which will be discussed further below.","A third module is the RF extension to the MHP\/OCAP , which obtains an identification number (ID) from the RF tags , associated with the various devices. If an application  can know on which brand it is running on, it can execute the program code that works for this specific brand. The module  is an Application Program Interface (API). More information about API's can be found at http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/API. The API interacts with a vendor data base . Code associated with the API and used to gather information as part of the invention is illustrated with respect to .  is useful for MHP interoperability, in other words, making sure that MHP applications can run on any brand hardware.  is useful for finding out characteristics of the environment of the user premises.  gives a more detailed picture of the environment by retrieving more details from the devices in the neighborhood.","The invention could also be used in the context of an ordinary application, not based on MHP or OCAP middleware. In that case, instead of the RF extension to MHP\/OCAP, there would be a software library.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["201","210","301","212","302","302","213","303","303","214","304","304","213","305","212","212","306","211","307","212","308","210","210","309"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 2","FIG. 4","FIG. 2"],"b":["206","208","2","210","401","212","402","207","209","402","213","403","403","207","209","404","404","213","405","212","212","406","211","1","2","3","407","212","1","2","3","408","210","210","409"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4","FIG. 5","FIG. 2"],"b":["206","208","210","501","212","502","207","209","502","213","503","503","207","209","504","504","213","505","212","212","508","210","509"]},"MHP is an application execution environment that is independent of the underlying, vendor-specific hardware. This means that MHP applications, shown at , theoretically should be able to run on any MHP hardware of any brand. This is the theory, but in practice it is very hard to write applications that work on all brands. Some program code needs to be different for different brands.","An example of this is to be found in . At , the receiver  decides that, in order to draw something on a display screen, it must hide the current video display of a television. How this is to be done will depend on the brand of the television. The MHP application  is designed to be general purpose therefore it has code for several brands to allow it to hide video in different ways dependent on the design of the various brands. At , the receiver scans its own device tag\u2014or what it believes to be its own device tag\u2014to determine what brand of television it finds itself in. If it determines that it is in a Brand A television, then at  it will issue a command to scale the video to (,). If a Brand B television is detected, than at  the MHP  will issue a command to hide the video layer. If a Brand C television is detected, than at  the MHP  will issue commands to pause the video and blank the screen. After the appropriate command is issued, control proceeds to , where other application tasks are continued.","The embodiments described above relate to an MHP application. The invention could also be applied to a PC environment, with a PC application running under an operating system such as Windows, rather than an MHP application. The Windows environment would have to be extended with the RF extension API. Other intelligent appliances such as mobile phones and PDAs might implement the invention as well. Other types of middleware software could be used instead of MHP\/OCAP, such as the standards devised by the Multimedia and Hypermedia information coding Expert Group (\u201cMHEG\u201d) as described in http.\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mheg, OpenTV as described in http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/OpenTV, MediaHighway http:\/\/www.nds.com\/middleware\/middleware.html, Liberate available from http:\/\/www.liberate.com\/, or JavaTV described at http:\/\/java.sun.com\/products\/javatv\/overview.html.","From reading the present disclosure, other modifications will be apparent to persons skilled in the art.
