Field of the Invention","Embodiments of the present invention are directed to determining whether to permit a communication session between two or more parties within a wireless communications system.","2. Description of the Related Art","Wireless communication systems have developed through various generations, including a first-generation analog wireless phone service (1G), a second-generation (2G) digital wireless phone service (including interim 2.5G and 2.75G networks) and a third-generation (3G) high speed data\/Internet-capable wireless service. There are presently many different types of wireless communication systems in use, including Cellular and Personal Communications Service (PCS) systems. Examples of known cellular systems include the cellular Analog Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS), and digital cellular systems based on Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA), Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), the Global System for Mobile access (GSM) variation of TDMA, and newer hybrid digital communication systems using both TDMA and CDMA technologies.","The method for providing CDMA mobile communications was standardized in the United States by the Telecommunications Industry Association\/Electronic Industries Association in TIA\/EIA\/IS-95-A entitled \u201cMobile Station-Base Station Compatibility Standard for Dual-Mode Wideband Spread Spectrum Cellular System,\u201d referred to herein as IS-95. Combined AMPS & CDMA systems are described in TIA\/EIA Standard IS-98. Other communications systems are described in the IMT-2000\/UM, or International Mobile Telecommunications System 2000\/Universal Mobile Telecommunications System, standards covering what are referred to as wideband CDMA (WCDMA), CDMA2000 (such as CDMA2000 1xEV-DO standards, for example) or TD-SCDMA.","In wireless communication systems, mobile stations, handsets, or access terminals (AT) receive signals from fixed position base stations (also referred to as cell sites or cells) that support communication links or service within particular geographic regions adjacent to or surrounding the base stations. Base stations provide entry points to an access network (AN)\/radio access network (RAN), which is generally a packet data network using standard Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) based protocols that support methods for differentiating traffic based on Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. Therefore, the base stations generally interact with ATs through an over the air interface and with the AN through Internet Protocol (IP) network data packets.","In wireless telecommunication systems, Push-to-talk (PTT) capabilities are becoming popular with service sectors and consumers. PTT can support a \u201cdispatch\u201d voice service that operates over standard commercial wireless infrastructures, such as CDMA, FDMA, TDMA, GSM, etc. In a dispatch model, communication between endpoints (ATs) occurs within virtual groups, wherein the voice of one \u201ctalker\u201d is transmitted to one or more \u201clisteners.\u201d A single instance of this type of communication is commonly referred to as a dispatch call, or simply a PTT call. A PTT call is an instantiation of a group, which defines the characteristics of a call. A group in essence is defined by a member list and associated information, such as group name or group identification.","Conventionally, data packets within a wireless communications network have been configured to be sent to a single destination or access terminal. A transmission of data to a single destination is referred to as \u201cunicast\u201d. As mobile communications have increased, the ability to transmit given data concurrently to multiple access terminals has become more important. Accordingly, protocols have been adopted to support concurrent data transmissions of the same packet or message to multiple destinations or target access terminals. A \u201cbroadcast\u201d refers to a transmission of data packets to all destinations or access terminals (e.g., within a given cell, served by a given service provider, etc.), while a \u201cmulticast\u201d refers to a transmission of data packets to a given group of destinations or access terminals. In an example, the given group of destinations or \u201cmulticast group\u201d may include more than one and less than all of possible destinations or access terminals (e.g., within a given group, served by a given service provider, etc.). However, it is at least possible in certain situations that the multicast group comprises only one access terminal, similar to a unicast, or alternatively that the multicast group comprises all access terminals (e.g., within a cell or sector), similar to a broadcast.","Broadcasts and\/or multicasts may be performed within wireless communication systems in a number of ways, such as performing a plurality of sequential unicast operations to accommodate the multicast group, allocating a unique broadcast\/multicast channel (BCH) for handling multiple data transmissions at the same time and the like. A conventional system using a broadcast channel for push-to-talk communications is described in United States Patent Application Publication No. 2007\/0049314 dated Mar. 1, 2007 and entitled \u201cPush-To-Talk Group Call System Using CDMA 1 x-EVDO Cellular Network\u201d, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. As described in Publication No. 2007\/0049314, a broadcast channel can be used for push-to-talk calls using conventional signaling techniques. Although the use of a broadcast channel may improve bandwidth requirements over conventional unicast techniques, the conventional signaling of the broadcast channel can still result in additional overhead and\/or delay and may degrade system performance.","The 3Generation Partnership Project 2 (\u201c3GPP2\u201d) defines a broadcast-multicast service (BCMCS) specification for supporting multicast communications in CDMA2000 networks. Accordingly, a version of 3GPP2's BCMCS specification, entitled \u201cCDMA2000 High Rate Broadcast-Multicast Packet Data Air Interface Specification\u201d, dated Feb. 14, 2006, Version 1.0 C.S0054-A, is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","Embodiments include systems, apparatuses and methods of determining whether to permit a call to an access terminal. A second party is determined to be available for a communication session between a first party and the second party. Location information associated with a call permissions rule set is obtained, where the call permissions rule set includes at least one rule related to whether a communication session between the first and second parties is permissible. Further, at least one rule includes one or more location-based rules. Location information is obtained that is associated with the second party. Then, it is determined whether to permit the communication session based on the obtained location information associated with the call permissions rule set and the obtained location information associated with the second party.","Aspects of the invention are disclosed in the following description and related drawings directed to specific embodiments of the invention. Alternate embodiments may be devised without departing from the scope of the invention. Additionally, well-known elements of the invention will not be described in detail or will be omitted so as not to obscure the relevant details of the invention.","The words \u201cexemplary\u201d and\/or \u201cexample\u201d are used herein to mean \u201cserving as an example, instance, or illustration.\u201d Any embodiment described herein as \u201cexemplary\u201d and\/or \u201cexample\u201d is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments. Likewise, the term \u201cembodiments of the invention\u201d does not require that all embodiments of the invention include the discussed feature, advantage or mode of operation.","Further, many embodiments are described in terms of sequences of actions to be performed by, for example, elements of a computing device. It will be recognized that various actions described herein can be performed by specific circuits (e.g., application specific integrated circuits (ASICs)), by program instructions being executed by one or more processors, or by a combination of both. Additionally, these sequence of actions described herein can be considered to be embodied entirely within any form of computer readable storage medium having stored therein a corresponding set of computer instructions that upon execution would cause an associated processor to perform the functionality described herein. Thus, the various aspects of the invention may be embodied in a number of different forms, all of which have been contemplated to be within the scope of the claimed subject matter. In addition, for each of the embodiments described herein, the corresponding form of any such embodiments may be described herein as, for example, \u201clogic configured to\u201d perform the described action.","A High Data Rate (HDR) subscriber station, referred to herein as an access terminal (AT), may be mobile or stationary, and may communicate with one or more HDR base stations, referred to herein as modem pool transceivers (MPTs) or base stations (BS). An access terminal transmits and receives data packets through one or more modem pool transceivers to an HDR base station controller, referred to as a modem pool controller (MPC), base station controller (BSC) and\/or packet control function (PCF). Modem pool transceivers and modem pool controllers are parts of a network called an access network. An access network transports data packets between multiple access terminals.","The access network may be further connected to additional networks outside the access network, such as a corporate intranet or the Internet, and may transport data packets between each access terminal and such outside networks. An access terminal that has established an active traffic channel connection with one or more modem pool transceivers is called an active access terminal, and is said to be in a traffic state. An access terminal that is in the process of establishing an active traffic channel connection with one or more modem pool transceivers is said to be in a connection setup state. An access terminal may be any data device that communicates through a wireless channel or through a wired channel, for example using fiber optic or coaxial cables. An access terminal may further be any of a number of types of devices including but not limited to PC card, compact flash, external or internal modem, or wireless or wireline phone. The communication link through which the access terminal sends signals to the modem pool transceiver is called a reverse link or traffic channel. The communication link through which a modem pool transceiver sends signals to an access terminal is called a forward link or traffic channel. As used herein the term traffic channel can refer to either a forward or reverse traffic channel.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","120","102","126","102","108","110","112","102","108","110","112"]},"Referring back to , the components of the wireless network  and interrelation of the elements of the exemplary embodiments of the invention are not limited to the configuration illustrated. System  is merely exemplary and can include any system that allows remote access terminals, such as wireless client computing devices , , ,  to communicate over-the-air between and among each other and\/or between and among components connected via the air interface  and RAN , including, without limitation, carrier network , the Internet, and\/or other remote servers.","The RAN  controls messages (typically sent as data packets) sent to a base station controller\/packet control function (BSC\/PCF) . The BSC\/PCF  is responsible for signaling, establishing, and tearing down bearer channels (i.e., data channels) between a packet data service node  (\u201cPDSN\u201d) and the access terminals \/\/\/. If link layer encryption is enabled, the BSC\/PCF  also encrypts the content before forwarding it over the air interface . The function of the BSC\/PCF  is well-known in the art and will not be discussed further for the sake of brevity. The carrier network  may communicate with the BSC\/PCF  by a network, the Internet and\/or a public switched telephone network (PSTN). Alternatively, the BSC\/PCF  may connect directly to the Internet or external network. Typically, the network or Internet connection between the carrier network  and the BSC\/PCF  transfers data, and the PSTN transfers voice information. The BSC\/PCF  can be connected to multiple base stations (BS) or modem pool transceivers (MPT) . In a similar manner to the carrier network, the BSC\/PCF  is typically connected to the MPT\/BS  by a network, the Internet and\/or PSTN for data transfer and\/or voice information. The MPT\/BS  can broadcast data messages wirelessly to the access terminals, such as cellular telephone . The MPT\/BS , BSC\/PCF  and other components may form the RAN , as is known in the art. However, alternate configurations may also be used and the invention is not limited to the configuration illustrated. For example, in another embodiment the functionality of the BSC\/PCF  and one or more of the MPT\/BS  may be collapsed into a single \u201chybrid\u201d module having the functionality of both the BSC\/PCF  and the MPT\/BS .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["126","126","160","165","170","175","170","160","175","170","102","108","110","112","120","160","160","160","120","122"]},"Referring to , the broadcast serving node (BSN)  may be configured to support multicast and broadcast services. The BSN  will be described in greater detail below. The BSN  communicates with the RAN  (e.g., the BSC\/PCF ) via a broadcast (BC) A10 connection, and with the application server  via the Internet . The BCA10 connection is used to transfer multicast and\/or broadcast messaging. Accordingly, the application server  sends unicast messaging to the PDSN  via the Internet , and sends multicast messaging to the BSN  via the Internet .","Generally, as will be described in greater detail below, the RAN  transmits multicast messages, received from the BSN  via the BCA10 connection, over a broadcast channel (BCH) of the air interface  to one or more access terminals .","Referring to , an access terminal , (here a wireless device), such as a cellular telephone, has a platform  that can receive and execute software applications, data and\/or commands transmitted from the RAN  that may ultimately come from the carrier network , the Internet and\/or other remote servers and networks. The platform  can include a transceiver  operably coupled to an application specific integrated circuit (\u201cASIC\u201d ), or other processor, microprocessor, logic circuit, or other data processing device. The ASIC  or other processor executes the application programming interface (\u201cAPI\u2019)  layer that interfaces with any resident programs in the memory  of the wireless device. The memory  can be comprised of read-only or random-access memory (RAM and ROM), EEPROM, flash cards, or any memory common to computer platforms. The platform  also can include a local database  that can hold applications not actively used in memory . The local database  is typically a flash memory cell, but can be any secondary storage device as known in the art, such as magnetic media, EEPROM, optical media, tape, soft or hard disk, or the like. The internal platform  components can also be operably coupled to external devices such as antenna , display , push-to-talk button  and keypad  among other components, as is known in the art.","Accordingly, an embodiment of the invention can include an access terminal including the ability to perform the functions described herein. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the various logic elements can be embodied in discrete elements, software modules executed on a processor or any combination of software and hardware to achieve the functionality disclosed herein. For example, ASIC , memory , API  and local database  may all be used cooperatively to load, store and execute the various functions disclosed herein and thus the logic to perform these functions may be distributed over various elements. Alternatively, the functionality could be incorporated into one discrete component. Therefore, the features of the access terminal in  are to be considered merely illustrative and the invention is not limited to the illustrated features or arrangement.","The wireless communication between the access terminal  and the RAN  can be based on different technologies, such as code division multiple access (CDMA), WCDMA, time division multiple access (TDMA), frequency division multiple access (FDMA), Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), or other protocols that may be used in a wireless communications network or a data communications network. The data communication is typically between the client device , MPT\/BS , and BSC\/PCF . The BSC\/PCF  can be connected to multiple data networks such as the carrier network , PSTN, the Internet, a virtual private network, and the like, thus allowing the access terminal  access to a broader communication network. As discussed in the foregoing and known in the art, voice transmission and\/or data can be transmitted to the access terminals from the RAN using a variety of networks and configurations. Accordingly, the illustrations provided herein are not intended to limit the embodiments of the invention and are merely to aid in the description of aspects of embodiments of the invention.","Below, a description of conventional call permission enforcement is described, followed by call permission enforcement according to embodiments of the present invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["400","1","1","1","1","1"]},"In , the application server  announces a call with a call announcement message (e.g., a PTT or PTX call announce message) that includes a calling party ID of the call initiator (e.g., a PTT initiator, a PTX initiator, a unicast call initiator, etc.). The announced call can be for a unicast call, or a multicast call. In other words, while the application server  is described above with respect to ,  and  as being a multicast server, the application server  may alternatively correspond to a unicast server.","AT  receives the call announcement message from the application server , and determines whether to permit the call based on the calling party ID of the calling party and the call permissions rule set, . For example, AT  compares the calling party ID received with the call announcement message in  with the listed calling party IDs in the call permissions rule set established in . If AT  finds a matching calling party ID, AT  next determines the call permissions associated with the matching calling party ID to determine whether the call can be permitted.","In , if AT  determines not to permit the call, AT  blocks or ignores the call announcement message, . For example, in , AT  drops the call announcement packet such that AT  is not aware that the call was ever announced. Alternatively, in another example, AT  can be notified that the call announcement message was received and rejected, pursuant to the call permissions rule set. Otherwise, if AT  determines to permit the call, the process of  advances to .","In an example, in , AT  notifies a user of AT  of the call announcement message (e.g., prompts the user for an accept\/reject indication), and the user can then determine whether to accept the call. In this example, if the call is determined to be permitted by the call permissions rule set in , the user still has the option to overrule the call permissions rule set and reject the call. Alternatively, in another example, AT  may automatically accept the call in  without first obtaining user permission. Irrespective of the manner by which calls are accepted,  of  assumes that AT  accepts the call.","As will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art, the call permissions rule set used to determine call permissions in  has some flexibility with regard to calling party ID, time-parameters, etc. However, conventional call permissions rule sets do not include location criteria associated with a calling party as a factor in determining call permissions. Accordingly, embodiments of the invention, described below, are directed to determining whether to permit a call based at least in part upon location criteria associate with a calling party.","As will now be described in greater detail, embodiments of the invention, described below, are directed to determining whether to permit a call based at least in part upon location information associated with a calling party. While the examples provided below are described in, in some instances, with respect to multicast calls (e.g., push-to-talk (PTT) calls, push-to-transfer (PTX) calls, QChat calls, etc.) where the application server  is embodied as a multicast server, it will be appreciated that other embodiments of the present invention can be directed to unicast calls.","As used herein, \u201clocation information\u201d is intended to be interpreted broadly, and can be indicative of a geographic range or area (e.g., a sector, or other geographic partition), a geographic coordinate, a street or address (e.g., \u201c80E. Avenue\u201d, \u201c1773 oak farm crossing, Oakton, Va.\u201d, etc.), a building (e.g., \u201cShea Stadium\u201d, \u201cThe Empire State Building\u201d, etc.) and\/or any other metric that can be used to indicate location.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 4"],"b":["500","1"]},"In an example, the location-based call permissions rule set can include \u201cglobal\u201d location-based call permissions rules that apply to all calling parties, or can include more selective location-based call permissions rules that apply to less than all calling parties. For example, a first location-based call permissions rule can be applied to a first set of calling parties (e.g., \u201cBusiness Contacts\u201d, etc.), a second location-based call permissions rule can be applied to a second set of calling parties (e.g., \u201cFamily Contacts\u201d, etc.) and a non-location-based call permissions rule (e.g., such as a conventional calling party ID or time-based rule) can be applied to a third set of calling parties (e.g., \u201cEmergency Contacts\u201d, etc.).

One or more of the listed rules may be included within a location-based call permissions rule set, in an example. Also, the scope of the rules may be controlled by a user of AT . For example, if the location-based call permissions rule set includes Rules #1 and #2, Rule #1 may apply to calling parties A, B and C, and Rule #2 may apply to calling parties D, E and F (e.g., where A, B and C correspond to a first type of contact, such as business contact, and D, E and F correspond to a different type of contact). In a further example, the scope of some rules may be limited to unicast calls, while the scope of other rules may be limited to multicast calls. In further examples, rules can be specific to group calls, or non-group calls. Accordingly, it will be appreciated that the scope of the rule(s) are fully customizable by the user.","Again referring to Table 1, Rule #1 sets forth a rule that only calls from calling parties within 5 miles from a given sports arena for the duration of a given sporting event (e.g., a baseball game, a football game, etc.) are permitted. As will be appreciated, to evaluate whether this rule is satisfied (at \/, below), AT  must know (i) the location of the calling party, (ii) the location of the given sports arena, (iii) the time-span of the sporting event and (iv) a current time. It will be appreciated that, without the \u201cduration\u201d aspect of Rule #1, (iii) and (iv) would not be required to evaluate the rule. Rule #2 is similar to Rule #1 in certain aspects, except call announcements satisfying Rule #2 indicate calls that are blocked (i.e., instead of permitted). Rule #3 differs from Rules #1 and #2 because Rule #3 relates to a current position of AT , and not a fixed position (e.g., the sporting arena in Rule #and the hotel in Rule #2 are fixed). Rule #4 is associated with location information related to AT 's current serving sector, and a current serving sector of a calling party. Rule #5 is associated with location information related to a building that currently houses AT  (e.g., which may require a building recognition in addition to a mere geographic location estimate). Similar to Rule#5, Rule #6 is also associated location information related to both AT 's current address (or other building designation), as well as the address or building designation of the calling party. As will be appreciated, the location types of the \u201ccurrent position\u201d of the calling party or AT  in Table 1 (above) can correspond to any type of location information as defined above (e.g., a geographic range or area such as a sector or geographic coordinate range, a geographic coordinate, a street or address, a building, etc., and\/or any other metric that can be used to indicate location).","Rules #1-#6 are intended to demonstrate examples of the different potential location-based call permissions rules that may be established by a user of AT . However, it will be appreciated that, in other embodiments of the invention, different rules and\/or different combinations of rules may be included within the location-based call permissions rule set. Also, while each rule example in Table 1 includes at least one location criterion, in other embodiments of the invention the location-based call permission rule set can include one or more rules that do not include a location criterion. Also, while not illustrated in Table 1, it is possible for AT  to establish one or more calling parties (e.g., emergency contacts) that will always be permitted, irrespective of restrictions set forth by the location-base call permissions rule set.","Further, while not discussed in detail above, AT  may not necessarily have the information required to evaluate one or more rules in the rule set (e.g., for Rule #2, the location of the given hotel may not be known, etc.). In this example, a default permission setting (e.g., always permit, always block, etc.) may be established for calls that cannot be evaluated by the rule set. Hereinafter, it may be assumed for the processes of  for the sake of convenience that AT  can evaluate any location-based rule. Examples of how AT  may acquire the requisite location information to evaluate location-based rules are discussed in more detail below with respect to .","Returning to , in , at some point after the location-based call permissions rule set is established in , assume that the application server receives a request to call AT  (e.g., for a unicast call, a multicast call, etc.). In , the application server  forwards an announce message (e.g., a PTT or PTX call announce message) to the RAN , which transmits the announce message to AT  (e.g., as a data-over-signaling (DOS) message on a control channel (CCH), via a standard paging process, etc.). AT  receives the announce message transmitted in , and determines location information associated with the location-based call permissions rule set, . In other words, in , AT  acquires the location information by which to determine whether to permit the announced call (e.g., the qualifying location information), based on one or more rules included within the location-based call permissions rule set (e.g., the disqualifying location information). For example, assume that the location-based call permissions rule set for AT  includes Rule #1 from Table 1 (above) (Rule #1\u2014\u201cOnly permit calls from calling parties within 5 miles from a given sports arena for the duration of a given sporting event\u201d). In this example, the location information determined in  corresponds to a five-mile radius zone surrounding the given sports arena (e.g., based on a geographic location or the arena as determined by a satellite positioning system (SPS) such as the global positioning system (GPS), a geographic zone or range based on GPS, etc., which can be acquired in advance from an Internet site, manually entered by the user, etc.). While not location-information, the time-span or duration of the given sporting event can also be acquired in  (e.g., 5:00 PM \u20148:00 PM EST on Monday), along with a current time (e.g., a time at which the announce message is received). In another example, if the location-based call permissions rule set includes Rule #3 or Rule #5 from Table 1, then a current position of AT  would also be determined (e.g., based on GPS, a hybrid GPS\/cellular positioning technique, triangulation, etc.).","In , AT  determines location-information associated with the calling party. For example, for Rule #1, this can include determining a geographic location (e.g., computed by GPS, triangulation, etc.) of the calling party. For Rule #5, this includes determining whether the calling party is located within a building, etc. In , AT  determines whether to permit the call based on the location information associated with the location-based call permissions rule set and the location information associated with the calling party. For example, the location information determined in  can be compared with the location information determined in  to determine whether one or more rules of the location-based call permissions rule set permit the call to proceed.","In , if AT  determines not to permit the call, AT  blocks or ignores the call announcement message, . For example, in , AT  drops the call announcement packet such that AT  is not aware that the call was ever announced. Alternatively, in another example, AT  can be notified that the call announcement message was received and rejected, pursuant to the call permissions rule set. Otherwise, if AT  determines to permit the call, the process of  advances to .","In an example, in , AT  notifies a user of AT  of the call announcement message, and the user can then determine whether to accept the call.

At some point after receiving the location-based call permissions rule set, the application server  receives a request to call AT  (e.g., for a unicast call, a multicast call, etc.). In , the application server  determines location information associated with the location-based call permissions rule set, and in , the application server  determines location-information associated with the calling party.  and  of  generally correspond to  and  of , respectively, except  and  are performed at the application server  whereas  and  of  are performed at AT . Accordingly, a further description of  and  has been omitted for the sake of brevity.","In , the application server  determines whether to permit the call (e.g., from the application server's  standpoint, this means whether to announce the call) based on the location information associated with the location-based call permissions rule set and the location information associated with the calling party. For example, the location information determined in  can be compared with the location information determined in  to determine whether one or more rules of the location-based call permissions rule set permit the call to proceed.","In , if the application server  determines not to permit the call, the application server  does not announce the call to AT , . However, as will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art, if the call to be announced is a multicast call, the call announce message may still be transmitted in AT 's sector, such that the call is still announced to AT . In this case,  should be interpreted as indicating that AT  is not factored into the decision regarding the sectors which will announce the multicast session. Otherwise, if the application server  determines to permit the call, the application server  sends the call announce message to AT , . In , assume that AT  sends a message that indicates an acceptance of the announced call. In an example, in , AT  notifies a user of AT  of the call announcement message, and the user can then determine whether to accept the call. In this example, the user still has the option to overrule the call permissions rule set and reject the call. Alternatively, in another example, AT  may automatically accept the call in  without first obtaining user permission. Irrespective of the manner by which calls are accepted,  of  assumes that AT  accepts the call.","While the processes of , as described above, assume that the location information associated with the calling party can be determined at the target AT or AT  () and\/or the application server  (), it will be appreciated that ATs are not necessarily aware of the locations of ATs that call them.

However, embodiments of the present invention are not limited to these particular manners of obtaining the location information, and , for example, can be implemented in any system where this information can be obtained in other embodiments of the present invention.","While embodiments of the invention above have generally been directed to calls, it will be appreciated that other embodiments of the invention may be directed to any type of communication session (e.g., a data transport session, a unicast call or session, a multicast call or session, a direct session between two session participants, etc.). Accordingly, as used herein, \u201ccall\u201d is intended to be interpreted broadly so as to read upon any type of communicative contact to or from an access terminal, and is not necessarily limited to phone calls, for example, unless expressly indicated.

For example, assume that an employer issues a certain number of wireless phones to its employees to be used for work-purposes only. The employer provisions the wireless phones with location-restriction based software that only permits calls (or other types of communication sessions) to be made when the employees are within proximity to designated work areas. Thus, the employer can increase the likelihood that its employees only use their work-phones for work-related objectives by restricting communicative access to the work-phones to work-related areas.","Those of skill in the art will appreciate that information and signals may be represented using any of a variety of different technologies and techniques.
