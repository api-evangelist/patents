title: RFID tag parameter estimation using read difficulty factor
abstract: A Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) system uses read difficulty factors (RDFs) to improve tag-parameter estimation. During inventory, a reader can obtain a tag's item identifier (II), determine a read metric such as a received signal strength indicator (RSSI), retrieve an RDF associated with the II, and adjust the RSSI using the RDF to more accurately estimate a tag parameter such as distance from the reader antenna. The system can then use the estimated distance to categorize the tag.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND","BRIEF SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61\/389,118 filed on Oct. 1, 2010. The disclosures of the provisional patent application are hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes.","Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) systems typically include RFID tags and RFID readers. RFID readers are also known as RFID reader\/writers or RFID interrogators. RFID systems can be used in many ways for locating and identifying items to which the tags are attached. RFID systems are particularly useful in product-related and service-related industries for tracking objects being processed, inventoried, or handled. In such cases, an RFID tag is usually attached to an individual item, or to its package.","In principle, RFID techniques entail using an RFID reader to interrogate one or more RFID tags. The reader transmitting a Radio Frequency (RF) wave performs the interrogation. The RF wave is typically electromagnetic, at least in the far field. The RF wave can also be predominantly electric or magnetic in the near field.","A tag that senses the interrogating RF wave responds by transmitting back another RF wave. The tag generates the transmitted back RF wave either originally, or by reflecting back a portion of the interrogating RF wave in a process known as backscatter. Backscatter may take place in a number of ways.","The reflected-back RF wave may further encode data stored internally in the tag, such as a number. The response is demodulated and decoded by the reader, which thereby identifies, counts, or otherwise interacts with the associated item. The decoded data can denote a serial number, a price, a date, a destination, other attribute(s), any combination of attributes, and so on.","An RFID tag typically includes an antenna and an RFID integrated circuit (IC) including a radio section, a power management section, and frequently a logical section, a memory, or both. In some RFID tags the power management section employs an energy storage device, such as a battery. RFID tags with an energy storage device are known as active or battery-assisted tags. Advances in semiconductor technology have miniaturized the electronics so much that an RFID tag can be powered solely by the RF signal it receives. Such RFID tags do not include an energy storage device such as a battery, and are called passive tags. Regardless of the type, all tags typically store or buffer some energy temporarily in passive storage devices such as capacitors.","An RFID system may be used to discriminate between desired tagged items and undesired tagged items. Undesired tags are also referred to as \u201cstray tags\u201d. Improving the sensitivity and accuracy of the discrimination process may increase the overall performance of the RFID system.","This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.","An RFID system can discriminate desired from undesired tagged items by estimating and using RFID parameters such as tag velocity and tag distance to an RFID reader antenna. RFID systems include, for example, Point-of-Sale (POS) systems that may need to distinguish between tagged items placed on a counter and other tagged items nearby, and inventory management systems that may need to communicate with a desired group of tags and exclude stray tags which may be in the vicinity but not desired to be interrogated. RFID systems may use a variety of read metrics to estimate these tag parameters so as to distinguish desired items from strays. One metric may include an RF characteristic of the signal returned by the tag (e.g. signal strength, phase, Doppler frequency shift). Another may include the reader state when the read occurred (e.g., time of read, antenna on which the tag was read, state of the antenna, number of antennas reading the tag, etc.). Unfortunately, environmental conditions may affect some of these metrics, such as received tag signal strength, and skew the metric. For example, two tagged items may be the same distance from a reader. The first item may be made from an RF transparent material such as paper, while the second may be made from an RF absorbing material such as a liquid-filled bottle, in which case the received signal strength from the tag on the first item may be higher than that from the tag on the second item, causing the reader to erroneously conclude that the first item is closer than the second item.","Embodiments are directed to improving reader-to-tag parameter estimation, such as tag distance to the reader antenna, using a read difficulty factor (RDF). An RFID system may inventory an RFID tag to obtain an item identifier (II). The item identifier is a number stored in the tag to identify the item to which the tag is attached. The RFID system may also determine one or more read metrics during the inventory process. Read metrics may include a received tag signal strength indicator (RSSI) value, a time of a tag read, a Doppler frequency shift, a RF phase, a reader antenna on which a tag is read, an antenna state at a tag read time, a number of antennas on which a tag was read during a time interval, and\/or a number of tag reads during a time interval. The RFID system may then determine the RDF associated with the read II. The determination can be via a look-up of the RDF in a local or remote database, a computation based on a formula, or even from an RDF value transmitted by the tag. The RFID system may then estimate a tag parameter, such as tag distance to the reader antenna, based on the RDF and the one or more determined read metrics. For example, the RFID system may adjust a received RSSI based on the RDF and optionally other metrics and use the adjusted RSSI to estimate the tag distance. The system may then categorize the item based on the estimated parameter. Categories may include desired\/stray or other any other suitable categories.","These and other features and advantages will be apparent from a reading of the following detailed description and a review of the associated drawings. It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are explanatory only and are not restrictive of aspects as claimed.","In the following detailed description, references are made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which are shown by way of illustration specific embodiments or examples. These embodiments or examples may be combined, other aspects may be utilized, and structural changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present disclosure. The following detailed description is therefore not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.","As used herein, a \u201cmemory\u201d is one of ROM, RAM, SRAM, DRAM, NVM, EEPROM, FLASH, Fuses, and FRAM. Some memories or memory portions may be writeable and some not. \u201cSingulation\u201d refers to choosing or isolating a single tag from a population of tags. \u201cCommand\u201d refers to a request for a tag to perform one or more actions. \u201cInventory\u201d is a series of communications between a reader and one or more tags which singulates the tags. The tags provide information stored in their memory such as electronic product codes (EPCs). An \u201cEPC\u201d is one example of an \u201citem identifier\u201d (II) and may be numeric or may be a numeric representation such as an alphanumeric string stored in tag memory. An II may also include a tag identifier (TID), a key identifier (KID), a unique item identifier (UII), and a serialized trade identification number (SGTIN).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","110","112","120","110","112","126","110","126"]},"Reader  and tag  exchange data via wave  and wave . In a session of such an exchange each encodes, modulates, and transmits data to the other, and each receives, demodulates, and decodes data from the other. The data can be modulated onto, and demodulated from, RF waveforms. The RF waveforms are typically in a suitable range of frequencies, such as those near 900 MHz, 2.4 GHz, and so on.","Encoding the data can be performed in a number of ways. For example, protocols are devised to communicate in terms of symbols, also called RFID symbols. A symbol for communicating can be a delimiter, a calibration symbol, and so on. Further symbols can be implemented for ultimately exchanging binary data, such as \u201c0\u201d and \u201c1\u201d, if that is desired. In turn, when the symbols are processed internally by reader  and tag , they can be equivalently considered and treated as numbers having corresponding values, and so on.","Tag  can be a passive tag, or an active or battery-assisted tag (i.e., having its own power source). Where tag  is a passive tag, it is powered from wave .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["220","120","220"]},"Tag  is formed on a substantially planar inlay , which can be made in many ways known in the art. Tag  includes an electrical circuit which is preferably implemented as an integrated circuit (IC)  (also referred to as chip). IC  is arranged on inlay .","Tag  also includes an antenna for exchanging wireless signals with its environment. The antenna is usually flat and formed on inlay . IC  is electrically coupled to the antenna via suitable antenna connections (not shown in ).","The antenna may be made in a number of ways, as discussed in more detail below. In the example of , the antenna is made from two distinct antenna segments , which are shown here forming a dipole. Many other embodiments are possible, using any number of antenna segments.","In some embodiments, an antenna can be made with even a single segment. Different points of the segment can be coupled to one or more of the antenna connections of IC . For example, the antenna can form a single loop, with its ends coupled to the terminals. It should be remembered that, when the single segment has more complex shapes, even a single segment could behave like multiple segments at the frequencies of RFID wireless communication.","In operation, a signal is received by the antenna and communicated to IC . IC  both harvests power, and responds if appropriate, based on the incoming signal and the IC's internal state. In order to respond by replying, IC  modulates the reflectance of the antenna, which generates backscatter  from wave  transmitted by the reader. Coupling together and uncoupling the antenna connections of IC  can modulate the antenna's reflectance, as can a variety of other means.","In the embodiment of , antenna segments  are separate from IC . In other embodiments, antenna segments may alternatively be formed on IC , and so on. Furthermore, an interface element may be used to couple the IC  to the antenna segments  (not shown in ).","The components of the RFID system of  may communicate with each other in any number of modes. One such mode is called full duplex. Another such mode is called half-duplex, and is described below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["300","120","220"]},"RFID reader  and RFID tag  talk and listen to each other by taking turns. As seen on axis TIME, when reader  talks to tag  the communication session is designated as \u201cR\u2192T\u201d, and when tag  talks to reader  the communication session is designated as \u201cT\u2192R\u201d. Along the TIME axis, a sample R\u2192T communication session occurs during a time interval , and a following sample T\u2192R communication session occurs during a time interval . Of course interval  is typically of a different duration than interval \u2014here the durations are shown approximately equal only for purposes of illustration.","According to blocks  and , RFID reader  talks during interval , and listens during interval . According to blocks  and , RFID tag  listens while reader  talks (during interval ), and talks while reader  listens (during interval ).","In terms of actual technical behavior, during interval , reader  talks to tag  as follows. According to block , reader  transmits wave , which was first described in . At the same time, according to block , tag  receives wave  and processes it, to extract data and so on. Meanwhile, according to block , tag  does not backscatter with its antenna, and according to block , reader  has no wave to receive from tag .","During interval , tag  talks to reader  as follows. According to block , reader  transmits a Continuous Wave (CW), which can be thought of as a carrier signal that ideally encodes no information. As discussed before, this carrier signal serves both to be harvested by tag  for its own internal power needs, and also as a wave that tag  can backscatter. Indeed, during interval , according to block , tag  does not receive a signal for processing. Instead, according to block , tag  modulates the CW emitted according to block , so as to generate backscatter wave . Concurrently, according to block , reader  receives backscatter wave  and processes it.","An order, a timing, and\/or other characteristics of RFID communications may be defined by industry and\/or government standards. For example, the Class-1 Generation-2 UHF RFID Protocol for Communications at 860 MHz-960 MHz (\u201cGen2 Specification\u201d) by EPCglobal, Inc. is one such standard.

Local block  includes a block  of an antenna and a driver of the antenna for communicating with the tags. Some readers, like that shown in local block , contain a single antenna and driver. Some readers contain multiple antennas and drivers and a method to switch signals among them, including sometimes using different antennas for transmitting and for receiving. And some readers contain multiple antennas and drivers that can operate simultaneously. A demodulator\/decoder block  demodulates and decodes backscattered waves received from the tags via antenna\/driver block . Modulator\/encoder block  encodes and modulates an RF wave that is to be transmitted to the tags via antenna\/driver block .","Local block  additionally includes an optional local processor . Local processor  may be implemented in any number of ways known in the art. Such ways include, by way of examples and not of limitation, digital and\/or analog processors such as microprocessors and digital-signal processors (DSPs); controllers such as microcontrollers; software running in a machine such as a general purpose computer; programmable circuits such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), Field-Programmable Analog Arrays (FPAAs), Programmable Logic Devices (PLDs), Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC), any combination of one or more of these; and so on. In some cases, some or all of the decoding function in block , the encoding function in block , or both, may be performed instead by local processor . In some cases local processor  may implement an item categorization process based on an RDF-adjusted tag-distance estimation; in some cases one or more of the item categorization functions can be distributed among other blocks, or may be entirely incorporated in another block.","Local block  additionally includes an optional local memory . Local memory  may be implemented in any number of ways known in the art and may be any type of memory as described above. Local memory  can be implemented separately from local processor , or in a single chip with local processor , with or without other components. Local memory , if provided, can store programs for local processor  to run, if needed.","In some embodiments local memory  stores data read from tags or data to be written to tags, such as IIs and read metrics. Local memory  can also include reference data associated with the IIs, instructions and\/or rules for how to encode commands for the tags, modes for controlling antenna , instructions and order of instructions to be sent to the tags, and so on. In some of these embodiments, local memory  is provided as a database.","Some components of local block  typically treat data as analog, such as antenna\/driver block . Other components such as local memory  typically treat data as digital. At some point there is a conversion between analog and digital. Based on where this conversion occurs, a reader may be characterized as \u201canalog\u201d or \u201cdigital\u201d, but most readers contain a mix of analog and digital functionality.","If remote components  are indeed provided, they are coupled to local block  via an electronic communications network . Network  can be a Local Area Network (LAN), a Metropolitan Area Network (MAN), a Wide Area Network (WAN), a network of networks such as the internet, or a mere local communication link, such as a USB, PCI, and so on. In turn, local block  then includes a local network connection  for communicating with communications network . Communications on the network can be secure, such as if they are encrypted or physically protected, or insecure if they are not encrypted or otherwise protected.","There can be one or more remote component(s) . If more than one, they can be located at the same location, or in different locations. They can access each other and local block  via communications network , or via other similar networks, and so on. Accordingly, remote component(s)  can use respective remote network connections. Only one such remote network connection  is shown, which is similar to local network connection , etc.","Remote component(s)  can also include a remote processor .

Remote memory  may also contain information associated with command, tag profiles, instructions, instruction parameters, RDF values and corresponding Hs, or the like, similar to local memory .","Of the above-described elements, it may be advantageous to consider a combination of these components, designated as operational processing block . Operational processing block  includes those components that are provided of the following: local processor , remote processor , local network connection , remote network connection , and by extension an applicable portion of communications network  that links remote network connection  with local network connection . The portion can be dynamically changeable, etc. In addition, operational processing block  can receive and decode RF waves received via antenna , and cause antenna  to transmit RF waves according to what it has processed.","Operational processing block  includes either local processor , or remote processor , or both. If both are provided, remote processor  can be made such that it operates in a way complementary with that of local processor . In fact, the two can cooperate. It will be appreciated that operational processing block , as defined this way, is in communication with both local memory  and remote memory , if both are present.","Accordingly, operational processing block  is location independent, in that its functions can be implemented either by local processor , or by remote processor , or by a combination of both. Some of these functions are preferably implemented by local processor , and some by remote processor . Operational processing block  accesses local memory , or remote memory , or both for storing and\/or retrieving data.","RFID reader  operates by operational processing block  generating communications for RFID tags. These communications are ultimately transmitted by antenna block , with modulator\/encoder block  encoding and modulating the information on an RF wave. Then data is received from the tags via antenna block , demodulated and decoded by demodulator\/decoder block , and processed by processing operational processing block .","Embodiments of an RFID system can be implemented as hardware, software, firmware, or any combination. It is advantageous to consider such a system as subdivided into components or modules. A person skilled in the art will recognize that some of these components or modules can be implemented as hardware, some as software, some as firmware, and some as a combination. An example of such a subdivision is now described, together with the RFID tag as an additional module.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","500"]},"An RFID tag  is considered here as a module by itself RFID tag  conducts a wireless communication  with the remainder, via the air interface . It is noteworthy that air interface  is really only a boundary, in that signals or data that pass through it are not intended to be transformed from one thing to another. Specifications as to how readers and tags are to communicate with each other, for example the Gen2 Specification, also properly characterize that boundary as an interface.","RFID system  includes one or more reader antennas , and an RF front end module  for interfacing with reader antenna(s) . These can be made as described above.","RFID system  also includes a signal-processing module . In one embodiment, signal-processing module  exchanges waveforms with RF front end module .","RFID system  also includes a physical-driver module , which is also known as data-link module. In some embodiments physical-driver module  exchanges bits with signal-processing module . Physical-driver module  can be the stage associated with the framing of data.","RFID system  additionally includes a media access control module , which is also known as MAC layer module. In one embodiment, MAC layer module  exchanges packets of bits with physical driver module . MAC layer module  can make decisions for sharing the medium of wireless communication, which in this case is the air interface.","RFID system  moreover includes an application-programming library-module . This module  can include application programming interfaces (APIs), other objects, etc.","All of these RFID system functionalities can be supported by one or more processors. One of these processors can be considered a host processor. Such a host processor might include a host operating system (OS) and\/or central processing unit (CPU), as in module . In some embodiments, the processor is not considered as a separate module, but one that includes some of the above-mentioned modules of RFID system . In some embodiments the one or more processors may perform operations associated with implementing item categorization using the RDF.","User interface module  may be coupled to application-programming-library module , for accessing the APIs. User interface module  can be manual, automatic, or both. It can be supported by the host OS\/CPU module  mentioned above, or by a separate processor, etc.","It will be observed that the modules of RFID system  form a chain. Adjacent modules in the chain can be coupled by appropriate instrumentalities for exchanging signals. These instrumentalities include conductors, buses, interfaces, and so on. These instrumentalities can be local, e.g. to connect modules that are physically close to each other, or over a network, for remote communication.","The chain is used in one direction for receiving RFID waveforms and in the other direction for transmitting RFID waveforms. In receiving mode, reader antenna(s)  receives wireless waves, which are in turn processed successively by the various modules in the chain. Processing can terminate in any one of the modules. In transmitting mode, waveform initiation can be in any one of the modules. Ultimately, signals are routed to reader antenna(s)  to be transmitted as wireless waves.","The architecture of RFID system  is presented for purposes of explanation, and not of limitation. Its particular subdivision into modules need not be followed for creating embodiments. Furthermore, the features of the present disclosure can be performed either within a single one of the modules, or by a combination of them.","As mentioned previously, embodiments are directed to RDF-based parameter estimation. Embodiments additionally include programs, and methods of operation of the programs. A program is generally defined as a group of steps or operations leading to a desired result, due to the nature of the elements in the steps and their sequence. A program is usually advantageously implemented as a sequence of steps or operations for a processor, such as the structures described above.","Performing the steps, instructions, or operations of a program requires manipulation of physical quantities. Usually, though not necessarily, these quantities may be transferred, combined, compared, and otherwise manipulated or processed according to the steps or instructions, and they may also be stored in a computer-readable medium. These quantities include, for example, electrical, magnetic, and electromagnetic charges or particles, states of matter, and in the more general case can include the states of any physical devices or elements. It is convenient at times, principally for reasons of common usage, to refer to information represented by the states of these quantities as bits, data bits, samples, values, symbols, characters, terms, numbers, or the like. It should be borne in mind, however, that all of these and similar terms are associated with the appropriate physical quantities, and that these terms are merely convenient labels applied to these physical quantities, individually or in groups.","Embodiments furthermore include storage media. Such media, individually or in combination with others, have stored thereon instructions of a program made according to the embodiments. A storage medium according to the embodiments is a computer-readable medium, such as a memory, and is read by a processor of the type mentioned above. If a memory, it can be implemented in a number of ways as described above, some of which are volatile and some nonvolatile.","Even though it is said that the program may be stored in a computer-readable medium, it should be clear to a person skilled in the art that it need not be a single memory, or even a single machine. Various portions, modules or features of it may reside in separate memories, or even separate machines. The separate machines may be connected directly, or through a network such as a local access network (LAN) or a global network such as the Internet.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0079","num":"0078"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},"According to some embodiments, a reader may inventory a population of items 1-N (, , ) via RF link . Each item includes an attached tag (T-T). The tagged item may be identified at a product level (e.g., this item is a specific type of medication) and\/or at a product category level (e.g., this item is medication). The tags may store additional information associated with the items such as date of manufacture, expiration date, manufacturer, lot number, and the like. Items may be identified by their corresponding tags via an II as described above.","In a typical operation, reader  communicates with tags T-Tby transmitting one or more commands from its front end  through antenna , thereby establishing RF link . Each tag may respond with its II  among other things. In addition to receiving the IIs  from the tags, the reader front end  may also measure\/record one or more metrics . For example, reader front end  may measure an RSSI for each tag, a time of tag response, a phase of tag response, and other metrics. An II  and metrics  are then input to a read-category algorithm processing block  implementing a read-category algorithm for categorizing the items based in part on one or more parameters. For example, an item may be categorized based on the direction of movement of its associated tag and\/or the distance from its associated tag to the reader antenna. The read-category algorithm processing block  may be implemented in hardware (e.g., on operational processing block  described in ) or as software programs executing on hardware. According to some embodiments, one of the inputs to the read-category algorithm implemented by processing block  may be an RDF determined from the II received from that tag. Configurable categorization threshold(s)  may also be provided to the read-category algorithm processing block  for outputting item category decision(s) .","The read-category algorithm implemented by processing block  may use \u201cbins\u201d to categorize RDF-adjusted tag-distance estimates into groups. Bins simplify the categorization process, and enable the system to implement a simplified tagged item classification. The outputted categories may include, but are not limited to, near\/far, desired\/stray\/uncertain, genuine\/counterfeit, damaged\/undamaged, moving\/stationary, or other similar categories.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0082"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},"As discussed above, a read-category algorithm  accepts metrics , II , and thresholds  as input. The metrics  may include RSSI , time of tag response , phase of tag response , and other measured or recorded information associated with the tag response. Metrics  may further include RDF . RDF values may be assigned to tagged items based on the items' form or composition, based on analysis, or as a result of measurements. The RDF values may be stored at a network-accessible external database or a local reader database and can be looked up by II or similar method. The RDF values may also be stored in tag memory according to some embodiments and transmitted to an inventorying reader. Alternatively the inventorying reader may be configured to calculate the RDF, or to access another device to perform the calculation. An address of a database or tag memory or device where a particular RDF is stored or calculated may be referred to as an \u201cindex\u201d, in which case the look-up process may include determining an index from an II, then looking up the RDF value at the determined index. Regardless of the method, a reader may use the RDF to adjust its tag parameter estimate. In some embodiments the RDF is determined from testing the tag attached to an item. In some embodiments the RDF is averaged from a plurality of tag reads for a class of items. In some embodiments the RDF is time varying based on a read-history profile and in some embodiments the RDF can be further based on a physical location for the item.","Thresholds  include any threshold TH, TH through TH. Thresholds can be predetermined or adjusted dynamically to alter the output of the read-category algorithm , such as to improve the accuracy of category decision . Additionally multiple thresholds (1-K) can be used to determine the category selection such as near, far, desired, uncertain, stray, genuine or counterfeit, etc.","The read-category algorithm  may be implemented by a general-purpose or special-purpose processor of an RFID reader or by a controller in communication with the reader. In some embodiments, the category decision may be made at the reader and transmitted to a controller. In other embodiments, the decision may be made at a controller based on data provided by the reader. In some embodiments the reader or controller may take an action in response to the category decision. For example, in response to determining an item as stray, a reader may disregard its tag's response (or be instructed to disregard its tag's response). According to another example, in response to determining a tagged item as counterfeit or damaged the reader (or the controller) may alert a designated party.","Thus, the RDF provides an additional input to a read-category algorithm and as such it may influence how other metrics are combined or evaluated. One or more of the metrics may be combined linearly or nonlinearly. In linear combining the metric values are weighted by a multiplicative scale factor and summed to form a composite metric. Any operation on metric values other than linear is defined to be nonlinear combining. More than one composite metric may be calculated as part of read-category algorithm processing. The read-category algorithm may compare the one or more composite metrics to one or more thresholds  to make category decisions.","The RDF may measure how an item can modify an attached tag's returned signal power, phase, Doppler frequency shift, number of reads per time interval, or other metric. According to some embodiments, RDFs may be predetermined through computation, measurement, read history profile, etc. An item may be associated with multiple RDFs (e.g., depending on location and\/or environment). Furthermore, RDFs may be defined for item classes (i.e., a group of same or similar products such as printer paper, construction paper, etc.) or for individual items. According to other embodiments RDFs may be determined time-dynamically from sensor inputs or by other means. Sensor inputs can come from tags or via an external interface from components outside of the RFID system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0089","num":"0088"},"figref":"FIGS. 8A and 8B"},"Tag distance estimations are often based on a tag's RSSI. For example, a reader may interpret a weak RSSI to represent a distant tag and a strong RSSI a nearby tag. In some cases the distance estimation may be enhanced by time, phase, and other measurements. If the RSSI is attenuated by the item or the environment, such as by dielectric loading by the tagged item, or by other factors such as the tag size (e.g., tags for jewelry are inherently smaller than tags for automobile tires and the size difference can translate into RSSI differences) then the distance estimate by the reader may be skewed.","In diagram  of , reader  with antenna  interrogates tags  and  on items  and , respectively. In this example scenario, tags  and  are roughly the same distance from reader . However, the materials, contents, or physical forms of items  and  can affect the tags' RSSI. For example, tag  may be attached to a liquid-filled item  (e.g. a bottle), and tag  may be attached to a paper item . Even though both items are at approximately the same distance, reader  may estimate tag  to be further away than tag  because the liquid loads the antenna of tag  and attenuates the tag's RSSI more than the paper loads the antenna of tag . But, by using RDF values for items  and  (i.e. compensating for the different dielectrics of the two items), reader  can adjust the RSSI values to determine that tags  and  are actually at the same distance.","In diagram  of , reader  with antenna  interrogates tags  and  on items  and , respectively, with similar form and composition as in . In this example scenario, the items are located at different distances from reader . If the reader is trying to determine which item is in a desired zone with a specific location or boundary (such as on a counter at a POS station), it must correctly estimate the distances from antenna  to items  and . However, the items' composition may skew the RSSI values, causing the reader to receive approximately the same RSSI levels from both tags (because liquid-filled item  is attenuating its tag's RSSI more than paper item  does). The reader may conclude, erroneously, that items  and  are at the same distance, and therefore both within (or outside of) the desired zone. In a system according to embodiments, however, the reader may adjust its estimates based on RDF values for both items, enabling it to estimate the distances more accurately and categorize the items correctly.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0093","num":"0092"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},"In the example configuration of diagram , a received II  is provided to a read-category algorithm  along with other measured or recorded metrics  such as RSSI, time of response, phase of response, or any other suitable metric. On a parallel path, an index  for looking up RDF is extracted from the II (). The index is used to look up the RDF associated with the item identified by the II. The look-up may be performed at a local database of a reader system, at a remote database through a networked connection, or computed at either location. The result of the look-up  (the RDF) is also provided as an input to read-category algorithm . The algorithm computes an estimated tag distance based on the metrics, adjusts the estimated distance based on the RDF, and compares the estimated distance to one or more thresholds , arriving at category decision .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0095","num":"0094"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},"The configuration shown in diagram  is an alternative embodiment to that of diagram , in this case with the RDF accessible from tag memory. The RDF may be stored in the memory at any time prior to the read event, such as, for example, at the time of assigning the tag an II, either before or after attaching the tag to the item. Alternatively, the tag may determine its RDF dynamically, such as from a sensor input, and provides the determined RDF to the reader or provides a means (such as a sensor address) by which the reader can extract the RDF. In the example scenario, the reader receives both II  and the means  by which it can extract the RDF from the tag. The extracted RDF is then provided as input to read-category algorithm  along with other metrics  and thresholds , which the algorithm uses to output an item category decision .","As discussed previously, RDF-based tag-distance estimation may be used in POS applications. Items intended for purchase are placed near an RFID-enabled checkout station and read (inventoried) by the RFID system. RDF-based distance estimation may reduce or eliminate stray reads from other merchandise in the store or from items held by other shoppers. RDF-based distance estimation may also enable detection and reporting of damaged or counterfeit items. For example, if the actual distance of a tagged item is known to a reader, and the reader calculates an estimated distance employing RDF-based adjustment which does not match the known distance, the reader can conclude that either the tag (or item) is damaged or the item may be counterfeit with different compositional characteristics. As described above, other uses for RDF-based tag-distance estimation may include inventory applications, shipping and receiving applications, and similar ones.","In some embodiments, RDF values may be used to improve other estimates besides tag distance, such as tag movement (e.g., whether a particular tag is moving and in which direction). As an example of the latter, a received RSSI value lower than an expected RDF-adjusted RSSI value may indicate that there is some problem with the communication link between a tag and a reader.","Embodiments also include methods. Some are methods performed by an RFID reader for estimating tag distance using a RDF. These methods can be implemented in any number of ways, including using the structures described in this document. One such way is by machine operations of devices of the type described in this document. Another way is for one or more of the individual operations to be performed by one or more human operators. These human operators need not be co-located with each other, but each can be with a machine that performs a portion of a program or operation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0100","num":"0099"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},"The example method begins at operation , where the reader inventories an RFID tag to obtain its II. In operation , the reader measures the tag's RSSI. As described above, a reader can use the RSSI as a metric to help determine a category for the tagged item. At operation , the reader determines the RDF associated with the II. The RDF may be determined by a database lookup or calculation from the II. Alternatively, the RDF can be retrieved from the tag. At operation , the reader estimates a tag parameter such as distance, velocity (e.g., if the tag is stationary with zero velocity, or if the tag is moving, how quickly it is moving), or direction of motion using the RSSI, and optionally other metrics, adjusted by the RDF. At optional operation , the reader may determine an item category based on the estimated parameter(s).","The operations described in process  are for illustrative purposes only. Improving tag parameter estimation using an RDF may be performed employing additional or fewer operations and in different orders using the principles described herein. Of course the order of the operations may be modified, some operations eliminated, or other operations added according to other embodiments.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0103","num":"0102"},"figref":"FIG. 12","b":["1200","1200","1240"]},"More particularly, utility  may receive an II and metrics from or about a tag, determine an RDF associated with the II, estimate a parameter of the tag based on the metrics, adjust the estimated parameter using the RDF, and determine a category for the tagged item based on the estimated parameter.","Architecture  additionally includes an interface converter  and an agent . Embodiments also include methods of operation of interface converter . Interface converter  enables agent  to control utility . Interface converter  is so named because it performs a conversion, a change, as will be described in more detail below. Agent , interface converter , and utility  can be implemented in any way known in the art. For example, each can be implemented in hardware, middleware, firmware, software, or any combination thereof. In some embodiments, agent  is a human.","Between interface converter , agent  and utility  there are respective boundaries , . Boundaries ,  are properly called interfaces, in that they are pure boundaries, as is the above described air interface.","In addition, it is a sometimes informal usage to call the space between boundaries  and , which includes interface converter , an \u201cinterface\u201d . Further, it is common to designate this space with a double arrow as shown, with an understanding that operations take place within the arrow. So, although \u201cinterface\u201d  is located at a boundary between agent  and utility , it is not itself a pure boundary. Regardless, the usage of \u201cinterface\u201d  is so common for interface converter  that this document sometimes also refers to it as an interface. It is clear that embodiments of such an \u201cinterface\u201d  can be included in this invention, if they include an interface converter that converts or alters one type of transmission or data to another, as will be seen below.","Agent  can be one or more layers in an architecture. For example, agent  can be something which a programmer may program. In alternative embodiments, where agent  is a human, interface converter  can include a screen, a keyboard, etc. An example is now described.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0109","num":"0108"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIG. 12"],"b":["1350","1350","1350","1240","1240","1350","1240","1260","1240"]},"Returning to , one-way interface converter  can be implemented is as a software Application Programming Interface (API). This API may control or provide inputs to an underlying software library.","Communications can be made between agent , interface converter , and utility . Such communications can be as input or can be converted, using appropriate protocols, etc. These communications may encode commands, data, or any other suitable signal(s). In some embodiments, these communications can include one or more of the following: a high-down communication HDNT from agent  to interface converter ; a low-down communication LDNT from interface converter  to utility ; a low-up communication LUPT from utility  to interface converter ; and a high-up communication HUPT from interface converter  to agent . These communications can be spontaneous, in response to another communication, in response to an input or an interrupt, or in response to any suitable signal or condition.","In certain embodiments, communications HDNT and LDNT include commands for ultimately controlling utility . These commands may control utility  in any number of ways. For example, one or more commands may install utility , or just a feature of it. The installation may be performed by spawning, downloading, or any other suitable installation method. Other ways in which commands may be used to control utility  include configuring, enabling, disabling, or operating utility , or just a feature of it. These commands can be standalone, or can carry parameters, such as data, instructions to be stored by tags, etc. In some embodiments interface converter  can convert these commands to a format suitable for utility .","In some embodiments, communications HUPT and LUPT include data. The data may indicate the success or failure of executing an operation. The data can also include tag data, which can be both codes read from tags and data about reading tags (such as RSSI, RDF, etc.). In some embodiments interface converter  can convert the data to a format suitable for agent , including in some cases aggregating, filtering, merging, or otherwise altering the format or utility of the data.","It should be noted that what passes across a single pure boundary is unchanged (by the mere definition of what is a pure boundary). However, signals or communications passing through interface converter  may be changed. More particularly, high-down communication HDNT may have encoding similar to or different from low-down communication LDNT. In addition, low-up communication LUPT may have encoding similar to or different from high-up communication HUPT. If encoding between signals\/communications is different, the difference can be attributed to interface converter , which performs a suitable change, or conversion, of one communication to another. The interface converter  may perform changes or conversions in order to expose the functionality of utility  to agent  and vice versa. In some embodiments, a command is converted, but a parameter is passed along without being converted. What is not converted at one module may be converted at another. Such modules taken together can also form an interface converter according to embodiments.","Agent , interface converter , and utility  can be implemented as part of a reader, or as a different device. In embodiments where the agent , interface converter , and utility  are implemented as part of a reader,  suggests a scheme  where agent , interface converter , and utility  can be implemented in connection with respective reader modules that are suitable, depending on the requirements.","The foregoing detailed description has set forth various embodiments of the devices and\/or processes via the use of block diagrams and\/or examples. Insofar as such block diagrams and\/or examples contain one or more functions and\/or aspects, it will be understood by those within the art that each function and\/or aspect within such block diagrams or examples may be implemented, according to embodiments formed, individually and\/or collectively, by a wide range of hardware, software, firmware, or virtually any combination thereof.","The present disclosure is not to be limited in terms of the particular embodiments described in this application, which are intended as illustrations of various aspects. Many modifications and variations can be made without departing from its spirit and scope, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Functionally equivalent methods and apparatuses within the scope of the disclosure, in addition to those enumerated herein, will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the foregoing descriptions. Such modifications and variations are intended to fall within the scope of the appended claims. The present disclosure is to be limited only by the terms of the appended claims, along with the full scope of equivalents to which such claims are entitled. It is to be understood that this disclosure is not limited to particular methods, configurations, antennas, transmission lines, and the like, which can, of course, vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only, and is not intended to be limiting.","With respect to the use of substantially any plural and\/or singular terms herein, those having skill in the art can translate from the plural to the singular and\/or from the singular to the plural as is appropriate to the context and\/or application. The various singular\/plural permutations may be expressly set forth herein for sake of clarity.","It will be understood by those within the art that, in general, terms used herein, and especially in the appended claims (e.g., bodies of the appended claims) are generally intended as \u201copen\u201d terms (e.g., the term \u201cincluding\u201d should be interpreted as \u201cincluding but not limited to,\u201d the term \u201chaving\u201d should be interpreted as \u201chaving at least,\u201d the term \u201cincludes\u201d should be interpreted as \u201cincludes but is not limited to,\u201d etc.). It will be further understood that if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is intended, such an intent will be explicitly recited in the claim, and in the absence of such recitation no such intent is present. For example, as an aid to understanding, the following appended claims may contain usage of the introductory phrases \u201cat least one\u201d and \u201cone or more\u201d to introduce claim recitations. However, the use of such phrases should not be construed to imply that the introduction of a claim recitation by the indefinite articles \u201ca\u201d or \u201can\u201d limits any particular claim containing such introduced claim recitation to embodiments containing only one such recitation, even when the same claim includes the introductory phrases \u201cone or more\u201d or \u201cat least one\u201d and indefinite articles such as \u201ca\u201d or \u201can\u201d (e.g., \u201ca\u201d and\/or \u201can\u201d should be interpreted to mean \u201cat least one\u201d or \u201cone or more\u201d); the same holds true for the use of definite articles used to introduce claim recitations. In addition, even if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is explicitly recited, those skilled in the art will recognize that such recitation should be interpreted to mean at least the recited number (e.g., the bare recitation of \u201ctwo recitations,\u201d without other modifiers, means at least two recitations, or two or more recitations).","Furthermore, in those instances where a convention analogous to \u201cat least one of A, B, and C, etc.\u201d is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., \u201ca system having at least one of A, B, and C\u201d would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and\/or A, B, and C together, etc.). Where a convention analogous to \u201cat least one of A, B, or C, etc.\u201d is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., \u201ca system having at least one of A, B, or C\u201d would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and\/or A, B, and C together, etc.). It will be further understood that virtually any disjunctive word and\/or phrase presenting two or more alternative terms, whether in the description, claims, or drawings, should be understood to contemplate the possibilities of including one of the terms, either of the terms, or both terms. For example, the phrase \u201cA or B\u201d will be understood to include the possibilities of \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d or \u201cA and B.\u201d","As will be understood by one skilled in the art, for any and all purposes, such as in terms of providing a written description, all ranges disclosed herein also encompass any and all possible subranges and combinations of subranges thereof.
