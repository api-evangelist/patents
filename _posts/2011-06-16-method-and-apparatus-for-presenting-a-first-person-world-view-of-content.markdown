title: Method and apparatus for presenting a first person world view of content
abstract: An approach is provided for presenting a global view of content. A content mapping platform determines a viewing location of a device with respect to a user interface, wherein the user interface depicts a three-dimensional object in which a surface closest to the viewing location is transparent to show, at least in part, an opposite surface of the three-dimensional object. Further, the content mapping platform then determines at least one target location associated with at least one content item. Furthermore, the content mapping platform causes, at least in part, a rendering of the at least one content item on the opposite surface of the three-dimensional object based, at least in part, on the at least one target location.

No. 12\/636,262, \u201cMETHOD AND APPARATUS FOR PRESENTING A FIRST PERSON WORLD VIEW OF CONTENT,\u201d filed Dec. 11, 2009, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.","Service providers (e.g., wireless, cellular, etc.) and device manufacturers are continually challenged to deliver value and convenience to consumers by, for example, providing compelling network services. One area of interest has been the development of services for providing online content over, for instance, the Internet (e.g., online television broadcasts, streaming video and audio, photographs, etc.), which in turn has resulted in an abundance of available content originating from across the world. It is noted that much of this content can be of high quality (e.g., professionally produced online web television channels) and attractive to a broad spectrum of users, but this content is often hard to find. Accordingly, service providers and device manufacturers face significant technical challenges to enabling users to discover and access such content.","Some Example Embodiments","Therefore, there is a need for an approach for efficiently discovering the availability of content and then presenting a first person world view of the discovered content. According to one embodiment, a method comprises determining a viewing location of a device with respect to a user interface, wherein the user interface depicts a three-dimensional object in which a surface closest to the viewing location is transparent to show, at least in part, an opposite surface of the three-dimensional object. The method also comprises determining at least one target location associated with at least one content item. The method further comprises causing, at least in part, a rendering of the at least one content item on the opposite surface of the three-dimensional object based, at least in part, on the at least one target location.","According to another embodiment, an apparatus comprising at least one processor, and at least one memory including computer program code, the at least one memory and the computer program code configured to, with the at least one processor, cause, at least in part, the apparatus to determine a viewing location of a device with respect to a user interface, wherein the user interface depicts a three-dimensional object in which a surface closest to the viewing location is transparent to show, at least in part, an opposite surface of the three-dimensional object. The apparatus is further caused to determine at least one target location associated with at least one content item. The apparatus further causes, at least in part, a rendering of the at least one content item on the opposite surface of the three-dimensional object based, at least in part, on the at least one target location.","According to another embodiment, a computer-readable storage medium carrying one or more sequences of one or more instructions which, when executed by one or more processors, cause, at least in part, an apparatus to determine a viewing location of a device with respect to a user interface, wherein the user interface depicts a three-dimensional object in which a surface closest to the viewing location is transparent to show, at least in part, an opposite surface of the three-dimensional object. The apparatus is further caused to determine at least one target location associated with at least one content item. The apparatus further causes, at least in part, a rendering of the at least one content item on the opposite surface of the three-dimensional object based, at least in part, on the at least one target location.","According to another embodiment, an apparatus comprises means for determining a viewing location of a device with respect to a user interface, wherein the user interface depicts a three-dimensional object in which a surface closest to the viewing location is transparent to show, at least in part, an opposite surface of the three-dimensional object. The apparatus further comprises means for determining at least one target location associated with at least one content item. The apparatus additionally comprises means for causing, at least in part, a rendering of the at least one content item on the opposite surface of the three-dimensional object based, at least in part, on the at least one target location.","In addition, for various example embodiments of the invention, the following is applicable: a method comprising facilitating a processing of and\/or processing (1) data and\/or (2) information and\/or (3) at least one signal, the (1) data and\/or (2) information and\/or (3) at least one signal based, at least in part, on (or derived at least in part from) any one or any combination of methods (or processes) disclosed in this application as relevant to any embodiment of the invention.","For various example embodiments of the invention, the following is also applicable: a method comprising facilitating access to at least one interface configured to allow access to at least one service, the at least one service configured to perform any one or any combination of network or service provider methods (or processes) disclosed in this application.","For various example embodiments of the invention, the following is also applicable: a method comprising facilitating creating and\/or facilitating modifying (1) at least one device user interface element and\/or (2) at least one device user interface functionality, the (1) at least one device user interface element and\/or (2) at least one device user interface functionality based, at least in part, on data and\/or information resulting from one or any combination of methods or processes disclosed in this application as relevant to any embodiment of the invention, and\/or at least one signal resulting from one or any combination of methods (or processes) disclosed in this application as relevant to any embodiment of the invention.","For various example embodiments of the invention, the following is also applicable: a method comprising creating and\/or modifying (1) at least one device user interface element and\/or (2) at least one device user interface functionality, the (1) at least one device user interface element and\/or (2) at least one device user interface functionality based at least in part on data and\/or information resulting from one or any combination of methods (or processes) disclosed in this application as relevant to any embodiment of the invention, and\/or at least one signal resulting from one or any combination of methods (or processes) disclosed in this application as relevant to any embodiment of the invention.","In various example embodiments, the methods (or processes) can be accomplished on the service provider side or on the mobile device side or in any shared way between service provider and mobile device with actions being performed on both sides.","For various example embodiments, the following is applicable: An apparatus comprising means for performing the method of any of originally filed claims -, -, and -.","Still other aspects, features, and advantages of the invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description, simply by illustrating a number of particular embodiments and implementations, including the best mode contemplated for carrying out the invention. The invention is also capable of other and different embodiments, and its several details can be modified in various obvious respects, all without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the drawings and description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature, and not as restrictive.","Examples of a method, apparatus, and computer program for presenting a world view of content are disclosed. In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments of the invention. It is apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the embodiments of the invention may be practiced without these specific details or with an equivalent arrangement. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the embodiments of the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"Even with some content being limited or exclusive, it is noted that there is still a vast collection of content and content related information available via service providers (e.g., over the Internet). This vast collection can quickly overwhelm the user, thereby making it extremely difficult for the user to identify and access content of interest. For example, one way to view a presentation of content over the Internet is via a content list. This traditional content list approach, however, may not be effective in situations where the density of information about content is high. More specifically, the high density of information can make lists long and interesting to a user. Moreover, the user may not find content interesting when that content is presented in a typical list buried among other items. Further, the user may wish to share the content or other related information (e.g., internet links, access data, content type, user location, content location, service provider, etc.) with other users so that they too can access the content, wherein the information may be shared via one or more methods such as short message service (SMS), multimedia messaging service (MMS), instant messaging (IM), social networking sites (e.g., Facebook\u00ae, YouTube\u00ae, Twitter\u00ae, etc.) and the like. Without an exciting or novel presentation, content that would otherwise appeal to users might go unnoticed and be missed.","To address the problems described above, a system  of  introduces the capability of presenting a simple and intuitive interface which gives the user a global view of currently available content. More specifically, the system  receives access information about potentially available content and automatically accesses the content as part of a verification process to determine availability information of the content. In one embodiment, the verification process may be performed at predetermined intervals (e.g., every 30 seconds, every 5 minutes, etc.) or at specified times to ensure that the availability information is up-to-date. Once the content is verified and availability information is determined, the system  generates a user interface to present the content or content information in interesting user interfaces. In the approach described herein, these user interfaces are based on depicting location information that is typically associated with the content. By way of example, the location information may indicate: (1) a broadcast location of the content, (2) a location that is the subject of the content, (3) a location where the content was captured, e.g., geo-tagged data, (4) a location of a provider of the content, or any other data or information to tie the content to a particular location. It is also contemplated that content may be associated with multiple locations.","In one embodiment, the system  presents representations (e.g., thumbnail images, animation, audio alerts, etc.) of the content on a map (e.g., a map of the world), wherein the content representations are displayed at locations corresponding to the location information associated with the content. In another embodiment, the system  shows content based on the three-dimensional (3D) direction along which a user device displaying the content is pointed. More specifically, the system  utilizes augmented reality (e.g., using live or actual images of a location) or augmented virtuality (e.g., using 3D models and 3D mapping information) to present a model of an map object (e.g., the Earth), seen in a first person view from the user device's current location so that the locations seen in the view match corresponding physical locations in reality. Although various embodiments are discussed with respect to the Earth as the three-dimensional map object, it is contemplated that the approach described herein is applicable to any map object including any real objects (e.g., a house, road, paper mill, etc.) and\/or virtual objects (e.g., planned architectural models, renderings of fictitious objects, etc.). In yet another embodiment, depending on the location information, the first person view is rendered as though the user would see through map object (e.g., the Earth) to view the representation of the content. This view (e.g., a transparency effect) can be used, for instance, when the content location information indicates that the content is associated with a location sufficiently far from the user's location (e.g., the opposite side of the Earth) that the map object (e.g., the Earth) itself would be an obstruction between the user and the content.","In various embodiments, one or more users may share, with one or more other users, content related information such as internet links, access data, content type, user and\/or content location (e.g., GPS coordinates, mapping location, etc.), service provider, and the like wherein the information may be shared via one or more methods such as short message service (SMS), multimedia message service (MMS), instant messaging (IM), social networking sites (e.g., proprietary service, public service, Facebook\u00ae, YouTube\u00ae, Twitter\u00ae, etc.) and the like, which may be send via one or more communication networks. The shared information may then be, at least in part, visually presented at a user device, for example, on a map or other applications with indicators (e.g., an arrow, a dot, text, an image, etc.) for providing guidance to access and\/or discover the content. In one embodiment, information about a user location (e.g., source location) and location of the content accessed by the user (e.g., target location) can be presented on a user interface (UI) as a virtual tunnel through an object (e.g., the Earth). For example, if a user from the user's (source) location is viewing\/looking\/accessing content at a different (target) location, a viewing tunnel is formed between the two locations, which can be presented at a user device UI.","Further, as more user viewing tunnels are formed between different locations, the tunnels may be visually rendered such that there are one or more different characteristics distinguishing them, for example, by colors, by intensity of the colors or by other visual graphical representations. Furthermore, the visual representations of the tunnels may indicate how many users are utilizing a tunnel (e.g., may indicate more than 10, 50, 100, etc.), direction of the tunnel (e.g., one way or two way). In another embodiment, a user may save (e.g., bookmark, log, list, etc.) information related to content accessed and\/or viewed at one or more locations wherein the information may be saved at the user device, at a service provider device and\/or at a network component device (e.g., a cloud device) whereby the information may further be shared with and\/or accessed by one or more users. In other embodiments, information related to the content, content access, tunnels and\/or user information may be utilized in creating one or more user applications (e.g., gaming, entertainment, informative, educational, and the like) which may be rendered in one or more methods (e.g., 3D, 2D, a combination, etc.) on a user device. For example, by utilizing existing tunnels and\/or creating new ones, the users (e.g., as a single user or in a team) may create and\/or claim shapes and\/or areas inside the Earth, which may be done in real time (e.g., online) or as an application on a user device (e.g., offline).","In other words, the view shows the user the content at a corresponding location on the other side of the map object where the user device is pointed. This view advantageously enables the user to understand how the map object as seen in the generated first person view relates to the physical world. Thus, the user becomes concretely aware of the nature (e.g., the spherical nature of the Earth). For instance, it is noted that although users are generally familiar that the Earth is round, they do not actively consider its meaning in the physical world: that they live on the surface of a spherical planet, and that most of the world is in fact located somewhere below their feet. For instance, if a person living in New York were asked where China is in reality, the person likely would reply with a compass direction (e.g., East of New York) or could not answer accurately at all. It is unlikely that the person would point along the most direct route through the Earth below the person's feet.","This lack of perspective or direction arises partly because traditional location based augmented reality systems lack the possibility to point to and\/or search\/browse content (e.g., geolocations, geo-tagged data, content associated with location information, etc.) anywhere on the Earth, including the other side of the world. Unlike the approach described herein, typical augmented reality solutions are suitable only for the range that is physically visible from the user's real physical location. The range can, in fact, be very short due to obstacles such as walls of buildings, and ultimately objects will drop below the horizon in the distance, making distant objects impossible to view in traditional augmented reality systems. Because the first person augmented reality view of the system  treats the Earth as if it were transparent, the system  does not suffer the same limitations of traditional systems with respect to rendering distant objects.","In another embodiment, the system  enables the user to browse available content by time as well as location. For example, the user can specify a time in the past, present, or future. The system  can then determine the availability of content with respect to the specified period of time and map the content based on the specified time. In this way, the user can view what content is available at any particular time. For example, to view upcoming content so that the user can plan what content to access, the user can specify a time period in the future and generate a corresponding content map to explore available content. Further, as noted above, the user may share one or more content related information with one or more other users. As shown in , a user equipment (UE)  may retrieve content information (e.g., content and location information) and mapping information (e.g., global maps, 3D maps, first person augmented reality views, etc.) from a content mapping platform  via a communication network . The content and mapping information can be used by an application  on the UE  (e.g., an augmented reality application, navigation application, or other location-based application). In the example of , the content mapping platform  stores content information in the content catalog and mapping information in the map database . By way of example, content information includes one or more identifiers, metadata, access addresses (e.g., network address such as a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) or an Internet Protocol (IP) address; or a local address such as a file or storage location in a memory of the UE ), description, or the like associated with content. In one embodiment, content includes live media (e.g., streaming broadcasts), stored media (e.g., stored on a network or locally), metadata associated with media, text information, location information of other user devices, mapping data, geo-tagged data (e.g., indicating locations of people, objects, images, etc.), or a combination thereof. The content may be provided by the service platform  which includes one or more services -(e.g., music service, mapping service, video service, social networking service, content broadcasting service, etc.), the one or more content providers -(e.g., online content retailers, public databases, etc.), other content source available or accessible over the communication network . Further, the content and\/or the content related information (e.g., in , , etc.) can be shared with and\/or accessed by one or more users simultaneously, asynchronously, from same and\/or different locations","In certain embodiments, the mapping information and the maps presented to the user may be an augmented reality view, a simulated 3D environment, a two-dimensional map, or the like. In certain embodiments, the simulated 3D environment is a 3D model created to approximate the locations of streets, buildings, features, etc. of an area. This model can then be used to render the location from virtually any angle or perspective for display on the UE . In some programs (e.g., navigation application ), the 3D model or environment enables, for instance, the navigation application  to animate movement through the 3D environment to provide a more dynamic and potentially more useful or interesting mapping display to the user. In one embodiment, structures are stored using simple objects (e.g., three dimensional models describing the dimensions of the structures). Further, more complex objects may be utilized to represent structures and other objects within the 3D representation. Complex objects may include multiple smaller or simple objects dividing the complex objects into portions or elements. To create the 3D model, object information can be collected from various databases as well as data entry methods such as processing images associated with location stamps to determine structures and other objects in the 3D model.","In addition or alternatively, the mapping information may be displayed using other user interfaces such as audio interfaces, haptic feedback, and other sensory interfaces. For example, in an audio presentation of the mapping information, the approximate locations of streets, buildings, features, points of interest, content, etc. can be read aloud by an voice synthesizer executing on the UE .","Additionally or alternatively, in certain embodiments, an image capture module  of the UE  may be utilized in conjunction with the application  to present content information, location information (e.g., mapping and navigation information), availability information, etc. to the user. The user may be presented with an augmented reality interface associated with the application  and\/or the content mapping platform allowing 3D objects or other representations of content and related information to be superimposed onto an image of a physical environment on the UE . In certain embodiments, the user interface may display a hybrid physical and virtual environment where 3D objects from the map database  are placed superimposed on top of a physical image.","By way of example, the UE  may execute the application  to receive content and\/or mapping information from the content mapping platform  or other component of the network . As mentioned above, the application  and content mapping platform  receive access information about content, periodically determines the availability of the content based on the access information, and then presents a unique global view of the content (e.g., a global map of available content or an augmented reality view of global content with a transparent Earth effect).","Moreover, map information stored in the map database may be created from 3D models of real-world buildings and other sites. As such, objects can be associated with real world locations (e.g., based on location coordinates such as global positioning system (GPS) coordinates). In certain embodiments, the UE  may utilize GPS satellites  to determine the location of the UE  to utilize the content mapping functions of the content mapping platform  and\/or the application . The map information may include a 3D model (e.g., a complex 3D model) of objects and structures in a physical environment (e.g., buildings) made up of a number of separate but adjoined simple 3D shapes such as polygons. Conventional approaches of 3D modeling include the ability to access and transform each polygon in size and shape separately from the other polygons that form the complete 3D model of the object.","By way of example, the communication network  of system  includes one or more networks such as a data network (not shown), a wireless network (not shown), a telephony network (not shown), or any combination thereof. It is contemplated that the data network may be any local area network (LAN), metropolitan area network (MAN), wide area network (WAN), a public data network (e.g., the Internet), or any other suitable packet-switched network, such as a commercially owned, proprietary packet-switched network, e.g., a proprietary cable or fiber-optic network. In addition, the wireless network may be, for example, a cellular network and may employ various technologies including enhanced data rates for global evolution (EDGE), general packet radio service (GPRS), global system for mobile communications (GSM), Internet protocol multimedia subsystem (IMS), universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS), etc., as well as any other suitable wireless medium, e.g., worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX), Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks, code division multiple access (CDMA), wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA), wireless fidelity (WiFi), satellite, mobile ad-hoc network (MANET), and the like.","The UE  is any type of mobile terminal, fixed terminal, or portable terminal including a mobile handset, station, unit, device, navigational device, multimedia computer, multimedia tablet, Internet node, communicator, desktop computer, laptop computer, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), or any combination thereof. For example, the UE  can be a device that simulates or provides a virtual telescope-like function. This type of UE  can be, for instance, mounted in a public place (e.g., a shopping center, hotel, etc.) to enable users to view content presented as described herein. It is also contemplated that the UE  can support any type of interface to the user (such as \u201cwearable\u201d circuitry, etc.).","By way of example, the UE , and content mapping platform  communicate with each other and other components of the communication network  using well known, new or still developing protocols. In this context, a protocol includes a set of rules defining how the network nodes within the communication network  interact with each other based on information sent over the communication links. The protocols are effective at different layers of operation within each node, from generating and receiving physical signals of various types, to selecting a link for transferring those signals, to the format of information indicated by those signals, to identifying which software application executing on a computer system sends or receives the information. The conceptually different layers of protocols for exchanging information over a network are described in the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Reference Model.","Communications between the network nodes are typically effected by exchanging discrete packets of data. Each packet typically comprises (1) header information associated with a particular protocol, and (2) payload information that follows the header information and contains information that may be processed independently of that particular protocol. In some protocols, the packet includes (3) trailer information following the payload and indicating the end of the payload information. The header includes information such as the source of the packet, its destination, the length of the payload, and other properties used by the protocol. Often, the data in the payload for the particular protocol includes a header and payload for a different protocol associated with a different, higher layer of the OSI Reference Model. The header for a particular protocol typically indicates a type for the next protocol contained in its payload. The higher layer protocol is said to be encapsulated in the lower layer protocol. The headers included in a packet traversing multiple heterogeneous networks, such as the Internet, typically include a physical (layer 1) header, a data-link (layer 2) header, an internetwork (layer 3) header and a transport (layer 4) header, and various application headers (layer 5, layer 6 and layer 7) as defined by the OSI Reference Model.","In one embodiment, the application  and the content mapping platform  may interact according to a client-server model. According to the client-server model, a client process sends a message including a request to a server process, and the server process responds by providing a service (e.g., providing map information). The server process may also return a message with a response to the client process. Often the client process and server process execute on different computer devices, called hosts, and communicate via a network using one or more protocols for network communications. The term \u201cserver\u201d is conventionally used to refer to the process that provides the service, or the host computer on which the process operates. Similarly, the term \u201cclient\u201d is conventionally used to refer to the process that makes the request, or the host computer on which the process operates. As used herein, the terms \u201cclient\u201d and \u201cserver\u201d refer to the processes, rather than the host computers, unless otherwise clear from the context. In addition, the process performed by a server can be broken up to run as multiple processes on multiple hosts (sometimes called tiers) for reasons that include reliability, scalability, and redundancy, among others.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["103","103","201","103","201","203","111","113","113","115","115","203","203"],"i":["a","n","a","m"]},"Next, the control logic interacts with the content verification module  to determine the availability or information about the availability of content. More specifically, the content verification module  verifies the status of a given content item (e.g., a live broadcast stream) by accessing the content at the corresponding access address. By way of example, the status includes: (1) whether the server hosting the content's access address is responding with the requested content; (2) whether there are any limitations or exclusivity restrictions on the content (e.g., does the content require authentication or registration before access); (3) whether the content is available for a certain period (e.g., only for a specific duration or only at specific times); and other like information. In one embodiment, the content verification module  can verify a particular content item before the content management module  adds the content item and related information to the content catalog. Alternatively, the content verification module  can perform the verification process continuously (e.g., a predetermined or fixed interval) by scanning the entire content catalog and updating the availability information accordingly.","Because the available media content or stream can take many forms (e.g., live video feeds, photographs, audio files, etc.) and can be delivered using any number means (e.g., streaming media, downloaded media, spontaneously created media, etc.), the content verification module  includes one or more sub-modules or application programming interfaces (APIs) (not pictured) for receiving and\/or detecting the media content in its native format or for converting the media content to a media format compatible with the content mapping platform . In other embodiments, the content verification module  may initiate a download or installation of the components (e.g., codecs, player applications, etc.) needed to verify the content or stream.","After verification, the control logic  interacts with the mapping module  to correlate the location information associated with the one or more content items with respective locations on a map. In one embodiment, the location information may include coordinates (e.g., GPS coordinates) or other indicators (e.g., longitude and latitude information) that can be associated with an existing map. For example, the location information may be extracted or derived from any geo-tagged data (e.g., geo-tagged automatically or manually by the user) such as photographs, videos, audio recordings, and the like. This location information (e.g., GPS or other coordinates associated data) generally is recorded with the data when the data is captured or recorded. The mapping module  can then perform recognition (e.g., facial recognition, audio recognition, object recognition, etc.) on the data to identify people, locations, other subjects, or related information in the data. The identified people, locations, etc. can then be associated with the extracted location information. In addition or alternatively, it is contemplated that the location information or geo-tagged data could also be created by the mapping module  by deriving the location from associated metadata (e.g., media titles, tags, and comments). More specifically, the mapping module  can parse the metadata for any terms that indicate association with a particular location. For instance, a family vacation photograph may be tagged with a description of \u201cParis Vacation.\u201d The mapping module  can parse \u201cParis Vacation\u201d using a natural language model to associate the photograph with Paris, France even though the photograph does not include any traditional location information (e.g., GPS coordinates).","The mapping module  then interacts with the rendering engine  to present the location information, content information, and other content related information using any type of visual user interface (e.g., augmented reality view, 3D maps, etc.), audio user interface, tactile or tangible user interface (e.g., haptic feedback), or any possible user interface or combination of user interface types.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["101","105","101","301","303","103","305","307","309","101","311","101","313","101","117"]},"Content and mapping information may be presented to the user via the user interface , which may include various methods of communication. For example, the user interface  can have outputs including a visual component (e.g., a screen), an audio component (e.g., a verbal instructions), a physical component (e.g., vibrations), and other methods of communication. User inputs can include a touch-screen interface, microphone, camera, a scroll-and-click interface, a button interface, etc. Further, the user may input a request to start an application  (e.g., a mapping or augmented reality application) and utilize the user interface  to receive content and mapping information. Through the user interface , the user may request different types of content, mapping, or location information to be presented. Further, the user may be presented with 3D or augmented reality representations of particular locations and related objects (e.g., buildings, terrain features, POIs, etc. at the particular location) as part of a graphical user interface on a screen of the UE .","The content mapping platform interface  is used by the runtime module  to communicate with the content mapping platform . In some embodiments, the interface is used to fetch content, mapping, and or location information from the content mapping platform , service platform , and\/or content providers -. The UE  may utilize requests in a client server format to retrieve the content and mapping information. Moreover, the UE  may specify location information and\/or orientation information in the request to retrieve the content and mapping information. The location module , magnetometer module , accelerometer module , and image capture module  may be utilized to determine location and\/or orientation information used in determining along which direction the UE  is pointed so that content and mapping information corresponding to the pointed direction can be retrieved. Further, this content and mapping information may be stored in the cache  to be utilized in presenting a world view of content at the UE .","In one embodiment, the location module  can determine a user's location. The user's location can be determined by a triangulation system such as a GPS, assisted GPS (A-GPS) A-GPS, Cell of Origin, wireless local area network triangulation, or other location extrapolation technologies. Standard GPS and A-GPS systems can use satellites  to pinpoint the location (e.g., longitude, latitude, and altitude) of the UE . A Cell of Origin system can be used to determine the cellular tower that a cellular UE  is synchronized with. This information provides a coarse location of the UE  because the cellular tower can have a unique cellular identifier (cell-ID) that can be geographically mapped. The location module  may also utilize multiple technologies to detect the location of the UE . GPS coordinates can provide finer detail as to the location of the UE . As previously noted, the location module  may be utilized to determine location coordinates for use by the application  and\/or the content mapping platform .","The magnetometer module  can include an instrument that can measure the strength and\/or direction of a magnetic field. Using the same approach as a compass, the magnetometer is capable of determining the directional heading of a UE  using the magnetic field of the Earth. The front of the image capture device (e.g., a digital camera) (or another reference point on the UE ) can be marked as a reference point in determining direction. Thus, if the magnetic field points north compared to the reference point, the angle the UE  reference point is from the magnetic field is known. Simple calculations can be made to determine the direction of the UE . In one embodiment, horizontal directional data obtained from a magnetometer is utilized to determine the orientation of the user. This directional information may be correlated with the location information of the UE  to determine where (e.g., at which geographic feature or object) the UE  is pointing towards. This information may be utilized to select a first person view to render content and mapping information.","Further, the accelerometer module  may include an instrument that can measure acceleration. Using a three-axis accelerometer, with axes X, Y, and Z, provides the acceleration in three directions with known angles. Once again, the front of a media capture device can be marked as a reference point in determining direction. Because the acceleration due to gravity is known, when a UE  is stationary, the accelerometer module  can determine the angle the UE  is pointed as compared to Earth's gravity. In one embodiment, vertical directional data obtained from an accelerometer is used to determine the angle of elevation or tilt angle at which the UE  is pointing. This information in conjunction with the magnetometer information and location information may be utilized to determine a viewpoint to provide content and mapping information to the user. As such, this information may be utilized in selecting available content items to present navigational information to the user. Moreover, the combined information may be utilized to determine portions of a particular 3D map or augmented reality view that may interest the user. In one embodiment, if the location information associated with one or more available content items does not correspond to the viewpoint (e.g., is not visible in the selected viewpoint), one or more indicators (e.g., arrows or pointers) may be showed on the user interface to indicate the direction towards the location of the content items.","In another embodiment, the user may manually input any one or more of the location, directional heading, and tilt angle to specify a viewpoint for displaying the user interface on the UE  instead of determining the viewpoint from the sensors. In this way, the user may select a \u201cvirtual viewpoint\u201d to be a place other than the current location and pointing direction of the UE .","Images for supporting a graphical user interface can be captured using an image capture module . An image capture module  may include a camera, a video camera, a combination thereof etc. In one embodiment, visual media is captured in the form of an image or a series of images. The image capture module  can obtain the image from a camera and associate the image with location information, magnetometer information, accelerometer information, or a combination thereof. As previously noted, this combination of information may be utilized to determine the viewpoint of the user by combining the location of the user, horizontal orientation information of the user, and vertical orientation information of the user. This information may be utilized to retrieve content and mapping information from the map cache  or the mapping platform . In certain embodiments, the cache  includes all or a portion the information in the content catalog and the map database . Further, the content and\/or the content related information (e.g., in , , etc.) can be shared with and\/or accessed by one or more users simultaneously, asynchronously, from same and\/or different locations. For example, John in London is accessing (e.g., via a tunnel) content in Los Angeles and wishes to have his friend, Ann, in New York access the same content, so he sends her an SMS including content related information (e.g., location coordinates of John, content type, location coordinates of the content, content availability time, and the like) so that Ann could utilize one or more information items for accessing the content; further, since John and Arm may be on a close latitudinal line, tunnels shown on their respective user devices may be substantially presented within one tunnel or alternatively may be presented as two different tunnels. In another example, Ann may communicate (e.g., via IM) substantially same content related information to her friend, Ken, in Miami who may establish a new tunnel for accessing substantially same content as John and Ann. In the previous examples, there may be one, two or three tunnels from London, New York and Miami for accessing the content in Los Angeles wherein the presentations on the respective devices may be rendered via one or more applications (e.g., a map) on the devices in one or more formats (e.g., 2D, 3D, textual, etc.) wherein the respective tunnels may be presented along with one or more other tunnels utilized by other users. Alternatively, a user may configure the user device to render and present tunnels based on user defined criteria such as user name, content type, tunnel origin\/source, tunnel end-point\/target and the like.  is a flowchart of a process for determining the availability of content, according to one embodiment. In one embodiment, the runtime module  performs the process  and is implemented in, for instance, a chip set including a processor and a memory as shown . In certain embodiments, the content mapping platform  may perform some or all of the steps of the process  and communicate with the UE  using a client server interface. The UE  may activate an application  to utilize content mapping services of the content mapping platform . Moreover, the application  may execute upon the runtime module .","In step , the runtime module  determines a viewing location of a device with respect to a user interface, wherein the user interface depicts a three-dimensional object in which a surface closest to the viewing location is transparent to show, at least in part, an opposite surface of the three-dimensional object. In various embodiments, one or more sensors (e.g., GPS), one or more applications, one or more service providers and or communications network information (e.g., cell location) can provide information, at least in part, indicative of the user device location and\/or viewing location. For example, GPS information can substantially indicate on a map (e.g., 2D, 3D) location of one or more user devices whereby one or more users can establish as their viewing location. Further, one or more UE  applications render on a UI a 3D and\/or a 2D view of an object (e.g., Earth) with one or more indicators indicating viewing location of the one or more users. For example, on the UE  UI a 3D rendering of the Earth can be presented while indicating viewing locations of users in Los Angeles, Helsinki, Beijing and Buenos Aires located closest to the surface of the 3D Earth rendering (e.g., each user is shown at their respective location on the 3D Earth rendering). Furthermore, the 3D rendering of the object (e.g., Earth) is substantially transparent so that the users from their viewing locations may view one or more contents located at the opposite side of the object. For example, a user located in Helsinki may view one or more contents located at or near Tokyo through the transparent rendering of the Earth.","In step , the runtime module  determines at least one target location associated with at least one content item. By way of example, the at least one content item and related data may comprise one or more of: (1) media content (e.g., live or stored media, streaming media, web cam feeds, photographs, metadata related to the media content, metadata related to the location information of the media content, etc., or a combination thereof); (2) mapping information (e.g., any available map data); (3) text information (e.g., descriptive labels such as \u201cVenice, Italy\u201d); (4) location information of other users (e.g., friends, coworkers, etc.) and associated avatars, photographs, text, etc.; (5) time of day (e.g., night-time regions can be visualized in darker colors, or working hours regions can be presented differently than non-working hour regions); and (6) natural phenomenon (e.g., ocean currents, hurricanes, environmental conditions, other weather events. It is contemplated that content and other related data are not limited to the above listed categories.","In Step , the runtime module  causes, at least in part, a rendering of the at least one content item on the opposite surface of the three-dimensional object based, at least in part, on the at least one target location. In one embodiment, from the selected viewpoint, an image representing an augmented reality view or a 3D model of the location corresponding to the viewpoint can be generated or retrieved from the cache  or the content mapping platform . As previously noted, the image may represent a physical environment; maybe located at any point (e.g., geographically opposite) on the three dimensional object; which may be captured using an image capture module  of the UE . In another embodiment, the image may represent a virtual 3D environment, where the user's location in the real world physical environment is represented in the virtual 3D environment. In the representation, the viewpoint of the user is mapped onto the virtual 3D environment. Moreover, a hybrid physical and virtual 3D environment may additionally be utilized to present navigational information to the user.","In step , as an alternative to the augmented reality or globe view user interface, the runtime module  can render a user interface as a map that includes a graphical representation of the at least one content item based, at least in part, on the viewing location, the at least one target location, or a combination thereof. In one embodiment, the rendering can provide a simple and intuitive map view of the content items and their corresponding location. In this view, the runtime module  renders graphical representations of the content items and places them on the map according to the location information corresponding to each content item. As with the augmented reality view point, the zoom and detail levels of the display can be varied to ensure that the map is not completely obscured. Additionally, content items can be animated to appear and disappear from the view based on date, user preferences, or other criteria to further reduce number of contents to display.","In step , the runtime module  may receive an input for specifying a time period in the past, present, or future, wherein the at least one content item is determined with respect to the time period. By enabling specification of a time period, the approach described herein enables the user to navigate content information using both location and time. In one embodiment, the default time for viewing the content and mapping information is the present.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 13"],"b":["305","500","500","305","300"]},"In step , the runtime module  determines a directional heading, an angle of elevation, or a combination thereof associated with the device UE  in order to determine a viewpoint from which to render the view. In one embodiment, the viewpoint parameters (e.g., location, direction heading, and angle of elevation of the UE ) are determined by pointing the user UE  at a specific place in the physical world. More specifically, to determine where the UE  is pointed, the runtime module  may utilize the location module , magnetometer module , accelerometer module , or a combination thereof. In other embodiments, the user may select the viewpoint based on a 3D environment. The user may select the viewpoint based on conventional means of searching a map or 3D map (e.g., by selecting a starting point and traversing the map or entering location coordinates, such as GPS coordinates or an address, of the viewpoint).","In step , the runtime module  processes and\/or facilitates a processing of the viewing location, the directional heading, the angle of elevation, or a combination thereof to determine the at least one target location, the at least one content item, or a combination thereof. By way of example, one or more directional guidance information may be presented via the UI at a user device wherein the user may utilize the guidance information for pointing the user device and find one or more contents. For example, the guidance information may be presented as arrows, one or more series of points, series of dots to connect, textual instructions, flashing lights and the like. Further, the user may utilize the guidance direction for moving the user device in one or more was such as move to the left, right, up, down, change angle of elevation and the like in order to substantially point to the desired content. Furthermore, if the device is capable of self-orientation\/self-movement (e.g., motorized change of direction while the device is affixed at one point), then the user device may utilize the guidance information for substantially automatically aligning the user device and point to the desired content. As an alternative, another user device (e.g., a personal computer) may utilize the guidance information for aligning\/pointing the user device (e.g., via a motorized mechanism wherein the user device UE  is affixed to) UE  to the desired content.","In step , the runtime module  updates the viewing location, the directional heading, the angle of elevation, or a combination thereof of the device and the user interface as the device moves. To facilitate finding specific content or features, the runtime module  enables the user input search criteria (e.g., a content item, person, city, weather, etc.) and get guidance for finding the direction where the searched content item is located in the real physical world. By way of example, the guidance may be indicated as a directional arrow or other similar indicator in the augmented reality display to indicate the direction the user should move or point the UE  in order to find the searched content item. Therefore, as the user moves the UE , the runtime module  updates the rendering of the user interface to reflect the new viewpoint.","As noted previously, an inherent property of an augmented reality user interface is that the display follows the movement and pointing of the UE . However, in some cases (e.g., when the user has found and is displaying a favorite location), the user may wish to \u201clock\u201d or fix the display at a particular viewpoint without having to maintain the UE  in the same position. Accordingly, at step , the runtime module receives one or more inputs for locking the viewing location, the at least one target location, the directional heading, the angle of elevation, or a combination thereof. This input may be initiated, for instance, selecting a menu option or actuating a physical button (e.g., a shutter release of the image capture module ).","In step , the user interface is rendered based, at least in part, on the locked viewing location, the locked at least one target location, the locked directional heading, the locked angle of elevation, or a combination thereof and a movement of the device does not update the user interface. In one embodiment, the image capture module  may also be used to \u201clock\u201d the viewpoint of the UE , so that even if the UE  is moved or turned away, the runtime module  renders the content from the locked viewpoint. In this way, the user can select a favorite viewpoint (e.g., a view of New York City through the transparent Earth) and monitor the development of evolution of available content originating from the location in the locked viewpoint. It is further contemplated that the user may store one or more of the locked viewpoints for later reference or recall.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0074","num":"0073"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 13"],"b":["305","600","103","600","101","101","107","103","107","305"]},"In step , the runtime module  causes, at least in part, a rendering of at least one connection between the viewing location and the at least one target location, wherein the rendering of the least one connection is depicted as at least one tunnel. By way of example, connection between a viewing location (e.g., user location, source location) and the target location (e.g., geographical location of the content) are represented as one or more tunnels in a user interface rendering. The one or more tunnels can have one or more characteristics (e.g., color, pattern, size, shape, 2D, 3D, et.) so that the one or more users may be able to determine further information about the one or more tunnels (e.g., user's own tunnel(s), tunnel direction(s), tunnel users, etc.)","In step , the runtime module  causes, at least in part, a sharing of the at least one target location, the viewing location, the at least one content item, or a combination thereof with one or more other devices. In one embodiment, the one or more users may share content related information such as location of the one or more users, location of the one or more contents, tunnel information, content availability times, tunnel access level required, content access level required and the like.","In step , the runtime module  processes and\/or facilitates a processing of the shared at least one target location, the viewing location, the at least one content item, or a combination thereof to determine frequency information, popularity information, or a combination thereof. In one embodiment, the content related information may be utilized, for example, by the users and\/or a service provider to ascertain further information about the frequency and\/or popularity information which may further provide, at least in part, additional criteria for deciding to utilize and\/or share the content and\/or the content related information.","In step , the runtime module  renders the user interface, the at least one content item, the viewing location, the at least one target location, or a combination thereof based, at least in part, on the frequency information, the popularity information, or a combination thereof. By way of example, the frequency and\/or the popularity information determined, at least in part, may be utilized to render (e.g., organize, categorize, list, prioritize, highlight, etc.), for example, the content and\/or the content related information via one or more applications on the user device UE . For example, a user may discover a very popular tunnel (e.g., indicating a popular content and\/or target location) and decide to share information related to the content and\/or the tunnel with one or more other users by any of the earlier mentioned methods (e.g. SMS, MMS, IM, etc.)","In step , the runtime module  causes, at least in part, a coordination of a selection of the viewing location, one or more other viewing locations, the at least one target location, or a combination thereof among the device, one or more other devices, or a combination thereof based, at least in part, on the sharing, wherein the coordination supports, at least in part, one or more gaming applications. By way of example, the content related information such as information related to the user, target, source, content, tunnels and the like can be utilized to, at least in part, arrange, construct, program one or more applications which may be utilized for entertainment, education, gaming and the like. For example, one or more users may utilize, on their respective device UI's, a 3D rendering of Earth with indications of one or more tunnels, to create one or more different areas within the Earth rendering and interact (e.g., claim, divide, purchase, rent, trade, cross, block, etc.) with the rendering amongst the participating users.","From the selected viewpoint, an image representing an augmented reality view or a 3D model of the location corresponding to the viewpoint can be generated or retrieved from the cache  or the content mapping platform . As previously noted, the image may represent a physical environment, which may be captured using an image capture module  of the UE . In another embodiment, the image may represent a virtual 3D environment, where the user's location in the real world physical environment is represented in the virtual 3D environment. In the representation, the viewpoint of the user is mapped onto the virtual 3D environment. Moreover, a hybrid physical and virtual 3D environment may additionally be utilized to present navigational information to the user.","The runtime module  can then further render or indicate the location and availability information of one or more content items in the augmented reality user interface. It is noted that to enable seeing the globe effect and the content simultaneously, the amount of content shown can be restricted or reduced (e.g., using adjustable zoom or detail levels) so that content labels do not obscure the globe. In certain embodiments, when there is much more content available than can be displayed in the existing globe view use interface, the runtime module  can be constantly animating the display of the content items so that new content keeps appearing while older content disappears. This animation process also makes the user interface more entertaining to users and gives a feeling of the world being \u201calive\u201d with activity.","Additionally, because of the large scale of the world, fine granularities of distances are not readily displayed or visible in the rendered user interface. Accordingly, the exact locations of people and content are less important which can guard against some privacy concerns when sharing people tracking data. For example, when rendering the augmented reality view from across the globe, the scale of the display enables the runtime module  to indicate a specific location with accuracy to generally the city or regional level. As a result, the large scale of the view limits how accurately the location tracking data can be displayed, thereby protecting the privacy of those participating in the people tracking service.","In certain embodiment, the user may specify a zooming range or granularity for rendering the user interface. For example, the user may have the option to select a range for distance (e.g., a display scale) or a level of accuracy or sensitivity for determining the viewpoint (e.g., the location, directional heading, and tilt angle) of the UE . The range selection can use traditional numerical input or natural language input (e.g., outer space, the sky above the buildings, above ground on the other side of the Earth, etc.). The range may also be specified by zooming controls in a touch-based user interface, or a slider, actuator, knob, or other similar user interface element. Moreover, it is contemplated that the sensitivity for determining the viewpoint can be automatically adjusted based on the zoom, thereby advantageously reducing the effects of the natural unsteadiness of the user's pointing of the UE  that is exacerbated at higher levels of zoom. As zoom increases, the exact locations of the location tracking subjects may be automatically obscured to protect the privacy of the location tracking subjects or other location information displayed in the user interface.","The zoom level also affects the amount of content or other data that can be displayed in the user interface. In addition, the user can add filters (e.g., based on content subject, type, etc.) to select the types of content to display in the user interface. In one embodiment, the user can also define the range where content is visible in the user interface, so that the user can, for instance, see only the content around a particular city that is near the horizon. Another example would be to define a very short range for viewing subway lines under a city. In yet another embodiment, the user interface may employ a visualization method similar to a camera auto-focus, so that the content that is under the \u201cpoint of focus\u201d is rendered normally, while the rest of the view user interface is blurred as if it was out of focus. In this way, the user interface more clearly presents the content at which the viewpoint is directed. As the viewpoint changes from one content item to the next, the focus can shift accordingly.","An inherent property of an augmented reality user interface is that the displayed content is dependent on the viewpoint and that to view a specific point or content located on the Earth, the user has to point the UE  in the correct direction. In addition or alternatively, the user may specify a particular viewpoint by entering at least one of a location, directional heading, and tilt angle rather than point the UE  manually. In this way, the user can virtually aim the UE  instead of manually pointing. Based on the manually specified viewpoint, the user interface may be rendered to depict the scene virtually using, for instance, such as a wireframe rendering, a tunnel or pipe graphical element, or other indication to signify that the presentation is based on a virtual viewpoint.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0086","num":"0085"},"figref":["FIGS. 7A-7F","FIG. 7A"],"b":["701","703","705","707","705","701","703","705","709","705","705","705","707","709","703","703","705"],"i":["a ","a ","b ","b ","a ","b"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0087","num":"0086"},"figref":"FIG. 7B","b":["711","713","715","717","715","714","713","711","717","711","719","711","717","711","711","711","719","717","714","715","715","717","713","713","715"],"i":["a ","a ","a ","a ","a ","a ","b ","b ","a ","b ","b","a ","b"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0088","num":"0087"},"figref":"FIG. 7C","b":["731","733","735","737","739","741","743"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0089","num":"0088"},"figref":["FIGS. 7D and 7E","FIG. 7D","FIG. 7E"],"b":["751","753","755","751","753","755","761"],"i":["a","a ","a "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0090","num":"0089"},"figref":"FIG. 7F","b":["781","783","785","787","789","781"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0091","num":"0090"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 8"],"b":["101","101","103","109"],"i":["a","b","a.

In one embodiment, the request may include filters which enable the UE to select what kind of content should be included in the requested content list. For example, the request may seek information related to one more places marked as places that are of particular interest to a user of the UE . The request may also define criteria for content of interest to the user. On receipt of the request, the content mapping platform  applies the filters and criteria to request a content list from the content catalog (at ). The content catalog completes the request and returns the content list to the content mapping platform  (at ).","In the meantime, the UE accesses the content mapping platform  to specify new content to add to the content list (at ). To specify the new content, the UE may submit an access address (e.g., a URL) of the new content for evaluation by the content mapping platform . Either in response to the new content submission or as part of a periodic updating process (if so configured), the content mapping platform  verifies the new submission (at ) and updates the content list for the content catalog (at ) based on the verification. At the same time, the content mapping platform  evaluates whether the new content passes the filter or satisfies the criteria applied by the UE and transmits the updated content list to the UE (at ). The UE is then assured of having an up-to-date content list specific to the applied filters and criteria. In some embodiments, the content mapping platform  may also apply external filters or criteria applied by content providers , the service platform , network operator, etc. For example, one external criteria may form a two-way link (essentially a tunnel through the Earth) between all or selected users and\/or locations. This tunnel, for instance, restricts or filters content so that only a specific set of users (e.g., users located in a first location) can view content originating at a second location. For example, video content originating in New York may be restricted to viewing by only those users located in Tokyo. As described, this restriction, in essence, creates a \u201ctunnel\u201d from Tokyo to New York so that users in other locations will not have access to the restricted video content.

The term computer-readable storage medium is used herein to refer to any computer-readable medium except transmission media.","Logic encoded in one or more tangible media includes one or both of processor instructions on a computer-readable storage media and special purpose hardware, such as ASIC .","Network link  typically provides information communication using transmission media through one or more networks to other devices that use or process the information. For example, network link  may provide a connection through local network  to a host computer  or to equipment  operated by an Internet Service Provider (ISP). ISP equipment  in turn provides data communication services through the public, world-wide packet-switching communication network of networks now commonly referred to as the Internet .","A computer called a server host  connected to the Internet hosts a process that provides a service in response to information received over the Internet. For example, server host  hosts a process that provides information representing video data for presentation at display . It is contemplated that the components of system  can be deployed in various configurations within other computer systems, e.g., host  and server .","At least some embodiments of the invention are related to the use of computer system  for implementing some or all of the techniques described herein. According to one embodiment of the invention, those techniques are performed by computer system  in response to processor  executing one or more sequences of one or more processor instructions contained in memory .

In this manner, computer system  may obtain application program code in the form of signals on a carrier wave.","Various forms of computer readable media may be involved in carrying one or more sequence of instructions or data or both to processor  for execution. For example, instructions and data may initially be carried on a magnetic disk of a remote computer such as host . The remote computer loads the instructions and data into its dynamic memory and sends the instructions and data over a telephone line using a modem. A modem local to the computer system  receives the instructions and data on a telephone line and uses an infra-red transmitter to convert the instructions and data to a signal on an infra-red carrier wave serving as the network link . An infrared detector serving as communications interface  receives the instructions and data carried in the infrared signal and places information representing the instructions and data onto bus . Bus  carries the information to memory  from which processor  retrieves and executes the instructions using some of the data sent with the instructions.

A processor  has connectivity to the bus  to execute instructions and process information stored in, for example, a memory . The processor  may include one or more processing cores with each core configured to perform independently. A multi-core processor enables multiprocessing within a single physical package. Examples of a multi-core processor include two, four, eight, or greater numbers of processing cores. Alternatively or in addition, the processor  may include one or more microprocessors configured in tandem via the bus  to enable independent execution of instructions, pipelining, and multithreading.

A main display unit  provides a display to the user in support of various applications and mobile terminal functions that perform or support the steps of presenting a global view of content. The display  includes display circuitry configured to display at least a portion of a user interface of the mobile terminal (e.g., mobile telephone). Additionally, the display  and display circuitry are configured to facilitate user control of at least some functions of the mobile terminal. An audio function circuitry  includes a microphone  and microphone amplifier that amplifies the speech signal output from the microphone . The amplified speech signal output from the microphone  is fed to a coder\/decoder (CODEC) .","A radio section  amplifies power and converts frequency in order to communicate with a base station, which is included in a mobile communication system, via antenna . The power amplifier (PA)  and the transmitter\/modulation circuitry are operationally responsive to the MCU , with an output from the PA  coupled to the duplexer  or circulator or antenna switch, as known in the art. The PA  also couples to a battery interface and power control unit .","In use, a user of mobile terminal  speaks into the microphone  and his or her voice along with any detected background noise is converted into an analog voltage. The analog voltage is then converted into a digital signal through the Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) . The control unit  routes the digital signal into the DSP  for processing therein, such as speech encoding, channel encoding, encrypting, and interleaving. In one embodiment, the processed voice signals are encoded, by units not separately shown, using a cellular transmission protocol such as global evolution (EDGE), general packet radio service (GPRS), global system for mobile communications (GSM), Internet protocol multimedia subsystem (IMS), universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS), etc., as well as any other suitable wireless medium, e.g., microwave access (WiMAX), Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks, code division multiple access (CDMA), wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA), wireless fidelity (WiFi), satellite, and the like.","The encoded signals are then routed to an equalizer  for compensation of any frequency-dependent impairments that occur during transmission though the air such as phase and amplitude distortion. After equalizing the bit stream, the modulator  combines the signal with a RF signal generated in the RF interface . The modulator  generates a sine wave by way of frequency or phase modulation. In order to prepare the signal for transmission, an up-converter  combines the sine wave output from the modulator  with another sine wave generated by a synthesizer  to achieve the desired frequency of transmission. The signal is then sent through a PA  to increase the signal to an appropriate power level. In practical systems, the PA  acts as a variable gain amplifier whose gain is controlled by the DSP  from information received from a network base station. The signal is then filtered within the duplexer  and optionally sent to an antenna coupler  to match impedances to provide maximum power transfer. Finally, the signal is transmitted via antenna  to a local base station. An automatic gain control (AGC) can be supplied to control the gain of the final stages of the receiver. The signals may be forwarded from there to a remote telephone which may be another cellular telephone, other mobile device or a land-line connected to a Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), or other telephony networks.","Voice signals transmitted to the mobile terminal  are received via antenna  and immediately amplified by a low noise amplifier (LNA) . A down-converter  lowers the carrier frequency while the demodulator  strips away the RF leaving only a digital bit stream. The signal then goes through the equalizer  and is processed by the DSP . A Digital to Analog Converter (DAC)  converts the signal and the resulting output is transmitted to the user through the speaker , all under control of a Main Control Unit (MCU) \u2014which can be implemented as a Central Processing Unit (CPU) (not shown).","The MCU  receives various signals including input signals from the keyboard . The keyboard  and\/or the MCU  in combination with other user input components (e.g., the microphone ) comprise a user interface circuitry for managing user input. The MCU  runs a user interface software to facilitate user control of at least some functions of the mobile terminal  to present a global view of content. The MCU  also delivers a display command and a switch command to the display  and to the speech output switching controller, respectively. Further, the MCU  exchanges information with the DSP  and can access an optionally incorporated SIM card  and a memory . In addition, the MCU  executes various control functions required of the terminal. The DSP  may, depending upon the implementation, perform any of a variety of conventional digital processing functions on the voice signals. Additionally, DSP  determines the background noise level of the local environment from the signals detected by microphone  and sets the gain of microphone  to a level selected to compensate for the natural tendency of the user of the mobile terminal .","The CODEC  includes the ADC  and DAC . The memory  stores various data including call incoming tone data and is capable of storing other data including music data received via, e.g., the global Internet. The software module could reside in RAM memory, flash memory, registers, or any other form of writable storage medium known in the art. The memory device  may be, but not limited to, a single memory, CD, DVD, ROM, RAM, EEPROM, optical storage, or any other non-volatile storage medium capable of storing digital data.","An optionally incorporated SIM card  carries, for instance, important information, such as the cellular phone number, the carrier supplying service, subscription details, and security information. The SIM card  serves primarily to identify the mobile terminal  on a radio network. The card  also contains a memory for storing a personal telephone number registry, text messages, and user specific mobile terminal settings.","While the invention has been described in connection with a number of embodiments and implementations, the invention is not so limited but covers various obvious modifications and equivalent arrangements, which fall within the purview of the appended claims.
