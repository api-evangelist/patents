Field","The present disclosure relates to a technology for controlling transmission power of a terminal in a wireless network.","2. Discussion of Related Art","Upon designing an enterprise wireless network considering a packet voice service (VoIP) and a streaming service, a service range of an access point (AP) tends to be designed to be smaller than that of a public hotspot area. Accordingly, in such an environment, a mobile terminal may perform data communication with a base station even using relatively low transmission power, compared to in a public hotspot area. However, a default data transmission power value (level) of commercially available mobile terminals is fixed to a sufficiently high value. Accordingly, in such a wireless network environment, transmission power control (TPC) for reducing unnecessary power consumption and also minimizing an influence on another wireless communication is essentially required at a terminal side.","However, an existing transmission power control scheme has the following problems. First, since a radio wave environment changes quickly and variously in an indoor environment, it is difficult for a terminal or an access point controller to accurately measure a radio wave environment for transmission power control in real time. Second, in order to control transmission power at a terminal side, additional power consumption occurs due to measurement of a radio wave environment, such as data reception sensitivity, and periodic data communication with an access point controller. The additional power consumption cost often exceeds a power consumption gain by performing real-time transmission power control.","Embodiments of the present disclosure are directed to providing a means for optimally controlling transmission power of a terminal according to a condition of a wireless network.","Embodiments of the present disclosure are also directed to providing a method of

reverse transmission qualities.","The calculation of the plurality of critical communication transmission power values may include calculating one or more of a minimum value, a maximum value, a median value, an arithmetic mean value, a geometric mean value, and a harmonic mean value of one or more of the plurality of critical communication transmission power values.","When a maximally increased transmission power value of the test terminal is not such that the preset reverse transmission quality service level value is met, the optimal transmission power calculation unit may be configured to

In addition, upon request from the authentication server , the management server  provides an optimal transmission power value corresponding to a terminal associated with the request using one of identification information of the terminal, information on a wireless network to which the terminal is currently connected, and frequency band information.","The database server  is a server for storing and managing an optimal transmission power value for each wireless network or terminal that is measured by the management server .","Next, the wireless network  is positioned between the mobile terminal  and the back-end server group  and configured to provide a communication service to the mobile terminal .

As described above, in an embodiment of the present disclosure, there are m different types of terminals . For example, the types of the terminals may be distinguished according to a terminal manufacturer and a model. In addition, although terminals of the same model are manufactured by the same terminal manufacturer, the terminals may be distinguished as different terminals when internally used mobile chipsets or their associated software applications are different. The mobile terminal  may include a wireless network access agent application program for authenticating a terminal through communication with the back-end server group  and setting a received optimal transmission power value to the terminal. In addition, this application program may control the transmission power value of the mobile chipset through an application programming interface (API) that is provided in an operating system (OS) layer (platform) of the mobile terminal .","The m types of terminals  that are connected to the wireless networks  have respective default transmission power values that are set when the terminals are released from the factory. Hereinafter, a product model of an i-th terminal of the m types of mobile terminals  is represented as MT_i (1\u2266i\u2266m), and a default transmission power value of MT_i is represented as MT_i_DFT_TP. Although a terminal is released by the same manufacturer, MT_i_DFT_TP has a different value according to a product model or a wireless modem chipset fabrication model equipped in the terminal.","The back-end server group  measures an optimal transmission power value of MT_i that will receive a data service in a wireless frequency band b (1<b<e, where e is the number of wireless frequency bands that may be serviced in the wireless network) of each wireless network  in consideration of a cell radius and an internal radio wave environment of the access point  that is established for each wireless network . A detailed method of finding the optimal transmission power value for each wireless network  will be described below. Hereinafter, an optimal transmission power of an i-th terminal -(MT_i) in a wireless frequency band b for a k-th wireless network -(1\u2266k\u2266n) may be represented as MT_i_WN_k_OTP_TP_b. That is, in an embodiment of the present disclosure, the back-end server group  measures and manages an optimal transmission power value for each wireless network, wireless frequency band, and a terminal type. The measurement of the optimal transmission power value may be repeatedly performed whenever a certain time period has elapsed or whenever an environment of a wireless network changes (change in an indoor layout, addition and removal of an access point to and from the wireless network, and installation\/removal of an external wireless network).","Subsequently, when the terminal  accesses any one of the plurality of wireless networks , the back-end server group  may provide the terminal  with a wireless network to be accessed by the terminal , a wireless frequency band, and an optimal transmission power value corresponding to a terminal type, thus allowing the terminal  to set the wireless network, the wireless frequency band, the optimal transmission power value.","Specifically, MT_i having the transmission power value initially set as MT_i_DFT_TP approaches the wireless network - to request authentication by a wireless network access agent, information on MT_i that is an authentication parameter is transmitted to the authentication server  via the access point AP  and the access point controller . The authentication server  included in the back-end server group  finds identification information of MT_i and identification information of a wireless network included in the authentication request. The identification information may be, for example, manufacturer\/model information of MT_i that requests an access to the wireless network 1 WN_1.","If authentication of MT_i succeeds in the authentication server , the authentication server  receives an optimal transmission power value MT_i_WN_1_OTP_TP_b corresponding to MT_i of the wireless network 1 from the management server  and transmits the optimal transmission power value to MT_i. Then, a wireless network access agent installed in MT_i stores MT_i_DFT_TP as a default transmission power value thereof and sets MT_i_WN_1_OPT_TP_b as a new transmission power value thereof to perform data communication in the wireless network -. In this case, wireless frequency access band information b may be determined by the authentication server  using an authentication policy according to information on MT_i.","Subsequently, when MT_i recedes from the wireless network -, MT_i resets a transmission power value thereof as MT_i_DFT_TP that is a default value. When MT_i accesses a wireless network -, MT_i sets MT_i_WN_2_OPT_TP_b as a new transmission power value thereof in the same method as described above.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0076","num":"0075"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["110","110","202","204"]},"The optimal transmission power calculation unit  calculates a type-based optimal transmission power value of a terminal  that is accessible to a wireless network  connected with the back-end server group . Specifically, the optimal transmission power calculation unit  calculates an optimal transmission power value for each of the one or more access points included in each wireless network  and calculates an optimal transmission power value of each wireless network  from the calculated optimal transmission power value for each access point.","Furthermore, in order to calculate the optimal transmission power value for each access point , first, the optimal transmission power calculation unit  measures a service area of the access point  using a forward transmission quality TX_QoS between the access point  and the terminal  and calculates a minimum transmission power value at which the test terminal enables communication in the service area using a reverse transmission quality RX_QoS between the terminal  and the access point .","When an access of the terminal  to any one of connected wireless networks  is sensed, the transmission power setting unit  provides the accessed terminal  with optimal transmission power values corresponding to the accessing terminal  and the wireless network accessed by the terminal  or corresponding to all frequency bands supported by the terminal.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0080","num":"0079"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["202","104","104","104","202"]},"As shown in , a distance between a point pwhere a virtual line drawn vertically from any access point AP to the ground intersects with the ground and the AP is defined as a shortest distance Xbetween MT_i and the access point AP. In this case, the access point AP may be installed on a ceiling, a wall, a pillar, and the like inside a building according to characteristics of an area where the wireless network  is installed.","The optimal transmission power calculation unit  measures a forward transmission quality TX_QoS (quality of data transmitted from AP to MT_i; measured by MT_i and then transmitted to AP) and a backward transmission quality RX_QoS (quality of data transmitted from MT_i to AP; measured by AP) while moving MT_i in a direction of any vector vthat is perpendicular to a straight line (AP to p) at the point p. In this case, TX_QoS and RX_QoS are all data quality parameters that can be measured by MT_i, and may include one or more of a bit error rate (BER), a packet error rate (PER), a signal-to-noise-plus-interference ratio (SNIR), and a received signal strength indicator (RSSI). Parameters constituting the above described TX_QoS and RX_QoS decrease (SNIR, RSSI, etc.) or increase (BER, PER, etc.) as the terminal becomes farther away from the access point . When the parameters increase above or decrease below a specific reference value, forward communication or reverse communication is physically impossible. As such, thresholds of TX_QoS and RX_QoS, which enable the forward communication or reverse communication, are defined as a forward transmission quality threshold TX_QoS_THOLD and a reverse transmission quality threshold RX_QoS_THOLD. That is, if a measured TX_QoS or RX_QoS is within TX_QoS_THOLD or RX_QoS_THOLD, the forward communication or reverse communication becomes possible, and otherwise, the forward communication or reverse communication becomes impossible. As described above, the parameters may be divided into two types: some increase and the others decrease according to a distance from the access point . An expression \u201cwithin the threshold\u201d has various meanings depending on which type is used as an index of TX_QoS and RX_QoS. For example, when BER is used as the index of TX_QoS and RX_QoS, \u201cBER being within a threshold\u201d or \u201cBER satisfying a threshold\u201d means that measured BER is lower or smaller than threshold BER. On the contrary, when SNIR is used as the index of TX_QoS and RX_QoS, \u201cSNIR being within a threshold\u201d or \u201cSNIR satisfying a threshold\u201d means that measured SNIR is higher or larger than threshold SNIR. This is the same with TX_QoS_SLA and RX_QoS_SLA to be described below.","The optimal transmission power calculation unit  may set a service level agreement (SLA) to be higher (SNIR, RSSI, etc.) or lower (BER, PER, etc.) than a threshold according to an attribute of a data service that is intended to be serviced in a corresponding wireless network. The service level agreement (SLA) is defined as a forward transmission quality service level value TX_QoS_SLA and a reverse transmission quality service level value RX_QoS_SLA. That is, the optimal transmission power calculation unit  may define \u0394q (>=0) in order to set TX_QoS_SLA and RX_QoS_SLA as more conservative values than the thresholds TX_QoS_THOLD and RX_QoS_THOLD. In this case, relations among TX_QoS_SLA, RX_QoS_SLA, TX_QoS_THOLD, and RX_QoS_THOLD are as follows.","<Parameters Increase the Farther Away from AP>\n\n__SLA=TX__THOLD+\u0394\n\n__SLA=RX__THOLD+\u0394\n","<Parameters Decrease the Farther Away from AP>\n\n__SLA=TX__THOLD\u2212\u0394\n\n__SLA=RX__THOLD\u2212\u0394\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0086","num":"0085"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","202"],"sub":["0 ","1"]},"In operation , the optimal transmission power calculation unit  sets a position of MT_i as a position p.","In operation , the optimal transmission power calculation unit  sets a counter (a) as 1. The counter (a) is used to perform measurement at a critical communication point repeatedly multiple times in a corresponding direction. That is, since a deviation may occur due to changes in surrounding wireless environment even when forward transmission quality is measured while MT_i moves in the same direction from p, the optimal transmission power calculation unit  according to an embodiment of the present disclosure repeatedly measures the forward transmission quality while repeatedly moving MT_i.","In operations  to , the optimal transmission power calculation unit  measures TX_QoS at every position (P0_v) moving MT_i by \u0394d in a direction from the point palong the vector v() and determines whether the measured TX_QoS is within the TX_QoS_SLA that is a reference value ().

If the determination result of operation  is that the increased transmission power exceeds MT_i_MAX_TP, RX_QoS still does not satisfy the RX_QoS_SLA although the transmission power of MT_i is increased maximally.
