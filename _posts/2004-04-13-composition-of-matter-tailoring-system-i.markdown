No. 10\/123,028 (filed Apr. 12, 2002, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,921,497), which application is a CIP of Ser. No. 09\/416,720 (filed Oct. 13, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,572,792).","All matter has structure. The structure of matter emanates from the electronic structure of the elements of the periodic table. It is the electronic structure of the elements and the new electronic structures that arise as a consequence of their combination in molecules that define the electronic state and character of matter. It is also the electronic structure that creates the properties identified and associated with elements and the matter that results from their combination and arrangement (e.g., molecules and matter).","Certain combinations of elements give rise to states of matter with particularly desirable properties. For instance, certain states of matter have long-range order, which refers to matter that has repeating aligned chemical, electronic, or structural units. Example of such states of matter include surfactant membranes, crystals such as smectic liquid crystals and liquid crystalline polymers, and magnetic materials.","One means of imparting unique properties to a material involves adding carbon to the material. Depending on the parent material and on the amount of carbon added, carbon may remain dissolved in a material or may precipitate out to form discrete carbon structures.","The present invention relates to a new composition of matter comprised of \u2018p\u2019, \u2018d\u2019, and\/or \u2018f\u2019 atomic orbitals, and a process for making the composition of matter. This new composition of matter can be distinguished by a change in energy, electronic properties, physical properties, and the like. X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy is a preferred method of detecting and distinguishing new compositions of matter. The change in properties can be controlled to be transient, fixed, or adjustable (temporarily permanent) and includes properties such as mechanical, electrical, chemical, thermal, engineering, and physical properties, as well structural character of the composition of matter (e.g., alignment, orientation, order, anisotropy, and the like).","The present invention includes manufactured metals and alloys characterized by the x-ray fluorescence spectrometry plots and elemental abundance tables (obtained from x-ray fluorescence analysis) contained herein.","The present invention is additionally a method of processing a metal or an alloy of metals, comprising the steps of:\n\n","Preferably, the present invention is a method of processing copper, comprised of the steps described above.","The present invention also includes a method of processing a metal or an alloy of metals, comprising the steps of:\n\n","In another embodiment, the present invention is a method of processing copper, or other metal or alloy comprising:\n\n","Advantages of the present invention include a method of processing metals into new compositions of matter and producing and characterizing compositions of matter with altered physical and\/or electrical properties.","Electromagnetic chemistry is the science that affects the transfer and circulation of energy in many forms when induced by changes in electromagnetic energy. The theory of Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies (Einstein, 1905) mandates that when the electrodynamic components of the material are manipulated, changes in the energy levels within the atomic orbitals must be induced. These changes in the atomic orbitals are the vehicles by which changes in the (material) properties, such as the magnitude and\/or the orientation, can occur. Alignment of the electrodynamic component induces effects that may result in significant changes in the underlying material species: (1) alignment of atoms with the resulting directionality of physical properties; (2) alignment of energy levels and the capability to produce harmonics, may establish physical properties conducive for energy transfer; (3) alignment of the electrodynamic component include the opening of pathways for free electron flow, and; (4) alignment of electrodynamic field phase orientation.","The present invention relates to new compositions of matter, referred to herein as \u201cmanufactured\u201d metals or alloys of metals. A \u201cmanufactured\u201d metal or alloy is a metal or alloy which exhibits a change in electronic structure, such as that seen in a fluid XRF spectrum. The American Heritage College Dictionary, Third Edition defines \u201cfluid\u201d as changing or tending to change.","Metals of the present invention are generally p, d, or f block metals. Metals include transition metals such as Group 3 metals (e.g., scandium, yttrium, lanthanum), Group 4 metals (e.g, titanium, zirconium, hafnium), Group 5 metals (vanadium, niobium, tantalum), Group 6 metals (e.g., chromium, molybdenum, tungsten), Group 7 metals (e.g., manganese, technetium, rhenium), Group 8 metals (e.g., iron, ruthenium, osmium), Group 9 metals (e.g., cobalt, rhodium, iridium), Group 10 metals (nickel, palladium, platinum), Group 11 metals (e.g., copper, silver, gold), and Group 12 metals (e.g., zinc, cadmium, mercury). Metals of the present invention also include alkali metals (e.g., lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, cesium) and alkaline earth metals (e.g., beryllium magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium). Additional metals include aluminum, gallium, indium, tin, lead, boron, germanium, arsenic, antimony, tellurium, bismuth, and silicon.","The present invention also includes alloys of metals. Alloys are typically mixtures of metals. Alloys of the present invention can be formed, for example, by melting together two or more of the metals listed above. Preferred alloys include those comprised of copper, gold, and silver; tin, zinc, and lead; tin, sodium, magnesium, and potassium; iron, vanadium, chromium, and manganese; and nickel, tantalum, hafnium, and tungsten.","Carbon sources of the present invention include materials that are partially, primarily, or totally comprised of carbon. Those carbon sources that are non-organic and comprised partially of carbon are primarily comprised of one or more metals. Suitable carbon sources include graphite rods, graphite powder, graphite flakes, flillerenes, diamonds, natural gas, methane, ethane, propane, butane, pentane, cast iron, iron comprising carbon, steel comprising carbon, and combinations thereof. A preferred carbon source is a high purity (<5 ppm impurities) carbon source. Another preferred carbon source is a high purity (<5 ppm impurities) graphite rod. The carbon source is selected, in part, based on the system to which it is added. In one example, graphite rods and graphite flakes are added to copper, typically in a sequential manner. In another example, graphite rods and graphite powder are added to iron, typically in a sequential manner.","Carbon sources can be contacted with molten metals for variable periods of time. The period of time the carbon source is in contact with molten metals is the time between adding the carbon source and removing the undissolved carbon source. The period of time can be from about 0.5 hours to about 12 hours, about 1 hour to about 10 hours, about 2 hours to about 8 hours, about 3 hours to about 6 hours, about 3.5 hours to about 4.5 hours, or about 3.9 hours to about 4.1 hours. Alternatively, the period of time can be from about 5 minutes to about 300 minutes, about 10 minutes to about 200 minutes, about 20 minutes to about 120 minutes, about 30 minutes to about 90 minutes, about 40 minutes to about 80 minutes, about 50 minutes to about 70 minutes, or about 59 minutes to about 61 minutes.","A cycle of the present invention includes a period of time where the temperature and\/or the degree to which a metal is saturated with carbon is varied. Over a period of time, varying the temperature involves a period of raising (or increasing) the temperature of a metal or alloy and a period when the temperature of a metal or alloy decreases (either passively, such as by heat transfer to the surrounding environment, or actively, such as by mechanical means), in any order. Inert gas can be added during a cycle, except where it is specified that inert gas addition is ceased prior to that cycle. Increasing the temperature of the metal or alloy increases the amount of carbon that can be dissolved into that metal or alloy, which therefore decreases the degree to which the metal or alloy is saturated with carbon (relative to the temperature and degree of carbon saturation when graphite saturation assemblies are removed the first time). Similarly, decreasing the temperature of the metal or alloy increases the (relative) degree to which the metal or alloy is saturated with carbon.","The degree to which a metal is saturated with carbon varies over the course of a method, as well as within each step. In Examples 1-14, the degree of carbon saturation varies between 70% and 95% in the first cycling step, between 70% and 95% in the second cycling step, between 101% and 103% in the third cycling step, between 104% and 107% in the fourth cycling step, between 108% and 118% in the fifth cycling step, and between 114% and 118% in the sixth cycling step. The cycling steps correspond to Steps (D.), (F.), (H.), (J.), (K.), and (L.), respectively, of the method described in the third paragraph of the summary.","One example of a method of the present invention can be described in terms of carbon saturation values. After a metal or alloy is added to a suitable reactor, establish the dissolved carbon level at 70% to 95% of the equilibrium saturation of carbon for the thermodynamic state specified (e.g., T, P, composition) when the composition is in its natural state (hereinafter the equilibrium saturation of carbon is referred to as \u201c[C]\u201d). Identify temperature set points for 80% and 95% [C]. Vary the temperature between the predetermined set points, such that the temperature is decreased for 7 minutes and increased over 7 minutes per cycle, for 15 cycles. Next, establish a flow of argon Vary the temperature between the predetermined set points, such that the temperature is decreased for 7 minutes and increased over 7 minutes per cycle, for 5 cycles; the temperature should be maintained above 70% [C]at all times and maintained below 95% [C], at all times. The carbon level is raised to saturation (i.e., [C]) with continued argon addition. Hold for 60 minutes at saturation (i.e., [C]) with continued argon addition. Raise the carbon level to 1%(i.e., 1%represents 1%above the saturation value as defined in its natural state) of [C]with continued argon addition and hold for 5 minutes. Vary the temperature for 20 cycles to remain between 1%and 3%of [C], such that the temperature is decreased over 9 minutes and increased over 9 minutes per cycle. Cease argon addition. Cool the metal to 4%of [C]. Vary the temperature for 4.5 cycles to remain between 4%and 7%of [C], such that the temperature is decreased over 3 minutes and increased over 5 minutes. Argon is added as the carbon saturation increases and nitrogen is added as carbon saturation decreases. Cool the metal to obtain 8%with continued argon addition. Vary the temperature over 15.5 cycles to remain between 8%and 18%of [C], such that the temperature is decreased over 15 minutes and increased over 15 minutes. Argon is added as the carbon saturation increases and nitrogen is added as carbon saturation decreases. After the 15.5 cycles are complete, gas addition is halted. Perform one complete cycle by varying the temperature to remain between 18%to 14%of [C](ending at 18%), such that the temperature is increased over 15 minutes and decreased over 15 minutes. Proceed immediately to a cool down that leads to solidification.","An iterative cycle process is a process comprising two or more cycles, whereby one or more of the cycles are carried out at a temperature below the carbon saturation point and one or more cycles are carried out at a temperature above the carbon saturation point. For example, in Example 1, the first cycle is carried out between 2480\u00b0 F. and 2530\u00b0 F., the second cycle is carried out between 2480\u00b0 F. and 2530\u00b0 F., the third cycle is carried out at 2453\u00b0 F. and 2459\u00b0 F., the fourth cycle is carried out between 2441\u00b0 F. and 2450\u00b0 F., the fifth cycle is carried out between 2406\u00b0 F. and 2438\u00b0 F., and the sixth cycle is carried out between 2406\u00b0 F. and 2419\u00b0 F. A cycle following an earlier cycle can have the identical temperature range as the earlier cycle, a partially overlapping temperature range with the earlier cycle, a temperature range above that of the earlier cycle, or a temperature cycle below that of the earlier cycle. Partially overlapping temperature ranges includes ranges where one temperature range falls within the limits of a second temperature range (e.g., 2406\u00b0 F. to 2438\u00b0 F. and 2406\u00b0 F. to 2419\u00b0 F.). Preferably, during an iterative cycling process, the degree to which the metal or alloy is saturated with carbon increases over the process.","Cycles of the present invention can vary in duration. The duration of a cycle can vary among cycles in a step. A cycle duration is, for example, about 2 minutes to about 90 minutes, about 3 minutes to about 67 minutes, about 5 minutes to about 45 minutes, about 8 minutes to about 30 minutes, about 10 minutes to about 20 minutes, about 14 minutes to about 18 minutes, about 7 minutes to about 9 minutes, about 13 minutes to about 15 minutes, about 17 minutes to about 19 minutes, about 28 minutes to about 32 minutes, or about 29 minutes to about 31 minutes.","A cycle can be symmetry or asymmetric. In a symmetric cycle, the period of increasing the metal or alloy temperature is equal to the period of decreasing the metal or alloy temperature. In an asymmetric cycle, the period of increasing the metal or alloy temperature is different than the period of decreasing the metal or alloy temperature. For an asymmetric cycle, the period of increasing the metal or alloy temperature can be longer than or shorter than the period of decreasing the metal or alloy temperature.","For example, in a cycle lasting about 7 minutes to about 9 minutes, the temperature can be increased for about 3 minutes and the temperature can be decreased for about 5 minutes. If the cycle lasts about 13 minutes to about 15 minutes, the temperature can be increased for about 7 minutes and the temperature can be decreased for about 7 minutes. If the cycle lasts about 17 minutes to about 19 minutes, the temperature can be increased for about 9 minutes and the temperature can be decreased for about 9 minutes. If the cycle lasts about 29 minutes to about 31 minutes, the temperature can be increased for about 15 minutes and the temperature can decreased for about 15 minutes.","The number of cycles in a step is generally an integer or half-integer value. For example, the number of cycles in a step can be one or more, one to forty, or one to twenty. The number of cycles can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, or 40. Alternatively, the number of cycles in a step can be 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5.5, 6.5, 7.5, 8.5, 9.5, 10.5, 11.5, 12.5, 13.5, 14.5, 15.5, 16.5, 17.5, 18.5, 19.5, 20.5, 21.5, 22.5, 23.5, 24.5, 25.5, 26.5, 27.5, 28.5, 29.5, or 30.5. In a step comprising a half-integer or a non-integer quantity of cycles, either heating or cooling can occur first.","After the initial heating step, the temperature of a metal or an alloy is sufficiently high, such that the temperature is equal to or greater than the solidus temperature. The solidus temperature varies depending on the metal or the alloy, and the amount of carbon dissolved therein. The temperature at the end of Step (F.) of the third paragraph of the summary is typically about 900\u00b0 F. to about 3000\u00b0 F., but varies from metal to metal. For example, the temperature at the end of Step (F.) can be about 1932\u00b0 F. to about 2032\u00b0 F., about 1957\u00b0 F. to about 2007\u00b0 F., or about 1932\u00b0 F. to about 2467\u00b0 F. for copper; about 2368\u00b0 F. to about 2468\u00b0 F., about 2393\u00b0 F. to about 2443\u00b0 F., or about 2368\u00b0 F. to about 2855\u00b0 F. for nickel; about 2358\u00b0 F. to about 2458\u00b0 F. or about 2373\u00b0 F. to about 2423\u00b0 F., or about 2358\u00b0 F. to about 2805\u00b0 F. for cobalt; about 1932\u00b0 F. to about 2032\u00b0 F., about 1957\u00b0 F. to about 2007\u00b0 F., or about 1932\u00b0 F. to about 2467\u00b0 F. for a copper\/gold\/silver alloy; about 399\u00b0 F. to about 499\u00b0 F., about 424\u00b0 F. to about 474\u00b0 F., or about 399\u00b0 F. to about 932\u00b0 F. for a tin\/lead\/zinc alloy; about 399\u00b0 F. to about 499\u00b0 F., about 424\u00b0 F. to about 474\u00b0 F., or about 399\u00b0 F. to 932\u00b0 F. for a tin\/sodium\/potassium\/magnesium alloy; about 2550\u00b0 F. to about 2650\u00b0 F., about 2575\u00b0 F. to about 2625\u00b0 F., or about 2550\u00b0 F. to about 2905\u00b0 F. for silicon; about 2058\u00b0 F. to about 2158\u00b0 F., about 2073\u00b0 F. to about 2123\u00b0 F., or about 2058\u00b0 F. to about 2855\u00b0 F. for iron; about 2058\u00b0 F. to about 2158\u00b0 F., about 2073\u00b0 F. to about 2123\u00b0 F., or about 2058\u00b0 F. to about 2855\u00b0 F. for an iron\/vanadium\/chromium\/manganese alloy; or 2368\u00b0 F. to about 2468\u00b0 F., about 2393\u00b0 F. to about 2443\u00b0 F., or about 2368\u00b0 F. to about 2855\u00b0 F. for a nickel\/tantalum\/hafnium\/tungsten alloy.","Inert gas or gases can be added during a step. Inert gases are chosen, independently, from the group consisting of argon, nitrogen, helium, neon, xenon, krypton, hydrogen, and mixtures thereof. When an inert gas is added during a step, the inert gas (or mixture thereof) can change from cycle-to-cycle or within a cycle","For purposes of the present invention, inert gases used for purging, particularly in the backspace of a reactor are generally considered separately from the other inert gases. Nitrogen is typically added continuously through a method of the present invention, irrespective of whether \u201cinert gas\u201d flow into the metal is started or stopped. In one example, a nitrogen flow is maintained throughout an entire method, such that a nitrogen pressure of about 0.4-0.6 psi, or about 0.5 psi is maintained.","At the end of the instant methods, the molten metal or alloy is cooled. The metal or alloy is cooled, at minimum, to a temperature below the solidus temperature. Preferably, the metal or alloy is cooled to room or ambient temperature. Such cooling can include gradual and\/or rapid cooling steps. Gradual cooling typically includes cooling due to heat exchange with air or an inert gas over 1 to 72 hours, 2 to 50 hours, 3 to 30 hours, or 8 to 72 hours. Rapid cooling, also known as quenching, typically includes an initial cooling with air or an inert gas to below the solidus temperature, thereby forming a solid mass, and placing the solid mass into a bath comprising a suitable fluid such as tap water, distilled water, deionized water, other forms of water, inert gases (as defined above), liquid nitrogen or other suitable liquified gases, a thermally-stable oil (e.g., silicone oil) or organic coolant, and combinations thereof. The bath should contain a suitable quantity of liquid at a suitable temperature, such that the desired amount of cooling occurs.","Methods of the present invention are carried out in a suitable reactor. Suitable reactors are selected depending on the amount of metal or alloy to be processed, mode of heating, extent of heating (temperature) required, and the like. A preferred reactor in the present method is an induction furnace reactor, which is capable of operating in a frequency range of 0 kHz to about 10,000 kHz, 0 kHz to about 3,000 kHz, or 0 kHz to about 1,000 kHz. Reactors operating at lower frequencies are desirable for larger metal charges, such that a reactor operating at 0-3,000 kHz is generally suitable for 20 pound metal charges and a reactor operating at 0-1,000 kHz is generally suitable for 5000 pound metal charges.","Typically, reactors of the present method are lined with a suitable crucible. Crucibles are selected, in part, based on the amount of metal or alloy to be heated and the temperature of the method. Crucibles selected for the present method typically have a capacity from about five pounds to about five tons. One preferred crucible is comprised of 89.07% AlO, 10.37% SiO, 0.16% TiO, 0.15% FeO, 0.03% CaO, 0.01% MgO, 0.02% NaO, and 0.02% KO, and has a 9\u2033 outside diameter; a 7.75\u2033 inside diameter, and a 14\u2033 depth. A second preferred crucible is comprised of 99.68% AlO, 0.07% SiO, 0.08% FeO, 0.04% CaO, and 0.12% NaO, and has a 4.5\u2033 outside diameter, a 3.75\u2033 inside diameter and a 10\u2033 depth.","After being subjected to a process of the present invention, metals and alloys can be analyzed by a variety of techniques, including chemical and physical methods. A preferred analytical method is x-ray fluorescence spectrometry. X-ray fluorescence spectrometry is described in \u201cX-Ray Fluorescence Spectrometry\u201d, by George J. Havrilla in \u201cHandbook of Instrumental Techniques for Analytical Chemistry,\u201d Frank A. Settle, Ed., Prentice-Hall, Inc: 1997, which is incorporated herein by reference.","XRF spectrometry is a well-known and long-practiced method, which has been used to detect and quantify or semi-quantify the elemental composition (for elements with Z\u226711) of solid and liquid samples. This technique benefits from minimal sample preparation, wide dynamic range, and being nondestructive. Typically, XRF data are not dependent on which dimension (e.g., axial or radial) of a sample was analyzed. Accuracy of less than 1% error can generally be achieved with XRF spectrometry, and the technique can have detection limits of parts per million.","XRF spectrometry first involves exciting an atom, such that an inner shell electron is ejected (e.g., the photoelectric effect). Upon ejection of an electron, an outer shell electron will \u201cdrop\u201d down into the lower-energy position of the ejected inner shell electron. When the outer shell electron \u201cdrops\u201d into the lower-energy inner shell, x-ray energy is released. Typically, an electron is ejected from the K, L, or M shell and is replaced by an electron from the L, M, or N shell. Because there are numerous combinations of ejections and replacements possible for any given element, x-rays of several energies are emitted during a typical XRF experiment. Therefore, each element in the Periodic Table has a standard pattern of x-ray emissions after being excited by a sufficiently energetic source, since each such element has its own characteristic electronic state. By matching a pattern of emitted x-ray energies to values found in tables, such as those on pages 10-233 to 10-271 of \u201cHandbook of Chemistry and Physics, 73Edition,\u201d edited by D. R. Lide, CRC Press, 1992, which is incorporated herein by reference, one can identify which elements are present in a sample. In addition, the intensity of the emitted x-rays allows one to quantify the amount of an element in a sample.","There are two standard variations of the XRF technique. First, as an energy-dispersive method (EDXRF), the XRF technique uses a detector such as a Si(Li) detector, which is capable of simultaneously measuring the energy and intensity of x-ray photons from an array of elements. EDXRF is well-suited for rapid acquisition of data to determine gross elemental composition. Typically, the detection limits for EDXRF are in the range of tens to hundreds of parts-per-million. A wavelength-dispersive technique (WDXRF) is generally better-suited for analyses requiring high accuracy and precision. WDXRF uses a crystal to disperse emitted x-rays, based on Bragg's Law. Natural crystals, such as lithium fluoride and germanium, are commonly used for high-energy (short wavelength) x-rays, while synthetic crystals are commonly used for low-energy (longer wavelength) x-rays. Crystals are chosen, in part, to achieve desired resolution, so that x-rays of different energies are disperse to distinguishable 2\u03b8 angles. WDXRF can either measure x-rays sequentially, such that a WDXRF instrument will step through a range of 2\u03b8 angles in recording a spectrum, or there will be detectors positioned at multiple 2\u03b8 angles, allowing for more rapid analysis of a sample. Detectors for WDXRF commonly include gas ionization and scintillation detectors. A further description of the use WDXRF technique in the present invention can be found in Example 1. Results from EDXRF and results from WDXRF can be compared by determining the relationship between a 2\u03b8 angle and the wavelength of the corresponding x-ray (e.g., using Bragg's Law) and converting the wavelength into an energy (e.g., energy equals wavelength multiplied by Planck's constant).","Analysis of emitted x-rays can be carried out automatically or semi-automatically, such as by using a software package (e.g., UniQuant, which is sold by Omega Data Systems BV, Veldhoven, The Netherlands) for either EDXRF or WDXRF. UniQuant is used for standardless semi-quantitative to quantitative XRF analysis using the intensities measured by a sequential x-ray spectrometer. The software package unifies all types of samples into one analytical program. The UniQuant software program is highly effective for analyzing samples for which no standards are available. Sample preparation is usually minimal or not required at all. Samples can be of very different natures, sizes and shapes. Elements from fluorine or sodium up to uranium, or their oxide compounds, can be analyzed in samples such as a piece of glass, a screw, metal drillings, lubricating oil, loose fly ash powder, polymers, phosphoric acid, thin layers on a substrate, soil, paint, the year rings of trees, and, in general, those samples for which no standards are available. The reporting is in weight % along with an estimated error for each element.","In software packages, such as UniQuant, an XRF spectrum is composed of data channels. Each data channel corresponds to an energy range and contains information about the number of x-rays emitted at that energy. The data channels can be combined into one coherent plot to show the number or intensity of emitted x-rays versus energy or 2\u03b8 angle (the 2\u03b8 angle is related to the wavelength of an x-ray), such that the plot will show a series of peaks. An analysis of the peaks by one skilled in the art or the software package can identify the correspondence between the experimentally-determined peaks and the previously-determined peaks of individual elements. For an element, peak location (i.e., the centroid of the peak with respect to energy or 2\u03b8 angle), peak profile\/shape, peak creation, and peak fluidity would be expected to be essentially the same, within experimental error, for any sample containing the element. If the same quantity of an element is present in two samples, intensity will also be essentially the same, excepting experimental error and matrix effects.","A typical software package is programmed to correlate certain data channels with the emitted x-rays of elements. Quantification of the intensity of emitted x-rays is accomplished by integrating the XRF spectrum over a number of data channels. Based on the measured intensities and the previously-compiled data on elements, the software package will integrate over all data channels, correlate the emitted x-ray intensities, and will then calculate the relative abundance or quantity of elements which appear to be present in a sample, based upon comparison to the standards. Ideally, the relative abundances will total 100% prior to normalization. However, for a variety of reasons, such as improper or insufficient calibration, the relative abundances will not total 100% prior to normalization. Another reason that the relative abundances of elements do not total 100% prior to normalization is that a portion of the XRF spectrum falls outside of the data channels that the software package correlates with an element (i.e., a portion of the XRF spectrum is not recognized as belonging to an element and is not included in the relative abundance calculation). In this case, the relative abundances will likely total less than 100% prior to normalization. Representative examples of relative abundance data are presented in Table 4, which includes the results of XRF analyses of the products of Examples 1-10, as processed by a Uniquant software package.","X-ray emission spectrometry (XES), a technique analogous to XRF, also provides electronic information about elements. In XES, a lower-energy source is used to eject electrons from a sample, such that only the surface (to several micrometers) of the sample is analyzed. Similar to XRF, a series of peaks is generated, which corresponds to outer shell electrons replacing ejected inner shell electrons. The peak shape, peak fluidity, peak creation, peak intensity, peak centroid, and peak profile are expected to be essentially the same, within experimental error and matrix effects, for two samples having the same composition.","A new composition of matter of the present invention can manifest itself as a transient, adjustable, or permanent change in energy and\/or associated properties, as broadly defined. Property change can be exhibited as or comprise a change in: (1) structural atomic character (e.g., XES\/XRF peak creation, peak fluidity, peak intensity, peak centroid, peak profile or shape as a function of material\/sample orientation, atomic energy level(s), and TEM, STM, MFM scans); (2) electronic character (e.g., electron electromagnetic interactions, electromagnetic field position\/orientation, energy gradients, Hall effect, voltage, capacitance, voltage decay rate, voltage gradient, voltage signature including slope of decay and\/or change of slope decay, voltage magnitude, voltage orientation); (3) structural molecular or atomic character (e.g, SEM, TEM, STM, AFM, LFM, and MFM scans, optical microscopy images, and structural orientation, ordering, long range alignment\/ordering, anisotropy); (4) physical constants (e.g., color, crystalline form, specific rotation, emissivity, melting point, boiling point, density, refractive index, solubility, hardness, surface tension, dielectric, magnetic susceptibility, coefficient of friction, x-ray wavelengths); (5) physical properties (e.g., mechanical, chemical, electrical, thermal, engineering, and the like); and, (6) other changes that differentiate naturally occurring materials from manufactured materials created by inducing a change in matter.","1.

In these analyses, the axial direction or an axial trace refers to a side of the block that was originally parallel to the side walls of a reactor.

Manufactured copper in the axial direction exhibits similar composition to natural copper (i.e., 99.98%), but radial scans exhibit new peaks in the region close to naturally occurring S, Cl, and K. The shifting centroid of the observed peaks from the natural species (i.e., S, Cl, K) confirm electronic change in the atomic state of the base element; as does the non-contact MFM void scan (compare  with ).

This is the K line that would be expected if detectable quantities of sulfur were present; however, an IR LECO analysis of this sample showed that there was no sulfur was present (<10 ppm) in the sample. The presence of this line indicates an electronic structure change, which has shifted the two theta degree position of the K line compared to natural copper ().

Structural Molecular\/Atomic Character","New compositions of matter can be electronically modified to induce long range ordering\/alignment. In one new composition of matter, long range ordering was induced in oxygen-free high conductivity (OFHC) copper. Optical microscopy and SEM imaging of the material verifies the degree and extent of long range ordering achieved (, B, C, A, B, and C). Under similar electronic conditions, long range ordering was induced in high purity (99.99%) nickel. , B, A, and B show the optical microscopy imaging of the manufactured nickel material. A comparison of alignment is shown in-run, at two different points during processing, which highlights the adjustability of the altered electronic state of the manufactured nickel.","Extensive atomic force microscopy and non-contact MFM imaging of electronically altered OFHC copper shows views of structural configurations from a different perspective (, B, C, A, B, and C). Non-contact MFM imaging shows clear pattern repetition and intensity of the manufactured copper when compared to the natural copper. The manufactured copper represents a new composition of matter derived from natural copper, and the manufactured copper exhibits anisotropic behavior.","4. Physical Constants","In one sequence of new compositions of matter, color changes in OFHC copper were induced. The variation in color over four (4) new matter compositions ranged from black (two intensities) to copper (2 intensities) to gold (one intensity) to silver (one intensity). While not being bound by theory, the alteration of copper's electronic state along the continuum enables the new composition of matter's color to be adjusted along the continuum.","In another sequence of new compositions of matter, changes in the hardness of OFHC copper were induced. The variation in diamond pyramid hardness between different manufactured copper samples ranged from about 25 to 90 (or 3 to 9 times higher than natural copper). Hardness change was anisotropic.","In another new composition of matter, magnetism was induced in a high purity, non-magnetic metal copper (e.g., 99.98%) in its elemental form ().","5. Physical Properties","In one sequence of new compositions of matter, ductility changes were induced in a high purity, ductile copper (99.98%) in its elemental form. The variation in the engineering physical property of ductility ranged from brittle to semi-ductile to ductile to extremely ductile over four (4) new matter compositions.","In one new composition of matter, the electrical reactance was increased approximately 3% above that of natural copper over the frequency range of 0 Hz to 100 kHz. In another new composition of matter, electrical susceptance was increased approximately 20% above 99.98%copper of the same chemical composition (i.e., the copper in its natural state). In another new composition of matter, electrical susceptance was decreased approximately 25% below 99.98%copper of the same chemical composition (i.e., the copper in its natural state). Electrical susceptance for these new matter compositions compared to the control standard (the material in its natural state) is shown in .","6. Additional Differentiations","In one sequence of new compositions of matter, which all used the same raw materials, consumables, utilities, and materials of construction, the sum of element concentrations identified by XRF analysis varied considerably. Variations in elemental abundance determined by XRF Uniquant prior to normalization over three (3) new matter compositions were 99.5%(Table 3), 96.0%(Table 2), and 90.6%(Table 1). The apparent loss of matter between the recognized elemental structures and the manufactured elemental structures differentiates naturally occurring materials from materials with modified electronic structures (i.e., a new composition of matter).","While not being bound by theory, Applicant believes the conservation of energy requires that all mass, independent of magnitude and\/or configuration, character, and\/or dimension can be characterized by the allowed set of mathematical poles (defined as the operation zurn) and further characterized by the set of mathematical poles coalesced (defined as the isozurn value). An adjustment or manipulation of the zurn invokes a change in the isozurn value to a value different than its naturally occurring value, and accounts for the contribution of its rest state value, thereby modifying the electronic structure that defines the natural state. A change in the isozurn value to a value different than that which specifies the natural state denotes a change in the underlying electronic state of the specified species.","A change in the isozurn value is typically noted at the subatomic, atomic, or molecular level. While not being bound by theory, the complexity of energy interactions is believed to often impede single variable isolation. In these cases, a change in the electronic state of the specified species typically manifests itself as a change in a property value(s) from the naturally occurring state (e.g., the unaltered entropic driven ground state). Typical changes denoting a change in property value, which depart from the property value specifying its naturally occurring state, dictate a change in the isozurn value of that state.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0129","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0007","list-style":"none"},"li":["AO\u2014Atomic Orbital","SEM\u2014Scanning electron microscopy","TEM\u2014Tunneling Electron Microscopy","STM\u2014Scanning Tunneling Microscopy","AFM\u2014Atomic Force Microscopy","LFM\u2014Lateral Force Microscopy","MFM\u2014Magnetic Force Microscopy","XES\u2014X-ray Emission Spectrometry","XRF\u2014X-ray Fluorescence Spectrometry"]}},"A cylindrical alumina-based crucible (99.68% AlO, 0.07% SiO, 0.08% FeO, 0.04% CaO, 0.12% NaO; 4.5\u2033 O.D.\u00d73.75\u2033 I.D.\u00d710\u2033 depth) of a 100 pound induction furnace reactor (Inductotherm) fitted with a 75-30R Powertrak power supply was charged with 2500 g copper (99.98% purity) through its charging port.

Differences in the coloration and appearance of the axial and radial directions were observed: matte, burgundy brown coloration on the side, and glassy on the top with demarcations.","This ingot had internal voids. The ingot demonstrated enhanced chemical reactivity on the axial surfaces. Refractory was found to be tightly bound to select portions of the radial surfaces. Minimal magnetic activity was detected.","A cylindrical alumina-based crucible (89.07% AlO, 10.37% SiO, 0.16% TiO, 0.15% FeO, 0.03% CaO, 0.01% MgO, 0.02% NaO, 0.02% KO; 9\u2033 O.D.\u00d77.75\u2033 I.D.\u00d714\u2033 depth) of a 100 pound induction furnace reactor supplied by Inductotherm, fitted with a 75-30R Powertrak power supply and was charged with 100 pounds copper (99.98% purity) through its charging port. During the entire procedure, a slight positive pressure of nitrogen (\u02dc0.5 psi) was maintained in the reactor using a continuous backspace purge. The reactor was heated to the metal charge liquidus point plus 300\u00b0 F., at a rate no greater than 300\u00b0 F.\/hour, as limited by the integrity of the crucible. The induction furnace operated in the frequency range of 0 kHz to 3000 kHz, with frequency determined by a temperature-controlled feedback loop implementing an Omega Model CN300 temperature controller.","The temperature was again increased to 2462\u00b0 F. again using a rate no greater than 300\u00b0 F.\/hour. When this temperature was reached, graphite saturation assemblies (\u215c\u2033 OD, 36\u2033 long high purity (<5 ppm impurities) graphite rods) were inserted to the bottom of the copper charge through ports located in the top plate. The copper was held at 2462\u00b0 F. for 4 hours. Every 30 minutes during the hold period, an attempt was made to lower the graphite saturation assemblies as dissolution occurred. As the copper became saturated with carbon, the graphite saturation assemblies were consumed. After the 4 hour hold period was complete, the graphite saturation assemblies were removed.","The reactor temperature was increased to 2480\u00b0 F. over 7 minutes.
