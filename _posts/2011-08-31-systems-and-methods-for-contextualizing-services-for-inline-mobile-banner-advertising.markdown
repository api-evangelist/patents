title: Systems and methods for contextualizing services for inline mobile banner advertising
abstract: The present disclosure is directed to systems and methods for processing advertisement opportunities when a user views content on a mobile device. An agent on a mobile device may contextualize a portion of a page being viewed to identify and send contextual data to a contextualization service. The contextualization service may use the contextual data to select a campaign from a plurality of campaigns to deliver an in line banner advertisement for content being viewed. Based on the selected campaign, the contextualization service may send the agent an advertisement or campaign information for display, such as an inline banner at a natural break in the content being viewed. Instead of having an advertisement predetermined or fixed prior to the display of the content, the present systems and methods may dynamically contextualize the page at the point of viewing based on the content of the page being viewed.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The disclosure generally relates to the field of contextualizing content for augmenting a web page, in particular to contextualizing content currently being displayed on a mobile device to deliver an advertisement as an inline banner to the content.","Hypertext is used to provide information in a web page. Hypertext is the organization of computer based text into connected associations enabling a user to quickly access information that the user chooses. An instance of such an association is called a hyperlink or hypertext link. A hyperlink, when selected, leads the viewer to another web page (or file or resource, collectively called the destination page).","In order to access the supplemental information provided through hyperlinks, viewers are required to leave their current web pages. This requirement interrupts the viewers' web browsing experience. As a result, most viewers are reluctant to visit the destination page provided by hyperlinks.","In some cases, the viewer leaves the web page to visit a destination page that does not have information desired by the viewer. The user then may have to search for other destination pages to try to obtain the desired information. This may lead the viewer to perform multiple searches and visit several pages to find the desired information. The viewer may become frustrated with the amount of activity to find or not find the desired information and with leaving the current destination page to do so.","The present solution provides contextualization services to deliver an inline banner advertisement to display within content being viewed on a page on a mobile device. The present solution is directed to advertisement opportunities at the point of a user viewing content on a mobile device, such as while a user is scrolling through textual content of a web page on their mobile device. In general overview, an agent on a mobile device may contextualize a portion of a page being viewed to identify and send contextual data to the contextualization service of a server. The contextualization service may use the contextual data to select a campaign from a plurality of campaigns to deliver an in line banner advertisement for the content being viewed on the mobile device. Based on the selected campaign, the contextualization service may send an advertisement or campaign information to the agent for display, such as an inline banner at a natural break in the content being viewed on the mobile device. Instead of having an advertisement predetermined or fixed prior to the display of the content on the mobile device, the present solution dynamically contextualizes the page at the point of the user viewing portions of the page on the mobile device (e.g., scrolling the portion into view) and the contextualization is based on the content of the page being viewed","In some aspects, the present solution is directed to a method for providing in-line advertisement for mobile devices.

System and Network Environment","Some of the disclosed embodiments describe examples of a method (and corresponding system and computer program product) for augmenting files with related resources through layered augmentation. Viewers of the augmented files can access the related resources through a multi-layered dialog box. The process of providing additional resources through multilayered dialog box and the multi-layered dialog box are collectively called layered augmentation.","An embodiment of the method identifies data in a file, associates the identified data with reference data in a reference database, and stores the associations in a corresponding augmented file. A viewer of the augmented file can access resources related to a piece of augmented data through layered augmentation. When the viewer moves a pointer over the piece of augmented data (also called mouse-over), the related resources are provided in a multi-layered dialog box. The dialog box is overlaid on the augmented file approximate to the position where the mouse-over occurred. The viewer can navigate through the related resources in the dialog box without leaving the augmented file.","As described herein, a file includes any types of documents such as web pages. Augmented data, the data with integrated association in an augmented file, include any types of content such as text and image. Resources provided through layered augmentations include textual content, visual content such as images and videos, interactive controls such as dialog boxes, and services such as Internet search service and advertisement. A pointer can be any pointer device such as a mouse, a trackball, a roller, and a touchpad.

The augmentation server  retrieves web pages from the content providers  and augments the web pages. The augmentation server  augments a web page by identifying keywords in the web page, associating (or tagging) the keywords with one or more related references in a reference database, generating an augmented web page, and storing the associations in a database. When a user views an augmented web page in a client computer  and moves a pointer over one of the augmented keywords (hereinafter \u201cthe activated keyword\u201d), the augmentation server  displays (or avails) related advertisements in the client computer  through a multi-layered dialog box. An example architecture of the augmentation server  is described in detail below with respect to .","The content providers  are entities that provide (or generate), host, publish, control, or otherwise have rights over a collection of web pages (or other types of documents). In one embodiment, the content providers  are web servers hosting web pages for viewers to access. The content providers  may provide web pages to the augmentation server  for layered augmentation.

Systems and Methods for Providing Augmented Content",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0071"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["110","110","36","42","45","48","39","36","45"]},"A source data file  (e.g., a web page) resides on a server (e.g., a content provider ) on a network  (e.g., the Internet). The handler  retrieves the source data file  for augmentation by the augmentation server . The locator  examines the retrieved source data file  for comparison to data in the reference database . In one embodiment, the locator  analyzes content of the source data file  for keywords, searches corresponding reference data in the reference database , and provides the keywords and the corresponding reference data to the analyzer . In an alternate embodiment, rather than analyzing the source data file  for keywords, the locator  retrieves a list of keywords from the reference database  and enumerates through the textual content of the source data file  for matches.","The analyzer  creates associations between the keywords and the corresponding reference data found by the locator . The generator  generates an augmented data file  by embedding the associations created by the analyzer  in the source data file . The generator  embeds associations by generating intelligent tags for the keywords, and augmenting the keywords with the intelligent tags. In one embodiment, an intelligent tag is an alphabetic and\/or numeric string that identifies its associated keywords, and\/or reference data, and optionally includes an unique identification number (hereinafter called the association ID). The generator  inserts the generated intelligent tags into the source data file  to generate the augmented data file . Web pages with the integrated intelligent tags are called augmented web pages. Keywords with the integrated intelligent tags are called augmented keywords. The generator  also stores the identified keywords and\/or the associations in a database for later references.","The resulting augmented data file  is returned to the handler  to reside at a Universal Resource Locator (URL) address on the network  (e.g., at the content provider  from which the source data file  is retrieved). In one embodiment, the handler  also receives requests (or signals) from client computers  indicating user interactions with the augmented data file, and transmits to the client computers  related advertisements for display through layered augmentation. Layered augmentation is described in detail below with respect to . The handler  retrieves the activated keywords (e.g., from the requests), and determines one or more relevant advertisements from an advertising database (not shown) that matches the keywords and\/or the associated reference data. In one embodiment, rather than transmitting the related advertisements, the handler  transmits addresses (e.g., URLs) of the relevant advertisements to the requesting client computer . The client computer  resolves the addresses to retrieve the advertisements.","The reference database  stores reference data such as types of advertisements (e.g., television advertisements), categories of advertisements (e.g., storage rental, home equity loan), and\/or information about specific advertisements (e.g., associated keywords, format information, price the advertiser is willing to pay, and URL of the advertisement). The reference database  may be a relational database or any other type of database that stores the data, such as a flat file. In one embodiment, the reference database  is a web enabled reference database supporting remote calls through the Internet to the reference database .","The components of the augmentation server  can reside on a single computer system or several computer systems located close by or remotely from each other. For example, the analyzer  and the generator  may reside on separate web servers, and the reference database  may be located in a dedicated database server. In addition, any of the components or sub-components may be executed in one or multiple computer systems.","Web pages (or web browsers) can provide additional information to viewers. For example, when a user places a mouse over a link label of a hyperlink, a web browser displays the associated destination URL (e.g., on a status bar of the web browser). As another example, when a user places a pointer over a keyword, the web browser may generate a pop-up dialog box, and display relevant information (e.g., an explanation of the keyword). The process of providing additional information to web page viewers is called augmentation.","A keyword (or phrase) often has multiple aspects of related information, each having multiple aspects of related information. For example, the key phrase \u201cdigital camera\u201d is related to its history, underlying technology, and available products and services. A specific product related to digital camera has related information such as product description, customer review, and competing products. Usually only one aspect of the related information is provided through augmentation due to limited display space.","Multiple aspects of related information can be arranged and provided to viewers through layered augmentation. Each aspect of related information can be assigned to one specific layer of the layered augmentation. Viewers can navigate among the multiple aspects of related information by accessing the different layers of the layered augmentation without leaving the web page. For example, the augmented information can be displayed in a multi-layered dialog box. A viewer can navigate among different layers by selecting associated tabs displayed in the dialog box in which each tab is associated with a layer. Alternatively, the multiple layers may be stacked in a manner similar to windows in Microsoft Windows\u2122 Operating System. The stacked layers may be arranged in a horizontal, vertical, or cascade style, showing a small exposed portion of each layer, such as a title area or a corner area. Navigation between each layer in the stack can be through selection of that small exposed portion of the layer within the stack. The process of providing additional information (or resources) through multi-layered dialog box and the multi-layered dialog box are collectively called layered augmentation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0080"},"figref":"FIGS. 3A through 3C","b":["300","350","390","100"]},"By way of example, the illustrated method may be embodied through instructions for performing the actions described herein and such instrumentations can be stored within a tangible computer readable medium and are executable by a processor. Alternatively (or additionally), the illustrated method may be implemented in modules like those in the augmentation server  described above with respect to  and\/or other entities such as the content providers  and\/or the client computers .

In one embodiment, the locator  searches for reference data in the reference database  that match the piece of structured data by making function calls to the reference database . In one embodiment, the structured data are keywords, and the reference data also contain keywords.","Keywords are a facile and efficient means of generating layered augmentation. In addition to or instead of using keywords, one embodiment uses a \u201cfuzzy expert\u201d or a neural network analysis of the source data file , such as by a natural language search of the source data file  to generate a distinct identifier for the content in the source data file . One advantage of a natural language search is the ability to better place content in context making links more contextually appropriate, for instance, security might relate to security of a physical plant such as security of a residence in one source data file  in one context and security of a website in another. In one embodiment, the method  determines a context of the keywords and\/or the source data file  based on statistical modeling (e.g., through the locator ). For example, a context can be assigned a pre-defined set of terms which acts as a fingerprint for the context (hereinafter called context fingerprint). The locator  can compare the context fingerprints associated with a collection of contexts with the terms within the source data file  to determine a percentage match for each context in the collection. Where a high percentage match is achieved (e.g., exceeding a pre-defined percentage match threshold), the locator  determines that the associated context is the context for the source data file . Alternatively or in conjunction, the locator  may determine the context associated with the highest percentage match as the context for the source data file . The context can be used to locate corresponding reference data and\/or related resources.","At a block , the method  generates an association to the piece of structured data based upon the located matching reference data (e.g., through the analyzer ). In one embodiment, a piece of reference data includes an identifier such as a keyword, a context, a unique identification number, and\/or associated URL address(es) of intended destination resource(s) based upon the occurrence of the corresponding keywords in the source data file . Generating an association means to associate the piece of structured data located in the source data file  with the located reference data in the reference database . The generated association might optionally include additional identification codes such as an association ID. The method  then augments the original source data file  with the generated association at a block  to generate an augmented data file  (e.g., through the generator ).","In one embodiment, the method  expresses the association as intelligent tags (e.g., through the generator ). The method  generates intelligent tags for the located keywords and tags the keywords with the generated intelligent tags. The intelligent tags contain information about the associated keywords such as the keyword and related context, and information about the associated reference data such as IDs that uniquely identify the reference data in the reference database . For example, the intelligent tags may contain requirement (or preference) information about advertisements (or other types of resources) to be associated with the keyword, such as types of advertisements and a minimum advertisement fee. In one embodiment, the intelligent tags also format the augmented keywords differently than the other textual content in the augmented web pages. Having generated the augmented data file , the method  then terminates at a block .","In one embodiment, the augmentation server  (or the content providers ) also augments the web pages by including computer code (hereinafter called client code) to monitor and report viewers' interactions with the augmented keywords. The computer code can be in any computer language, such as JavaScript. Additional functions of the client code are described in detail below with respect to .","The augmented data file  can be delivered (or transmitted) to client computers  for display through a web browser to viewers to provide related resources through layered augmentation. The delivery of the augmented data file  and the process to provide layered augmentation is described in detail below with respect to . For purpose of illustration, the method is described in terms of web pages augmented with advertisements, even though the disclosed embodiments apply to other types of augmented data file and resources.","Referring now to , a flowchart illustrating an example process (or method)  for providing layered augmentation to viewers of augmented web pages. As illustrated, the method  transmits  an augmented web page to a client computer. For example, a user of the client computer  may enter the URL of an augmented web page (or the corresponding original web page) in the address bar of a conventional web browser (e.g., Microsoft Internet Explorer\u2122, Mozilla Firefox\u2122, or Apple Safari\u2122) The web browser of the client computer  (hereinafter called the client web browser) resolves the URL and transmits a request for the web page to a corresponding content provider. Responding to the request, the content provider transmits  the augmented web page to the client web browser for display. In one embodiment, the client web browser displays augmented keywords in a double underline style and\/or in a color distinctive from text that is not augmented in the augmented web page.","The method  receives  an intelligent tag request from the client computer . As described above with respect to , the augmented web page contains client code that monitors user interactions with augmented keywords. In one embodiment, if the user moves a pointer (e.g., a pointer controlled by a mouse, navigation button, or touchpad) over (a mouse-over) an augmented keyword (the activated keyword), the client code (which may be integrated with the web browser, for example, as a plug-in applet) generates an intelligent tag request and transmits the request to the augmentation server . The request indicates the mouse-over user activity to the augmentation server . The request may contain information that uniquely identifies the activated keyword (e.g., an association ID), and\/or other information such as the activated keyword itself.","The method  determines  advertisements relevant to the activated keyword for the received request based on the keyword and\/or the associated reference data. In one embodiment, the augmentation server  extracts the keyword and\/or related context from the request, retrieves the associated reference data from the reference database , and determines  the relevant advertisements by searching in an advertisement database using the keyword and\/or requirements set forth in the associated reference data (e.g., advertisement category, context, fee requirements, etc.).","In one embodiment, the method  determines  the advertisements that match the best (e.g., matching the activated keyword and\/or satisfies the most number of reference requirements) as the relevant advertisements. In another embodiment, the method  determines  relevant advertisements based on a context of the augmented web page and\/or the activated keyword. For example, for a key phrase \u201cdigital camera\u201d in an article about digital camera, the method  may determines the following resources as relevant: a product review of a digital camera in CNET.com, a collection of user reviews at Buy.com, and a selection of similar digital cameras. The context can be determined when the activated keyword is identified in method .","In one embodiment, the method  determines a sequence for the related advertisements. The top advertisement in the sequence (also called the default advertisement or the primary advertisement) is the advertisement being displayed on the top layer of the layered augmentation. The lower ranked advertisements (also called secondary advertisements) are made available on lower layers of the layered augmentation. In one embodiment, the method  uses a bidding system to determine related advertisements sequence. For example, for a key phrase \u201cdigital camera,\u201d there may be multiple related advertisements (e.g., advertisements for different brands or models of digital cameras), each having a bid (or budget or cost) for the key phrase. The method  may determine a sequence of the advertisements based on their bids, the one with the highest bid ranked the highest and so on.","In another embodiment, the method  may determine the sequence of multiple advertisements based on factors other than bidding prices. For example, the method may consider factors such as relationships among the multiple advertisements (e.g., prioritizing video advertisements over text ones), prior user interactions with the advertisements (e.g., prioritizing advertisements with higher interacting rate), and contexts of the augmented keyword (e.g., prioritizing advertisements from retailers or service providers having branches near a geographical context of the keyword and\/or the augmented web page, or geographic locations of a substantial portion of viewers of the web page).","Further, specific sequences may be set for specific keywords and\/or parties (e.g., content providers, advertisers, users). For example, if the keyword(s) is a music artist (or band, album) name, the method  may make available his songs (e.g., playback through an embedded music player) on the top layer and other resources on lower layers. As another example, if the keyword(s) is a location name (e.g., Yellowstone National Park), the method  may make available the relevant map (e.g., MapQuest\u2122 Map) on the top layer. As noted above, the resources made available through the layered augmentation need not to be advertisements and can be related contents such as related articles, videos, images, music, to name only a few. For example, a content provider may specify that the layered augmentations in its web pages make available a set of links to its other relevant web pages (e.g., within the same website) where the keyword(s) being augmented is cross-indexed.","In one embodiment, viewers can set their preferences to determine a preferred sequence for the layered augmentation. For example, a viewer may prefer video advertisements while another may disfavor them (e.g., due to bandwidth constrains at receiving device). As a result, the method  may place video advertisements higher on a sequence for the first viewer, while not consider video advertisements for augmentation for the second viewer. Viewer preferences can be stored in a database such as the reference database  along with other viewer related data (e.g., profile data).","The method  transmits  the relevant advertisements to the client computer  for display. In one embodiment, the method  retrieves the advertisements from an advertisement database, and transmits  them to the client web browser (or the client computer) for display. Alternatively, the method  may transmit references of the advertisements (e.g., their URLs) to the client web browser for retrieval.","In one embodiment, the method  generates computer code (hereinafter called the advertisement code) to facilitate user interaction with the advertisements. Similar to the client code, the advertisement code can be in any computer language, such as JavaScript. The advertisement code may display the relevant advertisements in a multi-layered dialog box (or popup box) when the viewer moves a pointer over the activated keyword. The method  transmits the generated advertisement code along with the related advertisements to the client web browser. In one embodiment, the advertisement code is a part of the client code, and is integrated in the augmented web page when the page is generated","The client web browser displays  the relevant advertisements in a layered dialog box proximate to the activated keywords (or the position where the mouse-over is occurring) as an in-page overlay. In one embodiment, the client web browser utilizes the advertisement code to display the advertisements in a multi-layered dialog box. The advertisements are displayed according to their sequence. In one embodiment, only the top advertisement is displayed and the lower ranked advertisements are represented by selectable tabs. An example process of the operation of the advertisement code and the client code is described in detail below with respect to .","Referring now to , a flowchart illustrating an example process (or method)  of the client code and\/or the advertisement code. As illustrated, the method  determines whether a pointer is positioned over an augmented keyword (the activated keyword), and if so, sets  the primary advertisement as the active advertisement, and displays  the active advertisement in a multi-layered dialog box overlaying the augmented web page in a position proximate to the activated keyword or the mouse-over. The multi-layered dialog box also displays multiple selectable (e.g., clickable) tabs representing the lower layers. The viewer can select a tab to request the multi-layered dialog box to display the corresponding layer. If the user selected a tab, the method  sets  the advertisement corresponding to the selected layer as the active advertisement and displays  it in place of the previously displayed advertisement.","The viewer can also interact with the currently displayed advertisement by selecting the advertisement. If the viewer selects the advertisement, the method  responds  to the user selection based on the nature of the user selection and the configuration of the advertisement. For example, if the user clicks on the active advertisement, the method  redirects the web browser to a web page related to the active advertisement. Alternatively, if the user drags a scrollbar displayed on the dialog box, the method displays different portions of the active advertisement as the user drags along the scrollbar. In one embodiment, if the viewer moves the pointer away from the activated keyword and\/or the multi-layered dialog box for an extended period of time, the method  hides the dialog box.","Referring back to , in one embodiment, rather than displaying multiple advertisements, the method  displays multiple aspects (or portions) of the same advertisement in the multi-layered dialog box. For example, the multi-layered dialog box may display an image and brief description of a product, and present two tabs, one for user reviews and the other for playback of a television advertisement of the product. The viewer may interact with the advertisement through the multi-layered dialog box without having to navigate away from and otherwise leave the current web page the viewer is interacting with in the web browser. For example, if the advertisement contains video, the multi-layered dialog box may overlay the video with video controls (e.g., forward, rewind, play\/pause, volume, etc.). The multi-layered dialog box may also provide functional resources such as web searches, enabling viewers to conduct web searches and\/or review search results without leaving the augmented web page.","The method  tracks  the received requests, the advertisements displays, and\/or the user's interactions with the advertisements. These activities may be logged in a database (e.g., the reference database ) or reported to another device or person (e.g., via electronic mail).","The methods described above with respect to  are illustrated below in an example together with accompanying screenshots in . Initially, the augmentation server  retrieves a web page  for augmentation. The web page  may contain textual content of any subject.  shows an example of the web page  as displayed in Microsoft Internet Explorer\u2122 As shown in , the web page  is retrieved from website www.computing.net and contains a paragraph about computer virus.","The augmentation server  reads  the web page  for keywords. The augmentation server  identifies the keyword \u201csecurity\u201d  for layered augmentation. The augmentation server  locates  a piece of reference data matching the keyword \u201csecurity\u201d  and determines a context of computer security for the keyword . The piece of reference data includes an advertisement category for computer security services. The augmentation server  generates  an association of the keyword \u201csecurity\u201d  and the located piece of reference data.","The augmentation server  augments  the web page  by generating an intelligent tag encoding the generated association, and integrating the intelligent tag in an augmented web page . The augmentation server  also includes in the augmented web page  JavaScript code (client code) that captures user interactions with the augmented keyword .","A web browser running on a client computer  retrieves the augmented web page  and displays it to a user (e.g., responding to the user entering an URL of the web page  or  in the address bar of the web browser).  illustrates a screenshot of the augmented web page  as displayed on an Internet Explorer\u2122 web browser after it is retrieved by the browser. It is noted that in  the augmented keyword  is displayed in a double underline style to distinguish from conventional hyperlinks that are single underlined.","Subsequently, the user may move a pointer (e.g., controlled by a mouse, stylus, or touchpad) over the double underlined augmented keyword  (the activated augmented keyword). This user action is also referred to as a mouse-over. Detecting the mouse-over, the embedded JavaScript code (the client code) in the augmented web page  (or the web browser) generates an intelligent tag request that uniquely identifies the activated augmented keyword  and\/or the related context, and transmits the request to the augmentation server . The augmentation server  receives  the request, retrieves stored association of the keyword , and determines  relevant advertisements by searching for advertisements corresponding to the keyword  and\/or the related context in an advertising database. In the present example, the augmentation server  determines  that an advertisement for Cisco security center is the relevant advertisement associated with the augmented keyword .","The augmentation server  determines a sequence of various parts of the Cisco advertisement and\/or other relevant advertisements. In the present example, the augmentation server  determines that a description of the Cisco security center ranks top in the sequence, followed by its customer reviews, and a list of competing services.","The augmentation server  transmits  the related advertisement(s) back to the web browser for display. The augmentation server  also transmits JavaScript code (advertisement code) that enables layered representation of the transmitted advertisements.","The web browser (or the advertisement code) displays  the received advertisement(s) as an overlay in a multi-layered dialog box in proximity to the keyword  or the location where the mouse-over occurred. As illustrated in , the user has moved a mouse pointer over the keyword . As a result, the web browser receives advertisements related to the keyword \u201csecurity\u201d  and displays them in a multi-layered dialog box  proximate to the pointer.","As illustrated, the multi-layered dialog box  displays an advertisement about CISCO security center. On the bottom of the multi-layered dialog box  are two tabs labeled \u201cClick to view customer review\u201d and \u201cClick to view alternative services,\u201d respectively. Note that this is consistent with the sequence of the advertisements (and\/or advertisement portions) determined by the augmentation server . The user can navigate the advertisements within the multi-layered dialog box  by clicking the labeled tabs. The user can also visit the corresponding advertiser's web page by clicking the advertisement. While the user navigates within the multi-layered dialog box , the augmented web page  remains as the current web page displayed in the client web browser. The user can quickly resume browsing the rest of the augmented web page .","As illustrated in , when the user clicks (or mouse-over) the tab labeled \u201cClick to view customer review,\u201d the multi-layered dialog box  displays customer reviews for Cisco security center. It is noted that the label on the tab representing customer review changes to \u201cClick to hide customer review.\u201d The user can click the tab to resume viewing the previous advertisement for Cisco security center.","As illustrated in , when the user clicks the Cisco security center advertisement, the advertisement code redirects the client web browser to the advertiser's web page, in this case a web page related to Cisco security center.","C.

This contextual targeted may be performed by the ad server platform and performed in the background while the page is being loaded and browsed\/viewed by the user. The ad server platform receives page content from the client, such as via an agent. The ad server platform analyzes the page to match keywords to campaigns targeted to the web-site, page or URL. In some embodiments, the ad server platform finds all campaigns targeted to this site, finds all keywords in those campaigns and forms or generates a site keyword list for this site. The ad server platform may match the keywords from the site keyword list to keywords in the content from the page. The ad server platform may assign each matching keyword a relevancy weight.","Referring now to , an embodiment of assigning a relevancy weight to each keyword to provide contextual targeting is depicted. The ad server platform may provide a relevancy weight to each keyword of the site keyword list matching content of the web page. The ad server platform may use any type and form of metrics or combinations of metrics to determine a relevancy weight. In some embodiments, the ad server platform uses a location, frequency and\/or length metric to assign a relevancy weight to the matching keyword. The location relevancy weight may comprise an indicator or multiplier to those keywords that appear near the beginning or top of the web page relevant to those keywords that appear near the end of bottom of the web page. The frequency relevancy weight may comprise an indicator or multiplier to those keywords that appear more times on the same page or content than other keywords. The length relevancy weight may comprise an indicator or multiplier to those keywords that have more words in the keywords than single keyword or keywords with less words.","Each type of metric relevancy weight may be weighted the same or differently. Each metric relevancy weight may have it owns multiplier or factor that scales the weight for the keyword up or down according to the relevancy. The keyword may be up weighted and\/or down weighted one or more times by each of the metric relevancy weights. A keyword relevancy weight may be up weighted by one metric relevancy weight while downloaded by another relevancy weight. For example, a keyword may be repeated several times and be up weighted or have a high multiplier based on the frequency relevancy weight while only found and repeated near the end of the page for a down weighting or low multiplier from the location relevancy weight. In some embodiments, a keyword may get a low relevancy weighting from each of the metric relevancy weightings. In some embodiments, a keyword may get a high relevancy weighting from each of the metric relevancy weightings. In some embodiments, a keyword may get a combination of low and high relevancy weightings from different relevancy weightings.","Referring now to , an embodiment of applying behavioral targeting is depicted. The ad server platform may identify, track and store formation about a user's behavior in a behavioral profile. The behavioral profile may comprise a profile for one user or a plurality of users. Each of the user's profile data may be identified, tracked and managed via unique user identifiers. In some embodiments, the ad server platform may track a predetermined number of search terms, such as 5, that the user last searched. In some embodiments, the ad server platform may track a predetermined number of search terms for each search engine, such as the Google search engine, Microsoft Bing search engine, Yahoo search or Ask search engine.

In some embodiments, the ad server platform tracks and stores those search terms for which the user clicked a search result. In some embodiments, the ad server platform tracks and stores those search terms for which the user clicked a search result. In some embodiments, the ad server platform tracks and stores those search terms for which the user clicked a search result and landed on a web page of a predetermined content provider or publisher.","Referring to , a further embodiment of behavioral targeting is depicted. The ad server platform may track and store in the behavioral profile of a user a history of terms the user has seen over a predetermined time period. In some embodiments, the ad server platform tracks terms has a user has viewed on a web page. In some embodiments, the ad server platform tracks terms the user has selected from a search or interacted with during the user's viewing history. In some embodiments, the ad server platform tracks terms of one or more search results from which the user has clicked through. In some embodiments, the ad server platform tracks viewed terms over a predetermined time period. In some embodiments, the ad server platform tracks viewed terms over a start of a behavioral profile of the user to current time.","The ad server platform may use any of the search terms and\/or viewed terms from the behavioral profile to make a change to the relevancy weightings of the matching keywords. Those matching keywords that the use has searched or viewed previously will have their relevancy weightings increased or up weighted via a behavioral targeting multiplier. In some embodiments, the ad server platform may use a combination of recently searched and viewed terms to apply a multiplier to each matching keyword. The ad server platform may use any temporal threshold to determine which search terms and\/or viewed terms to use for determining a multiplier to the relevancy weightings of the matching keywords. The ad platform may apply higher behavioral targeting multipliers to those keywords that were recently viewed and\/or recently search within a predetermined time history. The ad platform may apply no or lower behavioral targeting multipliers to those keywords that were not recently viewed and\/or not recently search within the predetermined time history.","As a result of using behavioral profile data and behavioral targeting multipliers, as depicted in , the ad server platform modifies the relevancy of the matching keywords from the site keyword list. The matching keywords are assigned a first relevancy weighting from the contextual targeting and are modified or changed to a second relevancy weighting from the behavioral targeting. In some embodiments, the ad server platform maintains both the contextual targeting relevancy weightings and the behavioral targeting relevancy weighting for each matching keyword. In some embodiments, the ad server platform maintains a single relevancy weighting keyword comprising the behavioral targeting multipliers (up weighting or down weighting) to the relevancy weighting applied by the contextual targeting.","Referring to , an embodiment of campaign selection is depicted. In some embodiments, the results of contextual and\/or behavioral targeting are used as input to the campaign selection engine. The ad server platform may use the relevancy weightings of the matching keywords from the site keyword list to determine which campaigns may be applicable to these matching keywords. Those campaigns not having keywords corresponding to any of the matching keywords may be dropped from consideration. In some embodiments, those campaigns not having a number of keywords corresponding to the matching keywords within a predetermined threshold may be dropped from consideration. In some embodiments, those campaigns having one or more keywords corresponding to a predetermined number of the top relevancy weighted keywords may be identified for consideration.","The ad server platform may order the list of campaigns under consideration using any type and form of algorithm. For example, the ad server platform may rank the campaigns based on having matching keywords with the highest combined relevancy weightings. the ad server platform may rank the campaigns based on having the highest number of matching keywords. The ad server platform may rank the campaigns based on a combination of the highest combined relevancy weightings and the highest number of matching keywords.

Based on the selected campaign, the contextualization service may send a advertisement or campaign information for the advertisement to the agent for display inline with the content being viewed on the mobile device, such as an inline banner at the next natural break in the content. Instead of having an advertisement predetermined or fixed for the currently viewed content prior to the display of the page, the present solution dynamically contextualizes the portions of the page at the point of or displaying those portions of the page on the mobile device and the contextualization is based on the content of the portions of page being loaded\/displayed on the mobile device.","The advertisement(s) for the mobile content may be contextualized to provide advertisement(s) regarding products and\/of services of an advertiser or publisher associated with a subject or context of that portion of the content being viewed via the mobile device or content surrounding the portion of the page being viewed on a mobile device. The contextualization may be focused or limited to the content of a page currently in view on the mobile device. The advertisement may be designed and constructed to leverage the existing space or real estate on the page, such as an inline advertisement that fits within a natural break on the page, such as between paragraphs on the page. For example, one form of advertisement may be a inline banner about the width of a paragraph displayed after a paragraph identifying one or more keywords for contextualization. Such a banner may allow a viewer to see most or all of the content (e.g. paragraphs) while being able to see and\/or interact with the advertisement.","The inline mobile advertisement provides content providers and publishers an opportunity to generate advertisement and revenue opportunities from within existing site\/page real estate and inventory and furthermore, at the point of viewing related content on the mobile device. With limited viewing windows and capabilities on a mobile device, a user or viewer of the mobile device may quickly scroll through or scroll by portions of a page, may skip over portions of a page and may therefore only view or interface for any meaningful time period certain content of the page. Embodiments of the present solution dynamically and selectively provide augmented content and\/or advertisements to those portions of the contents currently being viewed on the mobile device. Therefore, instead of providing augmented content or advertisement for those pages not being viewed or being scrolled by or skipped, the present solution provides advertisements and\/or augmented content contextualized to those portions of the content the user is viewing or engaging via a mobile device.","The advertisement and\/or augmented content may be inserted, placed or displayed within the existing content being viewed or to be viewed. The advertisement and\/or augmented content may be inserted, placed or displayed within natural breaks within the content. For example, the user may currently be viewing a paragraph of a plurality of paragraphs of content. Embodiments of the present solution contextualize this paragraph and display an advertisement in the white space or break already existing between this paragraph and the next paragraph. Such an advertisement therefore may not take up more page real estate but fits within existing white space or breaks on the page and at or near the point of viewing by the user. Embodiments of the present solution may create and\/or insert space or breaks into the viewed content to insert or place an advertisement and\/or augmented content. The mobile inline advertisement may be used to deliver advertisement campaigns in addition to other advertisement campaigns that may be operating on or using other real estate or portions of the web-site viewed via the mobile device. For example, the present solution may deliver both in line mobile advertising and image advertising for the same advertiser or for different advertisers on the same page.","Referring now to , an embodiment of an inline mobile advertisement is depicted.
