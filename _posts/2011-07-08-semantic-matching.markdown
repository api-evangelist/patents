{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD","BACKGROUND","BRIEF SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["One or more implementations relate generally to semantic matching in a computing environment.","The subject matter discussed in the background section should not be assumed to be prior art merely as a result of its mention in the background section. Similarly, a problem mentioned in the background section or associated with the subject matter of the background section should not be assumed to have been previously recognized in the prior art. The subject matter in the background section merely represents different approaches, which in and of themselves may also be inventions.","Accurate retrieval of semantically similar objects has become increasingly more complex due to the sheer number of semantically described objects necessary for comparison with a particular object in order to find semantically similar objects and the numerous approaches to defining the objects. Additionally, there are a variety of possible formats for the descriptions of objects and organizational models to reference from providers of the objects which adds to the complexity. The complexity increases as the number of objects and the number of different organizational models for the objects grows.","For example, it has become difficult for a reseller to retrieve semantically similar objects when similar objects are described differently by each provider, and each provider may have completely different organizational model for grouping of the objects. Continuing with the example, a reseller may need to return results for a search query with an object described as \u201cplasma tv\u201d and an object of \u201ctv\u201d with the attribute of \u201cplasma\u201d and the information for the objects could be modeled in two entirely different organizational structures.","The retrieval of accurate information and subsequent delivery of semantically similar objects to the user system has been and continues to be a goal of search and\/or knowledge management systems in a computing environment. The ability to scale well in light of the number of objects and comparisons necessary has been and continues to be a goal for approaches to retrieval of semantically similar objects. Accordingly, it is desirable to provide techniques to improve the accuracy of semantic matching methods that scales well in a computing environment.","In accordance with embodiments, there are provided mechanisms, systems, computer readable mediums, computer program products, and methods for semantic matching.","In an embodiment and by way of example, a method, system, and computer-readable medium for semantic matching are provided. In a method, system, and computer-readable medium having instructions for semantic matching, a configuration for one or more ontologies is determined with an ontology that has one or more concepts and a representation for the one or more concepts, and the configuration has an assignment of concepts to positions and one or more relationships between concepts in accordance with the representation. The configuration is optimized in accordance with one or more constraints, and a constraint has a relationship defined in a representation for an ontology and a judgment on a similarity of a plurality of concepts from the one or more ontologies, and an estimate is calculated for a similarity between a first concept and a second concept using the configuration.","Any of the above embodiments may be used alone or together with one another in any combination. The one or more implementations encompassed within this specification may also include embodiments that are only partially mentioned or alluded to or are not mentioned or alluded to at all in this brief summary or in the abstract. Although various embodiments may have been motivated by various deficiencies with the prior art, which may be discussed or alluded to in one or more places in the specification, the embodiments do not necessarily address any of these deficiencies. In other words, different embodiments may address different deficiencies that may be discussed in the specification. Some embodiments may only partially address some deficiencies or just one deficiency that may be discussed in the specification, and some embodiments may not address any of these deficiencies.","General Overview","Systems, mechanisms, computer readable mediums, computer program products, and methods are provided for semantic matching. Semantic matching may be performed to identify information, objects, concepts, or any other data that is semantically related, refers to the same underlying concept, and\/or similar. A semantic matching request may be received and any number of semantically similar concepts may be identified in response to the request. For example, a \u201ccar\u201d may be semantically similar to an \u201cautomobile.\u201d In another example, a \u201ctoaster oven with at least 1000 W power\u201d may be a semantically similar concept to \u201cBrandX Toast-R-Oven 4-Slice Toaster Oven\u201d and \u201cBrandY Convection Toaster Oven.\u201d","In one or more embodiments, a global ontology may be created to serve as a reference in handling requests for determining whether concepts and\/or objects are semantically similar. For example, a query may be received with a request to determine whether a first concept is similar to a second concept and the global ontology may be used as a reference to determine the similarity between the concepts. The global ontology may be computed from and\/or represented with a configuration. The configuration may be created from data or information from one or more ontologies and serve as a representation for the one or more ontologies. The configuration may represent the ontologies with a set of positions for the one or more concepts from the one or more ontologies in a metric space.","In an embodiment, a potential momentum and\/or potential energy may be associated with each concept in the configuration. The potential energy function may be determined from the set of concepts, the set of ontological relations between concepts (e.g. subclass, disjoint, or any other type of relation), and\/or the similarity judgments. Data or information may be received on at least a portion of one or more ontologies (e.g. a concept or a schema) and the configuration for the global ontology may be created or updated with the received information.","The data associated with the configuration, set of positions in a metric space, and\/or set of locations in a metric space may be distributed over one or more computer systems, such that the global ontology may consist of many configurations or portions of configurations that are instantiated on one or more computer systems. A programming construct of a class (e.g. instantiated as a programming construct of an object) may be instantiated for each concept in the configuration, such as in a tree or graph data structure in an implementation. Metadata for the set of positions of the configuration may be contained on one or more computer systems and a data structure for a configuration or portion of a configuration may be instantiated as needed. Embodiments may use the metadata for the configuration to determine semantically similar concepts without implementing a data structure for the configuration.","An ontology may be any representation or description that defines one or more individual concepts, one or more classes of concepts, and\/or any number of relations among the concepts. The ontology may provide a hierarchy, a schema, a structure, or any other representation that defines the relationships between the one or more concepts. The term \u201chierarchy\u201d may be any representation that defines the relationships between the one or more concepts, and the terms \u201chierarchy\u201d and \u201crepresentation\u201d may be used herein interchangeably throughout.","A concept is a cognitive unit of meaning, such as an abstract idea or unit of knowledge, built from other units (e.g. data) which act as a concept's characteristics. The concept may be a class of concepts, an individual concept, a node, an object, and\/or any other type of entity. A class of concepts may be a set of one or more individual concepts. Concepts may be created to represent any data, idea, object, and\/or domain. For example, concepts may be created for commercial transactions, bartering, products, services, or any other data. Concepts may have associated attributes, various features, and restrictions.","An ontology may have a set of instances of classes (e.g. groups of individual concepts) that may serve as a knowledge base. For example, an instance of a class of wines (e.g. red wine) in an ontology may represent a group of all red wines, and a specific wine (e.g. a glass of Bordeaux) may be an instance of an individual concept. A class of concepts may itself be a concept that serves as a description for a group of individual concepts in a domain. As such, the terms \u201cclass\u201d and \u201cconcept\u201d may be used interchangeably throughout.","The global ontology may be a configuration that satisfies one or more ontological hierarchies and\/or ontological structures (e.g. one or more ontologies). The ontological hierarchies or ontological structures may express the relationships between the concepts and map the relationships between the one or more concepts. Metadata on the concepts from the one or more ontologies and the assignment of concepts to positions in metric space may be stored for creation of the configuration. In an embodiment, the global ontology may be viewed as consisting of one or more objects or instances of the concepts described in a schema for an ontology.","In one or more embodiments, relationships between concepts in the configuration may be formed based upon one or more judgments on the similarity of concepts within the global ontology. The terms \u201cjudgment on a similarity\u201d and \u201csimilarity judgment\u201d may be used interchangeably throughout. An initial assignment of the concepts to positions in metric space may position the concepts in space to reflect the anticipated similarity between the concepts and\/or a hierarchy. The relationships based upon the hierarchies and similarity judgments may be noisy, inconsistent, and\/or not verified for accuracy. Optimization may be performed to adjust the configuration of the concepts in accordance with one or more constraints provided by the hierarchy of the ontologies and the given similarity judgments.","It may be desirable to view a global ontology for solving a semantic matching problem as respecting some of the same principles found in nature that are used for solving a molecular dynamics problem. As such, it may be desirable to view handling those same principles with methods and\/or a mapping of a semantic matching problem to a conceptual framework as an application of how the principles are handled with a framework that is used in solving a molecular dynamics problem. In an embodiment, the use of a global ontology may be viewed as a mapping of a semantic matching problem to an energy minimization molecular dynamics problem and\/or an application of aspects of handling an energy minimization molecular to a semantics matching problem. However, those with skill in the art will recognize that a molecular dynamics problem is the modeling of a physical protein whereas the use of a global ontology is a symbolic model for concepts.","By way of example, in a molecular dynamics problem, a set of positions of atoms in metric space for a protein may be initially provided and the positions may be altered to minimize the energy between the atoms of the protein. In nature, force is inversely proportional to distance, such that atoms nearby only need to be considered during analysis and atoms that are far away may be largely ignored. Molecular dynamics energy minimization problems involve solving large numbers of partial differential equations simultaneously or in parallel on one or more computer systems to analyze atoms of proteins. To solve a molecular dynamics problem, a group of atoms may be assigned to a particular machine for analysis based on the group's proximity to a particular atom or particular atoms. This grouping of atoms for minimization on computer systems allows for simultaneous processing for minimization of the energy for the protein.","In an embodiment of solving a semantic matching problem, the concepts nearby particular concepts may be weighted more heavily during optimization than those positioned relatively farther away in observance of the same principle found in nature. Continuing with the embodiment, the concepts close in proximity to each other may be assigned to the same computer systems for optimization and\/or computation of area for concepts. Concepts located relatively close to concepts may be weighted more heavily than the concepts that are relatively far apart, during optimization. Those with skill in the art will recognize that atoms have set and have defined properties (e.g. hydrogen is attracted to oxygen) that are fixed and will not change over time and\/or are not noisy (e.g. inconsistent). In an embodiment of semantic matching, concepts that are consistently found to be similar and\/or found in ontological hierarchies may be grouped together on one or more computer systems for optimization of the configuration.","In another example, the distance between two atoms in a molecular dynamics problem that are highly attracted to each other and are located in the immediate area may be reduced to minimize the potential energy for the protein. In one or more embodiments, the interactions between concepts in a configuration of the global ontology are analyzed to reduce the \u201cenergy\u201d caused by the positioning of concepts in the configuration. For a pair of concepts, it may be desirable to view the energy as \u201chigh\u201d in semantic matching if two similar concepts are positioned relatively far from each other in the configuration, and the configuration may be optimized to reduce the \u201cenergy\u201d created by keeping two highly similar concepts separated.","Next, systems, mechanisms, computer readable mediums, computer program products, and methods are provided for semantic matching that will be described with reference to example embodiments.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"100"},"The ontology may have a structure or a representation that indicates any sort of relationship between concepts, such as, but not limited to, a hierarchy that may indicate a parent-child relationship, a sibling relationship, subclass-superclass relationship, and\/or provide any other relationship between concepts. In an embodiment, the ontology may represent a particular domain or subject matter and provide information on a set of concepts within that domain. For example, the ontology may have concepts that represent all of the products from a particular company or supplier.","Information may be received on the one or more ontologies and a configuration for the concepts in the one or more ontologies may be determined. Information received (e.g. an OWL graph or other schema) may be provided in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to use of a computer program, a user interface, and\/or entity extraction from natural language.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 1B","FIG. 1B","FIG. 1B"],"b":["106","108","106","110","112","114","106"]},"The configuration may define an assignment of positions for one or more concepts in a metric space and one or more relationships between the concepts. The configuration may be the assignment of positions to concepts, such as the assignment to individual concepts and the assignment to classes of concepts. Continuing with the example, in , \u201cBook\u201d concept  would be mapped with all of the relationships to concepts: \u201c1989\u201d , \u201cThe Book Title\u201d , and \u201cJohn Doe\u201d . In an embodiment, the initial set of positions for the concepts in metric space may be an assignment of position for the concepts in metric space such that their distance reflects the initial expectation of similarity and\/or hierarchy. In another embodiment, an assignment of a position may be stored for the concept in metadata and the concept does not have to be instantiated in a configuration in space to become part of the configuration. In yet another embodiment, one or more of the concepts may be arbitrarily assigned positions in a metric space.","In an embodiment, the concept itself may represent a relationship between concepts. The concept may have properties that describe or define the concept and\/or the concept may have relationships with one or more concepts in accordance with the hierarchy. For example, the concept \u201ctelevision\u201d may have a property of size \u201csmall\u201d and relationships with the concept \u201cplasma\u201d and the concept \u201cbrandX.\u201d","Metadata on the configuration (e.g. assignment of positions of the concepts) and the concepts may be stored in a database. A database is any collection of data, including, but not limited to a relational database, an object-oriented database, or a file system. In an embodiment, the metadata on a particular set of positions may be retrieved to create redundant configurations and\/or portions of the global ontology on one or more computer systems.","In an embodiment, information or data received on the one or more ontologies may be in different formats and\/or different schema formats. The information on the ontologies may be converted into a single format for semantic matching. For example, an ontology may be received in OWL-Lite and converted to a RDF-Schema format.","The configuration may represent a portion of a global ontology that may be referenced to handle requests on the similarity between two concepts. The configuration may be distributed and\/or subdivided, such that portions of the configuration are instantiated on one or more computer systems. In an embodiment, the configuration may be viewed as instantiations of the individual concepts from one or more ontologies, and the position in metric space assigned to the concept may reflect the relative similarity to other surrounding concepts. For example, a child concept of a concept may be positioned relatively close to the parent concept. In another example, a concept known to be dissimilar to another concept may be positioned relatively far away from the dissimilar concept in the configuration.","Continuing with , the configuration may be optimized in accordance with one or more constraints (). A constraint may be a hierarchy provided for an ontology and\/or a judgment on a similarity of a plurality of concepts from the one or more ontologies.","The judgment on the similarity of the plurality of concepts from the one or more ontologies may be obtained from methods including, but not limited to, crowdsourcing, mining data, recording a behavioral judgment, using a histogram, using a heuristic, or any other method for decision making on the similarity between two or more concepts. In an embodiment, the judgment on the similarity of the plurality of concepts may be machine generated and human generated. The similarity judgments may be created offline in a batch mode and\/or continuously provided throughout execution of semantic matching processes.","A behavioral judgment is a judgment made by a person on whether two concepts are similar. For example, a person may be requested to provide a similarity judgment on two concepts. Crowdsourcing is the outsourcing of a task to a number of persons. In another example, the task of creating similarity judgments may be outsourced to a group of persons to select whether two concepts are similar, such as a group of randomly selected persons. In another embodiment, a user may be queried on whether the results from a semantic match query were accurate and the user's decision on the accuracy may serve as a similarity judgment.","Data mining is the process of extracting patterns from large data sets. In an embodiment, similarity judgments for one or more concepts may be discovered by crawling the Internet and mining the data found to determine pairs of concepts found on website(s), webpage(s), reference websites (e.g. Wikipedia), webpage links found on webpages, and\/or webpages linked to a particular webpage may be determined to be similar.","In an embodiment, a degree of certainty that the similarity judgment is accurate may be associated with the similarity judgment. The degree of certainty that a similarity judgment mined from the Internet may be trusted and\/or deemed accurate may be based upon the location that the concepts are found on the Internet. For example, if a first concept is found on a webpage linked to a webpage that a second concept is found, then the degree of certainty that the concepts are similar may be less than if the two concepts were found on the same page.","In another embodiment, a reference website or trusted website may be mined to determine similarity judgments and\/or to add to the degree of certainty that the similarity judgment is accurate. For example, if a trusted website had two concepts on a webpage and the two concepts are also found on two linked webpages, then the degree of certainty that the similarity judgment may be higher. In an embodiment, the dissimilarity between the two concepts may be recorded as a similarity judgment.","In one or more embodiments, the configuration may be optimized by analyzing the constraints for a plurality or a pair of concepts. As indicated above, it may be desirable to view optimization as finding a stable configuration with a potential function. The optimization may involve solving a set of partial differential equations or performing a simulation. In an embodiment, a Monte Carlo simulation may be used. In a Monte Carlo simulation, every possibility may be considered from a set of possible inputs and the best is chosen. For example, satisfying every possible combination of the one or more constraints may be considered for positioning of the concepts with a Monte Carlo simulation and the best set of positions in accordance with the constraints may be selected. The assignment of positions in the configuration may be adjusted in accordance with the constraints on the pair of concepts. The configuration may be adjusted to minimize any number of conflicts with satisfying the one or more constraints for each pair of concepts during optimization. For example, the position of a concept from the pair may be adjusted in accordance with the majority of constraints (e.g. similarity judgments) and\/or one or more trusted constraints.","In an embodiment, a potential energy function may be used to model a large number of constraints and\/or the stability of the configuration with the assignment of positions in space. The potential energy function for the configuration represents the energy stored in a system due to the assignment of positions of the concepts in the configuration. The addition of a new concept, a constraint, and\/or similarity judgment may change the potential energy of the configuration. The analysis of a concept, constraint and\/or similarity judgment not considered in the initial set of positions for the configuration may cause instability in the configuration and change the potential energy of the configuration.","The optimization for semantic matching may be viewed as minimizing the potential energy of the system. For example, concepts that are likely to be similar may be thought of as highly attracted to each other and may be positioned closer in order to \u201cminimize the energy\u201d of the configuration. It may be desirable to view optimization\/minimization as reaching an equilibrium found when the set of concepts reaches a low energy state.","In one or more embodiments, the optimization of the configuration may be spatially subdivided and processed on one or more computer systems. Spatial subdivision is the division of the metric space into regions and the processing of the data within each of the regions. The spatial subdivision may be used to divide the metric space of the configuration and each subdivision may be optimized.","Spatial subdivision methods may include, but are not limited to, uniformly subdividing the configuration to regions, quad-tree spatial, or any other method for spatial subdivision. The use of spatial subdivision may allow for increased speed in discovery of neighbors. In a preferred embodiment, the discovery of neighbors may be from O(n) to O(1).","In an embodiment, the subdivisions are non-overlapping regions of the metric space for the configuration. In another embodiment, the subdivisions may be overlapping. For example, the subdividing may be performed such that there is sufficient redundancy for the failure of one or more computer systems. Continuing with the example, a threshold may be provided for when to fork off a new process on another computer system to instantiate, store, optimize, and\/or analyze data for at least a portion of an ontology. The metric space may be subdivided and then optimization process for each subdivision may be assigned to a computer system within a cluster of computer systems. A cluster is a group of loosely coupled computers that work together closely.","In a preferred embodiment, the use of spatial subdivision and the grouping of concepts that are positioned relatively near each other in subdivisions for performing semantic matching on one or more computer systems may allow for scaling on computer systems with minimal space and intercommunication requirements. Continuing with the preferred embodiment, for an input size of n, the computation average is O(log n) or O(n log n). In an embodiment, general purpose computers with may be configured to be a particular computer for semantic matching including, but not limited, any of the following: lossy interconnects or network connections, memory, and\/or small hard discs. In another embodiment, semantic matching may be performed with any number of servers. Semantic matching may be offered as software as a service in the \u201ccloud\u201d in an embodiment.","An estimate may be calculated for a similarity between a first concept and a second concept using the configuration (). The area for the regions of the first and second concept may be computed and a similarity estimate for the first and second concepts may be calculated. Spatial subdivision may be used to divide the configuration and compute the regions for the area of the concepts.","In an embodiment, an estimate for the similarity is calculated, as follows:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":"similarity","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":"C","mn":"1"},{"mi":"C","mn":"2"}],"mo":","}}},"mo":"=","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mi":"area","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":"C","mn":"1"},{"mi":"C","mn":"2"}],"mo":"\u22c2"}}},{"mi":"area","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":"C","mn":"1"},{"mi":"C","mn":"2"}],"mo":"\u22c3"}}}]}}}}},"where Cis the first concept, and Cis the second concept.

In such cases, globules have some volume, so any two concepts within that volume may have varying distances, which means that globules will have a maximum volume, or number of contained concepts. If dimensionality is too low, then for a given number of concepts, the average distance in the globule may be large enough that the average potential is still relatively high (e.g. the concepts cannot get close enough to be stable). In an n-dimensional metric space, a point is defined by n numbers. So, in a two dimensional space, a point is defined by two numbers (interpreted, for example, in a Euclidean space as multiplicative factors on each if there are a set of basis vectors) If there are many concepts then the only way to get stable configurations may be to increase dimensionality. In some embodiments, the ability to change the dimensionality may increase the ability to find stable, low-energy configurations, thereby helping find configurations that accurately estimate a solution to the given set of constraints.","Versioning of Ontologies","In an embodiment, differences between different versions of an ontology may be determined and\/or displayed or highlighted. If provided with at least two ontologies that represent different versions of the same ontology, such that each ontology is describing the same concepts and uses the same names for the (intended) same concepts, semantic matching may be used to display differences between the versions of the ontologies. Using semantic matching, a similarity estimator may be built for combining a plurality of ontologies and displaying the most-similar and most-different concepts in the different versions. This provides a way of highlighting changes between versions of a large ontology without having to browse through a large number of concepts.","Quality Assurance","Pairwise similarity estimation can be used to discover empty concepts (concepts with an empty extension) by computing the similarity between the given concept, C, and the concept Empty where Empty is a concept with no members. In an embodiment, this could get mapped into a configuration in which no atoms are labelled Empty.","Search","With a target concept, semantic matching can be used to determine a sequence of concepts ordered by decreasing similarity to the target concept. In an embodiment, search can be performed using (a) pair-wise similarity of concepts; and (b) an index that maps concepts to members thereof by using pairwise similarity to query the index and find a collection of concepts that are similar to the target concept.","System Overview",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0131","num":"0135"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["1000","1000","1000"]},"Computer systems  may communicate with other computer systems\/devices using any number of Communication Interface(s) .
