The Government has certain rights in the invention.","The resonator fiber optic gyroscope (RFOG) has the potential of meeting the needs of many navigation and rotation sensing markets and creating new markets because of its capability of high performance in a small size, at low power and low cost.  illustrates a conventional RFOG  consisting of a clockwise (CW) laser , a counter-clockwise (CCW) laser , a fiber optic resonator  and electronic circuits (\u201celectronics\u201d) providing at least resonator-coupling and resonance-tracking (or resonance-detection) functionality. The CW laser  inputs light into the resonator  and a CW photodetector  detects the CW output of the resonator.","The electronics downstream of the CW photodetector , which include a CW modulation generator , a CW demodulator , a CW accumulator , and a summing element , control the CW laser frequency to a resonance frequency of the resonator . The resonance frequency is detected by modulating the laser frequency at fusing the CW modulation generator  and then demodulating the output of the CW photodetector  at fusing the CW demodulator . At the resonance frequency, the CW photodetector  signal at fpasses through zero amplitude. The CW accumulator  controls the laser frequency via the CW laser driver  to the resonance frequency by adjusting the laser frequency until the output of the CW demodulator  is zero. The modulation at fis electronically summed with the CW integrator  output by the summing element . With regard to the similarly configured CCW path of the RFOG , the CCW laser  is controlled to the CCW resonance frequency in a similar manner, except it is common that the modulation frequency fis different than fto eliminate errors that arise when light from one direction of propagation in the resonator  inadvertently couples into the other direction.","In order to achieve high performance, the RFOG electronics must be capable of digitizing and detecting a very small signal from the resonator  and at specific frequency in the presence of a very large unwanted (e.g., harmonic) signal. The required resolution cannot be obtained with conventional analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) alone, and therefore some type of filter, to remove the unwanted signal to allow additional gain of the rotation signal so that conventional ADCs can be used, would be desirable. Ideally, such a filter removes the unwanted signal without removing noise that is required for ADC bit interpolation.","In an embodiment, a resonator fiber optic gyroscope includes a first light source configured to generate a light signal. A resonator element is configured to generate an optical signal based on the light signal. A photodetector is configured to generate a first electrical signal based on the optical signal. The first electrical signal includes an oscillating signal, a direct-current (DC) signal, an even-harmonic signal including components at even harmonics of the oscillating signal, and an odd-harmonic signal including components at odd harmonics of the oscillating signal. A filtering element is configured to attenuate the DC signal, at least one even-harmonic component, and an odd-harmonic component to produce a second electrical signal. An amplifier is configured to amplify the second electrical signal. An analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is configured to digitize the amplified second electrical signal.","An embodiment provides an optimum accommodation of signal rejection and passing noise for ADC bit interpolation by splitting a gyro signal into two paths, applying a filter in a first path that is optimized for unwanted signal rejection and a filter in a second path that is optimized for passing only noise necessary for good ADC bit interpolation, then recombining the two paths before ADC processing.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 4","FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","200"]},"For an ideal resonator, the difference in the CW and CCW resonance frequencies is proportional to rotation rate of the RFOG. To achieve full performance potential, the resonance frequencies must be determined with high precision. The RFOG employs a modulation\/demodulation technique, employing, for example, the generator  and demodulator , to determine the resonance frequencies.","To provide a signal that is indicative of a deviation from the resonance frequency, the frequency of the CW and CCW lasers ,  are modulated. The frequency modulation sweeps the laser frequency relative to the resonance frequency. The resulting output of the resonator CW and CCW preamps (photodetectors ,  that convert resonator output light intensity to an electrical signal) depends on where the average laser frequency lies relative to the resonance frequency. If the average laser frequency deviates from the resonance frequency, then a signal at the modulation frequency is present. The sign or phase of the signal depends on which direction the average laser frequency deviates from the resonance frequency. When the average laser frequency is exactly on resonance, then the amplitude of the signal at the modulation frequency, and odd harmonics thereof, is zero. Therefore the resonance frequency is detected by detecting a null of the signal at the modulation frequency.","A synchronous demodulator is typically used to detect the resonator output signal at the modulation frequency. Synchronous demodulation provides significant rejection of other signals and noise that does not occur at the modulation frequency. A synchronous demodulator is also sensitive to the phase of the demodulator input signal and thus provides an output that has a sign that indicates the direction that the average laser frequency deviates from the resonance frequency. Synchronous demodulation can be performed by an analog mixer; however this may result in large sensing errors due to imperfections of the analog mixer. For example, even if there is no signal at the modulation frequency going into the analog mixer, the output of the mixer may have some offset due to imperfections. The offset will translate to a gyro rate bias error. Significant performance improvements can be realized by using a digital demodulator, which does not have offset errors like the analog mixer.","To employ a digital demodulator the resonator signal from the preamp must be digitized by an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) . Typically an anti-aliasing (AA) filter  is placed in-front of the ADC to reduce the effects of signal and noise aliasing, which is accomplished by providing signal attenuation at and above the ADC sample frequency.","A servo may be used to maintain the average laser frequency at the resonator resonance frequency. The servo controls the laser frequency to the resonance frequency such that the demodulator output is held at zero. A servo can consist of an analog integrator, but like the analog demodulator, an analog mixer has imperfections that can lead to rotation sensing errors. An example is an effective integrator input voltage offset, which will cause the integrator to move the average laser frequency slightly off resonance to generate a demodulator output that cancels out the integrator input offset. To improve gyro performance, a digital approximation of an integrator (e.g., accumulator ) can be employed. The output of the accumulator  can be converted back to analog by a digital-to-analog converter (DAC)  before being sent to the laser frequency control circuit . The DAC  output may also be summed with the modulation generator  output, which provides modulation of the laser frequency.","Digitizing the preamp signal may introduce quantization noise associated with the ADC . The ADC quantization noise will result in higher angle random walk (ARW), which is a key performance parameter of the gyro. The impact that ADC quantization noise has on ARW depends on the signal gain before the ADC . A higher signal gain reduces the impact on ARW. With enough signal gain, the quantization noise impact on ARW can be made insignificant. However, without changes to the configuration of the RFOG shown in , the amount of signal gain is limited by the direct-current (DC) preamp  output due to the time-average light intensity at the resonator  output, and the even harmonic signal that results from modulating over the resonance peak. Typically, to reduce quantization noise impact on ARW to required levels, an additional 20 dB to 30 dB of signal gain may be required over the limit imposed by DC preamp output due to the average light intensity and the even harmonic signal. Thus, it is desirable to reduce the DC and even-harmonic signals to allow additional gain before signal processing by the ADC .","Table 1 shows results from a calculation of the ratio of specific even harmonic amplitude to the second harmonic amplitude of the even harmonic signal.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"133pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},"TABLE 1"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Harmonic #","Ratio with SH (dB)"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"133pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"2","0.0"]},{"entry":[{},"4","\u221215.5"]},{"entry":[{},"6","\u221231.1"]},{"entry":[{},"8","\u221246.6"]},{"entry":[{},"10","\u221262.2"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"Without additional filtering of the signal, the 2nd harmonic component of the even harmonic signal dominates and is what limits the additional gain. To obtain an additional gain of 30 dB, the even harmonic signal amplitude should be reduced by approximately 30 dB. The table shows that if only the 2nd harmonic is eliminated (such as using a notch filter with a notch frequency at the 2nd harmonic frequency, as discussed in greater detail below herein), then the 4th harmonic will limit the additional gain to about 15 dB. To obtain an additional gain of 30 dB, the Table 1 shows that at least the 2nd and 4th harmonics must be removed. Since the 6th harmonic is \u221231 dB down from the second, there is little design margin if 30 dB of additional gain is required; therefore, even rejection of the 6th harmonic is desirable.","Setting the cutoff frequency of the AA filter  with an appropriate roll-off just above the modulation frequency can achieve the desired rejection of the even harmonic signals. However, by doing so, another important criteria associated with the ADC may not be met; to meet performance requirements the required detection level of the resonator output signal at the modulation frequency is typically much less than the bit resolution of available ADCs. For an ideal case, if the average resonator signal is between two adjacent bits of the ADC, then a non-zero resonator signal will not be detected until its amplitude is large enough to be detected by either bit. This can lead to a deadband in the gyro rotation-sensing transfer function, or additional rotation sensing noise.","To overcome the resolution limitation of ADCs, a method known as noise dithering and over-sampling may be employed. With sufficient noise amplitude, adjacent ADC bits are always toggled even if the signal is in-between bits. The bit toggling provides a signal at the ADC  output that has an average duty cycle depending on the amplitude of the signal that lies between bits. The signal can be digitally reconstructed by averaging the ADC  output. To accurately reconstruct the signal with averaging, the ADC sample frequency must be greater than the frequency of the averaged samples, which in turn must be greater than the frequency of the signal to be reconstructed. Typically, in fiber optic gyros, the, ADC sampling frequency is at least 100 times greater than the signal frequency. It has been shown in the literature that to obtain accurate reconstruction of the ADC input signal, the total root mean square (RMS) amplitude of the ADC input noise should be at least \u2153 of the least significant bit (LSB) of the ADC. If the RMS noise amplitude is less than \u2153 LSB, then the noise dithering may not eliminate deadband in the gyro rotation sensing transfer function, or additional rotation sensing noise due to finite ADC resolution.","In practice, the resonator  signal has some wide-band noise due to many noise sources, such as photon shot noise. The wide-band noise can be used to provide a dither signal to the ADC . To provide enough noise at the ADC  to meet the \u2153 LSB criteria, the noise bandwidth from the preamp  to the ADC  may be approximately 1 MHz. A typical modulation frequency for an RFOG ranges from 20 kHz to about 200 kHz. If the cut-off frequency of the AA filter  is set to just above the modulation frequency, then the AA filter will limit the noise bandwidth to much less than required, and therefore there will not be enough noise at the ADC  input for bit interpolation. Thus, it is desirable to reject at least the 2nd, 4th and 6th harmonics of the even harmonic signal while providing enough noise amplitude at the ADC input.","Referring to , an embodiment includes respective filtering elements ,  and amplifiers ,  employed in the CW and CCW paths of the RFOG . In an embodiment, the filtering elements ,  may include a notch filter, or a series of notch filters, that reject an even-harmonic component of the even-harmonic signal. For example, one notch filter may be set to reject the 2nd harmonic, another notch filter for the 4th harmonic, another notch filter for the 6th harmonic, etc. This approach can provide the desired attenuation of the even-harmonic signal to allow the desired additional gain provided by amplifiers ,  without saturating the electronics of the RFOG . However, the notch filters may pass noise at the odd harmonics of the signal. Noise at these frequencies can increase ARW if a square-wave digital demodulator is employed. A square-wave demodulator is commonly used in FOG signal processing because of its simplicity requiring very few digital gates in the digital processor chip.","A square-wave demodulator is not only sensitive to a signal at the modulation\/demodulation frequency, but also odd harmonics of the modulation frequency. The square-wave demodulator sensitivity to an odd harmonic is inversely proportional to the harmonic number n.

If noise at the 3rd harmonic is removed, (n_min=5), then the ARW is increased by only about 6%. After removing noise at the 3rd through 19th harmonics, any additional removal of higher harmonics has insignificant (i.e., less than 1%) impact on ARW. Therefore, besides rejecting the 2nd, 4th and 6th harmonics of the even harmonic signal, and passing enough noise for ADC bit dithering, the filtering elements ,  may advantageously reject noise from about the 3rd to the 19th harmonic of the modulation frequency, but can pass noise above the 19th harmonic. A transfer function provided by filtering elements ,  according to an embodiment is shown graphically in .  illustrates a configuration of filtering element  (as well as filtering element ) according to such an embodiment.","In the embodiment illustrated in , the preamp  signal includes an oscillating signal (e.g., f or f), a direct-current (DC) signal, an even-harmonic signal including a set of components at even harmonics (e.g., 2f, 4f 6f etc.) of the oscillating signal, and an odd-harmonic signal including a set of components at odd harmonics (e.g., 3f 5f 7f, etc.) of the oscillating signal. At the filtering element , the preamp  signal is split into two paths. In one path, a Low-Frequency Bandpass Filter (BPF)  passes only a fundamental component (e.g., 1f) of the oscillating signal and rejects the DC signal, the even harmonic signal and noise at odd harmonics. In the other path, a High-Frequency BPF  passes enough noise (e.g., a subset of harmonic components above the 19harmonic) for ADC  bit dithering, but rejects the DC signal, significant even harmonic signals (e.g., a subset of harmonic components below the 8th harmonic) and significant noise at odd harmonics (e.g., a subset of harmonic components including the 19harmonic and below). The outputs of the two BPFs ,  are summed together at a summing element, such as a summing amplifier , or a summing node of the amplifier . After amplification by the amplifier , the filtered signal may then be digitized by ADC .","Referring to , the gain of the filtering element  drops with lower frequencies below fand goes to zero at DC to block any DC signal from the preamp .
