No. 12\/190,762 filed Aug. 13, 2008 and entitled SINGLE-PART, LIGHT-CURABLE, SELF-ADHERING DENTAL RESTORATIVE COMPOSITION AND METHOD OF USING THE SAME, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety as if completely set forth herein below.","This invention relates to a single-part, light-curable, self-adhering dental composition and a simplified method for filling a dental cavity with this single-part, light-curable, self-adhering dental restorative composition.","There are several choices available as a filling material for filling a dental cavity: a traditional amalgam (a silver-mercury alloy), a glass ionomer, and a composite resin. In the past two decades, composite resin filling material has become the material of choice for dentists for filling dental cavities due to their exceptional esthetic properties, i.e. precise color-matching capability and excellent translucency. However, current composite resins generally do not have a self-adhesive property and generally require pre-treating the tooth structure (or tooth cavity wall) with an adhesive to bond the composite to the tooth structure. For some adhesives, an etchant and\/or a primer are needed to etch and\/or condition the tooth structure prior to adhesive application. For a 4generation dental adhesive system, such as OptiBond\u00ae FL (Kerr Corporation, Orange, Calif.), the restorative procedures would include the following steps: (1) remove carious dentition (dentin and enamel); (2) etch the cavity wall with a 37% Phosphoric Acid Gel Etchant (Kerr Corporation, Orange, Calif.); (3) rinse the etchant off the cavity wall with water; (4) briefly dry the cavity wall with compressed air using a dental air-syringe; (5) apply a layer of OptiBond\u00ae FL Primer (Kerr Corporation, Orange, Calif.) to the cavity wall; (6) evaporate the solvent within the primer with compressed air using a dental syringe; (7) apply a layer of OptiBond\u00ae FL Adhesive (Kerr Corporation, Orange, Calif.) to the primer-coated cavity wall; (8) air-thin the adhesive with compressed air; (9) light-cure the adhesive with a dental curing light; (10) place a composite resin filling material, such as Premise\u2122 (Kerr Corporation, Orange, Calif.), either in bulk (or single increment) or in several increments; (11) light-cure the composite resin of each increment; and (12) remove excess composite resin and polish the restoration. Because of the many components and steps involved with the current dental cavity filling procedure using a composite resin filling material, the restorative procedure is quite complicated and time-consuming. Also, the procedure could be quite technique-sensitive as each specific adhesive has its own unique application procedure and care has to be given for each step for ensure a successful restoration. In addition, because of the many materials and steps involved, there will be increased chances for mistakes (i.e. using the wrong material or sequence of materials) and also contaminations due to saliva or blood during the procedure.","Recent development in the adhesive arena has simplified the restorative procedure to some extent with the introduction of various new primer and\/or adhesive configurations: total-etch priming adhesive (the primer and adhesive are combined into a single part), self-etch primer (the etchant and primer are combined into a single part), and a self-etch adhesive (the etchant, primer and adhesive are combined into a single part). Nevertheless, an adhesive or an adhesive in combination with either an etchant or a self-etch primer is still needed to bond the composite resin filling material to the cavity wall.","It is highly desirable to further simplify the cavity-filling restorative procedure by imparting self-adhesiveness to the composite resin filling material and therefore eliminate the need for an etchant and an adhesive. To formulate a self-adhesive composite resin, adhesive monomers need to be incorporated into composite resin to provide an adhesive property to the composite resin. However, most adhesive monomers have high polymerization shrinkage due to their low molecular weight. The adhesive monomers generally have a high viscosity and tend to limit the amount of inorganic fillers that can be incorporated into the composite resin, resulting in more polymerization shrinkage. Therefore, a self-adhering composite resin incorporating adhesive monomers is expected to have excessive polymerization shrinkage upon light-curing, exerting excessive shrinkage force at the bonding interface between the composite resin filling material and the cavity wall. The excessive shrinkage force can cause debonding and therefore microleakage at the bonding interface, leading to secondary caries later on. Another potential issue with a self-adhering composite resin filling material is that the material is expected to be quite sticky due to the incorporation of adhesive monomers and can further compromise the bonding interface due to excessive stickiness. Another issue with a self-adhering composite resin filling material is that the adhesiveness of the material would be compromised due to much increased filler loading and therefore viscosity, making it difficult to effectively wet the tooth surface to establish a reliable bond without the help of an etchant and\/or an adhesive. For those reasons or issues, there is still no viable commercialization of a truly self-adhering composite resin filling material that would eliminate the need for an etchant and\/or an adhesive.","The current invention discloses a single-part, light-curable, self-adhering dental restorative composition consisting essentially of: (A) one or more first polymerizable monomers selected from the group consisting of hydroxyethyl (meth)acrylate phosphate, hydroxypropyl (meth)acrylate phosphate, hydroxybutyl (meth)acrylate phosphate, dipentaerythritol penta(meth)acrylate phosphate, pentaerythritol tri(meth)acrylate phosphate, phenyl (meth)acryloxyethyl phosphate, and a combination thereof, (B) one or more second polymerizable monomers having a molecular weight of 100-250, at least one hydroxyl group, and at least one ethylenically unsaturated group; (C) one or more third polymerizable monomers having a molecular weight of 270-900, at least two ethylenically unsaturated groups and no acidic functional group; (D) at least one photo-initiator; (E) one or more fillers each having a mean particle size of more than 0.005 microns and less than 70 microns, and (F) one or more optional ingredients selected from colorants, stabilizers, UV absorbers, solvents, fluoride-releasing compounds, antimicrobial additives, and surfactants, wherein the weight ratio of (A+B):(C) ranges from 30:70 to 90:10. The composition has a shear bond strength of at least 10 MPa to both dentin and enamel after being light-cured. In one embodiment, component (A) further comprises glyceryldi(meth)acrylate phosphate, bis{hydroxyethyl (meth)acrylate} phosphate, or a combination thereof. In another embodiment, the concentration of component (A) in the restorative composition, excluding fillers, is in the range of 10-50% by weight, and the concentration of component (B) in the restorative composition, excluding fillers, is in the range of 15-60% by weight.","The invention also discloses a restorative method for filling a dental cavity with the above self-adhering dental composition without first treating the dental cavity with an etchant, a primer and\/or an adhesive. The omission of the steps of treating the dental cavity with an etchant, a primer and an adhesive significantly simplifies the restorative procedure, resulting in significant time savings for the dentist.","The current invention discloses a single-part, light-curable, self-adhering dental restorative composition and a simplified restorative method for filling a dental cavity with the self-adhering dental composition without first treating the dental cavity with an etchant, a primer and\/or an adhesive. One benefit of the inventive self-adhering composition is its excellent bond strength to tooth structure (both dentin and enamel) without the need for an etchant, a primer and\/or an adhesive. The excellent adhesion can reduce the chance of de-bonding due to polymerization shrinkage of the material during polymerization and subsequent microleakage. Another benefit of the inventive self-adhering composition is its excellent mechanical property, providing a restorative material that is strong and durable. Yet another benefit of the inventive self-adhering composition is its increased filler loading and therefore reduced shrinkage while maintaining a desirable viscosity of the composition, thereby leading to reduced microleakage. Yet another benefit of the inventive self-adhering composition is its reduced stickiness and therefore improved handling property, thereby leading to reduced microleakage and contributing to long-term success of the restoration.","In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, the single-part, light-curable, self-adhering dental restorative composition comprises: (A) one or more first polymerizable monomers having at least one phosphorus-containing acidic moiety and at least one ethylenically unsaturated group; (B) one or more second polymerizable monomers having a molecular weight of 100-250, at least one hydroxyl group, and at least one ethylenically unsaturated group; (C) one or more third polymerizable monomers having a molecular weight of 270-900, at least two ethylenically unsaturated groups and no acidic functional group; (D) at least one photo-initiator; and (E) one or more fillers each having a mean particle size of more than 0.005 microns and less than 70 microns.

The cured disk was removed from the mold and conditioned in 37\u00b0 C. water for 24 hours before subjecting to mechanical testing on an Instron Universal Tester (Model 4202) in compression mode with a crosshead speed of 0.50 mm\/minute. The peak load at which the specimen broke was used to calculate the CS expressed in MPa unit. Six specimens were tested for each formula.","Diametral Tensile Strength (DTS) Test","The specimens were prepared by condensing the paste into a stainless-steel mold with a dimension of 6mm (diameter)\u00d73mm (height), and then photo-curing the paste with a Demetron Optilux\u2122 501 curing light (Kerr Corp.) for 30-seconds from each side. The cured disk was removed from the mold and conditioned in 37\u00b0 C. water for 24 hours before subjecting to mechanical testing on an Instron Universal Tester (Model 4202) in compression mode with a crosshead speed of 10 mm\/minute. The load was applied in the diameter direction in compression mode. The peak load at which the specimen broke was used to calculate the DTS expressed in MPa unit. Six specimens were tested for each formula.","Flexural Strength (FS) and Young's Modulus (E) Tests","FS and E were measured from the same flexural test according to ISO 4049 standard. The specimens were prepared by condensing the paste into a stainless-steel mold with a dimension of 2mm\u00d72mm\u00d725mm, and then photo-cured from both sides. The cured disk was removed from the mold and conditioned in 37\u00b0 C. water for 24 hours before subjecting to mechanical testing on an Instron Universal Tester (Model 4202) in 3-point bending mode with a crosshead speed of 0.5 mm\/minute. The peak load at which the specimen broke was used to calculate the FS expressed in MPa unit. E was obtained from the slope of the stress-strain curve in the initial linear region. Five specimens were tested for each formula.","The Volumetric Polymerization Shrinkage (VPS)","VPS was calculated based on the measured densities of the material before and after light-curing with the Demetron Optilux\u2122 501 curing light for 60 seconds (30 seconds each side). The density was measured using the buoyancy method in de-ionized water.","Shear Bond Strength (SBS) to Enamel","The enamel bond strength test was conducted as follows: Bovine enamel specimens were embedded in cold-cure acrylics. A set of 6 specimens was prepared for each group. The enamel surface was then prepared with a fine diamond bur to create a new surface, and the surface was cleaned by rinsing with water and dried with compressed air from a dental air syringe for about 3 seconds. Without etching the enamel surface with an etchant or conditioning the enamel surface with a primer\/adhesive, the bovine enamel surface was then held securely by a bonding jig (Ultradent Inc., UT) with a cylindrical mold (\u03a6=2.38 mm) The self-adhering restorative composition was condensed inside the mold, and light-cured for 30 seconds using the Demetron Optilux\u2122 501 (Kerr, CA) dental curing light. After conditioning in 37\u00b0 C. water for 20-24 hours, the bond strength was tested on an Instron mechanical tester (Model 4467, Instron, MA) in shear mode using a notched (semi-circular) edge at a crosshead speed of 1.0 mm\/min The SBS to Enamel was calculated by dividing the peak load by the bonding area and expressed in MPa.","Shear Bond Strength (SBS) to Dentin","Dentin bond strength test was conducted according to following method: Extracted human teeth were embedded in cold-cure acrylics. A set of six specimens was prepared for each group. A low speed diamond saw was used to remove the crown and expose the occlusal dentin. The dentin substrates were polished with 240-grit and subsequently 600-grit SiC paper, rinsed thoroughly with water, and air dried briefly. Without etching the dentin surface with an etchant or conditioning the dentin surface with a primer\/adhesive, the dentin surface was then held securely by a bonding jig (Ultradent Inc., UT) with a cylindrical mold (\u03a6=2.38 mm) The self-adhering restorative composition was condensed inside the mold, and light-cured for 30 seconds using an Optilux\u2122 501 (Kerr, CA) dental curing light. After conditioning in 37\u00b0 C. water for 20-24 hours, the bond strength was tested on an Instron mechanical tester (Model 4467, Instron, MA) in shear mode using a notched (semi-circular) edge at a crosshead speed of 1.0 mm\/min The SBS to Dentin was calculated by dividing the peak load by the bonding area and expressed in MPa.","In this example, neither the enamel surface nor the dentin surface was etched with an etchant or pre-conditioned with an adhesive before bonding with the self-adhering restorative composition. The self-adhesiveness of the composition toward both dentin and enamel was clearly demonstrated.","Abbreviations for materials used in all examples:","Bis-GMA: 2,2-bis [4-(2-hydroxy-3-methacryloylpropoxy)-phenyl]-propane CQ: camphorquinone.\n\n","In all the examples for making the single-part, light-curable, self-adhering restorative material compositions, a homogeneous resin mixture was made first by mixing all resins with initiators and additives that are soluble in the resin mixture.
