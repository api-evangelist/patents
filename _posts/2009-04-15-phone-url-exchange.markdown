{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The invention relates generally to information exchange in unified communications systems including telephony systems, electronic mail systems, voice mail systems, fax communications systems, Internet web-based systems, and other communications systems. Particularly, the invention relates to facilitating Universal Resources Locators (URLs) and Universal Resource Identifiers (URIs) exchange with an acceptable level of security between systems with or without a pre-defined relationship over a standard phone line.","2. Description of the Background Art","Unified communications systems integrates a variety of communications systems, such as instant messaging, chat, presence, telephony, data collaboration-including presentation sharing, desktop sharing, application sharing, whiteboard sharing, editable document sharing with audit trails, video, email, voicemail and short message services, such that users are able to exchange information in various formats in the unified communications systems. However, the exchange of information between two or more parties in a unified communications system relies on a control mechanism such as a federation and a clearing house, which implies a formal relationship between the two parties. Both federation and clearinghouse mechanisms result in inconvenient and inefficient set-ups for information exchange, which is not suitable for information exchange between a sender and a receiver that have no or little relationship. A telephony system, such as traditional switched telephone network systems or new telephony systems that use Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), can be used in conjunction with a system like the phone URL exchange (PURLX) system described in the invention to facilitate information exchange using an already established open line of communications between two un-related communications parties.","Web-based applications of a unified communications system, such as SharePoint\u2122, Google applications, file sharing of Flickr, YouTube and social networking sites (e.g., Facebook\u2122 or MySpace\u2122) allow users to communicate with a shared organizer, which implies communications set-up and some forms of formal relationship. However, existing web-based communications are still cumbersome to exchange URLs or URIs between multiple parties. For example, a caller places a telephone call to another individual, listens as the other individual verbally provides an email address over the phone, and then sends an email message to the email address with the URL to be exchanged; or the caller and the other individual must be actively using the unified communication system. In yet another example, two parties uses cell phones and one party sends a short text message to the other party regarding the URL to be exchanged. A URI or a URL is used to identify or name a resource. A URL is a URI that, in addition to identifying a resource, provides means of acting upon or obtaining a representation of the resource by describing an access mechanism or network \u201clocation\u201d. From herein and throughout the specification, \u201cURL\u201d and \u201cURI\u201d are used interchangeably.","Traditionally, when dialing a telephone, a telephone number is encoded and transmitted across a telephone line as telephone tones, such as Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) tones. The tones \u201ccontrol\u201d the telephone system by instructing where to route the call. These control tones are sent over the same telephone communications channel and in the same band as the voice and other sounds of the telephone call. One problem with DTMF is that the telephone tones are very loud and annoying to human senders and receivers. Further, when sending data that has low error tolerance, such as a URL transmitted using a modem, traditional DTMF signaling faces challenges to provide a secure and user friendly way to exchange URL over telephone communications channels.","As alluded to above, existing telephony systems in use today are not designed to exchange information for web-based applications, such as a URL for web conferencing, over telephone communications channels, especially in a secure and user friendly way. For example, one individual verbally provides a URL for a web conferencing session to a second individual using a telephone. Existing telephony systems do not have mechanisms to electronically exchange the URL even if sending and receiving apparatus (e.g., telephones) are able to receive such information with a URL encoding\/decoding processing unit. The second individual must write down the URL or remember the URL and write it later or must be processed as in above examples, which is not convenient for telephone users to handle while simultaneously conducting a conversation.","Hence, there is a lack of a system and method that provides information exchange in general between unified communications systems with or without a pre-defined relationship over a communications channel. Particularly, there is a lack of a system and method that provides URL exchange using a telephony system between unified communications systems with or without a pre-defined relationship over a communications channel while providing an acceptable level of security.","The invention overcomes the deficiencies and limitations of the prior art by providing a system and method for exchanging information in general, and a Universal Resource Locator (URL) or a Universal Resource Identifier (URI) in particular, over a telephone communications channel in specific and over a communications channel in general. In one embodiment, the system comprises a first and a second endpoint corresponding to a first and a second caller (either of which can be a human being or an automated attendant), respectively. The system further comprises a phone URL exchange unit configured to receive a phone URL exchange request from the first endpoint, to determine the URL to be sent and URL encoding method based on the request, to encode the URL into audio data or as a part of the communications control signals using the URL encoding method and to send the audio data and the encoded URL to the second endpoint over the telephone communications channel. The phone URL exchange unit is further configured to receive audio data or the communications control signals embedded with a URL and to decode the received data to reveal the URL. The first and the second endpoint connect to the URL exchanged for general Internet based communications and especially for web-based communications. The invention also includes a variety of methods including a method for validating the sender and receiver of the phone URL exchange request against a whitelist and\/or a blacklist and a method for decoding audio data or the communications control signals embedded with a URL.","A system and method for providing phone URL exchange capabilities for unified communications using a telephony system is described. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the invention. It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the invention can be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring the invention. For example, the invention is described in one embodiment below with reference to user interfaces and particular hardware. However, the invention applies to any type of computing device that can receive a data and commands, and any peripheral devices providing services.","Reference in the specification to \u201cone embodiment\u201d or \u201can embodiment\u201d means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the invention. The appearances of the phrase \u201cin one embodiment\u201d in various places in the specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment.","Some portions of the detailed descriptions that follow are presented in terms of algorithms and symbolic representations of operations on data bits within a computer memory. These algorithmic descriptions and representations are the means used by those skilled in the data processing arts to most effectively convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. An algorithm is here, and generally, conceived to be a self consistent sequence of steps leading to a desired result. The steps are those requiring physical manipulations of physical quantities. Usually, though not necessarily, these quantities take the form of electrical or magnetic signals capable of being stored, transferred, combined, compared, and otherwise manipulated. It has proven convenient at times, principally for reasons of common usage, to refer to these signals as bits, values, elements, symbols, characters, terms, numbers or the like.","It should be borne in mind, however, that all of these and similar terms are to be associated with the appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels applied to these quantities. Unless specifically stated otherwise as apparent from the following discussion, it is appreciated that throughout the description, discussions utilizing terms such as \u201cprocessing\u201d or \u201ccomputing\u201d or \u201ccalculating\u201d or \u201cdetermining\u201d or \u201cdisplaying\u201d or the like, refer to the action and processes of a computer system, or similar electronic computing device, that manipulates and transforms data represented as physical (electronic) quantities within the computer system's registers and memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the computer system memories or registers or other such information storage, transmission or display devices.","The invention also relates to an apparatus for performing the operations herein. This apparatus may be specially constructed for the required purposes, or it may comprise a general-purpose computer selectively activated or reconfigured by a computer program stored in the computer.

To interconnect all of these sites, enterprise unified communications systems and enterprise telephony systems have been developed. Enterprise unified communications systems integrates a variety of communications systems, such as instant messaging, telephony, data collaboration, video, email, voicemail, calendar and short message services, such that users are able to exchange information in various formats in the unified communications systems. Enterprise telephony systems, which comprise a set of voice gateways and servers, offer enterprise applications enabled by the integration of computer systems with telephony services. The software that supports the computer-integrated functionality is generally implemented as a client-server environment in which the participants or clients (distributed telephony users) communicate with a server.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["195","195","100","100","100","100","190","100","100","195","100","100"]},"The first site A includes a phone URL exchange (PURLX) unit A, a gateway A, a route A with a firewall, four endpoints (analog phone A, IP phone A, software phone A and smart phone-PC suite A), a device running a call manager application A, a local area network (LAN) A and a storage device A. The gateway A and the router A with the firewall may be combined in a single suite. The gateway A represents a VoIP device to which a number of telephony endpoints can be coupled, such as analog phones A, IP phones A, software phones (softphones) A and smart phone-PC suites A. Additionally, all the endpoints can be coupled to the call manager application A via the LAN A. In the illustrated embodiment, the gateway A is coupled to the LAN . The gateway A is also coupled to a public switched telephone network (PSTN)  via an analog or digital trunk line (e.g., a T1 or E1 interface). In the illustrated configuration, the gateway A provides an interface for calls originating from or terminating on the PSTN . The router\/firewall A is configured to restrict an application at one site from communicating with another application at another site for network security concerns.","An endpoint enables a user to carry on a phone call. Although in the illustrated embodiment the first site A has four endpoints (one analog phone A, one IP phone A, one softphone A and one smart phone-PC suite A), in other embodiments the first site A has different numbers and types of endpoints. An endpoint is coupled (via the LAN A) to the call manager application A, the PURLX unit A, or both. Each of the endpoints can also include a display device (not shown) that is used in conjunction with the phone of the endpoint.","An endpoint has a user interface to send data, such as audio data and URLs, to a user and receive data from a user. In one embodiment, an endpoint further communicates with a PURLX unit A directly or through the gateway A and the call manager application A for URL exchange. This embodiment is further described with reference to FIGS.  and -. In another embodiment, an endpoint comprises a phone URL exchange processing unit, a PURLX engine , within the endpoint itself. This embodiment is further described with reference to . In yet another embodiment, an endpoint connects to a computer  having a PURLX engine  that implements phone URL exchange processing. The endpoint and the computer together perform the features or functions of the invention. This embodiment is further described with reference to .","The analog phone A has, for example, a Telephone User Interface (TUI) that sends data through a speaker and receives data through a microphone and a keypad. The IP phone A has, for example, both a TUI and a graphical user interface that sends data through a display device associated with the IP phone A. In one embodiment, the IP phone's graphical user interface also receives data from a touch screen display device associated with the IP phone A. The softphone A has, for example, a software application that runs on a computer and sends data through a display device and a speaker and receives data through a microphone, a keyboard, and a pointing device. The smart phone-PC suite A comprises an IP phone and a computer such as a PC. The smart phone-PC suite A processes phone URL exchange in addition to audio data communicated through a speaker, microphone and a keypad. In one embodiment, the endpoints (e.g., the analog phone A, the IP phone A, the softphone A and the smart phone-PC suite A) collaborate with the call manager application A and the PURLX unit A to exchange URL data.","A device running a call manager application A, such as a computer, controls one or more endpoints with which it is associated. In one embodiment, the call manager application A is software or routines executable by a computer, or more specifically a processor. The call manager application A offers a user an interface through which he\/she can perform call-related functions. Call manager application A can also trigger and specify URL data to be processed by the PURLX unit A and\/or handle the decoded URL data generated by the PURLX unit A. While shown as operational as a separate module in this embodiment and , those skilled in the art will recognize that in other embodiments, the call manager application A may be operational as part of the gateway A or end points such as the IP phone A, the softphone A and the smart phone-PC suite A.","Although in the illustrated embodiment the first site A has only one call manager application , in other embodiments the first site A has a different number of call manager applications . A given endpoint is controlled by one call manager application . To communicate with an endpoint controlled by another call manager application , the call manager applications  communicate with each other. In one embodiment, two endpoints communicate with each other for the purpose of exchanging URLs over a communications channel.","The PURLX unit A is configured to implement features or functions of the invention. The PURLX unit A is coupled to the LAN A and can also be coupled to one or more endpoints, such as IP phone A and softphone A. In the embodiment illustrated in , one PURLX unit A is associated with each of the sites A-B. Other embodiments can have two or more PURLX units  in the site A or B. The PURLX unit  will be further discussed below with reference to .","The storage device A contains directory information, including directory entries and associations between directories and phones. In one embodiment, the storage device A also contains information regarding the directory context of a phone. Alternatively, this information can be stored in the PURLX unit A. In one embodiment, directory context information includes one or more of the following: (1) a portion of a directory that is currently available for presentation (the portion could include, e.g., information from all entries versus information from entries that meet certain criteria); (2) a filter (if any) that was used to determine the entries in (1), such as a whitelist containing a list of phone numbers that are acceptable to exchange URLs via phone with others. Similarly, the filter may be used to determine a blacklist containing a list of phone numbers that are marked as unacceptable to exchange URLs via phone with others; (3) of the entries in (1), which entries are currently being presented by the phone; (4) of the entries in (3), which entry is currently navigated to; (5) what call function (if any) the directory was invoked during a voice communication. Note that since the directory context specifies the information presented by the phone, storing the directory context enables later determination of what information is being presented by the phone.","Also, note that directory context information need not include all items (1)-(5). For example, if the entire directory and the filter (2) are known, the directory portion available for presentation (1) can be determined. In the illustrated embodiment, the storage device A is directly coupled to the PURLX unit A.","One skilled in the art will appreciate that additional networking devices (not shown) can be added to the first site A, for example, if needed to support additional endpoints, PURLX units A or other systems. For example, the first site A can include a second gateway A and an edge router to couple the first site A to the network  and to provide local area connectivity for the first and second gateways A, B. One skilled in the art will also recognize that numerous configurations of gateways A, B and communications links are contemplated. For example, PSTN links can be coupled to multiple gateways  at several points within the topology and soft-gateways  can also be used.","For convenience and ease of understanding, the second site B is shown with the same structure and functionality as the first site A. Specifically, the second site B includes four endpoints (analog phone B, software phone B, IP phone B and smart phone-PC suite B), a PURLX unit B, a call manager application B, a storage B, a LAN B and a gateway B. Gateway B of the second site B is communicatively coupled with the PURLX unit B. Similar as gateway A, the gateway B provides an interface for calls originating from or terminating on the PSTN . A call can involve more than one gateway. For example, a call that originates from an endpoint that is communicatively coupled to gateway A at site A out to the PSTN  through gateway B from the PSTN  and terminates on an endpoint that is communicatively coupled to gateway B of the second site B involves two gateways: gateway A of the first site A and gateway B of the second site B. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the first site A and the second site B may have less or more components that these shown in the .","In one embodiment of the invention, the network  is a partially public or a globally public network such as the Internet. The network  can also be a private network or include one or more distinct or logical private networks (e.g., virtual private networks or wide area networks). Additionally, the communication links to and from the network  can be wire line or wireless (i.e., terrestrial- or satellite-based transceivers). In one embodiment of the invention, the network  is an IP-based wide or metropolitan area network.","The system  of the invention also includes a web server  located at one of the sites A-B for communication with the PURLX unit  via the network . In another embodiment, the web server  is external to the system . The web server  can be a conventional web server, such as Apache Web Server. The web server  accepts data in a variety of formats and the data can be launched by a URL on a computer. For example, the web server  accepts HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) requests from clients (e.g., endpoints) and serves the clients HTTP responses which usually are web pages located at the specified URL. Specifically, the web server  is communicatively coupled with the PURLX unit , the call manager application  or the gateway , and the web server  supports web-based communications associated with the URL exchanged over a telephone communications channel, such as web conferencing using the URL exchanged in conjunction with the use of any of the endpoints , ,  or .","PURLX Engine ",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 8","FIG. 10"],"b":["260","110","260","130","110","260","262","264"]},"Referring now to , a block diagram of a PURLX unit  on a server architecture according to one embodiment of the invention is shown. In this embodiment, PURLX unit  is configured to implement features or functions of the invention. PURLX unit  includes a processor  and a memory . The processor  can be a conventional processing device, such as a general-purpose microprocessor. The memory  includes computer program instructions or functional units that implement features of the invention. Specifically, the memory  includes a telephony management software (TMS) unit , a telephony application programming interface (TAPI) unit , an optional directory unit , a PURLX engine  and a packet interface . TMS unit  provides an event and call control path to endpoints. TAPI unit  provides an application interface for the PURLX engine . The URLs sent or received by endpoints are transmitted to the TMS unit , the TAPI unit  and the PURLX engine .","In one embodiment, the memory  also includes one or more application units (not shown) or application interfaces (e.g., socket interface) that interact with the TMS unit  and the TAPI unit  to enable a specific computer-integrated function. An application unit uses the TAPI unit  to exchange data with the TMS unit . The TMS, or TAPI or any other mechanisms may be used to communicate with the processor  to indicate the inclusion of the URL to be embedded into audio data or as a part of the communications control signals. The memory  uses an application unit to inject the URL data into the audio data or the communications control signals or to signal the gateway  to include the URL data.","In the illustrated embodiment, the PURLX unit  includes an optional directory unit  in dashed lines. In general, the directory unit  enables a phone to access a directory and use the directory in conjunction with other phone functions. In one embodiment, directory unit  is implemented as a service that interacts with TMS unit . Communication or data exchange is between TMS unit  and directory unit . Although directory unit  is illustrated as executing on the PURLX unit , directory unit  can be distributed among computing devices as is known to one of skill in the art. For example, the functionality enabled by directory unit  can be implemented in a client-server fashion by having the client (user's local system, such as a general-purpose computer or endpoint) perform some functions and having the PURLX unit  perform others. As another example, some or all of the functionality enabled by directory unit  can be implemented by having a call manager application  perform some or all functions.","The PURLX unit  illustrated in  also includes the packet interface unit  that packs the received application data (e.g., URL and audio message data) into network packets according to the network protocols being used by the communications network (e.g., network ). In one embodiment, the network protocol is Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for setting update and tearing down multimedia communications sessions, such as voice and video calls over the Internet. Other embodiments use different network protocols such as Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) for controlling mediate gateways on the Internet and PSTN, Remote Procedure Call, SIP, SOAP, H.323 and etc.","In the illustrated embodiment, the PURLX unit  includes the PURLX engine . The PURLX engine  is software or routines for exchanging a URL between two endpoints over a telephone communications channel. Specifically, the PURLX engine  encodes an URL and embeds the URL into audio data or as a part of the communications control signals. The PURLX engine  also decodes audio data or the communications control signals embedded with a URL. The PURLX engine  monitors calls between parties for a PURLX signal indicating that a first caller is requesting phone URL exchange with a second caller (i.e., a receiver of the call). The PURLX engine  then determines the URL encoding parameters including information to be sent and URL encoding method to be used. The PURLX engine  encodes the URL with the determined encoding method and embeds the URL into audio data or as a part of the communications control signals. The PURLX engine  may check a given user's rights or policies on receiving the embedded audio data or the communications control signals. The embedded audio data or the communications control signals are delivered by the telephony system to the receiver. Upon receiving audio data or the communications control signals embedded with a URL, the PURLX engine  decodes the embedded audio data or the communications control signals and delivers the decoded URL to its recipient such as an application module for further processing. The PURLX engine  is described in more detail below with reference to .","Referring now to , one embodiment of the PURLX engine  is shown. The PURLX engine  injects processed audio data embedded with a URL into a data stream (e.g., audio data)  to be sent over a telephone communications channel. The PURLX engine  also extracts embedded URL data from the data stream  received by the PURLX engine . The PURLX engine  comprises a PURLX monitoring module , an initialization module , a configuration determination module , a PURLX encoding module , a gateway\/Phone interface module , a PURLX decoding module  and an interface module . These components cooperate together to provide the functionality of the invention. The operation of these modules , , , , ,  and  can also be better understood with reference to , ,  and  below in addition to the description that follows.","The PURLX monitoring module  is software and routines for determining whether a caller has input a signal requesting phone URL exchange and signaling other modules (e.g., , , , ,  and ) of the PURLX engine  responsive to receiving a phone URL exchange request. In one embodiment, the PURLX monitoring module  interfaces with the call manager application  to determine whether any requests for phone URL exchange have been received from an application running on an endpoint or a computer. The PURLX monitoring module  is adapted for communication with the call manager application  or any application supporting the proper Application Programming Interface (API) being used by a signal line . The PURLX monitoring module  is advantageously able to identify when a request for phone URL exchange has been received, the parties on the call, a first party (a URL initiator) that has the URL to be exchanged, and one or more other parties (URL receivers) that receive the URL in an embedded audio data or in the communications control signals. The PURLX monitoring module  is also adapted for communication with the PURLX encoding module  to provide information about the URL to be exchanged.","The initialization module  is software and routines for initializing operation of the phone URL exchange functionality. The initialization module  is coupled by signal line  to the other modules , , , ,  and  for initializing their operation. The initialization module  is also coupled to signal line  for communication with the call manager application  to enable specific endpoints so that they are able to utilize the phone URL exchange functionality. In one embodiment, initialization of different endpoints (e.g., an IP phone A and a softphone A) includes enabling an endpoint to use the phone URL exchange functionality, such as receiving a decoded URL, and notifying other modules responsible for launching a web browser and connecting to a web conferencing session located at the website indicated by the URL.","In one embodiment, the initialization module  also communicates with the directory  to validate the URL sender and receiver against a whitelist and\/or blacklist stored in the directory  and\/or a given user's rights or policies on receiving the embedded audio data or the communications control signals. For example, the initialization module  accepts a phone URL exchange request from a URL sender on the whitelist and rejects a phone URL exchange request from a URL sender on the blacklist. Similarly, the initialization module  may validate a URL receiver against the whitelist and\/or blacklist. For example, the initialization module  delivers audio data or the communications control signals embedded with an URL to a URL receiver on the whitelist, and rejects the audio data or the communications control signals embedded with the URL to a URL receiver on the blacklist. Other embodiments implement the above validation in an application layer.","The gateway\/phone interface module  is software and routines for determining the information to be sent over the telephone communications channels. In one embodiment, the information to be sent includes the URL requested by the sender, content of an audio message to the receiver, data sharing format such as text chat, white boards and audio-video conferencing and data to be shared (e.g., text, audio and video). The information to be sent in one embodiment is determined based on a pre-defined configuration. For example, the call manager application  is configured according to the pre-defined configuration to detect and retrieve the URL of a sender's conference (i.e., the URL identifying the sender's conference) on his\/her associated gateway . In another embodiment, the information is determined on-the-fly, where the PURLX engine  asks the URL sender to identify the information to be sent. For example, upon detecting an input signal requesting phone URL exchange from a URL sender, the call manager application  is configured to prompt an inquiry on the caller's telephone user interface asking the sender to specify his\/her conference by selecting the conference from a list or by entering it through an input means. In one embodiment, the URL data is input on a phone keypad as a series of characters including numbers running from 0 to 9 and alphanumeric characters running from [a-z] and [A-Z] as well as additional special characters. In another embodiment, on an IP phone, the sender can either select the conference from a list or enter it through a keypad.","The gateway\/phone interface module  comprises software and routines for communicating with and controlling the gateway  or the IP phone . In one embodiment, the gateway\/phone interface module  has two subsets of software and routines, one for communicating with and controlling the gateway  and the other for communicating with and controlling the IP phone . The gateway\/phone interface module  may have an internal control to switch between the two sets of routines. The gateway\/Phone interface module  is coupled by the signal line  to the gateway , IP phone  and the PURLX unit . The gateway\/phone interface module  allows the PURLX engine , to communicate with the gateway  and\/or the IP phone  to deliver audio data or the communications control signals embedded with a URL to its intended recipient, and reconnects and disconnects callers from one another.","Once the information to be sent being determined, the configuration determination module  further selects which URL encoding method to encode the URL and to embed the encoded URL into audio data or as a part of the communications control signals. An encoding method describes a methodology being used to encode a URL and a signaling scheme for the determined URL.","Various methodologies for encoding a URL can be used in the scope of the invention. For example, a URL may be encoded using an ASCII Binary encoding method. Using the ASCII Binary encoding method, a URL data is packetized and converted from one format, e.g., ASCII formatted data, to another format, e.g., Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) formatted data. If the call is a digital phone line, it is noted that not all binary values are valid, depending on the telephony coding scheme. This means that binary codes cannot be directly sent over a telephony line. For example, T-1 lines using channel associated signaling (CAS) utilize robbed bit signaling, which utilizes one of the 255 values in certain data bytes for control signals. The alphanumeric and special characters can be converted to ASCII as defined by the ASCII table from the ANSI committee. The encoded URL is then sent from the URL sender to its intended recipient over the telephone communications channel using a selected analog signaling scheme such DTMF or multi-frequency (MF) tones. DTMF is an intrusive signaling scheme used in telephone systems to converts numbers\/characters found on standard telephone keypads to a particular frequency set, which can be converted back to the particular number. MF is similar to DTMF, but uses a different set of tones than those found on a telephone keypad.","In another embodiment, a URL may be encoded in a non-intrusive manner using steganography techniques. A steganography technique is a form of security through obscurity technique that data desirable to transport (i.e., to hide) is hidden in a carrier (i.e., signal, stream, or data file). A steganography technique enables the hidden data to be communicated in such a way that no one apart from the sender and the intended recipient realizes there is a hidden data in a data stream publicly transmitted over a communications channel. Electronic communications can include steganographic coding inside a transport layer, such as a file, or protocol, such as User Datagram Protocol (UDP). Media files (e.g., audio and video clips) are ideal for steganographic transmission because of their large size and\/or the nature of a live audio stream. Taking UDP as an example, the URL to be exchanged is a part of the payload of a UDP packet. The steganography technique embeds the URL payload into a voice stream. The resulting signal\/stream (e.g., a voice stream with embedded URL) is transmitted over a telephone communications channel. Care needs to be taken in the case of an analog telephone line, as converting a digital stream to analog and back to digital can introduce errors.","Other URL encoding and signaling algorithms are known to those of ordinary skills in the art, to whom the usage thereof within the context of the invention will be readily apparent, in the light of the specification. In one embodiment, a URL is encoded using modem signaling to be transmitted over a telephone communications channel. Similar to caller identification (Caller ID) service that transmits a caller's number to a called party's telephone equipment before the call is answered, during the quiet periods between ringing signals, or when the call is being set up but before the call is answered, the URL is encoded as a telephone number.","A related signaling technique is Caller ID while call waiting, which transmits a telephone number during a call, and the audio path to the listening parties is suppressed during transmission. A more general telephony technique than transmitting Caller ID numbers is Analog Display Signaling Interface (ADSI). ADSI is a combination of DTMF and Bell  modem signaling. The modem signaling supports the ASCII character set and allows longer strings than telephone numbers. The audio path is suppressed during transmission. The techniques to encode digital information (such as URL) into analog waveforms appropriate for an analog modem are readily known to those of ordinary skills in the art. The advantages of using modem signaling are higher data rate and a low error rate for encoding the URL onto an analog telephone line.","In another embodiment, a URL is encoded into an in-band signaling within a Real-Time Protocol (RTP) stream for VoIP calls between enterprises. In-band signaling is a mechanism to send metadata and control information in the same band, or on the same channel, as used for audio data. A RTP stream permits arbitrary binary data, however, the data is heard as sounds if played directly by the receiving phone. This can be overcome by encoding a tone to indicate that the stream should be muted, similar to Caller ID while call waiting and ADSI signaling. The signaling can be disguised using various coding methods, such as using steganography as described above. RTP streams have the option of encoding arbitrary digital data within the stream but not heard by the receiving phone, and are thus out of band. The Request for Comment (RFC) 2833 option for the RTP protocol describes how a packet header can indicate an arbitrary payload.","In yet another embodiment, a URL is encoded using Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) signaling. The ISDN D channel carries all signaling between a customer's terminal device and a carrier's end switching device. Using ISDN signaling, a URL is encoded as a part of the signaling transmitted over the D channel between the URL's endpoint and its associated switching which further transmits to the ISDN terminating equipment, where it is retrieved from the D channel and passed to the PURLX engine  and to its intended recipient.","Other URL encoding methods include Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) signaling and white noise signaling. SIP is a signaling protocol widely used for setting up and tearing down multimedia communications sessions such as voice and video calls over the Internet. A URL can be encoded as a part of SIP control signaling from a user agent on the transmitting user's telephony system to the user agent on the receiving user's telephony system and then passed to the PURLX engine . One skilled in the art will appreciate that individuals communicating with SIP softphones communicate using an embodiment of the invention independent of the PSTN network .","White noise is a random signal (or process) with a flat power spectral density. White noise exists at low levels in all telephony applications. Extra white noise is even added in cases where there is very little sound in order to give user the feeling that he\/she is connected. This is called comfort noise generation. In one embodiment, the URL can be steganographically embedded in the low level white noise generated by the telephony system. The encoded URL is embedded into audio data and gets transmitted over a telephone communications channel. The recipient decodes the white noise and reconstructs the URL.","Referring back now to the PURLX encoding module , the PURLX encoding module  is software and routines for encoding a URL based on the encoding method selected by the configuration determination module . The PURLX encoding module  is coupled to signal line  for communication with the other modules this , , , ,  and . Encoding a URL includes: receiving and processing a signal from the PURLX monitoring module  indicating a user has requested phone URL exchange, interacting with the configuration determination module  to determine the information to be sent and encoding method to use, encoding the URL into audio data or as a part of the communications control signals using the determined encoding method and controlling the gateway\/phone interface module  to deliver the audio data or the communications control signals embedded with the URL to its intended recipient. The operation of the PURLX encoding module  is described in more detail below with reference to .","The PURLX decoding module  is software and routines for decoding audio data or the communications control signals embedded with a URL. The PURLX decoding module  is coupled to signal line  for communication with the gateway\/phone interface module . Decoding audio data or the communications control signals embedded with a URL includes: discovering the embedded audio data or the communications control signals on a receiving end (e.g., an IP phone ), identifying the encoding method used in the embedded audio data or the communications control signals and decoding the embedded audio data or the communications control signals using a decoding method corresponding to the identified encoding method. For example, for an embedded audio data encoded using in-band signaling within a RTP stream, the PURLX decoding module  decodes the embedded audio data into an audio data payload and a decoded URL. Once decoded, the decoded data (e.g., audio data and URL) is sent to the gateway\/phone interface module  for further processing, such as notifying a receiver of the received data, and waiting for a confirmation from the receiver. The interface module  notifies a web server associated with the receiver and the web server waits for the receiver to connect to the received URL.","The interface module  is software and routines for interfacing with other components of the phone URL exchange system , and these components are communicatively coupled to the PURLX engine . The interface module  is coupled to the signal line  for communication with the other components such as the call manager application  and the IP phone . The interface module  initiates the send of a URL embedded in audio data or as a part of the communications control signals to its recipients. The interface module  also communicates with the call manager application  to handle the URL, and the call manager application , in turn, invokes a web browser to render the URL into its corresponding HTML files and communicates the rendered URL with the web server .","Referring now to , an example of a telephony system  utilizing the invention is shown according to one embodiment of the invention. In particular,  shows a diagram illustrating an example with a first caller communicating with a second caller and how the invention exchanges a URL between the callers over a telephone communications channel. As shown in , the first caller has a system A that includes an endpoint A (e.g., an IP phone ) and a computer A for communicating audio data with the second caller. The system A of the first caller is communicatively coupled with a gateway A and a PURLX unit A. Similarly, the second caller has a system B that includes an endpoint B and a computer B for communicating audio data with the first caller. The system B of the second caller is communicatively coupled with a gateway B and a PURLX unit B. These system A and B configurations are provided only by way of example, and those skilled in the art will recognize that there are a variety of other configurations for the systems of the first caller and second caller. To simplify description of an embodiment, the first caller is also referred to as A and second caller is referred to as B.","Initially, a call is established between the first caller A and the second caller B. This call could be audio only or audio embedded with a URL. The call could be an audio message requesting a web conferencing session from the first caller to the second caller. The audio data of the call along with the signaling of the call (e.g., PSTN signaling, or SIP signaling) is represented by solid line , the embedded URL is represented by the dashed line , and the web data corresponding to the embedded URL data  is represented by the dashed line . Once the second caller B confirms to join the web conferencing session, the first caller A presses a special key on his\/her keypad, or a button in the application or a key on the keyboard of the computer to signal a phone URL exchange request. In one embodiment, the system A communicates with the PURLX unit A to validate the URL initiator (i.e., the first caller) and the URL receiver (i.e., the second caller). In another embodiment, the URL initiator and receiver validation is optional. The PURLX unit A further determines the information to be sent and URL encoding method. For example, the PURLX unit A determines the URL of the first caller's conference for a web conferencing session and audio message to embed the URL based on a pre-defined configuration. The PURLX unit A encodes the URL using the determined method (e.g., steganography in a voice stream) and embeds the encoded URL (represented by the dashed line ) into one of the audio messages sent by the first caller. The first caller A communicates with the second caller via the gateways A-B, the PSTN  and the network  in one or more audio messages. The encoded URL  embedded with the audio data of the call along with the signaling of the calls  is delivered from the first caller A to the second caller B (e.g., the arrowed path of  URL data from the first caller A to the second caller B). The web data  corresponding to the embedded URL data  are communicated between the first caller A and B. The interface module  of the PURLX unit  determines whether the same URL is to be used or a variation of the URL to be used by the URL sender and the receiver. For example, the URL sender may uses a variation of the embedded URL as \u201chttp:\/\/server\/meeting\/leader\/123\u201d and the receiver uses another variation of the same embedded URL as \u201chttp:\/\/server\/meeting\/participant\/123\u201d. Once the embedded audio data being delivered to the second caller B, or in parallel to the embedded audio data being delivered to the second caller B, the first caller A launches a web browser and a web conferencing session using the URL exchanged through the web server .","On the receiving end of the audio data embedded with the URL, e.g., the second caller B, the PURLX unit B detects the embedded audio data by the gateway B in one embodiment, or by the computer B in another embodiment. The second caller B communicates with the PURLX unit B to decode the embedded audio data. The second caller B receives the decoded URL, launches a web browser from the computer B and connects to the web conferencing session at the received URL ending on the web server .","In another embodiment, a caller may call an automated attendant (i.e., non-human receiver on the other end of a call). The caller may be presented with an option to receive a URL from which the caller can get further information from the web page located at the URL or to provide information in a web form associated with the URL.","To further illustrate the example in , a real world scenario using the invention is presented. A typical scenario may be as follows: Alice works for company A which uses some of product development tools of company B. Both companies use a telephony system that has implemented the phone URL exchange functionality according one embodiment of the invention. Other than the PURLX telephony system, the two companies have no prior information exchange experience with each other. Alice calls Bob, a technical support at company B, for some technical problems she has encountered during her product development. Bob asks Alice if she would mind performing a web conferencing session on her system so that Bob can actually see some specific configuration screens of the product development. Alice agrees.","At this point, Bob presses a special key on his IP phone. The URL for Bob's conference on his collaboration bridge is retrieved by the system. The URL is encoded into an audio message according to the encoding method determined by the system and sent on the telephone line. Alice hears a message like \u201cYour correspondent is starting a collaboration session. Please wait for the communication to complete.\u201d After a few seconds, Alice's call manager pops up an alert: \u201cYour correspondent is requesting to launch your web browser. Do you want to open it now? Launch\/Cancel?\u201d Alice clicks on \u201cLaunch.\u201d A web browser pops up and she connects to the web conferencing session where Bob is waiting for her.","Those skilled in the art will recognize that the example of  represents the simplest of cases, and that the invention includes a variety of alternate embodiments. Alternate embodiments of the invention are described in more detail below with reference to .","Allowing phone URL exchange between a human user and an automated attendant has a wide range of applications such as customer services and advertising business. Using the Alice-Bob example described above for the embodiment of phone URL exchange between a human user (e.g., Alice) and an automated attendant of a company called ACME, Alice has a PURLX unit and a smart phone (or a phone and a computer). She connects to ACME's phone system to get support information on a microwave she purchased. Alice is sent to a phone queue by an automated attendant on ACME end. While Alice waits, she can either be prompted to receive information (e.g., a URL) or have the information sent to her directly using the PURLX mechanism described above. Alice's PURLX unit decodes the information and sends the decoded information to the application layer which prompts Alice to open the web browser at the URL provided. Depending on which number Alice called, or which selection she made with the automated attendant, Alice can have different types of information. For example, the information is a URL which points to a frequently-asked-questions (FAQ) web page for her microwave. In some cases the URL provides a form in which Alice may submit additional information via the web to assist ACME in meeting her needs, such as her current address and the best time for a service call.","Another application of phone URL exchange between a human user and an automated attendant is advertising business. Similar to pop-up advertisement commonly seen in a user's computer while the user browses the web. The PURLX system described above provides a framework for a similar method of advertisement via a telephone. The advertising provided by the PURL system is less intrusive than a standard sale call since all the information (e.g., URL) is out-of-band. In the example above, Alice calls ACME and the ACME system may push to Alice via the PURLX system new product information and advertisements about her microwave and ACME's new microwave product line. In a similar embodiment of the invention, the automated attendant performs more advanced operations such as identifying the caller using a caller ID mechanism, authenticating the caller with a pin or a password, and performing actions\u2014such as transferring or emailing of files from the caller office computer to a specific or pre-defined email account.","Methods","Referring now to  and A-B, methods for performing a phone URL exchange are shown.  is a flow chart illustrating an example of phone URL exchange using the PURLX engine  according to one embodiment of the invention. For purposes of simplicity, only one PURLX unit  is illustrated in . The PURLX unit  should be interpreted as the PURLX unit A responsive to operations associated with caller A. The PURLX unit  should be interpreted as the PURLX unit B responsive to operations associated with caller B.","Initially, a first caller A initiates  phone URL exchange by sending a phone URL exchange signal to the PURLX unit . The PURLX unit  determines the information to be sent and URL encoding method and encodes  the URL into audio data or as a part of the communications control signals. The PURLX unit  sends  the audio data or the communications control signals embedded with the URL to a second caller B. The PURLX unit  decodes  the URL embedded in the audio data or in the communications control signals, and the second caller B sends  a request to the PURLX unit  for the decoded URL data. The PURLX unit  sends  the decoded URL to the second caller B. The first caller opens  a web conferencing session at the URL exchanged, and the second caller connects  to the received URL to join the web conferencing session.
