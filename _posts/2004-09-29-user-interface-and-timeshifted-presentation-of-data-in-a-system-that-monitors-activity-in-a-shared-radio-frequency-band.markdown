{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application is related to U.S. application Ser. No. 10\/717,852, filed Nov. 19, 2003, claims priority to the following U.S. Provisional Patent Applications:","U.S. Application No. 60\/556,513, filed Mar. 25, 2004.","The entirety of each of these applications is incorporated herein by reference.","The present invention relates to a system and method for monitoring activity in a shared frequency band one or more radio sensor devices positioned to capture data concerning activity in the shared frequency band at various locations.","The explosive growth in wireless applications and devices over the past few years has produced tremendous public interest benefits. Wireless networks and devices have been deployed in millions of offices, homes, and more recently, in increasing numbers of public areas. These wireless deployments are forecast to continue at an exciting pace and offer the promise of increased convenience and productivity.","This growth, which is occurring place mostly in the unlicensed bands, is not without its downsides. In the United States, the unlicensed bands established by the FCC consist of large portions of spectrum at 2.4 GHz and at 5 GHz, which are free to use. The FCC currently sets requirements for the unlicensed bands such as limits on transmit power spectral density and limits on antenna gain. It is well recognized that as unlicensed band devices become more popular and their density in a given area increases, a \u201ctragedy of the commons\u201d effect will often become apparent and overall wireless utility (and user satisfaction) may degrade. This phenomenon has already been observed in environments that have a high density of wireless devices.","The types of signaling protocols used by devices in the unlicensed bands are not designed to cooperate with signals of other types also operating in the bands. For example, a frequency hopping signal (e.g., a signal emitted from a device that uses the Bluetooth\u2122 communication protocol or a signal emitted from certain cordless phones) may hop into the frequency channel of an IEEE 802.11 wireless local area network (WLAN), causing interference with operation of the WLAN. Thus, technology is needed to exploit all of the benefits of the unlicensed band without degrading the level of service that users expect.","Historically, the wireless industry's general approach to solving \u201ctragedy of the commons\u201d problems has been for manufacturers to simply move to another commons further up the spectrum. This solution, however, is not workable for much longer, due to spectrum scarcity and to the less attractive technical characteristics of the higher bands (decreased signal propagation and the inability to penetrate surfaces).","Enterprise uses of the unlicensed band are focused on larger scale deployment of wireless networks (e.g., WLANs) and integration into wired networks. WLANs can complicate existing network management schemes because they introduce the additional requirement of efficiently managing radio spectrum. Current WLAN systems and management technology are focused on managing activity at the network level of the WLAN, but provide little or no capability to manage the frequency band where signals of multiple types (e.g., communication protocol\/network types, device types, etc.) are present.","There are many shortcomings of existing WLAN system technologies. Current WLAN technologies are only generally aware of other network elements. They have no way to discover other nearby sources emitting RF signals in the unlicensed bands. The lack of device discovery and location functions exposes existing WLANs to significant security vulnerabilities. While current WLANs can perform standard authentication services and encryption services, they are vulnerable to imposter stations, denial-of-service attacks, parking lot attacks, and other security breaches.","Briefly, an intelligent spectrum management (ISM) system and method are provided that includes sophisticated features to detect, classify, and locate sources of RF activity. The system comprises one or more radio sensor devices positioned at various locations in a region where activity in a shared radio frequency band is occurring. A server is coupled to the radio sensor devices and aggregates the data generated by the sensor devices. Each radio sensor device comprises a spectrum monitoring section and a traffic monitoring section. The spectrum monitoring section comprises a radio receiver capable of receiving radio signals in a radio frequency band, a spectrum analysis system coupled to the radio receiver for generating spectrum (radio frequency) activity information representative of the (radio frequency) activity in the frequency band. The traffic monitoring section comprises a baseband signal processing section that demodulates signals transmitted by other devices on a wireless network in the frequency band according to the communication protocol and a radio receiver coupled to the baseband signal processing section that receives signals on the wireless network and couples received signals to the baseband signal processing section. A processor is coupled to the spectrum monitoring section and to the traffic monitoring section. The processor executes one or more programs to analyze packets transmitted by devices on the wireless network in the frequency band based on signals demodulated by the baseband signal processing section and to classify radio signals occurring in the frequency band based on the spectrum activity information output by the spectrum analysis system.","The server receives data from each of the plurality of sensor devices and executes functions to process the data. For example, the server executes a performance function that monitors and generates events related to the performance of the wireless network, a discovery function that monitors and generates events pertaining to devices operating in the wireless network or other radio frequency emitters in the frequency band and a security function that monitors and generates events related to security threats to the wireless network. In addition, the server interfaces data generated by its various functions to a client application, e.g., a network management application.","Data collected and processed by the server from the sensors may be presented to a user by a console application. The server continuously stores spectrum analysis data and\/or protocol analysis data pertaining to activity in a frequency band over time. The console application presents the spectrum analysis data and\/or protocol analysis data associated with the event. This functionality provides a time-shift display mode to allow a user to display data associated with activity in a frequency band without being present (both in time and location) with respect to occurrence of that activity.","The above and other advantages of this technique will become more apparent when reference is made to the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.","The system, methods, software and other technologies described herein are designed to cooperatively manage use of a shared frequency band where signals of multiple types occur (often simultaneously), such as an unlicensed band, and interference among the users of the band may occur. Many of the concepts described herein may apply to frequency bands that are not necessarily \u201cunlicensed,\u201d such as when a licensed frequency band is used for secondary licensed or unlicensed purposes.","The term \u201cnetwork\u201d is used hereinafter in many ways. There may be one or more wireless networks each comprising multiple devices or nodes that operate in the shared frequency band. One example of such a network is an IEEE 802.11 WLAN. There are also networks, called piconets, which are formed with Bluetooth\u2122 capable devices. Many of the examples described herein are made with respect to an IEEE 802.11 (also known as WiFi\u2122) WLAN, mostly due in part to the expansive use that the WLAN has seen, and is expected to continue to see. In addition, the term network may refer to a wired network, and to an aggregation of one or more wired and wireless networks. The spectrum management and monitoring systems, methods, software and device features described herein are not limited to any particular wireless network, and are equally applicable to any wireless network technologies now known or hereinafter developed for a frequency band where it is desired to monitor activity occurring that may affect operation of wireless radio communications. For example, the system and methods described herein are applicable to monitoring activity in wide area network wireless communications.","The Environment","Referring first to , an environment is shown where there are multiple devices that at some point in their modes of operation transmit or emit signals within a common frequency band, and that may at least partially overlap in frequency and time. When these devices are sufficiently close in proximity to each other, or transmit signals at sufficiently high power levels, there will inevitably be interference between signals of one or more devices. The dotted-line shown in  is meant to indicate a region where activity from any of the devices shown may impact other devices. A region may be a building in which there are multiple zones of unlicensed band activity.  shows a non-exhaustive exemplary selection of devices that may operate in an unlicensed frequency band, including cordless phones , frequency hopping communication devices , microwave ovens , a wireless local area network (WLAN) comprised of a WLAN access point () and its associated client station (STAs) (), () to (N), infant monitor devices  as well as any other existing or new wireless devices . Multiple WLAN APs () to (N) may be operating in the region, each of which has one or more associated client STAs () to (N).","One or more of the WLAN APs () to (N) may be connected to a wired network (e.g., Ethernet network) to which also connected is a server . Cordless phones  may be analog, digital and frequency hopping devices, depending on the type. Frequency hopping communication devices  may include devices operating in accordance with the Bluetooth\u2122 wireless communication protocol, the HomeRF\u2122 wireless communication protocol, as well as cordless phones. In addition, radar devices  may operate in an unlicensed frequency band. Other devices that may operate in the frequency band may also include appliances such as digital (still and\/or) video cameras, cable-set top boxes, etc.","The spectrum management system described herein involves deployment of a plurality of sensors () to (N) shown in  in various locations or zones where activity associated with any of the plurality of signal types is occurring in the frequency band to form a sensor overlay network. The spectrum and protocol intelligence gathered by the sensors is fed to a server . There may be multiple servers () to (P) each coupled to a plurality of sensors. A super server  may connect to the plurality of servers () to (P) to manage each of the servers. There may be one server for each building or portion of a building, and the super server  may manage the servers across a campus of buildings. For simplicity, a single server  (corresponding to server ()) will be referred to in the following description. The server  contains the aggregation and analysis software which processes low-level spectrum and protocol analysis data from the sensors () to (N) and provides network level services described hereinafter. The sensors () to (N) are referred to as \u201cagents\u201d to the server . A network management station  executes one or more end-user client management applications  or contains network management server software that requests services from the server. The network management station  may include one or more processors , memory  and a display . An example of an end-user management application is a graphical user interface (GUI) console application for use by network engineers or IT managers. Some of the functions which may be performed by a network management server include WLAN management functions, such as (1) AP configuration, AP firmware upgrades, etc.; (2) security management such as authentication or virtual private network (VPN) management; and (3) management of other networks, such as a wired Ethernet network. The network management station  is referred to as a \u201cclient\u201d to the server . The network management station  may be part of a larger WLAN management infrastructure including servers and switches, which in turn, interfaces with a generalized (wired and wireless) network management infrastructure.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"],"b":["2000","1","2000"]},"The Sensor","Turning now to , each sensor () comprises a spectrum monitoring  section to monitor RF activity in the frequency band and a traffic monitoring section  that is capable of sending and receiving traffic according to a communication protocol, such as an IEEE 802.11 WLAN protocol. The spectrum monitoring section  comprises a radio  (primarily for receive operations) that is capable of tuning to receive energy at each channel (or simultaneously all channels in a wideband mode) of, for example, any of the unlicensed bands (2.4 GHz and 5 GHz) in which IEEE 802.11 WLANs operate. An analog-to-digital converter (ADC)  is coupled to the radio  that converts the downconverted signals from the radio  to digital signals. A radio interface (I\/F)  is coupled directly to the radio  and also to the output of the ADC . A real-time spectrum analysis engine (SAGE)  is coupled to the radio I\/F . The SAGE  includes a spectrum analyzer , a signal detector  consisting of a peak detector  and one or more pulse detectors  and , and a snapshot buffer . A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) block (not shown) is coupled between the I\/F  and the spectrum analyzer , or included in the spectrum analyzer . The SAGE  generates spectrum activity information that is used in the sensor and\/or the server to determine the types of signals occurring in the frequency band, and captures signals for location measurement operations. A dual port random access memory (RAM)  is coupled to receive the output of the SAGE  and a processor I\/F  interfaces data output by the SAGE  to a processor , and couples configuration information from the processor  to the SAGE .","The functions of the SAGE  will be briefly described in further detail hereinafter, but more details on the SAGE can be found in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 6,714,605, commonly assigned co-pending U.S. application Ser. No. 10\/420,511, filed Apr. 22, 2003, entitled \u201cSystem and Method for Real-Time Spectrum Analysis in a Radio Device,\u201d and commonly assigned co-pending U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60\/587,834, filed Jul. 14, 2004, entitled \u201cPulse Detection Scheme for Use in Real-Time Spectrum Analysis.\u201d The spectrum analyzer  generates data representing a real-time spectrogram of a bandwidth of radio frequency (RF) spectrum, such as, for example, up to 100 MHz. The spectrum analyzer  may be used to monitor all activity in a frequency band, for example, the 2.4-2.483 GHz ISM band, or the 5.15-5.35 GHz and 5.725-5.825 GHz UNII bands. The FFT block referred to above is, for example, a 256 frequency bin FFT block that provides (I and Q) FFT data for each of 256 frequency bins that span the bandwidth of the frequency band of interest. An FFT block with greater resolution or bandwidth may be used as well. A spectrum correction block may be included to correct for I and Q channel imbalance by estimating an I-Q channel imbalance parameter related to phase error and amplitude offset between the I and Q channels, and to suppress a side tone resulting from the RF downconversion process. The spectrum analyzer  may further comprise a power computation block that computes (FFTdataI) and (FFTdataQ), respectively, and adds them together, to output a power value for each FFT frequency bin. The spectrum analyzer  may further include a stats logic block that has logic to accumulate statistics for average power, duty cycle, maximum power and a peaks histogram. Statistics are accumulated in the dual-port RAM over successive FFT time intervals. After a certain number of FFT intervals, determined by a configurable value stored in the spectrum analyzer control registers, an interrupt is generated to output the stats from the dual-port RAM. For example, the stats are maintained in the dual-port RAM  for 10,000 FFT intervals before the processor reads out the values. The power versus frequency data generated by the spectrum analyzer  is also used as input to the signal detector.","The signal detector  detects signal pulses in the frequency band and outputs pulse event information entries, which include one or more of the start time, duration, power, center frequency and bandwidth of each pulse that satisfies configurable pulse characteristic criteria associated with a corresponding pulse detector.","In the signal detector , the peak detector  looks for spectral peaks in the (power versus frequency data derived from FFT block output), and reports the bandwidth, center frequency and power for each detected peak. The output of the peak detector  is one or more peaks and related information. The pulse detectors  detect and characterize signal pulses based on input from the peak detector . A pulse detector lite  may be employed to generate pulse events in a manner slightly different from pulse detectors , as described in the aforementioned co-pending application entitled \u201cPulse Detection Scheme for Use in Real-Time Spectrum Analysis\u201d filed on Jul. 14, 2004.","The snapshot buffer  collects a set of raw digital signal samples useful for signal classification and other purposes, such as location measurements. The snapshot buffer  can be triggered to begin sample collection from either the signal detector  or from an external trigger source, such as a signal from the processor, to capture received signal data for a period of time sufficient to include a series of signal exchanges. Alternatively, the snapshot buffer will be in a free-running state continuously storing captured and then in response to detecting the first signal (e.g., the Probe Request frame), the snapshot buffer is put into a post-store mode that extends long enough to capture the ACK frame signal data.","The traffic monitoring section  monitors packet activity in a wireless network, e.g., a WLAN, and sends and receives certain packets that may be used for location measurement processes. For example, as described hereinafter, a sensor may transmit an 802.11 Probe Request frame, data frame or request-to-send frame that may be addressed to the device to be located. Included in the traffic monitoring section  are a radio transceiver  (comprising a transmitter Tx and a receiver Rx) and a baseband signal processor . The radio transceiver  and baseband signal processor  may be part of a package chipset available on the market today, such as an 802.11 WLAN chipset for any one or more of the 802.11a\/b\/g or other WLAN communication standards. The baseband signal processor  is capable of performing the baseband modulation, demodulation and other PHY layer functions compliant with the one or more communication standards of interest (e.g., IEEE 802.11a, b, g, h, etc.). An I\/F  couples the baseband signal processor  and radio transceiver  to the processor .","There may be other traffic monitoring sections in the sensor to monitor communication protocol type activity of other types, such as Bluetooth\u2122 communications.","The processor  performs the various processing algorithms described herein on the output of the SAGE  and on received packets from the traffic monitoring section . The processor I\/F  of the spectrum monitoring section  and the processor I\/F  of traffic monitoring section  may be a Mini-PCI or PC-Card (e.g., Cardbus\u2122) interface, or any other interface known in the art. While not shown in , there is also an LAN interface block (e.g., Ethernet) that is coupled to the processor  to enable the sensor to communicate with the server with a wired LAN connection. The processor  may generate signals to control the radio  independently of the radio transceiver , such that spectrum monitoring is occurring on one channel while protocol monitoring is simultaneously occurring on another channel, for example. The sensor may also communicate with the server via a WLAN connection.","It is envisioned that a WLAN AP may include all of the functionality of a sensor described above, and may be switched between AP operating mode and a sensor operating mode.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["2000","3000","2000","3000","4005","3000","2000","2710","2720","2730","2740","2710","2720","2130","2730","2130","2740","2520"]},"The interface between the sensor  and the server  is referred to as a network spectrum interface (NSI) .","The server  may run on a dedicated server box, or it may be integrated with other servers such as WLAN switches, authentication servers or management servers. There are high level services , low level services , and interface services . The high level services  include a database , discovery manager , performance manager  and security manager . The low level services  are invoked by one or more or the high level services  and include an RF manager , location manager  and protocol manager . The interface services  manages interfaces between the server  and client applications  by an application programming interface (API) called the intelligent spectrum management interface (ISMI) .","The functions provided by the server  can be summarized as follows. The server manages all of the sensors it communicates with. It aggregates data from the sensors, performs analysis on the data and presents the data in formats amenable to other network management entities.","The software functions of the sensor  will be described in more detail.","The measurement engine  software in the sensor is responsible for communicating with the SAGE driver software to configure the SAGE  in the sensor . In addition, the measurement engine  manages the resources of the SAGE  between spectrum monitoring functions and device location functions. The measurement engine  also collects and aggregates data from the SAGE  into meaningful units. The functions of the measurement engine  and classification engine  may be incorporated into a single functional block. Furthermore, the measurement engine  may configure reporting of data and statistics generated by the SAGE  and adjust the frequency channel (and\/or scan rate) on which the SAGE  operates. The measurement engine  may also operate the radio receiver in the sensor in a wideband mode to simultaneously process data across an entire unlicensed frequency band of interest. The measurement engine  produces the spectrum activity data from raw spectrum analysis and snapshot buffer data output by the SAGE . The spectrum activity data, simply put, comprises data representing one or more of time, frequency and power of radio frequency energy received in a portion (or all) of a frequency band.","One function of the measurement engine  is to control which bands are monitored, and to produce streams from spectrum analyzer statistics (SA STAT) and pulses produced by the SAGE. A SA STAT stream consists of one or more of: maximum power, average power, and average duty cycle for a particular frequency range or channel, over relatively short periods of time.","A pulse stream reports on individual pulses that have been detected by the sensor.","A pulse histogram stream provides histogram data on attributes of pulses of energy detected by the sensor, including histograms for center frequency, bandwidth, duration, inter-pulse (gap, e.g., start to start), and power.","In addition, the measurement engine  produces air quality (AQ) metrics that measure different attributes of a given \u201cchannel\u201d. The channels can be any requested range of frequencies, and might include an entire band if so desired. There are also protocol related AQ metrics derived by the server from the protocol monitoring records produced by the protocol engine in a sensor.","Although many of the previously described measurements can be decimated over longer time intervals to reduce network bandwidth, the AQ metrics are intended for longer statistical measures and would normally be enabled for intervals in the range of once a minute, as an example. The time interval over which an air quality metric is computed is referred to as an AQ update interval.","The following is the exemplary list of spectrum AQ metrics.","Maximum Power: Derived from the SA STATs, this may be the maximum power measurement in any bin for the specified frequency range or channel of interest. Alternatively, it may be the maximum power in a defined channel or frequency range over multiple FFT cycles that span a given time interval.","Average Power: Derived from the SA STATs, this is the average of average power measurement across all bins for the specified frequency range or channel of interest. Average power may be the logarithmic average power derived from the SA STATS, or it may be an RMS average power in a channel or frequency range derived from SA STATS or from computations performed on data captured by the snapshot buffer in the SAgE.","Duty Cycle: For all pulses that overlap the channel, it is the measure of the time that 1 or more pulses are present divided by the time spent monitoring the specified frequency range or channel of interest (normalized for overlap of dwell with frequency range or channel). A configurable IFS setting can be used to approximate impact on CSMA-CA protocols, such as 802.11. This extends the pulse durations for a configured additional back off time, before treating the channel as inactive.","Pulses Per Second: For all pulses that overlap the specified frequency range or channel of interest, this is the total number of pulses divided by the time spent monitoring this channel or frequency range (normalized for overlap of dwell with the channel or frequency range).","Average Pulse Duration: For all pulses that overlap the specified frequency range or channel of interest, this is the average of the pulse durations.","An AQ stream request can specify up to 32 frequency ranges to take measurements over, an IFS value (described for duty cycle), and a bitmap of requested metrics.","To summarize, each sensor's AQ measurements will consist of the following statistics for each configured frequency range (over a period of time longer than that provided by the SA STATs):","SAGE-based:\n\n","Protocol Analysis Based:","Percentage of 802.11 retries (packet resends)","Average 802.11 data rate selection (simply referred to as Average Data Rate). This may be an average data rate derived from the data rate that a sensor observes WLAN traffic to be moving from the sensor's monitoring of over the air WLAN packets. For example, if in a particular AQ update interval (e.g., 20 seconds) three client STAs were detected accessing the WLAN at 54 Mbps for a total of 30 ms and two client STAs accessing the WLAN at 6 Mbps for a total of 20 ms, then the average data rate selection would be (54*30 ms+6*20 ms)\/50 ms=34.8 Mbps.","Number of 802.11 Client Stations (STAs) Detected","Sensors will send a continual background air quality statistic stream to the server to be continuously stored in the database. In the case of the protocol portion of the air quality statistics, the server computes the noted statistics from the packet analysis data produced by the protocol engine  in the sensor. The use and analysis of the air quality data is described further hereinafter. A user may configure the frequency band of interest and air quality metrics to be streamed to the server for continuous storage (and ultimate display).","The classification engine  classifies\/identifies signals occurring in the frequency based on the output of the SAGE . Examples of signals that the classification engine  may identify include Bluetooth\u2122 signals, microwave oven signals, cordless telephones, wireless headsets, radar, etc., signals that would interference with operation of a WLAN. Techniques for signal classification are described in greater detail in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/246,364, filed Sep. 18, 2002, entitled \u201cSystem and Method for Signal Classification of Signals in a Frequency Band\u201d; U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/420,362, filed Apr. 22, 2003, entitled \u201cSystem and Method for Classifying Signals Occurring in a Frequency Band\u201d; and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/628,603, filed Jul. 28, 2003, entitled \u201cSystem and Method for Classifying Signals Using Timing Templates, Power Templates and Other Techniques.\u201d The classification engine  may generate events (at a configurable update rate) associated with identified signals and may further make a generalized air quality analysis of the frequency band given the type of signals determined to be occurring in the frequency band.","There are several types of classification events that indicate why a message has been sent. These types include the following.","Up: A device has been detected, and has met some minimal confidence level. The measurements include all pulses received until the record is generated.","Down: A device is no longer detectable. This may result because the device has stopped transmitting, its transmissions are below the sensor's detection sensitivity, the template has been unloaded, or monitoring of the band has been cancelled. The measurements include all pulses since the last event record for this instance, and under some cases there may have been no pulses since the last record.","Periodic Update: Since an instance may persist for an extended period of time and the measurements may vary over that interval, the SMC can be directed to produce periodic measurement records. The measurements include all pulses since the last event record for this instance.","The following fields may be present in a classification event record.","Timestamp: This provides a reference timestamp for the classification event.","Instance ID: This is a unique ID assigned to each new instance as it is classified. It can be used to match Update and Down events with the matching Up event.","Template ID: This identifies the template used to classify the device. This implies the name, version, and framework ID to the server.","Event Type: This is one of the event types, listed above.","Confidence Level: This is a number from 0 to 100, used to indicate confidence of the classification.","Average Power: This is the average energy measured across all pulses measured in this record.","Examples of the statistics and events output by the measurement engine  and classification engine  are described hereinafter.","The location engine  in the sensor is responsible for capturing received signal data that is used to compute the location of devices operating in a space in which the sensors are positioned. Many location or position techniques are known in the art, such as time of arrival (TOA), time difference of arrival (TDOA), power of arrival (POA) or received signal strength (RSS). The location engine  makes measurements on received signals (from the device to be located and perhaps from another sensor device) and sends those computations to the server  where the location computation is made. For example, the location engine  may be employed to process data based on received signals from 802.11 devices (clients or APs) in order to locate their positions, as well as other non-802.11 devices operating in the relevant frequency band(s) and which would potentially interfere with 802.11 communication protocol activity. In so doing, the location engine  negotiates access to the snapshot buffer of the SAGE (to capture raw received signal data) by sending a request to the measurement engine . The protocol engine  captures data pertaining to packets transmitted over the air in accordance with a communication protocol, such as the IEEE 802.11 WLAN protocols. This data is referred to as protocol analysis data, and is useful to indicate the performance of communication occurring according to the communication protocol The baseband signal processor section of the sensor  may operate in a \u201cpromiscuous mode\u201d by which it can receive packets sent by any device on a particular 802.11 channel (but may not have access to the content of packets). In this manner, the sensor can develop statistics about the type of packets being sent, the volume of packet traffic, packet retransmissions, intruding APs or STAs, etc. Upon receiving a packet, the protocol engine  collects statistics on the packet on a per channel, per device or per BSSID basis. Then, it applies a configurable (user-defined) filter to the packet for purposes of generating statistics. If the filter passes the packet, it is sent to the server for further processing, otherwise it is bit bucketed. For example, the filter may be configurable with a Boolean expression of packet characteristics. Examples of the statistics and events output by the protocol engine  are described hereinafter. The protocol engine  is responsive to a service configuration (Config) message from the server to configure how to capture and report protocol information. In addition, the protocol engine  performs functions to support location determination of other devices, such as scheduling the transmission of a reference packet that is used in TDOA location computations.","The protocol engine  configures the process by which the sensor scans 802.11 channels to obtain packet information. The channel scan parameters may include channel selection, dwell time on the channel, hop pattern between channels, measurement intervals, etc.","Finally, the protocol engine  configures criteria for protocol-based asynchronous alerts associated with network performance or security, or sensor operational conditions according to corresponding threshold based alarm criteria. Examples of techniques useful for protocol-based intrusion detection and address spoofing are described in the paper entitled \u201cLayer 2 Analysis of WLAN Discovery Applications for Intrusion Detection,\u201d Joshua Wright, Nov. 18, 2002, and in the paper entitled \u201cDetecting Wireless LAN MAC Address Spoofing,\u201d Joshua Wright, Jan. 21, 2003.","The capabilities of the sensor  shown in  may be incorporated into a client device, such as an 802.11 WLAN client device that may be a mobile device in the sense that it may move about a space. For example, the client device may be a laptop computer, wireless voice-over-IP phone, etc. The term \u201cclient\u201d is to denote a device that is a \u201cclient\u201d with respect to a WLAN AP. Other terms for this type of device may be a remote device (unit or station) or mobile device, whereas an AP may also be called a base device, unit or station. In this case, the traffic monitoring section  would handle all 802.11 communications, and the spectrum monitoring section  would handle the real-time spectrum analysis, together with the processor  which would handle the software functions described above for measurement, classification, location, etc. Alternatively, the spectrum monitoring section  and traffic section  may share the same radio. A client station so equipped can generate spectrum measurement data (signal classification, pulse events, pulse histograms, stream spectrum analysis statistics, and air quality statistics) based on the RF environment it experiences as it moves about.","The Server Software","Again, with reference to , the high level services  of the server  will now be described.","The database  provides physical storage of spectrum information, events, protocol information and related information generated by the sensors. In addition, the database  maintains configuration information pertaining to the functions in the server  and many functions in the sensors.","Discovery","The discovery manager  in the server processes data pertaining to the discovery of new devices operating in the frequency band, such as 802.11 and other devices, and the physical location of those devices. Discovery involves handling reports from sensors concerning the up (and new) and down state of such devices. Also, multiple sensors may see the same 802.11 device coming up. The discovery manager  detects and suppresses the duplicate event. A discovery event associated with an 802.11 device may fall into one of the following classes: ours, known others, new and rogue. To this end, the discovery manager  may maintain a list of authorized APs and STAs so that when a new device is detected by a sensor, the discovery manager  can determine whether or not it is authorized. Alternatively, the security manager, described hereinafter, could be the software process that maintains the list of authorized devices and determines the status of newly discovered devices.","Similarly, the discovery manager  also processes data pertaining to known and unknown interferers and handles associated events including up, down, new, and duplicate suppression. The sensors report on new known and unknown interferer devices. Also, multiple sensors may see the same known and unknown interferer device coming up and the discovery manager suppresses the duplicate event.","The discovery manager  executes a scan policy. When a new device is discovered and is in the management domain of the server, a request is made to the location manager  to determine the location of the device.","Finally, the discovery manager  handles event-action association. Given an event (e.g., when a new AP comes up), the discovery manager  initiates one or a series of actions (i.e., check whether the server should manage that device, and if so, locate it, etc.).","Performance","The performance manager  manages performance issues concerning the operation of wireless networks under the domain of the server in the shared frequency band. One such function is based on the air quality analysis by which the performance manager  may indicate to the user overall network and spectrum air quality.","The performance manager  may include a threshold crossing alarm (TCA) manager that manages performance issues concerning the operation of wireless networks under the domain of the server in the shared frequency band. TCAs are user-definable warnings that indicate when RF and\/or 802.11 protocol activity have reached levels that may negatively impact performance of a WLAN in the shared frequency band. One such function is to process the air quality data from the sensors. The TCA manager sets a variety of thresholds which, if crossed, generates alarms, called threshold crossing alarms. For example, an alarm may be generated if an AP has too many associated STAs, etc. A user can configure the server to generate an event when certain statistics cross a user-defined threshold level. Each TCA may have two numbers associated with it: a high threshold and a low threshold. The alarm is generated when the value first goes above the high threshold value. The alarm is cleared when the value goes below the low threshold value. The use of two levels helps to prevent oscillation of the alarm condition.","TCAs may be provided for the following Air Quality metrics:\n\n","In addition, TCAs may involve logical combinations of conditions from the above statistics. For example, a TCA could be set on Duty Cycle>X AND Pulses>Y. In addition, a user can specify a list of sensors to which the TCAs apply.","Likewise, a user can configure the system to generate spectrum alert events when (1) a pulse event occurs at a user-specified bandwidth, duration, power and\/or center frequency, or (2) a user defined spectral mask is exceeded. The spectrum alert may be triggered up to 20 times, and then will require retriggering by the user (to prevent any accidental flooding of events). Several independent spectrum alerts may be specified.","By combining spectrum and protocol analysis data, along with signal classification data from the sensors and TCAs (calculated internally by the server), the system can provide a continuous, real-time log of all RF events affecting the network. Alerts generated by the server may identify new RF devices in the WLAN environment, including both network (802.11) and non-network devices (typically interferers, such as cordless headphones, microwave ovens, etc.). Alerts may also be generated when devices are down (i.e., no longer connected to the network, or no longer impacting the network). Alerts can be sent by e-mail (to alert off-site network administrators) when mission critical RF events are detected. Alerts can also generate SNMP traps.","Security","The security manager  in the server is responsible for managing security of one or more wireless networks operating in the frequency band under its domain. One type of security function is rogue AP detection. In rogue AP detection, a user can specify which APs are inside a security perimeter of the server and are authorized to operate in that security perimeter based on IP or MAC address. Sensors report the APs and STAs that they detect. The security manager  processes these reports and determines whether an AP that is not authorized to operate inside the security perimeter has been detected. If so, then the security manager  generates an alarm indicating the presence of a rogue AP. A sensor detects the presence of an AP. The security manager  has the responsibility to declare that the detected AP is a rogue.","A client application (user) can specify the parameters of the security perimeter. The security manager  configures the security perimeter accordingly, which may be a polygon or volume region specified by the user. Inside this perimeter are the devices that the user wants to protect. The security manager  may generate an alert when a device physically located outside the security perimeter accesses a WLAN that is located inside the security perimeter. Conversely, the security manager  may generate an alert when a device physically located inside the security perimeter accesses or sends data to a device outside the security perimeter or associates with an AP outside the security perimeter. Moreover, a client user can give a particular device operating within the domain of the server a \u201cfixed location attribute.\u201d The security manager  detects whenever that \u201cfixed location\u201d device moves and reports it or generates an alert.","The security manager  may also use trend information to detect \u201csuspicious\u201d protocol usage. A sequence of packets that meets certain filter characteristics might be deemed to be suspicious. For example, suspicious activity may be alerted when a sensor detects repeated attempts to associate with an AP using different MAC addresses. Alternatively, something more subtle that may be deemed suspicious is if a sensor detects packets from a particular STA that have non-sequential sequence numbers, potentially suggesting that a device user is masquerading as a particular STA. Another example is a probe packet that matches a signature of a well-known piece of hacker software such as NetStumbler. These types of activities need to be monitored at the sensor, since it requires examination of detailed packet traces. The security manager  responds to suspicious protocol activity reports sent by sensors.","The low level services  will now be described in more detail.","RF","The RF manager  is responsible for aggregating and logging signal classification events from the classification engine  in a sensor , and for aggregating and logging spectrum statistics and air quality data from the measurement engine . The RF manager  may also supply new or update existing classification templates or reference files to each sensor that the classification engine uses to classify RF signals.","Location","The location manager  in the server handles the location processing to determine a location of a device operating in the frequency band. Location of a device (WLAN or interferer) can be a driving point for other analysis, particularly, security analysis. The location manager  selects a group of sensors (e.g., 4 sensors) for a location measurement operation to locate a particular device. Each location operation usually needs several sensors working in concert. The location manager  selects the subset sensors to be used in a location operation. An example of a location process using time difference of arrival techniques is disclosed in commonly assigned and U.S. application Ser. No. 10\/409,563, filed Apr. 8, 2003 referred to above. An example of a RSS location process is described in commonly assigned and U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/582,317, filed Jun. 23, 2004, entitled \u201cSystem and Method for Locating Radio Emitters Using Self-Calibrated Interpolated Path Loss Computation.\u201d The entirety of these prior applications is incorporated herein by reference. Many other TOA, TDOA, RSS and other location techniques are known in the art. The location manager  dispatches location request messages to each of the sensors that are to be part of the location operation. Each sensor generates TDOA or RSS information with respect to their respective receipt of the signals from the target device to be located and sends this information in a message to the location manager . The location manager  performs the final calculations from the TDOA or RSS information to compute the location of the device that is the subject of the location request. The location manager  may have a configurable retry policy for a failed location operation.","Protocol","The protocol manager  in the server is responsible for logging the captured packets by the various sensors into a log file for later processing. There may be a time sync difference between sensors. Different sensors come up (power up) at different times and do not have a concrete time of day concept. They have a notion of ticks with respect to which the server software needs to normalize. For example, sensor 's tick  may represent the same instance of time as sensor 's tick number . The protocol manager software accounts for such skews.","The protocol manager  may also provide aggregate packet statistic streams to a requesting client application. The protocol manager  synchronizes the packet arrival from different sensors into a common time line. That is, packets captured at the same time in two different sensors may reach the server at a certain time skew. The protocol manager  ensures that this time skew does not affect the packet traces. The protocol manager  also detects when multiple sensors may see the same packet and report it to the server and remove the duplicate packet.","A set of filters may be used to configure background and real-time filtering of packets (as well as configuring the size of the background log) and are executed by the protocol manager .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0114","num":"0124"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":"5000"},"In step , the server receives a continual background data stream from each sensor of spectrum and protocol analysis data to be stored in persistent storage. The data will have a configurable refresh rate (e.g., once per second). In step , the server continuously stores the streaming data from the sensors, and display of the data in real-time may be made available to a console application in step .","If and when an event occurs, such as an interference event, TCA event, etc., in step  the server stores\/marks the time of occurrence of the event and the sensor(s) associated with the event. Later, as shown by step , upon a user command from a console or other GUI application, the stored streaming data associated in time with the event may be played back (as if occurring in real-time) for display. An example of a TCA event is an air quality statistic crossing a threshold.","Examples of the background streaming spectrum analysis data that may be displayed in real-time (live) and in a time-shift mode are:","Power vs. Frequency data for the frequency band, such as average power, duty cycle and maximum power.","Pulse histograms for one or more of center frequency, bandwidth, duration, time between pulses (gap), power and number of pulses.","The air quality statistics described above may also displayed in real-time (live) and in a time-shift mode.

For example, a user can select one of the several Air Quality metrics, such as average power. A user can select which sensor is the source of the metrics, which frequency band or frequency range the metric is to be derived for, and the degree of aggregation. The server collects data from all sensors, all 802.11 channels, and collects the data continuously over time. The server software maintains records of cumulative data, such as RF activity across all (or specified) channels, or interferers detected by all (or specified) sensors across the enterprise. Additional plots (up to 4 as an example) of any of the aforementioned statistics, Air Quality metrics, etc., may be displayed in the data window space  from any sensor. For example, there are plots shown at reference numeral  for a variety of pulse histograms.","Other metrics or data that may be selected from any sensor for display include:","Examples of the plots are:\n\n","The air quality plots display air quality as a function of time. Air quality is determined by combining values for one or more spectrum and\/or protocol measurements. For example, an air quality measurement based only on spectrum properties might be based strictly on the average RF power, or it might be based on RF power plus the number of pulses per second. The higher the values\u2014the more RF power, and the more pulses per second\u2014the lower the overall RF air quality. An air quality measurement based on 802.11 protocol parameters might include average data rate selection, and percentage of frame retries. In this case, higher data rates are good, but higher frame retries indicates performance problems, so the server creates an aggregate measurement reflecting the overall quality.","Real-time and historical plots of air quality data may be displayed in several simultaneous plot windows. For each plot window, a user can select the air quality statistic (those described above) to be plotted. Each plot window may support a number of traces. For each trace, the user may select and configure which sensor the air quality data is to be sourced from, the frequency range, a set of 802.11 BSSIDs if appropriate, and the color of the trace. In addition to selecting a single sensor and frequency range, a user may be able to select aggregated statistics (average, max, min) across frequency ranges for a given sensor, or across sensors, or both.","Examples are:\n\n","Average pulse duration for all frequency ranges and all sensors.","For plots that may be displayed in the data window space , there are controls to select how those plots are displayed.","Change Time Scale.

The Jump-to-Time control may support the ability to jump to an explicitly entered time-value, Go Live or Navigate by Event. Navigation by event involves jumping to the time associated with a particular event of interest. When the Jump to Time button is selected, a display of a calendar is brought up allowing a user to select a particular day as well as time of day to begin playback of plots and related data. After the requested jump to a particular time, the Air View will be in a \u201cstopped\u201d state, plot controls will display data for the \u201ccurrent time position\u201d (that is, the selected time, called T0). Hitting the Play button begins time-shifted data playback from that selected point in time.

For example, an alarm to be triggered when the average RF Power exceeds a certain amount, and when the maximum RF Power exceeds a certain amount. In this case, the alarm is triggered only when both criteria are met. As another example, an alarm may be triggered when the average Data Rate falls below a certain value, or when the number of 802.11 Packet Retries per second exceeds a certain value. In this case, the alarm is triggered when either (or both) of the trigger criteria are met. Trigger criteria can be connected by the logical relations of AND, OR, and NOT.","A given threshold (Upper Threshold or Lower Threshold) has both an Enter Value and an Exit Value.","Enter Value\u2014The value which actually triggers the alarm to an \u201con\u201d condition. For a composite alarm, the Enter value determines when one particular threshold criteria is valid, or active. (Whether or not the alarm as a whole is triggered is determined by the other thresholds in the Alarm as well, and of course by events in the RF environment.)","Exit Value\u2014The value which turns the trigger off. For a composite alarm, the Exit value determines when one particular threshold is no longer valid, or no longer active. (Whether or not the alarm as a whole is turned off is determined by the other thresholds in the Alarm as well, and of course by events in the RF environment.) Separate Enter and Exit values prevent an alarm from being in a state of oscillation.","The Enter and Exit values should be close enough that they both reflect a major change in an RF environment (such as too many packet retransmissions).

An information technology (IT) administrator may use the system to help perform day-to-day management of his\/her wireless systems. The IT administrator can use the system in two in a \u201cfirefighting\u201d mode and a \u201cplanning\u201d mode.","In the firefighting mode, examples of tasks are to identify (and alert on) problems in the RF environment and diagnose the problem as quickly as possible. The IT administrator would configure threshold crossing alarm alerts to provide pop-ups, emails, traps, etc., in response to alarm conditions. Also, an event log and air quality plots would be provided.","Typically, the system will be operating in the background. In some cases, the IT administrator may have the console up and running, with a set of air quality plots showing the overall state of the system at all times, so that he\/she may glance at them periodically.","In other cases, the IT administrator may not have the console up and running at all, or, it may be iconified. When a problem occurs (e.g., significant threshold event, new interferer detected, etc.), the system will alert the IT administrator immediately. The alert may be a pop-up bubble on his console, an SNMP trap to a higher level management system, or an email (which can be connected to a pager system).","The IT administrator has the ability to configure threshold levels and event types that generate alerts. The key concept is that he be able to optimize the configuration over time to be notified only when something is actually wrong (i.e., eliminate false alarms) and before the problem has progressed too far that there is serious service degradation in the network.","Once the problem occurs, the IT administrator goes into action to determine the cause of the problem. If the console is not already open, at this point he\/she opens the console. Through a combination of the event log and the air data window, the administrator can quickly ascertain the nature and cause of the problem. If the solution to the problem is not obvious (e.g., remove the interfering device), he may turn to a person who is an RF expert to help him arrive at a solution using the system.","In planning mode, the administrator uses the system to analyze data to expose latent issues and to analyze trends for issues over time. In this mode, the administrator may use reports and air quality plots. The administrator can run reports that include performance statistics useful to spot latent problems. For example, it may be the case that performance is slowing down 50% due to interference from a microwave oven at lunch time, but the problem has not been reported because it is difficult to detect at the user level. The administrator can also run reports that look at trends of statistics over time. For example, the number of retries on 802.11 channel 1 may be 20% one month, but was 10% the prior month, and 5% in the month prior. This trend information points to a problem that may be getting worse over time, and that will become serious in a month or two.","An RF expert uses the system as a remote 24\u00d77 spectrum analysis tool. This person is most likely available for installations where the wireless system is considered mission critical. An RF expert has a detailed RF understanding and is familiar with traditional spectrum analyzers. In addition, this person may have a detailed understanding of wireless network systems. The RF expert may investigate reported events at the raw RF level. He\/she may review raw RF data for cases that are not identified\/classified by the system and confirm that recommended solutions have alleviated the problem. The RF Expert may use the detailed spectrum analyzer capabilities to confirm and\/or supplement the intelligence capabilities built into the system. For example, if the system reports that a video interference signal is occurring, he\/she may wish to view the power vs. frequency plots to confirm that it is not some other type of device. In addition, in cases the system does not recognize the interference the RF expert may examine the spectrum analysis data to make an assessment. The time shift mode is useful in cases where the problem is intermittent, or was a single event that occurred in the past (e.g., over a weekend) so that the RF Expert can see the spectrum plots that occurred at the time of interest.","Another use of the spectrum analyzer capabilities is to confirm when a problem has been fixed by corrective action. When a fix has been attempted, the IT department cannot afford to wait until the next day to see that no problem alerts re-surface. The RF expert can use the spectrum analyzer functions to perform before and after comparisons that confirm a fix (ex. Shielding added to an interference device) has indeed fixed the problem.","A network operations center (NOC) operator uses the system to perform monitoring and diagnosis of RF wireless systems at remote sites. Examples include WLAN hotspot service providers, or RF contract houses. Unlike the IT administrator case, the NOC typically employs people whose sole job is to monitor the system full time. In this case the air quality plots may be up and running 24\u00d77, and are constantly being viewed to spot problems and trends. When an operator notices a problem or concern, he\/she drills down into different views of the data to see more about the problem.","To summarize, a method is provided for presenting data related to activity occurring in a frequency band, comprising steps of continuously storing data derived from energy received in a frequency band over time; and presenting the data to a user.
