title: System and method for generating 'snapshot's of learning objects
abstract: A system for generating a ‘snapshot’ of a learning object is provided. An interface receives a target object and a user identification number. The target object corresponds to a category, comprising a plurality of sentences and multimedia data, wherein the sentences comprise at least one keyword. A learning object database comprises a plurality of learning objects and a user's historical learning record. Each of the learning objects corresponds to at least one category, and comprises at least one keyword. The user's historical learning record comprises a track record of learning objects used corresponding to the user identification number. A script preview unit selects at least one of the sentences of the target object according to the user's historical learning record corresponding to the user identification number. A multimedia preview unit selects one of the multimedia data of the target object, wherein the selected multimedia data is highly related to the selected sentence. A ‘snapshot’ generator generates a ‘snapshot’ of the target object by combining the selected sentence and the selected multimedia data, and directs a display device to display the ‘snapshot’.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The invention relates to data processing, and in particular to systems and methods for generating a \u2018snapshot\u2019 of a learning object.","This section is intended to introduce the reader to various aspects of art, which may be related to various aspects of the present invention, which are described and\/or claimed below. This discussion is believed to be helpful in providing the reader with background information to facilitate a better understanding of the various aspects of the present invention. Accordingly, it should be understood that these statements are to be read in this light, and not as admissions of prior art.","Many learning resource databases provide Application Programming Interface (API) for other website access, and use SQI (Simple Query Interface) to define an interface to facilitate cross-site search operations.","Generally, cross-site search operations locate large amounts of learning objects, and description of these learning objects does not provide adequate information to meet user requirements.","According to a conventional method, a provider of a learning object can generate a \u2018snapshot\u2019 of the learning object by composing an abstract of the learning object, and combining the abstract with pictures pertinent to the learning object.","The conventional method, however, is inconvenient for the provider of the learning object. In addition, the \u2018snapshot\u2019 is composed from the viewpoint of the provider. Accordingly, contents of the \u2018snapshot\u2019 do not provide adequate information for a user to determine whether he\/she is interested in the learning object. Even though the learning object has a \u2018snapshot\u2019, it is still inconvenient for a user to use it.","Hence, there is a need for a method and system for generating a \u2018snapshot\u2019 of a learning object better addressing the problems arising from the existing technology.","Certain aspects commensurate in scope with the originally claimed invention are set forth below. It should be understood that these aspects are presented merely to provide the reader with a brief summary of certain forms the invention might take and that these aspects are not intended to limit the scope of the invention. Indeed, the invention may encompass a variety of aspects that may not be set forth below.","A system for generating a \u2018snapshot\u2019 of a learning object is provided. The system for generating a \u2018snapshot\u2019 of a learning object comprises an interface, a learning object database, a script preview unit, a multimedia preview unit, and a \u2018snapshot\u2019 generator. The interface receives a target object and a user identification number. The target object corresponds to a category, comprising a plurality of sentences and multimedia data, wherein the sentences comprise at least one target object keyword. The learning object database comprises a plurality of learning objects and a user's historical learning record. Each of the learning objects corresponds to at least one category and comprises at least one learning object keyword. The user's historical learning record comprises a track record of learning objects used corresponding to the user identification number. The script preview unit selects at least one of the sentences of the target object as a preview sentence according to the user's historical learning record corresponding to the user identification number. The multimedia preview unit selects one of the multimedia data of the target object as a preview multimedia data, wherein the selected multimedia data is highly related to the selected sentence. The \u2018snapshot\u2019 generator generates a \u2018snapshot\u2019 of the target object by combining the preview sentence and the preview multimedia data, and directs a display device to display the \u2018snapshot\u2019.","Also provided is a method for generating a \u2018snapshot\u2019 of a learning object. A target object is received. The target object corresponds to a category.

Each of the learning objects corresponds to at least one category and comprises at least one learning object keyword. The user's historical learning record comprises a track record of learning objects used corresponding to the user identification number. At least one of the sentences of the target object is selected as a preview sentence according to the user's historical learning record corresponding to the user identification number. One of the multimedia data of the target object is selected as a preview multimedia data, wherein the selected multimedia data is highly related to the selected sentence. A \u2018snapshot\u2019 of the target object is generated by combining the preview sentence and the preview multimedia data. The \u2018snapshot\u2019 is then displayed.","One or more specific embodiments of the invention are described below.
