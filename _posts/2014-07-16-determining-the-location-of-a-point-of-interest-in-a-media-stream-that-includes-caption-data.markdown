title: Determining the location of a point of interest in a media stream that includes caption data
abstract: A method and computing device for determining the location of a point of interest in a media stream. The method receives an order of duplication for a media stream and a sequence of caption data strings associated with the media stream. The method computes a hash value for a selected string in the sequence. The hash value representing the selected string, and a number of strings in the sequence that immediately precede the selected string, where the order of duplication determines the number of strings. The method receives a media stream time for the selected string based on the hash value, and determines a time at a point of interest in the media stream relative to the media stream time for the selected string.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/534,145, filed Jun. 27, 2012, and entitled, \u201cDETERMINING THE LOCATION OF A POINT OF INTEREST IN A MEDIA STREAM THAT INCLUDES CAPTION DATA,\u201d the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference.","Television for long has been a known conversation starter. People love to watch television and movies and enjoy discussing at length their favorite shows. The advent of social media has given a new dimension to these conversations that were previously restricted to the dinner table or office. The recent phenomena of \u201ctweeting\u201d and updating status via Facebook have taken television-oriented conversations, as well as all other conversations, to a new level. Conversationalists enjoy talking about a television show or movie not only after the event, but also while watching it. This preference continues whether the conversationalists are located in same house or networked across great distances. All corporations that want to participate in this idea are coming up with new \u201csocializing strategies\u201d in such scenarios. One such strategy uses a dedicated server that connects group of viewers on a network and allows each viewer to update the content that the user is currently viewing on a television connected to a set-top box. Other strategies use social media products that allow each viewer to tag content via the set-top box or even comment on the content via the set-top box at various points during a live or recorded media stream.","Although some conventional solutions allow a viewer to post social media comments on the content (e.g., movie, or television show) via a computing device other than a set-top box, these solutions associate the viewer's comments with the entire content. There is a need for a system that allows the viewer to instantly post, and later read, comments or updates of the currently viewed content via social media based on a specific scene in the content. Such a system would allow the viewer to provide instant viewer comments or updates during the viewing of a live or recorded media stream.","Nevertheless, some conventional solutions do not provide the capability of determining absolute content position from the start of content while the consumer is watching it. In other words, to enable a viewer to post a comment based on a scene in the content, a system needs to be able to determine the exact location\u2014position, and time from the start of the content\u2014of any particular scene in the content. If a system can determine the exact location of a scene relative to the start of content, then it would be possible to capture and store the viewer's comment and then later present those scene specific social media updates and tags to their social network. In addition, if such exact location is detectable then it opens the door for introducing other opportunities such as scene-specific or comment-based targeted advertisement that are accurately targeted to a viewer based on the scene viewed and comment introduced by that viewer.","When a customer's set-top box is decoding a media stream, the current metadata for the media stream does not indicate at what point of the original stream it is currently playing out the content. If the set-top box tunes to the content from the start of the program, it may be possible at the set-top box to determine how far the content has played from the start. However, if the set-top box tunes to the content at some time after the start of the program, then it is impossible for the set-top box to determine how far the current point of content is from the start of the content. In other words, it is only possible to know the current position of the content with respect to the tuned point of content and not with respect to the beginning of the content. Furthermore, from a service operator's point of view, it would be of great interest to know the current point of the content that is playing at the customer's set-top box, assuming the customer tunes and plays-out, or requests to perform a trick play of the content, during the playing of the content. , , and , described below, depict embodiments of this scenario and illustrate examples of why the time elapsed from the start of the content is not always useful for determining the location of a point of interest.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIG. 3","FIG. 4"],"b":["100","100","0","0","0"]},"Extraneous content is any type of content that is not part of the original, unadulterated media. The term \u201cextraneous content\u201d includes content such as advertisements, commentary on the original content, and the like. The presence of extraneous content will lengthen the original content and push a POI after the extraneous content farther away from the start of program. Thus, a POI after the extraneous content now appears at a time that is lengthened by the length of the extraneous content. In addition, the length and manner that extraneous content is added to an original content may vary from one service provider to another.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["210","0","0","210","215","215","220","0"]},"If the content streamed by a multi-service operator (MSO) did not have any extraneous content, such as advertisements, introduced in the original content then it would be possible to approximate the time of content by taking the difference between current time and the program start time included in the electronic program guide. However, the MSO may edit the original content before broadcast. In one embodiment, the MSO may edit the original content because of ratings consideration of a region. In such cases, a simple difference between current time and clock-based program start time is not sufficient to determine the absolute position of the content.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["300","300","0","0","0","300"]},"The identification of an absolute content position becomes even more challenging when the play-out of the content is from a local digital video recorder (DVR) with no program start time. In addition, when the customer requests a trick play during the play-out of the content, it becomes impossible to predict the current content position based on program start time available in the program guide.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["410","0","0","410","415","415","420","0"]},"Currently, set-top boxes and media players on devices such as mobile phones, tablets, notebooks, and desktop computers cannot detect unambiguously and uniquely the exact position of the playback of content. This problem is further exacerbated when the media stream is edited before delivery or includes extraneous content. The content may be streamed from any source such as a live media stream delivered on terrestrial, cable, or satellite, delivered via the Internet as IP packets, or delivered from a local media storage device such as a DVR. Moreover, there is no guarantee that the media stream played is an exact replica of the original content. Consequently, it is difficult to detect the exact content location based on metadata alone or simple observation points such as time since start of play.","Captioning is the process of converting the audio content of a television broadcast, webcast, film, video, CD-ROM, DVD, live event, or other productions into caption data and displaying the text component of the caption data on a screen, monitor, or other visual display system. Captions not only display words as the textual equivalent of spoken dialogue or narration, but also include speaker identification, sound effects, and music description. Closed captions (i.e., closed caption data) are captions that are encoded, or embedded, into the video and cannot be seen unless turned on using your television or set-top box menu. Open captions (i.e., open caption data) are always visible and cannot be turned off because they are burned directly into the video and are a part of the picture. Subtitling is the process of making the soundtrack of a video recognizable to viewers who do not understand the language of the spoken dialogue or viewers unable to hear the audio. Subtitles (i.e., subtitle data) may appear as translations to foreign languages from the spoken language or straight transcripts of the spoken language. Generally, captions are not distinguishable from subtitles. However, in the United States and Canada, the aim of subtitles is to describe to a viewer who can hear but cannot understand the language or accent of the dialogue and some on-screen text, whereas the aim of captions is to describe to the deaf and hard of hearing all significant spoken dialogue, non-speech information, music, or sound effects. The Electronic Industries Alliance EIA-608 standard describes the encoding of closed captions, also known as line 21 captions, for National Television System Committee (NTSC) analog television broadcasts in the United States and Canada. The Electronic Industries Alliance CEA-708 standard describes the encoding of closed captions for Advanced Television Systems Committee (ATSC) digital television broadcasts in the United States and Canada. Accordingly, the use herein of the terms \u201ccaption\u201d, \u201ccaptioning\u201d, \u201csubtitle\u201d, and \u201csubtitling\u201d are synonymous, at least in some respects, and are not limiting to the teachings herein.","Some conventional solutions use closed caption tags that include commands and control information that the set-top box processes. Other conventional solutions use enhanced metadata in a searchable index to identify content segments and corresponding timing information. All of these conventional solutions add data to the media stream and require the MSO to install additional hardware and software, or do not accommodate media streams that are edited by the MSO or include extraneous content.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["520","510","530","520","510","520","530","570","520","530","510","530","510","530","520"]},"The MSO cable headend  includes a video server , digital access controller (DAC) system , and closed caption data server .

The only exception when the order of duplication is greater than 1 is for dealing with the first caption data string of the content. Since there are no immediately preceding caption data strings, the closed caption data server  uses the \u201cnull\u201d string to generate the hash value. In one embodiment, the closed caption data server  only performs this two-pass method (as for this example, however typically a multi-pass method) once during the lifetime of the media stream stored in the closed caption data server .","The hash values generated for each entry in the closed caption file  are useful when comparing the incoming hash value from the client devices in order to unambiguously and uniquely identify the current location of the media stream.
