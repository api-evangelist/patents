title: Portable toilet seat adapter with an integrated carrying case
abstract: A portable toilet seat adapter () can size down a stationary toilet to a child size and also provide a sanitary barrier. The seat adapter () comprises a carrying case () and an open-front toilet seat () in a U-shape. The toilet seat () folds in a catty-corner position for size reduction and then folds into the carrying case (). Living hinges are rotatable hinges integrated in the toilet seat () so that the toilet seat () can be formed from a single molding. Also, living hinges are integrated between a lid () for rotation around a base () and the carrying case () can be formed from a single mold. Fasteners that close the carrying case () can also be living hinges and formed from the same single mold as the carrying case ().

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","I. Overview of a Portable Toilet Seat Adapter","II. Component Details of the Portable Toilet Seat Adapter"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of priority under 35 U.S.C. 119(e) to U.S. Application No. 62\/013,539, filed Jun. 18, 2014, entitled TRAVEL CHILD ADAPTER SEAT FOR RESTROOMS, by Linda Grant, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","The invention relates generally to a toilet seat adapter, and more specifically, to a portable toilet seat adapter with an integrated carrying case for use on a stationary toilet.","Parents and caretakers of children can have an unpleasant experience while potty training a toddler.","First, toilet seats are not adapted for the smaller body frame of toddlers. Without a smaller base, the child does not have proper support to the sides of a commode. Secondly, restrooms, and public restrooms in particular, are known to fester germs and viruses. Many currently available products carry the germs and viruses after use in various public restrooms. Moreover, many currently available products are not compactable in order to drastically reduce the size of the travel toilet, as carried. Additionally, currently available products that fold for a reduction in size are dangerous because a child's skin can get pinched in the hinges, for example, with screws.","It is desirable to overcome these shortcomings.","To meet the above-described needs, a portable toilet seat adapter with an integrated carrying case, and associated methods and methods of manufacture, are described.","In a first embodiment, a portable toilet seat adapter () comprises a carrying case () and an open-front toilet seat (). In an embodiment, the carrying case () includes a lid () having a front (A) and a rear (B), a base () having a front (A) and a rear (B), at least one fastener (A-C) that couples the lid rear (B) and to the base rear (B) to close the carrying case (), and a first living hinge () that rotatably couples the lid front (A) to the base front (A).","In another embodiment, an open-front toilet seat () in a U-shape, the open-front toilet seat () includes a front portion (A, A) having an open end of the U-shape and fitting over a corresponding front portion of the stationary toilet seat, a rear portion (B, B) having the closed end of the U-shape and fitting over a corresponding rear portion of the stationary toilet seat, a stationary hinge () to rotatably couple the rear portion (B, B) of the U-shape to the base () of the carrying case (), and at least a second living hinge (A, B) to allow the open-front toilet seat () to fold in a catty-corner position to fit into the carrying case () to close with the at least one fastener (A-C), the open-front toilet seat () being larger than the carrying case () when unfolded.","Advantageously, the travel potty protects children from germs and bacteria on public toilet seats. A compact size and light weight makes the travel potty easy to grab and carry on the go. Parent and caregivers no longer need to be stressed and anxious over how to accommodate a child in public when needing to use a restroom. Air vents can be popped open while the travel potty remains in a closed position, in order to prevent dampness and germs. A no pinch factor makes the travel potty safe for children to continue potty training. A glow in the dark version allows the travel potty to be easily located even in dark environments, such as the trunk of an automobile. A hook can be added to the case to allow the travel potty to open up vertically, for example, from the door hook on a nearby door or wall. The travel potty is composed of sanitary, antiviral material. Therefore, adults can use a standard sized travel potty for sanitary reasons alone. These are just exemplary advantages and configurations.","A portable toilet seat adapter with an integrated carrying case \u201ctravel potty\u201d, and associated methods and methods of manufacture, are described herein in further detail. The travel potty can be used to adapt commercial or home toilet stationary toilet seats of various shapes. Conveniently, the travel potty has a folding seat that can be folded to fit within a compact carrying case that is integrally attached to the folding seat. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize variations of the examples given within, that are within the scope of the disclosure.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 1A","FIG. 1B","FIG. 1C","FIG. 1C"],"b":["100","100","105","120","105","110","130","120","110","130","120","110","120","130","114","110","115","110","130","112","130","100","100"]},"Furthermore, a living hinge formed from a single mold enables rotation without having separate parts that can pinch a child.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 2A","b":["100","100","105","100","120","125","125","122","124","122","124","105","120"]},"In some embodiments, the folding seat  in some embodiments is sized for a child and in other embodiment is standard size.

The living hinge  is like an elbow by allowing rotation while being integral with the case bottom  by being cast from a single mold. In one embodiment, a pinch free (or no pinch factor) case bottom  is cast from a single mold such that the living hinges are part of the mold casting. Accordingly, a plastic molding includes plastic hinges. The integral hinges are safer because they do not pinch the skin of a child while in use. In further detail, the hinges have fewer degrees of freedom than separate, independent hinges which are not so constrained. An independent screw, rod or other component would have more degrees of freedom which in turn allows skin to roll into spaces between the hinges and pinch children.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 2C","b":["110","130","100","110","130","110","130","110","130","120","105","100"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 2D","b":["120","100","120"]},"In some embodiments, the folding seat  also includes seat handles for sanitary self-support.
