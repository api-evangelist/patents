{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENTAL INTEREST","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured, used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government.","The present invention relates generally to a simple, low-cost method and device for presenting a known amount of a volatile or semi-volatile chemical material to a chemical detector, thus enabling an end user to quickly verify that a chemical detector is functioning properly or to calibrate the chemical detector.","Commercial chemical vapor detectors are commonly used to identify the presence and quantity of specific chemicals. Some chemical detectors may, for example, pull a sample of ambient air into the detection system for analysis. Test samples with known composition are important for verifying that the chemical detectors are functioning properly. Methods and devices for verifying and calibrating such chemical detectors are necessary in a variety of industries, including the defense, homeland security, environmental monitoring, industrial monitoring and health related industries.","Known methods for generating well characterized gas concentration samples to test the chemical detectors are typically costly, time-consuming and difficult to use without prior experience. These traditional methods do not allow a user to test a chemical detector at a point of use where it is critical for a soldier or a first responder to ensure that chemical detectors are operational and will alarm in the presence of toxic chemical vapors.","In an exemplary embodiment of the invention there is provided a method for validating or calibrating a chemical detector at a point of use. The method may include presenting a device to the chemical detector, the device comprising a frangible container defining a predetermined volume and a chemical material sealed within the frangible container in a predetermined amount; and breaking the frangible container to release the chemical material for detection by the chemical detector.","Another embodiment provides a method for making a device to validate or calibrate a chemical detector at a point of use. The method may include supplying a predetermined amount of chemical material to a frangible container, the frangible container having first and second tubes coupled thereto at a first end, each of the first and second tubes having a second free end to define, a substantially u-shaped vessel. The method may include sealing the second free ends of the first and second tubes.","In another embodiment of the invention, a device for validating or calibrating a chemical detector at a point of use is provided. The device may include a frangible container defining a predetermined volume. A chemical material may be disposed within the frangible container in a predetermined amount. First and second tubes each having a first end may be coupled to the frangible container and a second free end to define a substantially u-shaped vessel. Each second end of the first and second tubes may be sealed.","This summary is provided merely to introduce certain concepts and not to identify any key or essential features of the claimed subject matter. Further features and advantages of the invention, as well as the structure and operation of various embodiments of the invention, are described in detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings.","Various embodiments of the invention are discussed herein. While specific embodiments are discussed, specific terminology is employed for the sake of clarity. However, the invention is not intended to be limited to the specific terminology so selected and it should be understood that this is done for illustration purposes only. A person skilled in the relevant art will recognize that other components and configurations can be used without parting from the spirit and scope of the invention defined by the claims. Each specific element includes all technical equivalents that operate in a similar manner to accomplish a similar purpose.","Referring now to the drawings, there is shown in  a cross-sectional diagram of the method for validating or calibrating a chemical detector at a point of use according to an embodiment of the invention. The method may include presenting a frangible container  to a chemical detector . The frangible container  may define a predetermined volume and a chemical material  may be sealed within the frangible container  in a predetermined amount. The frangible container , storing the chemical material , may be presented (see arrow ) to a sampling nozzle  of the chemical detector . One or more forces F may be applied to the frangible container  to rupture the frangible container  and release the chemical material . The chemical material  may trigger a threshold alarm level of the chemical detector . Thus, presenting the chemical material  in close proximity to the sampling nozzle  may allow for the validation or calibration of the chemical detector .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIGS. 3-6"],"b":["100","101","50","10","20","10","200","102","10","20","50","20","50","20","50"]},"According to an example embodiment shown in , the device may include a length of flexible tubing and the frangible container  may be disposed within the flexible tubing. According to this embodiment, the first step  of method  may include coupling an end of the flexible tubing to a sampling nozzle  of the chemical detector .","Alternatively, the method  of  may further include both the steps of inserting the device into a length of flexible tubing to cause the frangible container  to be disposed within the flexible tubing and coupling an end of the flexible tubing to a sampling nozzle  of the chemical detector .","According to another embodiment, following the second step , the released chemical material  may contact a wicking material (see ) surrounding the broken frangible container  to introduce chemical vapors to the chemical detector  for validation.","According to an example embodiment shown in , the device may include a first and second tube ,  each having a first end ,  coupled to the frangible container  and a second free end ,  to define a substantially u-shaped vessel. Each second end ,  may be sealed and the second step  of the method  may include squeezing the first and second tubes ,  together to rupture the frangible container  and release the chemical material . In this exemplary embodiment, the action of squeezing the first and second tubes ,  may shatter the frangible container , for example a thin glass bulb, whereas a simple small frangible container  alone may otherwise be difficult to break.","The predetermined amount of chemical material  may be sufficient to meet a threshold alarm level of the chemical detector . The ultimate accuracy of the method  may be largely determined by the volume measurement of the chemical material  introduced into the frangible container . The predetermined volume of the chemical material  may be a known amount of a well-analyzed sample. The volume measurement may also be sufficient to meet most accuracy requirements for field measurements.","In general, the method  may assure that target concentrations of materials are delivered within acceptable uncertainties, may provide for simple use, may be capable of delivering sub-nanoliter volumes of test chemicals, may be compatible with reactive and\/or semi-volatile liquids, may be low cost, and may provide a long lifetime of the chemical sample and the delivery device (for example, greater than 10 years).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIGS. 3-6","FIG. 3"],"b":["200","10","20","10","30","40","32","42","10","34","44","200","34","44","30","40"]},"The predetermined amount of chemical material  may be sufficient to meet a threshold alarm level of the chemical detector . Specific chemical materials , for example liquid solutions, may be optimized for the particular detector technology and alarm concentration levels. For example, to test a M4 JCAD chemical agent detector a dilute solution of methyl salicylate (i.e. a blister agent simulant for an ion mobility spectrometer) in methanol may be used to produce sufficient concentrations of methyl salicylate to trigger the chemical detector alarm.","According to an embodiment, the second end  of the second tube  may be tapered. The second end  may also be trimmed to include a small vent hole  prior to sealing. Dissimilarly, the first tube  may maintain a constant inner and outer diameter to serve as a passage for the supply of chemical material  to the frangible container  during manufacture.","According to another embodiment, the first and second tubes ,  may have an inner diameter large enough to prevent the chemical material  from remaining in the first or second tubes ,  by capillary action. For example, the first and second tubes ,  may each be about 2.5 centimeters long and the inner and outer diameters may be about 0.1 centimeters and 0.2 centimeters, respectively.","According to an embodiment, the frangible container  may be glass to give chemical stability to the system. For example, the frangible container  may be an approximately spherical glass bulb. According to a further embodiment, the predetermined volume of the frangible container  may be approximately 50 micro-liters with a wall thickness of approximately 0.1 millimeters.","According to one embodiment, the predetermined amount of the chemical material  may be between approximately 5 micro-liters and 100 micro-liters. For applications which require the use of sub-nanoliter volumes, dilution of the liquid sample in an appropriate solvent may be a potential approach. According to one example, the predetermined amount of the chemical material  may be approximately 20 micro-liters and may fill a frangible container  having a predetermined volume of approximately 50 micro-liters.","According to another embodiment, the chemical material  may be a liquid chemical material or a gaseous material. Stated another way, any liquid chemical, or mixture of liquid chemicals, having a sufficient vapor pressure to produce the desired concentrations to trigger a threshold alarm level of the chemical detector may be used as the chemical material . For example, the chemical material  may be a volatile or semi-volatile chemical material or compound.","Examples of liquid chemical materials may include, but are not limited to, methanol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, iso-butyl alcohol, acetone, acetonitrile, benzaldehyde, benzene, toluene, xylene, carbon tetrachloride, carbon disulfide, dimethyl sulfide, mercury, bromine, iso-butyl mercaptan, chloroform, dimethyl methyl phosphonate, dichloromethane, dimethyl disulfide, ethyl benzene, ethyl chloride, ethyl mercaptan, ethyl methyl sulfide, hexane, hydrazine, methyl iodide, iso-propyl alcohol, propylene oxide, isopropyl mercaptan, thiophene, water, acrolein, acrylonitrile, etc.","Examples of gaseous chemical materials may include, but are not limited to, Ammonia, arsine, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, chlorine, hydrogen fluoride, freons, hydrogen sulfide, methyl bromide, methyl chloride, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, sulfur hexafluoride, boron trichloride, carbonyl sulfide, ethylene, ethylene oxide, hydrogen chloride, methane, nitric oxide, nitrous oxide, oxygen, phosgene, phosphine, vinyl chloride, hydrogen cyanide, cyanogens chloride, arsine, etc. In comparison to a liquid chemical material, a larger frangible container  may be required to contain a gaseous chemical material.","According to a further embodiment, the chemical material  may be a solid or semi-volatile solid chemical material if such solid material produces a sufficient vapor pressure to trigger a threshold alarm level of the chemical detector . Examples of solid chemical materials may include, but are not limited to, formaldehyde or phenol.","As shown in , if the chemical material  is a liquid chemical material, the device  may further include a wick material  surrounding the frangible container . The wick material  may be adapted to wick the liquid chemical material  after the first and second tubes ,  are squeezed together to break the frangible container  and release the liquid chemical material . The wick material  may provide a large surface area for evaporation of the chemical material . Additionally, the wick material may also be adapted to contain the broken fragments of the frangible container  after release of the liquid chemical container .","According to another embodiment, the device  may include a mesh material  surrounding the frangible container  to contain broken fragments of the frangible container  after release of the chemical material . For example, the mesh material  may be a polymer mesh. The wick material  and\/or mesh material  may surround the entire device , thus encasing both the frangible container  and first and second tubes , .","As shown in , the device  may include a length of flexible tubing . The frangible container  may be disposed within the flexible tubing  and the flexible tubing  may be configured to be attachable to a sampling nozzle  of a chemical detector . The flexible tubing  may be configured to ensure that the frangible container  is positioned in a consistent position and\/or proximity to the chemical detector . Such a configuration may aid in producing consistent detection and\/or calibration results.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["300","301","20","50","10","10","30","40","10","32","42","30","40","34","44","300","303","34","44","30","40","10"]},"According to one embodiment, the step  of supplying a predetermined amount of chemical material  to the frangible container  may occur through the first tube . This embodiment may include the additional step  of venting air from the frangible container  through an air vent  in the second tube  prior to sealing. The air vent  may be an opened, tapered or trimmed vent hole or aperture. The use of the first and second tubes ,  may enable the frangible container  to be sealed without significantly heating the chemical material , thus minimizing any potential loss of the chemical material . Further, use of the first and second tubes , , as described above, may alleviate pressure in the device  by allowing air and heat to vent during the sealing process to prevent the frangible container  from over-heating, cracking or breaking prior to use.","According to another embodiment, the step  of sealing includes sealing the second free end  of the first tube  and immediately thereafter sealing the second free end  of the second tube . This enables the device  to be quickly sealed and to maintain the exact predetermined amount of chemical material  supplied.","According to a further embodiment, the method  may include the step  of wrapping the frangible container  into at least one of a wicking material or a mesh material. Step  may occur before or after the step  of supplying chemical material  to the frangible container . Additionally, the method  may include the step  of inserting the frangible container  into a length of flexible tubing , such as that depicted in .","According to another embodiment, the method  may include the step (not shown) of making the frangible container  prior to step  of supplying chemical material  to the frangible container .","The various embodiments of the invention, as described above, may allow users of chemical detectors to quickly validate instruments with little preparation, equipment and training. Such chemical detectors may include, but are not limited to, nerve gas chemical detectors, chemical warfare agent detectors, toxic industrial chemical (TICS) detectors, general industrial gas detectors, etc. The device may be hand-held, miniaturized and light-weight to enable easy usage. Further, the device may be environmentally friendly and disposable after use in the field. The device for validating or calibrating a chemical detector at a point of use, as described above, may provide an inexpensive and technically simple alternative to many established methods for generating gas samples at specific levels.","While several embodiments of the invention are described above, it should be understood that the foregoing is presented by way of example only, and not limitation.
