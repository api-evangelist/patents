{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This document relates to electronic communication messaging.","Electronic communications, such as e-mail communications, have become prevalent in corporate, social, and other environments. Each electronic communication can include several components, such as addressing data, content data, and attachment data. The addressing data can specify one or more electronic addresses for one or more recipients. The content data can specify a subject of the electronic communication, and can include data related to the message, such as text data, image data, audio data, and video data. The attachment data can include files that are attached to the electronic communication, such as document files, video files, audio files, and executable files.","Often a sender of an electronic communication will address and send an electronic communication to the same group of recipients. Each recipient in the group must be entered for each of the multiple communications. For instance, in multiple e-mails sent to the same set of e-mail addresses, each recipient's address, e.g., e-mail address, and recipient type, e.g., a \u201cTo\u201d, \u201ccc\u201d or \u201cbcc\u201d recipient type, must be individually entered for each email. Additionally, other component data may also be frequently included in such electronic communications, such as the same subject data, text, and\/or the same attachments.","When electronic communications are frequently sent to the same group of recipients, entering this data can be a tedious and repetitive task. Thus, many electronic communication programs allow a user to manually create \u201cgroups,\u201d e.g., a set of associated addresses identified as a user-defined group that a user may select when addressing an electronic communication. Creating and maintaining such groups, however, can be time consuming, as users must manually create the groups and specify the recipients, and the users must periodically update the groups to add and\/or remove members. As a result, many users do not bother to create groups, and many of the groups that are created quickly become out of date. Additionally, creating such groups can be inefficient for such groups that are of temporal concern for the user, e.g., a group of recipients to which a user may send e-mails frequently for only several weeks or months.","Disclosed herein are systems, methods, and apparatus related to suggesting components of an electronic communication. In one implementation, an address set in an electronic communication is identified. The address set is compared to historical address sets, and one or more historical address sets is suggested for the electronic communication based on the comparison.","In another implementation, a component input associated with an electronic communication is received. Recipient address sets of the electronic communication based on previous electronic communications associated with the component input are identified.","In another implementation, a system includes a data store and a component suggestion module. The data store stores historical communication data of electronic communications. The historical communication data includes associations of two or more electronic communication components. The electronic communication components can include electronic addresses, content, or attachments, and each association defines communication components identified in electronic communications. The component suggestion module is stored in a computer readable medium and includes computer executable instructions that upon such execution cause a computer device to identify electronic communication component input in an electronic communication, compare the electronic communication component input to the historical communication data, and suggest one or more associations of electronic communication components for use in the electronic communication based on the comparison.","The details of one or more implementations are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features and advantages will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.","Like reference symbols in the various drawings indicate like elements.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","1","102","7","104","104","104"]},"Each of the user devices --- has a respective address A-A, e.g., an e-mail address, an internet protocol (IP) address, or some other electronic address that can be used for addressing electronic communications. Example user devices  include personal computers, laptop devices, wireless communication devices, or any other stationary or portable electronic device that can send and receive electronic communications over a wired and\/or wireless network.","In some implementations, the communication devices  can, for example, communicate electronically according to a peer-to-peer communication protocol. In other implementations, the communication devices  can, for example, communicate electronically through a centrally located server  that acts as a central point for receiving and routing electronic communications between client user devices , such as an e-mail server. Other communication protocols and communication schemes that support multiple recipients according to a recipient address set for an electronic communication can also be used.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","200","102","106"]},"The computing device  includes a processor , random access memory (RAM) , a data store , input\/output (I\/O) devices , and a network interface card (NIC) . Example I\/O devices  include a computer keyboard, mouse and monitor; a touch-sensitive display device; or other devices configured to facilitate the presentation of data to a user and to facilitate data input from the user. An example network interface card  can include a wired or wireless-enabled communication device configured to transmit and receive data over a network, such as the network . An example processor  can include a general purpose microprocessor capable of executing instructions stored in the data store . An example data store  can include a hard drive, a flash memory, or some other data storage device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","300","300"]},"The system  communicates with the one or more communication instances , such as one or more e-mail programs, to identify and suggest one or more components for the electronic communication. For example, in a client-side implementation, the system  can communicate with a client e-mail application through a component suggestion module . Alternatively, in a server-side implementation, the system  can communication with multiple client e-mail applications through the component suggestion module .","The component suggestion module  can be embedded within a larger communication program, such as a client-side e-mail program, or a server-side e-mail management program, or may communicate with the communication instances  through an application programming interface (API). The component suggestion module  can receive component input related to an electronic communication from a communication instance  and can compare the components received from the communication instance  with historical communication data . Based on the comparison, the component suggestion module  can suggest address sets and\/or other component input for the electronic communication.","Example historical communication data  can include associations of two or more electronic communication components. The electronic communication components include electronic address, content, or attachments, and each association can define communication components identified in previous electronic communications. For example, the historical communication data  can include addressing data , content data , and attachment data . The historical communication data  can define associations between the addressing data , content data , and attachment data , e.g., data associating the name of an attached file with the addresses to which the file was sent; or historical address sets, e.g., sets of addresses by recipient types; and other such associations.","In a client side implementation, the historical communication data  can include historical data for a particular user, e.g., addressing data  can include historical address sets of previous electronic communications addressed and\/or sent by the user. Such historical address sets can be further associated with other historical data, such as content data , which can include subjects and body data; and attachment data , which can include attachment-related data.","In a server side implementation, the historical communication data  can include historical data for multiple users, e.g., addressing data  can include historical address sets of previous electronic communication addressed and\/or sent by multiple users. Such historical address sets can be further associated with other historical data, such as content data , which can include subject and body data; and attachment data , which can include attachment-related data.","In some implementations, security protocols can be included to protect potentially sensitive information that may be stored or derived from the historical communication data store . For example, in some server side implementations, a separate historical communication data store  can be stored for each user, and each user may be authorized access to only the user's associated historical communication data store . In other server side implementations, a single historical communication data store  can be stored, and each client device may only be able to access the historical communication data store  by use of a password, a secured channel, or by some other protection scheme. When a user enters electronic communication component input, e.g., electronic addresses, attachments, or other component data, while editing an electronic communication in an editing environment, the component suggestion module  can compare the identified component input to historical component input stored in the historical communication data  and recommend one or more associations of electronic communication components to be used in the electronic communication. For example, when a user enters two or more recipient addresses in one or more of the To, cc, and\/or bcc fields in an e-mail communication editing environment, the component suggestion module  can compare the identified address set to historical address sets stored in the historical communication data . Based on this comparison, the component suggestion module  can provide a drop down menu of possible To, cc and bcc addressing sets.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","400","330","400"]},"In the example table , the associations of component inputs - are ranked according to a usage parameter, such as a frequency measure, e.g., the parameter \u201cFreq.\u201d An example frequency measure can be the number of times an e-mail with the corresponding association of component inputs is sent per average unit time, e.g., daily or weekly. Other frequency measures can also be used, e.g., the number of times an e-mail with the corresponding association of component inputs has been sent in total; the number of times an e-mail with the corresponding association of component inputs is sent per recent unit time, e.g., within the last day or within the last week, etc.","In some implementations, the frequency measure can be normalized, e.g., the association of component inputs  has the highest frequency value that is normalized to 1.00, the association of component inputs  has the next highest frequency valued normalized to 0.92, etc. Association of component inputs with a frequency measure of \u201cMIN\u201d can, for example, be associations that have only be identified a minimum number of times, e.g., once.","Other ranking schemes can also be used. For example, a predictive model, such as a Markov chain model, can be used to rank the address set according to one or more parameters, e.g., a time of day, or day of the week, etc.","In some implementations, a \u201cLast Used\u201d usage parameter can store the elapsed time from when a particular association of component inputs was last used to address an electronic communication. For example, the association of component inputs  was used 32 minutes and 57 seconds ago to address an electronic communication, while the association of component inputs  was used 122 hours, 12 minutes and 12 seconds ago to address an electronic communication. In some implementations elapsed time usage can be used, for example, to automatically delete an association if the corresponding elapsed time exceeds a predefined or user-selected value, e.g., 672 hours (four weeks).","In some implementations, the elapsed time usage can also be used to prioritize the list of suggested associations presented to the user. For example, if there are two associations that occurred substantially the same number of times and\/or at substantially the same rate, the more recently used association can be presented at the top of an association list that is shown to the user.","The associations of component inputs - can include historical address data, e.g., the association  includes a historical address set A, A, A and A, wherein the addresses A and A are designated a \u201cTo\u201d type; the address A is designated a \u201ccc\u201d type; and the address A is designated a \u201cbcc\u201d type. The associations of component inputs - can also include attachment data, e.g., the association  includes an attachment document D. Additionally, the associations of component inputs - can also include content data, e.g., the association  includes the subject text \u201cStatus.\u201d Other data can also be included.","In some implementations, each association - can be identified from previous electronic communications. For example, a user can install the component suggestion module  on computer device  or on a server , and the component suggestion module  can process stored electronic communication messages associated with the user's account to identify the associations. In some implementations, the associations - can be identified and\/or updated with each instance of an electronic communication. For example, after the associations - are identified, the associations - can be updated each time an e-mail message is sent, e.g., sending several e-mails with the subject \u201cLeads,\u201d and addressed to the address A and carbon copied to the address A would increase the frequency value of the component association .","More or less electronic communication component inputs can be stored in the table . For example, only addresses may be stored. Data in addition to the data shown in  can also be stored, such as a salutation line (e.g., the first line in the body of an e-mail message), a priority ranking (e.g., urgent, normal, low), etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIGS. 5A-5E","FIG. 4"],"b":["500","401","408","500","502","504","506","508","510","512"]},"In an implementation, the component suggestion module  can identify the communication component input in an electronic communication, e.g., addresses in one or more of the fields ,  and ; attachments in the field ; subjects in the field ; and\/or text in the field . The component suggestion module  can compare the identified electronic communication component input to the historical communication data  and, based on the comparison, suggest one or more associations of electronic communication components, e.g., one or more of the associations -, for use in the electronic communication.","For example,  is an editing environment  in which a user has entered the electronic addresses A and A in the \u201cTo\u201d field . The component suggestion module  can compare the address set A and A to the associations of component inputs - to identify matching historical address sets in the associations of component inputs -. Based on this identification of matching address sets, the component suggestion module  can suggest one or more associations of component inputs - as candidates for use in the preparation of the electronic communication. As shown in , the associations of component inputs , ,  and  each include a historical address set that includes A and A in the \u201cTo\u201d field . Accordingly, each of these associations of component inputs , ,  and  can be suggested for use in preparing the electronic communication.","In some implementations, the identified associations can each be presented in the editing environment and offset by a visual indicator. For example, in , each association , ,  and  is offset by a colored background, as indicated by the respective line patterns , ,  and . For example, the association , which is an address set having address A and A associated with a \u201cTo\u201d recipient type, address A associated with a cc recipient type, and address A associated with a \u201cbcc\u201d recipient type, can be highlighted in the fields , , and . Similarly, the associations of component inputs ,  and  can be similarly highlighted as appropriate.","In the implementation of , selection of any one of the suggested associations , ,  or , such as selection by a mouse click, can result in the selected association being used to address the electronic communication, and possibly to include additional data in the electronic communication, if such additional data is included in the selected association. For example, selection of the association  would result in the electronic communication having the addresses A and A in the To field , the address A in the cc field , the address A in the bcc field , and the subject \u201cStatus\u201d being included in the subject field .","In some implementations, only a subset of an association may be displayed. For example, only the candidate addresses may be displayed in the \u201cTo\u201d field .","In some implementations, the suggested associations are displayed according to a rank. The rank can, for example, be based on the frequency at which the suggested associations have been used over a period of time, e.g., within the last week, last month, etc. For example, the component associations , ,  and  are presented according to the frequency measure stored in the table . Upon the selection of a suggested association, the corresponding frequency measures are updated.","Instead of selecting a suggested association, a user may continue to manually input addresses or other component data. The component suggestion module  can also refine suggestions based on identified user inputs. For example, if the user inputs A into the \u201cTo\u201d field , the candidate associations of component inputs can be narrowed to associations  and .","Component data other than addresses can be used to identify candidate associations of component inputs. For example,  is the editing environment  in which a user has attached a document D in the attachment field  The component suggestion module  can compare the attachment D to the associations of component inputs - to identify candidate associations of component inputs that include the document D, e.g., associations  and . The identified candidate associations  and  are displayed as suggested component inputs, as indicated by the respective line patterns  and .","By way of another example,  is the editing environment  in which a user has entered the subject \u201cBudget\u201d in the subject field . The component suggestion module  can compare the text from the subject field  to the associations of component inputs - to identify candidate associations of component inputs that include the text \u201cBudget\u201d in the subject field , e.g., associations ,  and . The identified candidate associations ,   are displayed as displayed as suggested component inputs, as indicated by the respective line patterns ,  and .","The number of suggested component inputs can be limited based on a usage parameter. For example,  is the editing environment  in which a user has entered the electronic addresses A and A in the \u201cTo:\u201d field. The candidate associations that are suggested, as indicated by the line patterns ,  and , include only the associations of component inputs ,  and . Unlike , which included all possible associations of component inputs, e.g., associations , ,  and , only the associations of component inputs having a frequency measure that exceeds a threshold value, e.g., 0.50, are suggested. The threshold value can, for example, correspond to a user defined value, e.g., messages that are addressed to particular address sets more than 10 times per week.","Additional data can also be stored as component inputs and suggested. For example, content data associated with text input can also be suggested. As shown in , the first line of an e-mail communication, such as a salutation, can be suggested.","Other selection user interface schemes can also be used to suggest candidate associations or candidate historical address sets. For example,  is the editing environment  in which a user has entered the electronic addresses A and A in the \u201cTo:\u201d field. In this implementation, selectable divots ,  and  can be displayed in the address fields ,  and . The divots ,  and  can correspond to the associations ,  and . The divots ,  and  can be present in address fields that are populated by one or more addresses for the association corresponding to the divot. Thus, divots , which correspond to the address set stored in the association , are present in fields , , and ; divots , which correspond to the address set stored in the association , are present in fields  and ; and divots , which correspond to the address set stored in the association , are present in fields , , and .","Selection of a divot can, for example, provide a contextual drop down list of associated addresses for viewing by the user. Other user interface elements can also be used, e.g., drop down menus, etc.","In another implementation, and address set in an electronic communication need not exclusively match a historical address set for the historical address set to be suggested. Instead, an inclusive match, e.g., a match between any two or more addresses in the electronic communication and a historical address set, can result in a suggestion of the historical address set. If selected, the suggested historical address set can be substituted for the matching addresses in the electronic communication.","For example, a user may often send an e-mail to addresses A, A and A, resulting in the storage of a historical address set TO: A, A and A. However, a user may decide to later include the address A in the e-mail message that is normally addressed to A, A and A. Thus, upon entering the addresses A, A, and A (or A and any two addresses of A, A and A), the historical address set A, A, and A can be suggested.","In some implementations, the selection of an inclusively matched historical address set can result in a substitution of the matching addresses in the address set of the electronic communication by the selected historical address set. For example, for the address set A, A and A in the e-mail described above, selecting the suggested historical address set A, A and A will, in turn, substitute the addresses A and A by the addresses A, A and A, resulting in an address set of A, A, A and A.","In some implementations, a user can select whether inclusive or exclusive matching and substitution can be used. For example, a user can select a check box in a preferences environment that determines whether inclusive or exclusive matching is used.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 3"],"b":["600","600","300","320","320","610","320","610","320"]},"The system  can, for example, be implemented in a client device, such as a personal computer, or can be implemented in a server device, such as a mail server. Alternatively, the system  can be distributed across a client device and a server device. Other implementation architectures can also be used. In some implementations, the component suggestion module  can provide the automated group to computer devices associated with the recipient addresses stored in the automated group.","The system  thus facilitates the automatic creation and automatic removal of automated groups. For example, a group of seven employees, such as the users of the computers devices --- of , may be assigned to a temporary task that may span several weeks or months. As may often occur, multiple e-mail messages with particular addressing schemes may be generated among the users in the group. For example, the employee Peter may send daily e-mails according to the address scheme To: A, A, A, A and cc: A and A. Accordingly, the system  may identify an automated group defining the address scheme of From: A, To: A, A, A, A and cc: A and A, and thus the group can be selected by the employee Peter when addressing e-mail communications to the group.","In some implementations, the system  can provide the automated group to all computer devices associated with addresses in the automated group. Furthermore, the automated group can be modified for each computer device, depending on the computer device address. For example, the computer device - may locally store an automated group defining the address scheme of From: A, To: A, A, A, A and cc: A and A, and the computer device - may locally store an automated group defining the address scheme of From: A, To: A, A, A, A, A and cc: A.","After the temporary task is completed, e-mail communications that are sent to the automated group will likely decrease or cease altogether. Accordingly, once the usage parameter falls below the automated group storage threshold, the automated group can be removed from the automated group store .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 3","FIG. 6"],"b":["700","700","300","600"]},"Stage  identifies an address set in an electronic communication.
