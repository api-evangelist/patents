title: POD launched unmanned air vehicle
abstract: A method and apparatus for attacking a plurality of dispersed targets are herein presented. In particular, the method and apparatus herein presented allow the user to upload target data onto a pod mounted on a host aircraft. Upon reaching the pre loaded target location, the pod releases a plurality of individually targeted Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs), thereby allowing the user to attack a plurality of dispersed targets from a single aircraft standing off at a significant distance from the target area.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["This application claims rights under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119(e) from U.S. Application Ser. No. 60\/936,024 filed Jun. 18, 2007, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.","This invention was made with United States Government support. The United States Government has certain rights in this invention.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to ordnance and more particularly to ordnance applications of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).","2. Brief Description of Prior Developments","In modern warfare, especially in counter terrorism operations, adversaries may tend to dispense their assets. It may, therefore, be necessary to attack a plethora of targets from a single aircraft standing off at a significant distance from the target area.","There is, therefore, a need for an alternate way to attack dispersed targets.","The present invention is a method and apparatus for attacking dispersed targets from a single aircraft standing off at a significant distance from the target area. According to this invention, pods of individually targeted UAVs are carried in lieu of a bomb on a conventional bomb rack.","Referring to , in a preferred embodiment of this invention pod modules would be ejectable Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) with suitable payloads. The pod modules could also be delivered ballistically with chaff, flares, weapons, or sensors. Fixed modules which stays with the pod may be communications, RF uplink\/downlink, and ECM. The pod modules may be single, or double, or triple wide. They may, for example, be 20 single wide modules per pod. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that a module to module interlink would be provided by conventional means such as a CAN bus. Other than attachment points, no interface is necessary to the carrying aircraft. The pod has its own GPS and initiates function when the pod enters the preplanned operations area.","Potential MAV payloads would include weapons such as High Explosive utility, armor piercing, anti personnel, anti personnel mines, chemical, and incendiaries. Suitable payloads would also include decoys, or chaff, sensors. Such sensors could include visible light and infra red; acoustic, seismic or magnetic. Other suitable payloads would include chemical weapons or psychological operations devices or materials.","Referring to , a maximum vertical velocity Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) is shown which is an unpowered aerospike with a 2:1 length to diameter ratio. Maximum range would be from 10,000 feet AGL \u02dc4 miles. Vz Max would be \u02dc0.8 Mach. The, MAW would drop 10,000 feet AGL in about 20 seconds (straight down) to 120 seconds at 4 miles (maximum range). An example of a suitable payload for use with this embodiment would be a M77 shaped charge.","Referring to , a maximum range\/maximum endurance MAV is shown. It would be unpowered and have a 14:1 length to diameter ratio and a range from 10,000 feet AGL \u02dc28 miles. Vz Typical would be \u02dc5 ft\/sec (Vh \u02dc80 ft\/sec). The MAW would drop 10,000 feet AGL in about \u00bd hour. An example of a suitable payload would be a jammer.","Delivery modes for the UAV of this invention include endurance glide, fast glide attack, glide and slow drive, glide and fast drive, and unguided ballistic.","Referring to , in one preferred embodiment of the present invention the UAV may be used in a endurance glide. Typical payloads include sensors, jammers, decoys, and COM crosslink. Guidance might be GPS only or multiple waypoints. Required accuracy would be in hundreds of meters. A special advantage would be that the MAV would achieve programmed waypoints (even in winds) enabling precise geometry between payload and target.","Referring to , in our alternate embodiment of the present invention, the UAV may be used in a fast glide attack. A typical payload would include weapons. Suitable guidance would be by means of laser designation. The required accuracy would be 1 meter. A special advantage of this embodiment would be that it would be well suited to attack moving targets (car, truck, boat, another UAV) or to attack vertical faces (side of building, cave entrance).","Referring to , in another alternate embodiment of the present invention, the UAV may be used in a fast glide attack. Typical payloads would include sensors, or weapons such as an M77. Guidance could be by means of GPS glide or GPS and\/or laser designator dive. The required accuracy would be 100 m to a meter. Special advantages would be that it could land on roof, camo netting or ground without penetrating. A GPS glide\/GPS dive is true fire and forget weapon.","Referring to , in another alternate embodiment of the present invention the UAV may be used in a glide and fast dive mode. Typical payloads would include a sensor (such as planting a seismic sensor) or a weapon. Guidance could be GPS guide or laser designator dive. The required accuracy would be from 100 m to 2 m. A special advantage of this embodiment would be that it could penetrate some types of roofs and camo netting. It could also be used in ground attack of moving targets at greater range than fast glide.","Referring to , in another alternate embodiment of the present invention, the UAV could be employed in a ballistic mode. Typical payloads could be an en masse payload such a several dozen M-77's. No guidance would be required. Required accuracy would be 1000 m to 100 m. A special advantage of this embodiment would be its ultra low cost delivery.","Referring to Table 1, a parametric comparison of delivery modes is provided.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"6"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},"TABLE 1"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Endurance","Fast glide","Glide and slow dive","Glide and fast dive","ballistic"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"7"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Guidance","GPS","Laser","GPS","GPS\/Laser","GPS\/laser","None"]},{"entry":["Accuracy","High","Vary high","High","Very high","Very high","Low"]},{"entry":["Max Range","~10 nm","~6 nm","~8 nm","~8 nm","~8 nm","~1 nm"]},{"entry":"from 10,000"},{"entry":"AGL"},{"entry":["Time in flight","13","6","11","11","10","1"]},{"entry":"(min)"},{"entry":["Fire and forget","Y","N","Y","N","N","Y"]},{"entry":["Moving Target","N","Y","N","Y?","Y","N"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"While the present invention has been described in connection with the preferred embodiments of the various figures, it is to be understood that other similar embodiments may be used or modifications and additions may be made to the described embodiment for performing the same function of the present invention without deviating therefrom.
