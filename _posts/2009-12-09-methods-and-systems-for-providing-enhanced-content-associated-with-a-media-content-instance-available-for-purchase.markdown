{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND INFORMATION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["Set-top box devices and other media content access devices are often capable of allowing users to purchase access to a variety of different media content instances. For example, a user may purchase access to a pay-per-view event, a video-on-demand program, a movie, music, and\/or any other type of media content instance available by way of a media content access device.","Because such media content instances are transmitted to a media content access device by way of some type of network (e.g., a subscriber television network), a user may experience a media content instance almost immediately upon purchase thereof. Hence, users currently do not have any incentive to pre-order a media content instance scheduled for broadcast or release at a future date (e.g., a pay-per-view event, a movie, etc.).","Moreover, traditional broadcast advertisements for such media content instances are limited to a relatively short amount of time to generate user interest in the media content instances. For example, it is sometimes difficult to generate user interest in a pay-per-view event or a movie scheduled for release during thirty second advertisements slots. Hence, alternative approaches to promoting and incentivizing pre-ordering of media content instances available for purchase are desirable.","Exemplary methods and systems for providing enhanced content associated with a media content instance available for purchase are described herein. As described in more detail below, an advertisement for a media content instance available for purchase and accessible only at or after a scheduled release time may be presented to a user. A request input by the user to purchase access to the media content instance may be received and processed. In response to the received purchase request, enhanced content associated with the media content instance may be provided for experiencing by the user before the scheduled release time. The enhanced content may be additionally accessed at or after the release time of the media content instance.","Allowing a user to access enhanced content before a release date of a media content instance may result in a user having a more fulfilling and enjoyable experience with a purchased media content instance. Moreover, enhanced content may incentivize users to pre-order access to a media content instance available for purchase, motivate users to purchase a media content instance through a particular content provider (e.g., through a subscriber television provider as opposed to through an online or retail store), and allow producers of media content instances available for purchase to promote and\/or gauge interest in the media content instances.","As used herein, \u201cmedia content\u201d may refer generally to any content accessible via a media content access subsystem. The term \u201cmedia content instance\u201d will be used herein to refer to any television program, on-demand media program (e.g., video-on-demand program), pay-per-view event, broadcast media program (e.g., broadcast television program), multicast media program, narrowcast media program, IPTV media content, video, movie, song, video game, or combination of these or other forms of media content that may be viewed or otherwise experienced by a user.","As used herein, a \u201cscheduled release time\u201d of a media content instance refers to a particular time in the future at which the media content instance becomes available for access by one or more users. For example, a scheduled release time may refer to a broadcast time of a pay-per-view event, a date and time at which a new movie becomes available, and\/or any other time at which a media content instance becomes available for access by one or more users.","As used herein, \u201cenhanced content\u201d refers to any content associated with a purchased media content instance that may be of interest to a user.
