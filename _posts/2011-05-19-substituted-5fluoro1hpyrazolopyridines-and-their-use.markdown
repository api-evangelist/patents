{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims the benefit of priority of German Application Number DE 10201002637.2, filed May 26, 2010.","The present application relates to novel substituted 5-fluoro-1H-pyrazolopyridines, to processes for their preparation, to their use alone or in combinations for the treatment and\/or prophylaxis of diseases, and to their use for producing medicaments for the treatment and\/or prophylaxis of diseases, in particular for the treatment and\/or prophylaxis of cardiovascular disorders.","One of the most important cellular transmission systems in mammalian cells is cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Together with nitrogen monoxide (NO), which is released from the endothelium and transmits hormonal and mechanical signals, it forms the NO\/cGMP system. Guanylate cyclases catalyze the biosynthesis of cGMP from guanosine triphosphate (GTP). The known representatives of this family can be classified both according to structural features and according to the type of ligands into two groups: the particulate guanylate cyclases which can be stimulated by natriuretic peptides, and the soluble guanylate cyclases which can be stimulated by NO. The soluble guanylate cyclases consist of two subunits and very probably contain one haem per heterodimer, which is part of the regulatory site. It is of central importance for the activation mechanism. NO is able to bind to the iron atom of haem and thus markedly increase the activity of the enzyme. Haem-free preparations cannot, by contrast, be stimulated by NO. Carbon monoxide (CO) is also able to attach to the central iron atom of haem, but the stimulation by CO is distinctly less than that by NO.","By forming cGMP, and owing to the resulting regulation of phosphodiesterases, ion channels and protein kinases, guanylate cyclase plays an important role in various physiological processes, in particular in the relaxation and proliferation of smooth muscle cells, in platelet aggregation and platelet adhesion and in neuronal signal transmission, and also in disorders which are based on a disturbance of the abovementioned processes. Under pathophysiological conditions, the NO\/cGMP system may be suppressed, which may lead for example to high blood pressure, platelet activation, increased cellular proliferation, endothelial dysfunction, atherosclerosis, angina pectoris, heart failure, myocardial infarction, thromboses, stroke and sexual dysfunction.","Owing to the expected high efficiency and few side effects, a treatment of such disorders which targets the influence of the cGMP signal path in organisms and is NO-independent is a promising approach.","Hitherto, for the therapeutic stimulation of the soluble guanylate cyclase use has exclusively been made of compounds such as organic nitrates whose effect is based on NO. This is formed by bioconversion and activates soluble guanylate cyclase by attack at the central iron atom of haem. In addition to the side effects, the development of tolerance is one of the decisive disadvantages of this type of treatment.","In recent years, some substances have been described which stimulate soluble guanylate cyclase directly, i.e. without prior release of NO, such as, for example 3-(5\u2032-hydroxymethyl-2\u2032-furyl)-1-benzylindazole [YC-1; Wu et al., 84 (1994), 4226; M\u00fclsch et al., 120 (1997), 681], fatty acids [Goldberg et al., 252 (1977), 1279], diphenyliodonium hexafluorophosphate [Pettibone et al., 116 (1985), 307], isoliquiritigenin [Yu et al., 114 (1995), 1587] and various substituted pyrazole derivatives (WO 98\/16223).","WO 00\/06569 discloses fused pyrazole derivatives and WO 03\/095451 carbamate-substituted 3-pyrimidinylyrazolopyridines as stimulators of soluble guanylate cyclase.","It is an object of the present invention to provide novel substances which act as stimulators of soluble guanylate cyclase and which have an identical or improved therapeutic profile compared to compounds known from the prior art, such as, for example, with respect to their in vivo properties such as, for example, their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic behaviour and\/or their dose-activity relationship.","The present invention provides compounds of the general formula (I)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"65.96mm","wi":"69.85mm","file":"US08420656-20130416-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"in which","Rrepresents hydrogen or (C-C)-alkyl,\n\n","and their N-oxides, salts, solvates, salts of the N-oxides and solvates of the N-oxides and salts.","Compounds according to the invention are the compounds of the formula (I) and the N-oxides, salts, solvates and solvates of the N-oxides and salts thereof, the compounds, encompassed by formula (I), of the formulae specified hereinafter and the N-oxides, salts, solvates and solvates of the N-oxides and salts thereof, and the compounds encompassed by formula (I) and specified hereinafter as working examples and the N-oxides, salts, solvates and solvates of the N-oxides and salts thereof, to the extent that the compounds encompassed by formula (I) and specified hereinafter are not already N-oxides, salts, solvates and solvates of the N-oxides and salts.","In the context of the present invention, preferred salts are physiologically acceptable salts of the compounds according to the invention. Also encompassed are salts which are not themselves suitable for pharmaceutical applications but can be used, for example, for isolation or purification of the compounds according to the invention.","Physiologically acceptable salts of the compounds according to the invention include acid addition salts of mineral acids, carboxylic acids and sulphonic acids, for example salts of hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid, methanesulphonic acid, ethanesulphonic acid, toluenesulphonic acid, benzenesulphonic acid, naphthalenedisulphonic acid, formic acid, acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, propionic acid, lactic acid, tartaric acid, malic acid, citric acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid and benzoic acid.","Physiologically acceptable salts of the compounds according to the invention also include salts of conventional bases, by way of example and with preference alkali metal salts (e.g. sodium and potassium salts), alkaline earth metal salts (e.g. calcium and magnesium salts) and ammonium salts derived from ammonia or organic amines having 1 to 16 carbon atoms, by way of example and with preference ethylamine, diethylamine, triethylamine, ethyldiisopropylamine, monoethanolamine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine, dicyclohexylamine, dimethylaminoethanol, procaine, dibenzylamine, N-methylmorpholine, arginine, lysine, ethylenediamine and N-methylpiperidine.","In the context of the invention, solvates refer to those forms of the compounds according to the invention which, in the solid or liquid state, form a complex by coordination with solvent molecules. Hydrates are a specific form of the solvates in which the coordination is with water. Preferred solvates in the context of the present invention are hydrates.","Depending on their structure, the compounds according to the invention may exist in different stereoisomeric forms, i.e. in the form of configurational isomers or if appropriate also as conformational isomers (enantiomers and\/or diastereomers, including those in the case of atropisomers). The present invention therefore encompasses the enantiomers or diastereomers and the respective mixtures thereof. The stereoisomerically uniform constituents can be isolated from such mixtures of enantiomers and\/or diastereomers in a known manner; chromatography processes are preferably used for this, in particular HPLC chromatography on an achiral or chiral phase.","Where the compounds according to the invention can occur in tautomeric forms, the present invention encompasses all the tautomeric forms.","The present invention also encompasses all suitable isotopic variants of the compounds according to the invention. An isotopic variant of a compound according to the invention is understood here to mean a compound in which at least one atom within the compound according to the invention compound has been exchanged for another atom of the same atomic number, but with a different atomic mass than the atomic mass which usually or predominantly occurs in nature. Examples of isotopes which can be incorporated into a compound according to the invention are those of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulphur, fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine, such as H (deuterium), H (tritium), C, C, N, O, O, P, P, S, S, S, S, F, Cl, Br, I, I, I and I. Particular isotopic variants of a compound according to the invention, especially those in which one or more radioactive isotopes have been incorporated, may be beneficial, for example, for the examination of the mechanism of action or of the active compound distribution in the body; due to comparatively easy preparability and detectability, especially compounds labelled with H or C isotopes are suitable for this purpose. In addition, the incorporation of isotopes, for example of deuterium, can lead to particular therapeutic benefits as a consequence of greater metabolic stability of the compound, for example an extension of the half-life in the body or a reduction in the active dose required; such modifications of the compounds according to the invention may therefore in some cases also constitute a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Isotopic variants of the compounds according to the invention can be prepared by processes known to those skilled in the art, for example by the methods described below and the methods described in the working examples, by using corresponding isotopic modifications of the particular reagents and\/or starting compounds therein.","Moreover, the present invention also encompasses prodrugs of the compounds according to the invention. Here, the term \u201cprodrugs\u201d refers to compounds which for their part can be biologically active or inactive, but are converted (for example metabolically or hydrolytically) into compounds according to the invention during their dwell time in the body.","In the context of the present invention, unless specified otherwise, the substituents are defined as follows:","In the context of the invention, alkyl represents a straight-chain or branched alkyl radical having 1 to 4 carbon atoms. The following may be mentioned by way of example and by way of preference: methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, 1-methylpropyl, tert-butyl.","In the context of the invention, halogen represents fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine.","If radicals in the compounds according to the invention are substituted, the radicals may be mono- or polysubstituted, unless specified otherwise. In the context of the present invention, all radicals which occur more than once are defined independently of one another. Substitution by one, two or three identical or different substituents is preferred.","In the context of the present invention, preference is given to compounds of the formula (I) in which","Rrepresents hydrogen or methyl,\n\n","and their salts, solvates and solvates of the salts.","In the context of the present invention, particular preference is given to the following compounds

invention further provides medicaments which comprise at least one compound according to the invention, typically together with one or more inert, nontoxic, pharmaceutically suitable auxiliaries, and the use thereof for the aforementioned purposes.","The compounds according to the invention may act systemically and\/or locally. For this purpose, they can be administered in a suitable manner, for example by the oral, parenteral, pulmonal, nasal, sublingual, lingual, buccal, rectal, dermal, transdermal, conjunctival, otic route, or as an implant or stent.","The compounds according to the invention can be administered in administration forms suitable for these administration routes.","Suitable administration forms for oral administration are those which work according to the prior art, which release the compounds according to the invention rapidly and\/or in a modified manner and which contain the compounds according to the invention in crystalline and\/or amorphized and\/or dissolved form, for example tablets (uncoated or coated tablets, for example with gastric juice-resistant or retarded-dissolution or insoluble coatings which control the release of the compound according to the invention), tablets or films\/wafers which disintegrate rapidly in the oral cavity, films\/lyophilizates or capsules (for example hard or soft gelatin capsules), sugar-coated tablets, granules, pellets, powders, emulsions, suspensions, aerosols or solutions.","Parenteral administration can bypass an absorption step (e.g. intravenously, intraarterially, intracardially, intraspinally or intralumbally) or include an absorption (e.g. intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intracutaneously, percutaneously or intraperitoneally). Administration forms suitable for parenteral administration include preparations for injection and infusion in the form of solutions, suspensions, emulsions, lyophilizates or sterile powders.","For the other administration routes, suitable examples are inhalable medicament forms (including powder inhalers, nebulizers), nasal drops, solutions or sprays, tablets, films\/wafers or capsules for lingual, sublingual or buccal administration, suppositories, ear or eye preparations, vaginal capsules, aqueous suspensions (lotions, shaking mixtures), lipophilic suspensions, ointments, creams, transdermal therapeutic systems (e.g. patches), milk, pastes, foams, sprinkling powders, implants or stents.","Oral or parenteral administration is preferred, especially oral administration.","The compounds according to the invention can be converted to the administration forms mentioned. This can be done in a manner known per se, by mixing with inert, nontoxic, pharmaceutically suitable excipients. These excipients include carriers (for example microcrystalline cellulose, lactose, mannitol), solvents (e.g. liquid polyethylene glycols), emulsifiers and dispersing or wetting agents (for example sodium dodecylsulphate, polyoxysorbitan oleate), binders (for example polyvinylpyrrolidone), synthetic and natural polymers (for example albumin), stabilizers (e.g. antioxidants, for example ascorbic acid), dyes (e.g. inorganic pigments, for example iron oxides) and flavour and\/or odour correctants.","In general, it has been found to be advantageous in the case of parenteral administration to administer amounts of about 0.001 to 1 mg\/kg, preferably about 0.01 to 0.5 mg\/kg, of body weight to achieve effective results. In the case of oral administration, the dosage is about 0.01 to 100 mg\/kg, preferably about 0.01 to 20 mg\/kg and most preferably 0.1 to 10 mg\/kg of body weight.","It may nevertheless be necessary where appropriate to deviate from the stated amounts, specifically as a function of the body weight, route of administration, individual response to the active compound, nature of the preparation and time or interval over which administration takes place. For instance, in some cases, less than the aforementioned minimum amount may be sufficient, while in other cases the upper limit mentioned must be exceeded. In the case of administration of relatively large amounts, it may be advisable to divide these into several individual doses over the course of the day.","The working examples which follow illustrate the invention.

Determination of Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Intravenous and Peroral Administration:","The pharmacokinetic parameters of the substance are determined in male CD-1 mice, male Wistar rats and female beagles. The administration volume is 10 ml\/kg for mice, 5 ml\/kg for rats and 0.5 ml\/kg for dogs. Intravenous administration is via a formulation of species-specific plasma\/DMSO (99\/1) in the case of mice and rats and via water\/PEG400\/ethanol (50\/40\/10) in the case of dogs. For easier removal of blood, a silicone catheter is inserted into the right Vena jugularis externa of the rats before the administration of substance. The surgical intervention takes place one day prior to the experiment with isofluran anaesthesia and administration of an analgetic (atropine\/rimadyl (3\/1) 0.1 ml s.c.). Substance administration is as i.v. bolus in the case of mice, as i.v. bolus or via a 15-minute infusion in the case of rats and via a 15-minute infusion in the case of dogs. Removal of blood is after 0.033, 0.083, 0.17, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 24 hours in the case of mice and, after a 15-minute infusion, after 0.083, 0.25, 0.28 0.33, 0.42, 0.75, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 24 hours in the case of dogs and rats and after an i.v. bolus administration, after 0.033, 0.083, 0.17, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 24 hours in the case of rats. For all species, oral administration of the dissolved substance via gavage is carried out based on a water\/PEG400\/ethanol formulation (50\/40\/10). Here, the removal of blood from rats and dogs is after 0.083, 0.17, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 24 hours. The blood is removed into heparinized tubes. The blood plasma is then obtained by centrifugation; if required, it can be stored at \u221220\u00b0 C. until further processing.","An internal standard (ZK 228859) is added to the unknown samples, calibration samples and QCs, and the protein is precipitated using excess acetonitrile. After addition of an ammonium acetate buffer (0.01 M, pH 6.8 (Example 1\/3) or pH 3.0 (Example 2)) and subsequent vortexing, the mixture is centrifuged at 1000 g and the supernatant is examined by LC-MS\/MS (API 4000, AB Sciex). Chromatographic separation is carried out on an Agilent 1100-HPLC. The injection volume is 10 \u03bcl. The separation column used is a Phenomenex Luna 5\u03bc C8(2) 100A 50\u00d72 mm, adjusted to a temperature of 40\u00b0 C. For Example 1, a binary mobile phase gradient at 400 \u03bcl\/min is used (A: 0.01M ammonium acetate buffer pH 6.8, B: 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile): 0 min (90% A), 1 min (90% A), 3.5 min (15% A), 4.5 min (15% A), 4.6 min (90% A), 7 min (90% A). For Example 2, a binary mobile phase gradient at 500 \u03bcl\/min is used instead (A: 0.01M ammonium acetate buffer pH 3.0, B: 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile): 0 min (90% A), 1.5 min (90% A), 3.5 min (10% A), 4.5 min (10% A), 5 min (90% A), 7 min (90% A). For Example 3, a binary mobile solvent gradient at 500 \u03bcl\/min is used instead (A: 0.01M ammonium acetate buffer pH 6.8, B: 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile): 0 min (90% A), 1 min (90% A), 3 min (10% A), 4 min (10% A), 4.5 min (90% A), 6 min (90% A). The temperature of the Turbo V ion source is 500\u00b0 C. The following MS instrument parameters are used: curtain gas 20 units (Example 1), 16 units (Example 2) or 15 units (Example 3), ion spray voltage 5 kV (Example 1\/2) or 4.5 units (Example 3), gas 1 35 units (Example 1\/3) or 25 units (Example 2), gas 2 30 units, CAD gas 4 units (Example 1\/3) or 3 units (Example 2). The substances are quantified by peak heights or areas using extracted ion chromatograms of specific MRM experiments.","The plasma concentration\/time plots determined are used to calculate the pharmacokinetic parameters such as AUC, C, MRT (mean residence time), t(half life) and CL (clearance) employing the validated pharmacokinetic calculation programs KinEx (Vers. 2.5 and 3).","As the substance quantification is carried out in plasma, it is necessary to determine the blood\/plasma distribution of the substance to be able to adjust the pharamacokinetic parameters in an appropriate manner To this end, a defined amount of substance is incubated in heparinized whole blood of the species in question in a rocking roller mixer for 20 min. After centrifugation at 1000 g, the plasma concentration is measured (see above) and determined by calculating the quotient of the c\/cvalues.","Following intravenous administration of 0.3 mg\/kg of the compounds according to the invention in rats, the following values were recorded:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0406","num":"0420"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00004","num":"00004"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Example","1.*","2.**","3.**"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"49pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"AUC[kg \u00b7 h\/l]","4.36","1.79","1.36"]},{"entry":[{},"CL[lh\/kg]","0.29","0.53","1.02"]},{"entry":[{},"MRT [h]","4.1","2.3","2.3"]},{"entry":[{},"t[h]","3.4","1.7","1.9"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"*15-minute infusion"]},{"entry":[{},"**i.v. bolus administration"]}]}}]}}},"B-5.
