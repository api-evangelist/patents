{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present disclosure relates generally to geo-social networking, and more particularly, applying computer vision algorithms to user-uploaded multimedia objects to search a photographic location database for photographs containing similar object images in order to ascertain the physical location at which the multimedia object was captured.","Computer users are able to access and share vast amounts of information through various local and wide area computer networks including proprietary networks as well as public networks such as the Internet. Typically, a web browser installed on a user's computing device facilitates access to and interaction with information located at various network servers identified by, for example, associated uniform resource locators (URLs). Conventional approaches to enable sharing of user-generated content include various information sharing technologies or platforms such as social networking websites. Such websites may include, be linked with, or provide a platform for applications enabling users to view \u201cprofile\u201d pages created or customized by other users where visibility and interaction with such profiles by other users is governed by some characteristic set of rules. By way of example, a user profile may include such user-declared information as contact information, background information, job\/career information, as well as interests.","A traditional social network is a social structure made of individuals, groups, entities, or organizations generally referred to as \u201cnodes,\u201d which are tied (connected) by one or more specific types of interdependency. Social network (graph) analysis views social relationships in terms of network theory consisting of nodes and edges. Nodes are the individual actors within the networks, and edges are the relationships between the actors. The resulting graph-based structures are often very complex. There can be many kinds of edges between nodes. In its simplest form, a social network, or social graph, is a map of all of the relevant edges between all the nodes being studied.","Users may interact with other non-user nodes and explicitly express an affinity for the node through various actions. Users may also interact with physical entities, such as businesses or particular locations that may or may not be represented by a corresponding node in the social graph.","Social networking systems may include geo-social aspects in which geographic services and capabilities are used to enable additional social interactions. User-submitted location data or geo-location techniques such as mobile phone position tracking may enable a geo-social network to connect and coordinate users with local users, events, and places that match their interests.","Particular embodiments relate to a social network environment that includes an infrastructure or platform (hereinafter infrastructure and platform may be used interchangeably) enabling an integrated social network environment. In the present disclosure, the social network environment may be described in terms of a social graph including social graph information. In particular embodiments, one or more computing systems of the social network environment implementing the social network environment include, store, or have access to a data structure that includes social graph information for use in implementing the social network environment described herein. The social network utilizes a social graph that includes nodes representing users and concepts in the social network environment as well as edges that define or represent connections between such nodes.","In particular embodiments, the social graph information includes a first set of user nodes that each correspond to a respective user, and a second set of concept nodes that each correspond to a respective concept. As used herein, a \u201cuser\u201d may be an individual (human user), an entity (e.g., an enterprise, business, or third party application), or a group (e.g., of individuals or entities) that interacts or communicates with or over such a social network environment. As used herein, a \u201cconcept\u201d may refer to virtually anything that a user may declare or otherwise demonstrate an interest in, a like towards, or a relationship with, such as, by way of example, a sport, a sports team, a genre of music, a musical composer, a hobby, a business (enterprise), an entity, a group, a third party application, a celebrity, a person who is not a registered user, etc. In particular embodiments, each node has, represents, or is represented by, a corresponding web page (\u201cprofile page\u201d) hosted or accessible in the social network environment.","By way of example, a user node may have a corresponding user profile page in which the corresponding user can add content, make declarations, and otherwise express him or herself, while a concept node may have a corresponding concept profile page (\u201chub\u201d) in which a plurality of users can add content, make declarations, and express themselves, particularly in relation to the concept. In particular embodiments, the social graph information further includes a plurality of edges that each define or represent a connection between a corresponding pair of nodes in the social graph.","Users of the social networking system may interact with concept nodes and their hubs in various ways. For example, a user may click a button on the hub explicitly stating that the user \u201clikes\u201d the hub and associated concept node. In particular embodiments, a user may \u201ccheck-in\u201d to a real-world location that is associated with a hub page. Checking-into a real world location associated with a concept node may be a relatively complex process. A user of a mobile device must first access a \u201ccheck-in\u201d function, and search for concept nodes by name. Location-based algorithms that filter down the list of possible concept nodes to those within the geographic region of the user may expedite the process, but generally the user must still type in the name of the location, select the associated concept node from a list of nearby concept nodes, and \u201ccheck in.\u201d In particular embodiments, a user may append free-form text, audio, video, or a photograph to the check-in.","In particular embodiments, the social networking system maintains a photographic location database of various locations and objects. In particular embodiments, the images in the photographic location database are generated by the social network itself. In particular embodiments, the images are submitted by administrators of concept nodes, such as business owners. A particular business owner may submit a photo image of his or her storefront, for example. In particular embodiments, the social networking system builds the photographic location database by accepting images from users. For example, if multiple users submit a photograph of the Wynn casino in association with a check-in to the Wynn casino concept node, the social network associates the photos submitted with the concept node in the photographic location database. In particular embodiments, the social network builds the photographic location database based upon the location of submitted photos. For example, if a user uploads a photo within a predetermined time of capture, the social network knows that the user was at a particular location (from GPS or cellular data), and may infer that the photo is of the object or location associated with the particular location. In particular embodiments, the photographic location database is provided by a third-party such as Garmin, Mapquest, or Google StreetView. This disclosure contemplates any method of generating or obtaining the photographic location database.","In particular embodiments, photographs uploaded to the social networking system are subject to an object image recognition algorithm. The object image recognition algorithm compares the uploaded image to the images stored in the photographic location database and searches for similar objects in the photographic location database. Objects may be certain elements of the landscape, buildings, landmarks, or a particular arrangement of various photo elements. Methods for object searching are well-known in the art, and may include frequency-domain image processing, filtering, wavelet analysis, feature extraction, learning-algorithms such as neural networks, texture recognition, and the like. This disclosure contemplates any type of computer vision algorithms for finding matching objects. In particular embodiments, users uploading photos to the social networking system may tag particular regions of the photo containing people or objects of interest. In particular embodiments, this information may be used to exclude people from the object image recognition algorithm, or to include regions that may correspond to geographical objects such as buildings, landmarks, etc. that specific object image recognition algorithms, such as feature extraction algorithms, may key in on.","In particular embodiments, the object image recognition algorithm automatically recognizes signs as a particular class of object, and applies optical character recognition (OCR) to convert photographed signs into searchable text. In particular embodiments, the photographic location database includes extracted text for each photo including a sign. In particular embodiments, the text from the uploaded photo is searched against the text stored in association with each photo having a sign in the photographic location database.","This disclosure envisions various optimizations of the object image recognition algorithm. In particular embodiments, the object image recognition algorithm may narrow the images searched and compared based upon location information from the user uploading the photo. For example, if the user's location has been determined to be in Las Vegas (either from GPS, cellular triangulation, check-in, or being checked in by another user), within a predetermined period of time, the object image recognition algorithm may limit the images searched to only the images associated with Las Vegas, Nev. In a particular embodiments, the object image recognition algorithm first attempts to match text from the uploaded photo extracted by OCR to the text-searchable database before searching via the object image recognition algorithm due to the relative speed at which text is searched compared to image searching. In particular embodiments, the set of images searched by the object image recognition algorithm is narrowed by the text search.","In particular embodiments, after matching one or more objects in the uploaded image to objects contained in images in the photographic location database, the social networking system determines a location of the user based on location data stored in association with the matched images in photographic location database. In particular embodiments, the location is expressed in terms of a specific longitude and latitude coordinate pair. In particular embodiments, the location is expressed as a long\/lat coordinate pair and a radius covering a predetermined circular area in which the user may be in. In particular embodiments, the location information includes a direction. For example, if a user takes a picture of the John Hancock building and Lake Michigan is in the background, the object image recognition algorithm may recognize both the John Hancock building as well as a body of water. The social networking system may then determine that the only view of the John Hancock including water is toward the East facing Lake Michigan. In particular embodiments, the directionality value may be a vector or a series of vectors.","After obtaining location information, the social networking system may take one or more actions on the photo or the user account associated with the uploaded image. In particular embodiments, the social networking system may automatically check the uploading user into the determined location. For example, if a user takes and uploads a picture of the Empire State Building, the user will automatically be checked into \u201cEmpire State Building, New York, N.Y.\u201d, and this story will be displayed on the user's profile page on the social network. In particular embodiments, the social networking system also applies a face recognition algorithm, so that the user as well as any users whose faces are detected in the uploaded photo are checked into the location as well. In particular embodiments, the social networking system may tag the uploaded photos with the names of the users whose faces are detected by the face recognition algorithm. In particular embodiments, the object itself may also be tagged as a result of the object image recognition algorithm. For example, if a photo includes the Statue of Liberty, the social networking system may tag the object in the photo with the meta data \u201cStatute of Liberty.\u201d","In particular embodiments, the determined location can be used to augment or otherwise correct a location determination made by the user's device. For example, feature phones lacking a dedicated global positioning system (GPS) receiver may obtain a more accurate location fix from the location determined by the social networking system. Even phones with assisted-GPS (aGPS) may benefit from position data determined by the social networking system in areas where GPS signals are subject to obstruction and interference, such as areas with a large number of high buildings. This \u201curban canyon\u201d problem can result in grossly inaccurate position determination from GPS devices, and may be corrected via the location determined by the social network from analysis of the uploaded image. In particular embodiments, the social networking system may leverage metadata contained in the uploaded photo, such as exchangeable image file format (EXIF) data, to assist location determination. For example, the uploaded photo may include geotagging information such as EXIF tags indicating the location where the image was captured. Mobile devices such as mobile phones with global positioning system receivers may also automatically geotag photos captured by the device with EXIF location data. The social networking system may, for each photo including location metadata, narrow the set of images searched by the object image recognition algorithm to photos associated with locations in a predetermined radius around the region indicated by the location metadata. In particular embodiments, the timestamp metadata may be used to narrow or expand the search radius. For example, a photo that was uploaded within minutes of the time of capture may be searched against a smaller search area than a photo that was uploaded hours after the time of capture. In particular embodiments, EXIF data tags regarding the degree of zoom utilized by client device  may be leveraged in computing the capture location and orientation. This disclosure contemplates any suitable manner of utilizing metadata to determine capture location.","Various portions of such a social networking platform may be implemented via a hardware architecture or software framework that enables various software components or processes to implement particular embodiments, as is described in more detail, by way of example and not by way of limitation, below. The platform may include one or more hardware or software components, one or more of which may be located or embodied in one or more consolidated or distributed computing systems. Additionally, as used herein, \u201cor\u201d may imply \u201cand\u201d as well as \u201cor;\u201d that is, \u201cor\u201d does not necessarily preclude \u201cand,\u201d unless explicitly stated or implicitly implied.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","180","300","190","300","200","180","180","180","180","170","180","170","300","180","180","200"]},"A user of the client device  interacts with the social networking system  via an application, such as a web browser or a native application, to perform operations such as browsing content, posting and sending messages, retrieving and sorting messages received from other users, uploading multimedia objects, and the like. Client device  may also use an application or browser to pull and view profile information for various user nodes and hubs in social networking system .","The social networking system  comprises an object store , and a graph information store . The object store  stores information on objects, such as users, represented in or by the social networking environment . The graph information store  stores information on the relationships of the objects in the object store .","Object store  includes various storage areas. User store  includes profile pages for specific user accounts or members of social networking system . Hubs store  includes profile or hub pages for concept nodes such as businesses, locations, and celebrities. Apps store  includes third-party applications that users may install and run on their profile page. Media store  includes uploaded user media such as photos, videos, audio files, and other types of multimedia objects.","Location database  stores information regarding physical real-world locations, or places, that may be associated with concept nodes, such as a landmark, business, or popular location. Places correspond to various physical locations, such as restaurants, bars, train stations, airports and the like. Some places may correspond to larger regions that themselves contain places\u2014such as a restaurant or a gate location in an airport. In one implementation, each place can be maintained as a hub node in a social graph or other data structure maintained by the social networking system, as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/763,171. Social networking system may allow users to access information regarding each place using a client application (e.g., a browser) hosted by a wired or wireless station, such as a laptop, desktop or mobile device. For example, social networking system may serve web pages (or other structured documents) to users that request information about a place. In addition to user profile and place information, the social networking system may track or maintain other information about the user. For example, the social networking system may support geo-social networking system functionality including one or more location-based services that record the user's location. For example, users may access the geo-social networking system using a special-purpose client application hosted by a mobile device of the user (or a web- or network-based application using a browser client). The client application may automatically access Global Positioning System (GPS) or other geo-location functions supported by the mobile device and report the user's current location to the geo-social networking system. In addition, the client application may support geo-social networking functionality that allows users to check-in at various locations and communicate this location to other users. As described in more detail below, check-in to a given place may occur when a user is physically located at a place and, using a mobile device, access the geo-social networking system to register the user's presence at the place. As described below, a user may select a place from a list of existing places near to the user's current location or create a new place. The user may also provide comments in a text string when checking in to a given place. The user may also identify one or more other users in connection with a check-in (such as friends of a user) and associate them with the check-in as well. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/574,614, which is incorporated by reference herein for all purposes, describes a system that allows a first user to check-in other users at a given place. An entry including the comment and a time stamp corresponding to the time the user checked in may be displayed to other users. For example, a record of the user's check-in activity may be stored in a database. Social networking system may select one or more records associated with check-in activities of users at a given place and include such check-in activity in web pages (or other structured documents) that correspond to a given place. For example, social networking system may select the check-in activity associated with the friends or other social contacts of a user that requests a page corresponding to a place. The user may also add, delete or update events that the user is associated with. For example, a user may update a social event associated with a time and date that the user is planning to attend, or make comments in his wall-posts about a past event he attended.","Location application program interface (API) interacts with client device  to receive photos and other multimedia objects. In particular embodiments, client device  may upload photos substantially in real-time and without user action. In particular embodiments, client device  only uploads the photo in response to specific user actions. In particular embodiments, client device  uploads the photo or multimedia device through wireless network . In particular embodiments, client device  has a wired or wireless connection, such as a cellular connection or WiFi connection, and uploads the photo or multimedia object directly through network . This disclosure contemplates any manner of connectivity from client device  to social networking system .","Location API  may in some embodiments include face recognition application , object recognition application , and OCR application . In particular embodiments, object recognition application may be further broken down into different image processing modules, such as for frequency and wavelet transformation.","Location API accesses photographic location database . In particular embodiments, photographic location database  may be included in location database . In particular embodiments, photographic location database  may be logically or physically linked to location database . Regardless of the particular implementation, photographic location database  contains a collection of photos of various places, landmarks, businesses, and other physical locations, and may include multiple photos for each location or place stored in location database . In particular embodiments, photographic location database  includes, for each photo, the longitude and latitude coordinates associated with the physical location in the photo. In particular embodiments, each photo in photographic location database  includes a direction vector indicating the viewpoint from which the photo was taken. In particular embodiments, searchable text extracted through OCR is stored in association with photo images containing signage or other sources of text. For example, photographic location database  may store the text \u201cHollywood\u201d in a searchable format in association with a photo of the famous \u201cHOLLYWOOD\u201d sign in Los Angeles.","Photographic location database  may be updated to keep the photographs current. In particular embodiments, photos and videos received from other users may be utilized to update photographic location database . For example, if a photo is submitted in connection with a check-in, location API  may add the user uploaded photo by pulling it from media store  and the location from location store , create a data structure associating the photo and location, and store it in photographic location database . In particular embodiments, location API  may pull images from third-party sites  such as Yelp! or Google StreetView to update photographic location database .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["203","180","201","202","203","204","203","204","203","204","50","203","180","180"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["301","100","50","180","180","180","302","50"]},"If location API  determines that the uploaded multimedia object is a video, the method proceeds to Step . In Step , location API  extracts one or more individual frames from the video file. Location API  may extract frames from a video file in any manner. For example, in particular embodiments, location API  may select the first frame. In particular embodiments, location API may select the frame or frames which have the greatest similarity to other frames. In particular embodiments, location API  may select frames at predetermined intervals. This disclosure contemplates any manner of selecting and extracting frames from a video file.","After extracting one or more frames for comparison from the video file, or if the multimedia object is a single photographic image, the method proceeds to Step . At Step , location API  compares the uploaded photo or extracted frames to photographs in photographic location database . In particular embodiments, this process is carried out through specialized object recognition application . In particular embodiments, this step is carried out by location API . In particular embodiments, one or more software modules for comparing textures, edges, smooth objects, and the like carry out Step . In particular embodiments, location API  performs frequency-domain image processing or texture recognition to match a particular object in the uploaded photo to an object in one of the photographs in photographic location database . In particular embodiments, location API  uses graph similarity functions to perform the image matching. In particular embodiments, location API  creates object representations based on two-dimensional shape primitives for each object in the uploaded photo, and compares the primitives to primitives stored in association with each photo in photographic location database . In particular embodiments, location API  creates a transformed image from the uploaded photo using wavelet transforms, and compares the image to wavelet transforms of images stored in photographic location database . In particular embodiments, location API  utilizes a neural network to classify objects in the uploaded image. Methods of image matching and image object recognition are well-known in the art, and this disclosure contemplates any suitable method for matching objects in the uploaded image with objects contained in the images stored in photographic location database .","Comparison Step  may include extracting text from the uploaded image or extracted frames. Location API  may include optical character recognition application or other software modules that, alone or in conjunction, may locate blocks of text, perform OCR on the blocks of text, and extract searchable text from the OCR process. For example, famous signage or the name of a restaurant may be extracted from a photograph. Because of the relative speed at which text may be searched versus images, in particular embodiments, location API  first narrows the set of images in photographic location database  to be compared with the uploaded image to only those stored with extracted text matching a portion of the text extracted from the uploaded image.","Comparison Step  may include a number of performance optimizations to enhance the speed at which location API  may find a matching object image. For example, if the uploaded image includes any amount of location data, regardless of how coarse, location API  may narrow the search of images in photographic location database  to images associated within a predetermined vicinity to the location data. For example, if client device  is a mobile phone, the uploaded image may include location data such as a determined position through GPS or TDOA, or the cell site that client device  is connected to. Location API  may accordingly narrow the set of images in photographic location database  to be compared to the uploaded image. For example, location API may match the detected object in scene  to the Eiffel tower replica at the Paris casino in Las Vegas. However, even the coarsest of location augmentation obtained from client device  would prevent this erroneous location determination. Location API  may, in particular embodiments, use any type of location information obtainable through client device , including but not limited to the carrier, cell site number, whether the user is roaming, and the like.","If location API  completes the search of all images in photographic location database  without a match, the process terminates at Step . In particular embodiments, location API  may progressively increase the search set until a match is found or every single image in photographic location database  is searched. If an object in the uploaded image or extracted frames matches an object contained in an image stored in photographic location database , at Step , location API  obtains the location information stored in association with the matching image. The location information is generally stored as a long\/lat coordinate pair. In particular embodiments, the location information also includes a radius value indicating that the photograph was captured somewhere in the vicinity of a particular long\/lat coordinate pair. In particular embodiments, the location information also includes a directionality value, indicating that the photograph was captured with the lens facing a particular direction. In particular embodiments, this directionality value may be a single vector or multiple vectors. In particular embodiments, the location information comprises a long\/lat coordinate pair, a starting angle, an ending angle, and a radius, creating a cone representing the possible locations from which client device  may have been located when capturing the image. In particular embodiments, the location information is a polygon representing the possible locations of client device  at the time of image capture. In particular embodiments, the location information includes an elevation value. This disclosure contemplates any suitable location information stored in association with photographs in photographic location database .","Particular embodiments of this disclosure provide a method of building photographic location database  from user-uploaded photos. As disclosed above, location API  may determine the physical location of client device  at the time of the photo capture within a variable degree of precision. For example, based on the uploaded photo and the number of photos in photographic location database , location API may only be able to determine the location of client device  at the time of the photo capture within a 50 meter radius, or a segment of a 50 meter radius (assuming location API  may at least determine the direction the lens of client device  was facing at the time of capture). However, in some cases, location API  may be able to determine a pin-point location for client device  at the time of capture. In particular embodiments, where the precision of a location is below a predetermined threshold, for example five meters, the uploaded photo is stored in photographic location database  in association with the determined location. In this fashion, photographic location database  is updated with photographs having \u201csolidly-known\u201d location information. Additionally, in particular embodiments, where a photograph is uploaded in association with a check-in procedure, the photograph may be added to the location database with the known coordinates of the location checked-in to. Therefore, the set of data location API may compare uploaded images to is enhanced, allowing for improved location precision.","Upon obtaining location information associated with one or more photographs in photographic location database  containing objects matching objects in the uploaded photo, location API  may take one or more actions utilizing the acquired location information. In Step , location API may improve the location determination of client device . For example, if the user's client device  has performed a location-determining operation through GPS, aGPS, TDOA technologies, or if the user has self-declared a location explicitly, location API  may augment and increase the precision of client device 's location determination.  illustrate an example of this method. Additionally, location API  may check a user into a location in Step . This method is depicted in . Finally, location API  may tag the detected object in Step . This method is depicted in . Location API  may perform one or all of the actions in Step -upon obtaining the location information. U.S. patent application Ser.
