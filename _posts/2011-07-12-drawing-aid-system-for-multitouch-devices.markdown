{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS","CONCLUSION"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to drawing applications, and in particular, to a method, apparatus, and article of manufacture for specific geometric creation tools in a sketching\/drawing application executing on a multi-touch input device.","2. Description of the Related Art","Manually drawing or sketching perfect lines, circles and concentric rays with a pencil\/brush is nearly impossible. Consequently, drawing aid tools such as rulers, compass, and protractors have been invented. The mental model of these drawing tools is deeply ingrained across multiple cultures and children are exposed to them at an early age. However, prior art drawing applications executing on multi-touch devices fail to take advantage of such ingrained mental models and do not provide equivalent tools that can be executed in an easy or intuitive\/similar manner to their manual counterparts. Further, none of the prior art multi-touch sketching or drawing applications provide a comprehensive drawing aid system that takes advantage of the multi-touch capability available across multiple mobile devices.","In some cases, specific creation tools (e.g., tools to create a line, circle, arc, rectangle, etc.) have been implemented. However, such tools are static modality tools or commands that are separated from the \u201csketching\u201d experience and which are not well adapted to the advantage of multi touch input devices. More specifically, existing two-dimensional (2D) sketching applications:","1. Use single input device and modality to enforce drawing aids;","2. Use distinct tools\/commands to draw perfect lines\/circles\/rays; and\/or","3. Snap\/increments do not interact with line overhang artifacts.","Accordingly, what is needed is a capability to simulate\/use various well-known manual drawing tools with similar capabilities on a multi-touch device in an intuitive manner.","Embodiments of the invention introduce new multi-touch gestures and transient graphic helpers that mimic how real-life rules, compass, protractor, and other drawing tools behave and how these tools are used without disrupting the sketching activities.","Furthermore, embodiments of the invention introduce a \u201csoft\u201d tool activation\/deactivation method that also mimics where\/how these real life tools are usually organized and placed around the physical canvas. This new tool activation method, which consists of tracking multi-touch inputs traversing from the borders of the digital canvas, provides a drawing environment that flows naturally without enforcing rigid\/precise versus free drawing\/sketching modes.","By taking advantage of multi-touch, transient graphical affordances and digital paper concepts, these new drawing aid tools can furthermore be utilized with a greater freedom by dissociating the drawing aid tools position on the digital canvas and the pencil\/brush activities on the digital canvas itself. In other words the digital drawing aids' direction\/angle can be enforced anywhere on the digital canvas and the artist does not need to always position the drawing aid precisely where he wants that direction\/angle to be applied to his next brush\/pencil stroke.","In addition to the above, embodiments of the invention introduce two types of increment behaviors to further emulate\/mimic real life drawing tools. In this regard, real life rulers, compasses and protractors are used to control precise increments like angles or distances. Such behavior is also needed on a digital canvas, by providing increment behaviors, embodiments of the invention enable precise input or overhang control for each brush\/pencil stroke. The overhang control may be better suited for artistic sketching while the precise input may serve the needs of precise drawing\/sketch workflows.","In the following description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and which is shown, by way of illustration, several embodiments of the present invention. It is understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.","Overview","Embodiments of the invention provide a drawing aid system for multi-touch device in the form of a unique set of gesture and transient graphic manipulators that are closely related to their real life counterparts (e.g., ruler, compass and protractor). These drawing aid tools may always be available and can be easily activated and deactivated without the need of entering modes or running specific tools\/commands.","Unique aspects of the embodiments of the invention may include one or more of the following:\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","102","102","104","104","104","106","102","114","116","128","102","132"]},"In one embodiment, the computer  operates by the general purpose processor A performing instructions defined by the computer program  under control of an operating system .

Further, as described above, the client  or server computer  may comprise a thin client device or a portable device that has a multi-touch-based display.","The multi-touch drawing aid concept is based around the idea of using real life-like drawing tools: ruler, compass and protractor to manipulate and control brush\/pencil on a digital canvas. Just like in real life, these digital drawing aid tools can be utilized with both hands and can easily be summoned or discarded from the creative environment.","This premise serves to give the user access to a number of drawing tools, which can help create precise lines, circle, arcs and rays within the digital canvas without necessitating special commands or modes; thus keeping the artistic flow while the user moves from precise to freehand type strokes and vice versa.","Moving away from the constraints of the real life apparatus, these new drawing aid tools will be ubiquitous to the digital canvas and the user will not be forced to use them only from the tool's current position\/location on the canvas.","The multi-touch drawing aid concept can be group in different functionality cluster that will be described in different sections below:","1. The drawing aid tools:\n\n","2. Summoning\/activating of the drawing aid tools;","3. Dismissing\/deactivation of the drawing aid tools;","4. Increment capturing;","5. Different increment modes and relation with the captured stroke; and","6. Cycling between the difference drawing aid tools.","Drawing Aid Tools","Embodiments of the invention may enable various different drawing aid tools. The tools all have the same basic representations and share similar interaction patterns. Each representation has two active position grips (see (B) in ). The user moves and adjusts the size\/direction between these two graphic affordances to influence how the drawing aid influences the capture stroke.","Ruler",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0071"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},"The user has not activated the increment on the ruler. Accordingly, the system is not showing any graphic affordances for increments. See description below for gestures that activate the increment system for the drawing aids.","Once the ruler is activated, the user inputs a first point (D), then the finger follows a wobbly path (E) and then the user lifts his finger (F). During the duration of that interaction, the system traces a straight line (G) that maps to the ruler's direction. Accordingly, the ruler drawing aid tool provides the ability to draw a straight line (G) anywhere on the drawing canvas that is parallel to the ruler's direction.","Compass",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0075"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},"The user can adjust the compass' position by dragging the grips points (B) simultaneously. A circle (C) between these two grips points (B) indicates the relationship between the grip points (B).","The user has not activated the increment on the compass. Accordingly, the system in not showing any graphic affordances for them. See description below for gestures that activate the increment system for the drawing aids.","Once the compass tool is in use, the user inputs a first point (D) (e.g., using their other hand or the same hand if the tool is pinned to a particular display space). The finger then follows a wobbly path (E), and then the user lifts his finger (F). During the duration of the user's interaction, the system traces an arc line (G) that maps to the compass' direction. Accordingly, the compass drawing aid tool provides the ability for the user to draw an arc (G) that radiates on any circle having a center point that is coincident with the compass tool center point.","Protractor",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0080"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},"The user can adjust the protractor' position by dragging the grips points (B) simultaneously. A ray and circle (C) between these two grips points (B) indicates the relationship between the grip points (B).","The user has not activated the increment on the protractor. Accordingly, the system in not showing any graphic affordances for them. See the description below for gestures that activate the increment system for the drawing aids.","Once the protractor has been activated, the user inputs (e.g., using a different hand or the same hand if the protractor tool has been positioned and the user has removed fingers from grip points (B)), a first point (D) then the finger follows a wobbly path (E) and then the user lifts his finger (F). During the duration of the interaction, the system traces a ray (G) that maps and projects from the center grip point (D). Accordingly, the protractor drawing aid tool provides the ability for the user to draw a straight line (G) that is coincident with any line that radiates outwards from the center point of the protractor.","Additional Drawing Aid Tools","Embodiments of the invention are not limited to the ruler, protractor, and compass tools described above. In addition, any other tool that shares the same basic representation and similar interaction patterns may be used. For example, a French curve tool may also be used. Such a tool is a template having many curves that are used to smooth curves of varying radii. A French curve is placed on the drawing canvas, and a pencil, knife, or other implement is traced around its curves to produce the desired result. The same basic representation consisting of two points may be used to orient the French curve and the other hand may be used to draw lines consistent with the curve. Alternatively, other drawing aid tools may be used.","Inconsistent Gesture Resolution","Embodiments of the invention may also provide the ability to resolve gestures that are inconsistent with the intended use of a particular tool. For example, if a ruler tool is used, and the drawing brush stroke is in a direction perpendicular\/orthogonal to the ruler direction, embodiments of the invention are configured to resolve any discrepancies. In this regard, embodiments may attempt to automatically remap the user's gesture to a stroke that makes logical sense and in a manner that remains consistent with both the tool and the gesture.","As an example, referring to , if the ruler tool is used and the user gestures a stroke (F) that is within a threshold angle of the direction of the ruler, the entire stroke (F) may be remapped such that it is parallel (G) to the ruler. However, if the angle of the user's gesture is beyond a threshold value (e.g., more than 30 degrees, 45 degrees, 60 degrees, etc.), the gesture stroke (F) may still be remapped but instead of displaying the entire stroke, only a single point\/dot may be drawn at the point of intersection between a line parallel to the tool and the gesture stroke (F) itself.","Referring to , in the example of a compass, the user may not draw an arc gesture (E) but instead may draw a straight line or an arc that is curved in the opposite direction (e.g., concave v. convex). In such an example, embodiments of the invention may remap the gesture (E) using the first point (D) as the start of the arc. Using the tool as a guide, embodiments of the invention may then attempt to map the final arc point (F) to a nearest point on an arc that is coincident with the circle on which point (D) lies. Accordingly, the arc gesture (E) is remapped to brush stroke (G) based on the closest point lying on a coincident arc.","Referring to , in the example of a protractor, the user may not draw a line that is within a threshold distance from a center point or may draw a straight line that is perpendicular to a radiating line and in a different location on the canvas (e.g., line ). In such an example, embodiments of the invention may utilize the starting point of line  as input, utilize the center of the protractor, and after the last point of gesture  is received, remap the gesture  to a new line that is consistent with the tool use (e.g., to line (G) or to another line having the start point at the beginning of the gesture and a remapped ending point that is a closest point coincident with a line projecting from the center of the protractor (or some other remapping)). Thus, the new remapped line that is rendered may simply comprise a single dot or a line of a modified length that is consistent with the activated tool.","Multi-Touch Gesture to Summon\/Activate the Drawing Aid Tools","The drawing aid tools can be activated by a multi-touch gesture without having to leave the current tool or drawing commands.  illustrates the activation of a drawing aid tool using a multi-touch gesture in accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention. The idea is based on the real world where artists keep their tools accessible in the proximity of the physical canvas. The border of the mobile device  becomes a virtual holding space for all the drawing aid tools.","To active any of the tools, the user simply starts a two finger hold position outside of the virtual canvas (A) and enters the canvas with the two fingers from any of the borders (B). The system detects two incoming touch events from any of the borders (left, right, top, bottom) and displays the last activated drawing aid (e.g., the ruler in ). The drawing aid will display as soon has the system detects this situation and then the newly displayed drawing aid will follow the movement of the fingers.","The user can then position the drawing aid onto the digital canvas. The drawing aid will reside where the user lifts his fingers (D). In other words, the interaction with the user actually drawing a stroke may occur in a location (on the drawing canvas) other than where the tool is located on the drawing canvas; once the tool is positioned, the user can remove his\/her hand\/fingers (D) and still draw on the canvas in a separate location (e.g., with the other hand or the same hand). As explain above, the drawing aid can also be activated via a button  that is always visible in the middle lower position of the digital canvas. This button  acts like a toggle; it activates and de-activates the drawing aid tool.","In view of the above, the outside borders of a device are used as a virtual region to summon tools. Normally, devices are not active in such an outside region. Further, when a device normally detects two fingers touching, the device interprets the detection as a pan operation. Embodiments of the invention overwrite\/substitute such a panning operation interpretation (e.g., by defining a new application programming interface [API]) that enables the detection of events from the outside region. Accordingly, if two input points are a certain distance apart and\/or two different touch points are detected within a certain delay\/time frame, such an action is interpreted as a tool summoning operation. Stated another way, if a touch input is detected from a border, the system may wait a certain amount of time (e.g., a threshold time of \u215b sec., \u00bd sec., etc.) to determine if another touch input is received. If the second touch is detected within the time limit, the system may interpret such an operation as a tool summoning operation.","Embodiments of the invention may also limit such an interpretation based on a distance between the two touch points. For example, in one embodiment, the two touches must be received from the same or adjacent borders (e.g., both on the top, or on the top and right, top and left, etc.) (e.g., and not opposite sides). In another embodiment (e.g., a device with a smaller drawing canvas such as on an iPod\u2122 Touch\u2122), the distance between the two touch points may be used or the location of the touch points may not be used at all.","Multi-Touch Gesture to Dismiss\/Deactivate the Drawing Aid Tools","The drawing aid tools can be deactivated by a multi-touch gestures without having to leave the current tool or drawing commands. Two different gestures may be used to dismiss the drawing aid tool.","Dragging Out Gesture",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0089","num":"0098"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},"To deactivate any of the tools the user simply start a two finger hold on the drawing aid position grips (A) and drags them out of the canvas with the two fingers to any of the borders (B). The system will detect two outgoing (disappearing) touch events from any of the borders (left, right, top, bottom) and will stop displaying the last drawing aid (e.g., the ruler in ). The drawing aid will stop displaying as soon as the system detects this situation.","As described above, the drawing aid can also be deactivated via a button  that is always visible in the middle lower position of the digital canvas. This button acts like a toggle; it activates and de-activates the drawing aid tool.","\u201cImplosion\u201d Dragging Gesture",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0093","num":"0102"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},"To deactivate any of the tools, the user simply starts a two finger hold on the drawing aid position grips (A) and drags the grips (A) towards each other\/a converging point so that the points (A) collide (B). The system detects the two colliding (pinch) touch event and stops displaying the last drawing aid (e.g., the ruler in ). The drawing aid will stop displaying as soon as the system detects this situation.","Resizing of Drawing Aid Tools","The drawing aid tools may be resized using a simple gesture. Similar to the \u201cimplosion\u201d gesture to dismiss a drawing aid tool, a similar pinching gesture that stops short of converging on a single point may be used to shrink or decrease the size of a drawing aid tool (i.e., the length between the two grips (A) that are displayed.","In addition, an \u201cexploding\u201d gesture may be used to increase the size of a drawing aid tool. To increase the size, the user positions fingers on the two grips (A) and extends the fingers outwards from each other to the desired length of the ruler. Alternatively, a \u201cflicking\u201d type of motion in an outwards direction can be used to extend the distance between the grips (A) to the canvas boundary. In other words, the user can two-finger flick his\/her fingers outward (in opposite directions from each other) subsequent to positioning on the grips (A) and the size\/length of the drawing aid tool will extend to the boundary of the canvas. The boundary reached would depend on the angle\/orientation of the drawing aid tool (e.g., top to bottom, side to side, side to top, top to side, corner to corner, etc.).","Extending the drawing aid tool in length\/size may enable the user to more easily visualize the tool with respect to the canvas in order to orient\/position the tool in a desired manner. Further, once a tool has been extended to a particular boundary, if the user elects to reorient the tool in a different direction (e.g., by rotating the tool), the endpoints of the tool may automatically extend\/contract to the canvas boundary at the new orientation. Alternatively, the size of the original orientation prior to the rotation may remain intact. Such an automatic resizing may be presented as an option to the user (e.g., via a dialog box during\/after a rotation or as a default setting).","In addition, it may be noted that the drawing aid tool is zoom independent such that if the user zooms in\/out of the drawing canvas, the tool may remain the same size (e.g., as specified by the user). While a zoom operation may alter the number of increments in the tool, the tool itself may remain in the predefined\/user defined size.","Multi-Touch Gestures to Enable Increment Capture for Drawing Aid Tools","The drawing aid enables the control of the precision and ending behavior of the brush stroke. The user can set a relative distance or angle for the drawing aid. Thereafter, each subsequent brush stroke is influenced by the prescribed distance or angle. See the description below for details regarding different increment modes and how these modes may affect the capturing of brush stroke events.","Insertion of a New Increment","The ruler, compass, and protractor may all share the same multi-touch interactions to add and adjust an increment.  illustrates the addition\/adjustment of an increment in accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention.","To add an increment to any of the drawing aids, the user first activates the drawing aid by pressing on the two position grips (A). The user can then press anywhere on the line\/ray that represents the relationship between the two positions grips (B) (e.g., with the other hand or with the same hand\u2014three finger interactions). The system displays a new increment grip (B) at the specified location, and the user can drag the grip (B) along the line\/arc to which it is constrained. The system also previews and displays the subsequent increments by repeating the same distance\/angle on the line\/ray between the two position grips (A). Accordingly, once an increment distance is established (i.e., the distance between a first point (A) and the increment (B)) the increment distance is used to display further increment lines. The increment distance is also used to determine the length\/size of any stroke created using the drawing aid tool (as described in further detail below).","Accordingly, in , B, and C, the user is inserting\/adjusting the increment in a ruler, compass, and protractor drawing aid tool respectively. To modify the position of the increment the user simply reactivates the two position grips (A) of any of the drawing aids and then drags an increment grip. While  displays the usage of two hands for these operations, some\/all of these manipulations may be done using a single hand with three finger operations.","Deletion of an Increment",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0105","num":"0114"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},"Relation Between the Captured Stroke and the Increment Modes (Precise or Overhang)","The increment can control the captured brush strokes in two different ways. These increment modes are called \u201cprecise\u201d and \u201coverhang.\u201d","Precise Versus Overhang Mode",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0107","num":"0116"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},"In overhang mode, represented by the (A) to (F) stroke, the captured stroke (B) is remapped to finish at the same points (e.g., see how (C) and (F) match). However, the distance from the last passed increment (E) is utilized to sample a pressure release effect\u2014distance between (E) and (F).","These modes work with all the drawing aid tools (ruler, compass, and protractor). For example, in a compass, the increment may be a degree such that when the user draws an arc with his\/her finger, the increment will be used to determine the length of the arc. Similar to a ruler, when using an increment with a protractor, the increment will determine the length of the displayed line. Alternatively, a specific line length may be established and all lines\/arcs may automatically adjust to the specified length regardless of the size of the captured stroke (B).","In summary, when setting the increment (as described above), the distance (D) between a first grip and a point is used to determine the increment distance. To use the increment distance, when the user begins a stroke at point (A), the starting point is remapped to begin at point (A) and the increment distance (D) is used thereafter.","The resulting length of the remapped stroke (E) or (F) depends on whether the user has selected the precise versus overhang mode. In precise mode, the last point of the captured stroke (C) is remapped to a specific and exact increment value (D) (i.e., there is a hard stop or a snap to point (E) based on an exact increment value (D)). Embodiments of the invention can remap the captured last point (C) to a particular increment based on a variety of methods. For example, in one embodiment, the point (C) is always remapped to the prior increment (e.g., similar to a round-down operation). Alternative embodiments may select the nearest increment, round up to the next increment. In yet another embodiment, the system may attempt to determine when the point (C) is within a certain threshold of a particular increment point and based the \u201csnapping\u201d or length of the displayed stroke to a particular increment based on the point within the threshold region.

The first method is available when any of the drawing aid tools is activated and the second method is available via the button that is always visible in the middle lower position of the digital canvas.","Cycling when Drawing Tool Activated",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0117","num":"0126"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},"The drawing aid tools cycle from the ruler (default) to the compass and finally to the protractor, then cycles again in the same order.

The user can also tap and hold on the button to display a drawing aid tool selector (C). The user can select the desired drawing aid tool using the selector (C). These cycling methods are available either when a drawing tool is active or if deactivate\/inactive. In the case were the drawing tool is deactivated, the change will take place when the drawing aid tool is activated the next time.","Logical Flow",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0122","num":"0131"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},"At step , a drawing aid tool is activated and displayed. The drawing aid tool includes a first and second grip (located at first and second touches in a touch-sensitive region of the multi-touch device) and graphic representation of the tool. A relationship between the first grip and the second grip defines a size and orientation of the drawing aid tool that is displayed. The display of the tool may include positioning the tool by moving the two grips based on movement of the two touches\/touch points.","At step , a stroke gesture is detected in the multi-touch device.","At step , the stroke gesture is remapped to a defined stroke using the drawing aid tool. The first touch and the second touch may be controlled by a first hand of a user (e.g., a thumb and pointer finger) while the stroke gesture is controlled by a second hand of the user (e.g., using an index finger).","At step , the defined stroke is displayed. As noted above, the drawing aid tool influences a complete digital canvas space of the multi-touch device and the influence of the drawing aid tool is not specific to the location on the drawing canvas of drawing aid tool. The defined stroke is displayed dynamically in real time as the stroke gesture is detected. In other words, the system may not display the actual stroke gesture but only displays the remapped\/defined stroke as the user is entering gestures on the multi-touch device.","As described above, the drawing aid tool may be a ruler with the grips located at the ends of the ruler and the graphic representation displays a ruler line connecting the two grips. Using a ruler drawing aid tool, when the stroke gesture is a curvilinear line, the tool is used to remap the curvilinear line to a new line that is parallel to the ruler line.","In another embodiment, the drawing aid tool may be a compass with one grip located at a center point of the compass and the second grip located on a circle where a radius of the circle is defined by a distance between the two grips. The graphic representation displays a circle having the first grip as the center point and the second grip located on the perimeter of the circle. Using the compass tool, when the stroke gesture is a curvilinear line, the tool is used to remap the curvilinear line to an arc line that is concentric with the circle.","In yet another embodiment, the drawing aid tool may be a protractor with the first grip located at a center point of the protractor and the second grip located on a circle (where the radius of the circle is defined by a distance between the first grip and the second grip). The graphic representation displays the circle having the first grip as the center point, the second grip located on the perimeter of the circle, and a ray between the first grip and the second grip. Using the protractor tool, when the stroke gesture is a curvilinear line, the tool is used to remap the curvilinear line to a ray that projects from the center point.","The user may easily and simply cycle through the different drawing aid tools simply by tapping on either tool grip.","As part of steps -, increments may be used to control the length\/angle of the defined stroke. In such an embodiment, a relative distance that is based on the second grip is set on the drawing aid tool. Increment lines that are based on the relative distance are then displayed on the tool. If a precise increment setting is used, the defined stroke has a precise defined length that is a multiple of the relative distance. However, if an overhand increment setting is used, a pressure release effect that is based on a finish distance between a last passed increment and an end of the stroke gesture is defined and used.","The activation and display of the tool at step  may be performed in a variety of manners.  is a flow chart illustrating the logical flow for enabling a tool implement (whether a drawing tool or otherwise) in accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention.","At step , a first touch at a border of a touch-sensitive region of the multi-touch device is detected.","At step , a second touch at a border of a touch-sensitive region of the multi-touch device is detected.","At step , a determination is made regarding whether the second touch is detected within a threshold time of the first touch.","If the second touch is received outside of the time threshold, the process repeats at step . If the second touch is received within the time threshold, the tool implement is displayed at step . The tool implement has a first grip at the first touch location, a second grip at the second touch location, and a graphic representation of the tool. In addition, a relationship between the two grips defines a size and orientation of the tool implement.","At step , the tool implement is positioned based on movement of the two touches (e.g., by moving the two grips corresponding to movement of the two touches such as via user dragging their fingers across the touch-sensitive device).","At step , a touch gesture is detected in the multi-touch device.","At step , the tool implement is utilized in combination with the touch gesture to perform an operation in an application executing on the multi-touch device.","In one or more embodiments, the tool implement may be a drawing aid tool, the touch gesture is a stroke gesture, and the application is a computer drawing application. In such an embodiment, similar to that of , the utilization of the drawing aid tool includes remapping the stroke gesture to a defined stroke and displaying the defined stroke.","In addition to activating\/enabling the tool implement, the tool may also be easily deactivated\/disabled (e.g., as part of step ). To deactivate the tool, embodiments of the invention may detect a two-finger hold on the two grips followed by a dragging of the tool implement towards the border of the touch sensitive region (e.g., using the two grips). In response to detecting two outgoing touch events (of the two grips) from the border, the tool implement is deactivated and stops displaying (i.e., the display of the tool implement is withdrawn). Alternatively, in response to detecting a touch event on a tool implement toggle button, the tool implement may be deactivated and stop displaying. In yet another alternative embodiment, after detecting the two finger hold, the system may detect a dragging of the two grips towards a single point followed by a colliding touch event at the single. In response thereto, the tool implement may be deactivated and stop displaying.","This concludes the description of the preferred embodiment of the invention. The following describes some alternative embodiments for accomplishing the present invention. For example, any type of multi-touch device or computer, such as a mainframe, minicomputer, or personal computer, or computer configuration, such as a timesharing mainframe, local area network, or standalone personal computer, could be used with the present invention. In summary, embodiments of the invention provide a drawing aid system for multiple touch devices. More specifically, the drawing aid tools are activated and deactivated using the borders of the digital canvas and are always available without having to change the mode\/command\/tool. Once the drawing aid tools are activated, they influence the complete digital canvas space and are not specific to their current location\/position. The drawing aid tools can be controlled by one hand while the other hand is used to control the brush\/pencil activities. Further, the different drawing aid tools can easily be swapped by a simple gesture. In addition, the drawing aid tools increment system can control different how the captured stroke ends (e.g., with an overhand, or with a precise ending\u2014snap like behavior).","The foregoing description of the preferred embodiment of the invention has been presented for the purposes of illustration and description. It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed. Many modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teaching. It is intended that the scope of the invention be limited not by this detailed description, but rather by the claims appended hereto."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Referring now to the drawings in which like reference numbers represent corresponding parts throughout:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 16"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
