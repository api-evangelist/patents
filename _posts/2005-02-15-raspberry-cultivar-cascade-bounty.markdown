{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTERESTS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The invention was made in part with Federal formula funds pursuant to the Hatch Act and was part of Project WNP00640. The United States Government has certain rights in the invention.","This invention relates to a new and distinct cultivar of raspberry plant with a botanical name of and the cultivar designation \u2018Cascade Bounty\u2019.","Many cultivars of raspberry plant are known. For instance, raspberry cultivars named \u2018Lauren\u2019, \u2018Encore\u2019, \u2018Prelude,\u2019 and \u2018WSU 1090\u2019 are described in U.S. Plant Pat. Nos. 10,610, 11,746, 11,747, and 14,522 respectively. The parents of the new and distinct cultivar of the present invention are \u2018Chief\u2019 and WSU 984.","The instant plant, Cascade Bounty, originated from a hand-pollinated cross of WSU 984 (non-patented), the female parent, \u00d7 \u2018Chief\u2033 (non-patented), the male parent, made in 1992 at Washington State University Puyallup Research and Extension Center, Puyallup Wash. \u2018Chief\u2019 is a red raspberry cultivar released from the University of Minnesota in 1930. \u2018Chief\u2019 produces round, small to medium fruit that ripens early in the season. \u2018Chief\u2019 is highly root rot tolerant and very winter hardy. WSU 984 is a red raspberry selection from the Washington State University breeding program. WSU 984 was highly productive, has long fruiting laterals and produces long conic light colored fruit.","\u2018Cascade Bounty\u2019 is distinguished primarily by its high productivity and high level of tolerance to root rot. The fruit is rounded in shape and tart.","\u2018Cascade Bounty\u2019 is distinguished from its parent WSU 984 by having more rounded fruit, darker fruit color and more acidic fruit.","\u2018Cascade Bounty\u2019 is distinguished from its parent \u2018Chief\u2019 in having larger leaves with terminal, distal lateral and basal lateral leaflets all being longer and wider than Chief. \u2018Cascade Bounty\u2019 has larger fruit, more drupelets per fruit, greater drupelet weight, larger seeds, later harvest season and greater productivity than \u2018Chief\u2019.","\u2018Boyne\u2019 (non-patented) and \u2018Killarney\u2019 (non-patented) are red raspberry cultivars that also have \u2018Chief\u2019 as one of their parents. \u2018Cascade Bounty\u2019 is distinguished from \u2018Boyne\u2019 by a longer petiole, greater length of terminal and basal lateral leaflets and sessile basal lateral leaflets for primocane leaves, larger fruit, more drupelets per fruit, larger drupelets, larger individual seed weight, lighter fruit color and a later harvest season. \u2018Cascade Bounty\u2019 is distinguished from \u2018Killarney\u2019 by a longer petiole, longer leaflets and sessile basal lateral leaflets for primocane leaves, larger fruit, more drupelets per fruit, larger drupelets, larger individual seed weight, and a later harvest season.","\u2018Cascade Bounty\u2019 is distinguished from \u2018Meeker\u2019 (non-patented) in having sessile basal lateral leaflets, shorter and narrower basal lateral leaflets for primocane leaves, fewer drupelets per fruit, larger drupelets, larger seeds, more acidic fruit, more fruit per lateral, more fruit per fruiting node, and greater tolerance to root rot.","\u2018Cascade Bounty\u2019 is distinguished from \u2018Cascade Delight\u2019 (patented as WSU 1090, U.S. Plant Pat. No. 14,522) by in having sessile basal lateral leaflets, smaller leaflets on primocanes, lighter colored spines on the primocanes, greater total number of buds, flowers and developing fruit per lateral, node and fruiting nodes, greater number of fruit per lateral and fruit per fruiting node, smaller length to width ratio of fruit, fewer drupelets per fruit, smaller drupelets, smaller fruit, and greater tolerance to root rot.","\u2018Cascade Bounty\u2019 is distinguished from \u2018Chilliwack\u2019 (non-patented), \u2018Comox\u2019 (non-patented), \u2018Cowichan\u2019 (non-patented, \u2018Encore\u2019 (U.S. Plant Pat. No. 11,747), \u2018Malahat\u2019 (non-patented), \u2018Tulameen\u2019 (non-patented), and \u2018Qualicum\u2019 (non-patented) by having greater tolerance to root rot in a replicated yield planting on a site with severe root rot. \u2018Cascade Bounty\u2019 was very vigorous, while most or all of the plants of these cultivars died on this site.","History and Growth","The seeds resulting from the controlled hybridization of \u2018Chief\u2019\u00d7WSU 984 were germinated in a greenhouse during the winter of 1992-1993. Resulting seedlings were planted in the spring of 1993 at Puyallup, Wash. The seedlings fruited in 1995 and one, designated WSU 1162, was selected for its vigor on a poor site, bright uniform sized fruit, and apparent productivity.","During 1995-1996, the original plant selection was propagated asexually in a greenhouse at Puyallup, Wash., by rooting cuttings derived from root material. A replicated planting of four replications of three plants each was established in spring 1996 at Puyallup, Wash. Subsequently, additional test plantings were established from asexually propagated plants that were propagated from root cuttings or micropropagated using meristem cultures from axillary buds of primocanes. Plantings were established in Puyallup and Burlington, Wash. All asexually propagated plants have been observed to be true to type during all asexual multiplication and the vegetative and fruit characteristics of the original plants have been maintained. Plants fruited in the second or third season of growth after planting.","Test plantings have shown this new variety to be adapted to all tested locations in western Washington. There has been no observed winter damage, but winter hardiness is unknown. Plants of the new variety have vigorous growth with long fruiting laterals.","Measurements","When objects could be accurately measured with an 8 mm diameter measuring opening (leaves and fruit), color was measured with a Minolta Chroma Meter CR-200b, which measure color in L*, a*, b* color coordinates. Calibration was performed using a standard white plate supplied by the manufacturer. These L*, a*, b* coordinates were converted and presented in Munsell color notation. For all the other color measurements, color was compared with Royal Horticultural Society Colour Chart color plates and presented as Royal Horticultural Society Colour Chart designations.","The descriptions reported herein are from specimens grown at Puyallup, Wash., unless otherwise noted.","Size","The number of canes per hill, diameter, cane length, number of nodes, internode length, and color are given in comparison to \u2018Meeker\u2019 and \u2018Cascade Delight\u2019 in Table 1. The planting with \u2018Cascade Bounty\u2019 and \u2018Cascade Delight\u2019 were planted in 2000. This site is highly infested with root rot and over 65% of the cultivars and selections in the planting dying from root rot within 4 years. \u2018Cascade Delight\u2019 has some tolerance to root rot and was vigorous, \u2018Meeker\u2019 is susceptible to root rot and had collapsed by 2004. Data for \u2018Meeker\u2019 was collected from an adjacent planting established in 2001, where plants of \u2018Meeker\u2019 had not collapsed. Even in the 2000 planting, \u2018Cascade Bounty\u2019 produced many canes and was very vigorous (FIG. ). Plants have been grown in the hill system with 10-12 canes retained per hill and the primocanes pruned to 1.2 m in winter. The following summer, fruiting plots were 175 cm tall with a width of 130 cm.","Canes","Primocane emergence was similar for \u2018Cascade Bounty\u2019 and \u2018Cascade Delight\u2019 and occurred approximately Mar. 15, 2004. Bud break for \u2018Cascade Bounty\u2019 and for \u2018Cascade Delight\u2019 was Feb. 23, 2004. When the floricanes were observed Mar. 17, 2003 there were high levels of waxy bloom on the canes making the canes appear Greyed Purple group (186A). The color of the canes depended on the amount of wax on the canes. When the wax was rubbed off the color of the canes was Greyed Orange group (166B). The color of the bud scales were Greyed Purple group (183A). The midwinter color of canes is shown in FIG. . In midsummer (Jul. 16, 2004) the cane color was much greener, Yellow-Green Group (145B). At about 30 cm in height the canes had 20-40 spines per cm of cane (FIG. ). The distal portion of taller canes have fewer spines, smaller spines and the pigmentation at the basal spot and lower portions of the spine decrease. The spine color is Greyed-Purple Group (186A). The spines are straight and pointed toward the base of the canes. There are pigmented spots at the base of the spine that are the same color as the spines. The spine color is similar to \u2018Meeker\u2019 and not as dark as \u2018Cascade Delight\u2019. The spines at 30 cm of a plant grown in the greenhouse measured Sep. 27, 2004 were 2.4 mm long and the basal spot at the base of the spine was 0.9 mm. The canes are glabrous.","Leaves","The upper surface of the leaves is glabrous with some pubescence at the leaf margin. The leaves are pubescent on the lower surface. The leaflets are generally flat in cross-section. The petioles are pubescent and also have spines that are similar (but smaller) to those on the canes.","Characteristics of primocane leaves are given in Table 2. The petioles of \u2018Cascade Bounty\u2019 are longer than \u2018Boyne\u2019, \u2018Chief\u2019 and \u2018Killarney\u2019. The length of the terminal leaflet and basal lateral leaflet of \u2018Boyne\u2019 were less than \u2018Cascade Bounty\u2019. The leaves of \u2018Cascade Delight\u2019 are larger than \u2018Cascade Bounty\u2019, the length and width of the terminal, distal lateral and width of the basal lateral leaflets. The leaves of \u2018Chief\u2019 are smaller than \u2018Cascade Bounty\u2019, the length and width of all leaflets. The leaflets of \u2018Killarney\u2019 were shorter than the leaflets of \u2018Cascade Bounty\u2019. The leaves of \u2018Meeker\u2019 were generally similar is size to \u2018Cascade Bounty\u2019, except the basal lateral leaflets of \u2018Meeker\u2019 were shorter and narrower than \u2018Cascade Bounty\u2019.","The primocane leaves of \u2018Cascade Bounty\u2019 are pinnately compound with 5 leaflets (FIG. ). The leaves have 2 stipules. The distal lateral leaflets and the terminal leaflet overlap slightly. The leaflets are doubly serrated. The leaflets are generally ovate. The tips of all leaflets are acuminate to acute. The base of the terminal leaflet is rounded to cordate. The basal lateral leaflets are sessile and the bases are rounded and relatively symmetrical. The distal lateral leaflets are sessile with asymmetrical leaf bases.","Characteristics of floricane leaves are given in Table 3. There were few differences among cultivars for floricane leaf measurements. The basal lateral leaflets for \u2018Cascade Bounty\u2019 and \u2018Chief\u2019 were sessile, while \u2018Boyne\u2019, \u2018Cascade Delight\u2019, \u2018Killarney\u2019 and \u2018Meeker\u2019 had petioles over 1 mm. The floricane leaves have 3 leaflets that do not overlap. The leaves have 3 leaflets and 2 stipules. The leaflets are generally ovate. The leaflet tips are acuminate to acute. The leaf bases for the terminal leaflet is cordate and the lateral leaflets are rounded.","Flowers and fruit","Fruit of this variety ripens late in the season, with the midpoint of harvest averaging July 12 and the length of the fruiting season averaging 27 days at Puyallup, Wash. The midpoint of harvest for \u2018Meeker\u2019 averaged July 13 with 23.5 days for the length of the fruiting season. Fruit production has not been observed on primocanes. Fruit releases easily from the receptacle. The fruit is medium sized, averaging 3.4 over the season. Early in the fruiting season, fruit was much larger, averaging 5.29 g on Jun. 25, 2004.","Although variable from year to year and among locations, May 6, 2004 was the date for the first open flowers of \u2018Cascade Bounty\u2019 at Puyallup, Wash., the same as for \u2018Cascade Delight\u2019. The lateral length, number of nodes, number of flowers, flower diameter and color are given in Table 4. \u2018Cascade Bounty\u2019 had a greater total number of buds, flowers and developing fruit per lateral, node, and fruiting node than \u2018Cascade Delight\u2019. Flower morphology is typical of most red raspberry cultivars and is not useful to identify \u2018Cascade Bounty\u2019. The petals are White Group (155A), sepals Yellow-Green Group (147C) and pedicels Greyed-Purple Group (184A). The flowers are perfect with generally 5 sepals, 5 petals and numerous stamens (approximately 90, same as \u2018Cascade Delight\u2019) and pistils (approximately 85 based on the number of developed drupelets). The flowers are self-fertile. The flowering trusses are cymose in elongate clusters and at each node on the fruiting lateral the flowers are predominantly borne singly, or sometimes in clusters of two or more. The flowers have no discernable fragrance. The pedicel length, number of fruit and number of fruiting nodes are given in Table 5. The pedicel length was similar in \u2018Cascade Bounty\u2019, \u2018Cascade Delight\u2019 and \u2018Meeker\u2019. \u2018Cascade Bounty\u2019 had more fruit per lateral and number of fruit per fruiting node than \u2018Cascade Delight\u2019 and \u2018Meeker\u2019. Differences between the number of flowers (Table 4) and number of fruit (Table 5) are within sampling errors.","Fruit morphological characteristics are given in Table 6. Fruit is round in shape and glossy (FIG. ). The width of the fruit of \u2018Boyne\u2019 and \u2018Chief\u2019 was greater than their length. The length of the fruit of \u2018Cascade Delight\u2019 was greater than its width. The length and width of the fruit were similar for \u2018Cascade Bounty\u2019 and \u2018Killarney\u2019 and \u2018Meeker\u2019. The number of drupelets per fruit for \u2018Cascade Bounty\u2019 was less than for \u2018Cascade Delight\u2019 and \u2018Meeker\u2019 and more than \u2018Boyne\u2019, \u2018Chief\u2019 and \u2018Killarney\u2019. The drupelet weight of \u2018Cascade Bounty\u2019 was less than \u2018Cascade Delight\u2019 but greater than \u2018Boyne\u2019, \u2018Chief\u2019, \u2018Killarney\u2019 and \u2018Meeker\u2019. The individual seed weight of \u2018Cascade Bounty\u2019 was greater than the five cultivars it was compared with. Fruit of WSU 984 (one of the parents of \u2018Cascade Bounty\u2019) is not available, but in 1994, the shape of its fruit was conic to long conic with the length\/width ratio of 1.4 (range 1.2 to 1.6). This is much greater than the length\/width ratio of 1.07 for \u2018Cascade Bounty\u2019. The Munsell color value for fruit of WSU 984 in a 1994 sample was 6R3\/6. This is much lighter than \u2018Cascade Bounty\u2019.","Fruit of \u2018Cascade Bounty\u2019 is tart, but with a good raspberry flavor. The pH, titratable acidity, soluble solids and anthocyanin concentration of processing ripe fruit are given in Table 7. Soluble solids content and pH of \u2018Cascade Bounty\u2019 fruit did not differ from \u2018Willamette\u2019. The titratable aciditiy of \u2018Cascade Bounty\u2019 did not differ from \u2018Cascade Delight\u2019. The anthocyanin content of \u2018Cascade Bounty\u2019 fruit did not differ from \u2018Meeker\u2019. Although not analyzed in 2004, the fruit of WSU 984 (one of the parents of \u2018Cascade Bounty\u2019) was included in analyses in 1992. The anthocyanin concentration for WSU 984 was low, 56% of the value of \u2018Meeker\u2019 fruit harvested that same year in the same planting. In the 2003 comparison, the anthocyanin concentration of \u2018Cascade Bounty\u2019 was over 90% of the value of \u2018Meeker\u2019.","Because of the fruit acidity, size and firmness, \u2018Cascade Bounty\u2019 probably is not well suited to fresh market use. Therefore, fruit of \u2018Cascade Bounty\u2019 were not evaluated for post-harvest storage.","Fruit production was measured in two plantings replicated plots at Puyallup that were hand harvested. Both plantings were on sites with high levels of root rot. In the planting established in 1996, \u2018Cascade Bounty\u2019 was compared to \u2018Comox\u2019, \u2018Encore\u2019, \u2018Malahat\u2019, \u2018Meeker\u2019, \u2018Tulameen\u2019 and \u2018Willamette\u2019 (Table 8). \u2018Cascade Bounty\u2019 had the highest yield in 1998 and in 1999, but because of root rot in the plots, there was considerable variability among plots. By 1999, all plots of \u2018Encore\u2019 and \u2018Malahat\u2019 had died. In the planting established in 2000, \u2018Cascade Bounty\u2019 was compared to \u2018Cascade Delight\u2019, \u2018Meeker\u2019, \u2018Chilliwack\u2019, \u2018Willamette\u2019, \u2018Cowichan\u2019, \u2018Malahat\u2019, \u2018Qualicum\u2019 and \u2018Tulameen\u2019. Before the 2003 harvests, all plots of \u2018Cowichan\u2019, \u2018Malahat\u2019, \u2018Qualicum\u2019 and \u2018Tulameen\u2019 had died from root rot. In both 2003 and 2004, yield for these plots was set to 0 and missing values for other variables. \u2018Cascade Bounty\u2019 was extremely productive and had higher yields than all other cultivars in each year. Fruit weight of \u2018Cascade Bounty\u2019 was similar to \u2018Meeker\u2019 in both plantings and both were smaller than \u2018Cascade Delight\u2019. Fruit firmness for \u2018Cascade Bounty\u2019 was similar to \u2018Meeker\u2019 in both years. The 5%, 50% and 95% harvest dates were similar for \u2018Cascade Bounty\u2019 and \u2018Cascade Delight\u2019 and \u2018Meeker\u2019 (except for the date of 95% of harvest in 2003 for \u2018Meeker\u2019). \u2018Cascade Bounty\u2019 was also subjectively evaluated in plots established in 2003 that were machine harvested at Burlington, Wash. \u2018Cascade Bounty\u2019 machine harvested acceptably for bulk frozen, puree or juice uses. There was some broken fruit and soft fruit, so it may not be suitable for IQF fruit (Individually Quick Frozen fruit).","Disease resistance","\u2018Cascade Bounty\u2019 is susceptible to the large raspberry aphid () the vector for the mosaic virus complex. It appears to be susceptible to raspberry bushy dwarf virus (RBDV) via pollen transmission. In unsprayed plots, the canes had some spur blight ([Niessl] Sacc.) infections, but with a low incidence. \u2018Cascade Bounty\u2019 has been planted in areas with high levels of root rot (var.
