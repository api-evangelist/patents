No. 60\/362,499, filed Mar. 7, 2002.","This invention was made with government support under research Grant No. GM55600 awarded by the National Institutes for Health (NIH), Bethesda, Md. The government has certain rights in the invention.","The present invention relates to compounds useful as microtubule stabilizing agents. More particularly, the present invention relates to derivatives of laulimalide and the epothilones, to methods of making the compounds, and their use as microtubule stabilizing agents and as therapeutic agents, for example, in treating a cancer.","An important and significant goal in healthcare is to discover and make available safer and more effective drugs for the treatment of cancer. Most chemotherapeutic agents act by disrupting DNA metabolism, DNA synthesis, DNA transcription, or microtubule spindle function, or by perturbing chromosomal structural integrity by introducing DNA lesions.","One important chemotherapeutic in the treatment of cancer is taxol, also known as paclitaxel, which first was isolated from the Pacific yew tree in 1971 (M. C. Wani et al., 93, 2325\u20132327 (1971)). Taxol enhances polymerization of tubulin and forms stable microtubule polymers. More recent studies indicate that paclitaxel binding to Bcl-2 may involve a second pathway to apoptosis.","The clinical effectiveness of taxol (1) is well recognized. Since its approval in 1992, taxol has prolonged the lives of more than 800,000 patients with ovarian, breast, and lung carcinomas. The sales of taxol in 2000 alone exceeded $1.6 billion. Recently, taxol has been approved for treatment of myeloid leukemia and has shown promise in the treatment of a number of other carcinomas, including the skin, head, and neck.","The introduction of taxol, a plant-derived anticancer agent, is an example of the importance of natural products in the treatment of complex human diseases. However, despite its clinical successes, taxol possesses a number of major limitations including: (i) debilitating side effects; (ii) poor aqueous solubility leading to complexities in its formulation; (iii) ineffectiveness against colon cancer and many other carcinomas, and critically, (iv) significant loss of therapeutic value due to the emergence of P-glycoprotein mediated multidrug-resistance (MDR), as well as drug-induced resistance-conferring tubulin mutations.","The clinical usefulness and commercial success of taxol has stimulated intense research to find other antimitotic agents that overcome many of the disadvantages associated with taxol and, therefore, provide new cancer treatments having improved therapeutic profiles. As a result, several pharmaceutical companies currently are performing clinical trials using other microtubule stabilizing agents, such as the epothilones and discodermolides.","A number of these novel natural products deviate from the taxoid platform, and still exhibit microtubule-stabilizing properties. In particular, the epothilones (A and B) and their analogs have generated interest because of a less complex structure than taxol, a minimal structural analogy to taxol, and significant biological properties (K. C. Nicolaou et al., 37, 2014\u20132045 (1998)).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"176.28mm","wi":"72.90mm","file":"US07109235-20060919-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"Epothilones A and B were isolated as a cytotoxic antifungal agent from a strain of myxobacteria found in soil. Subsequently, it was discovered that the epothilones stabilize microtubule assemblies and their mode of action is similar to that of taxol. Competitive binding studies indicated that the epothilones occupy a similar binding site on microtubules as [H]taxol. Furthermore, the epothilones maintain cytotoxicity against P-glycoprotein expressing MDR cells. In addition, the epothilones are active against a number of taxol-resistant cell lines.","An epothilone derivative, BMS-247550 (5), has shown improved properties compared to epothilone B and is undergoing clinical trials. Another epothilone analog, desoxyepothilone B (6), is as potent, and less toxic, than epothilone B (4). Recent in vivo studies using compound (6) showed that it is less toxic and more effective than taxol in an MX-1 human mammary carcinoma xenograft model. Discodermolide (7), another nontaxane natural product isolated from a Caribbean sponge, also has been shown to inhibit mitosis and promote tubulin assembly more potently than taxol. Compound (7) also is an effective inhibitor of cell growth in taxol-resistant cell lines. Eleutherobin (8) and a related aglycon, sarcodictyin A, also have been shown to bind to the taxol site of microtubules. However, these compounds exhibit cross resistance to taxol-resistant cell lines.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"143.93mm","wi":"75.61mm","file":"US07109235-20060919-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"Laulimalide (2), also known as figianolide B, is an 18-membered macrolide isolated in miniscule quantities from the marine sponge (E. Quinoa et al., 53, 3642\u20134644 (1988)). Corey et al. (53, 3644\u20133646 (1988)) also isolated laulimalide from the Indonesian sponge Hyattella sp. Laulimalide possesses significant antitumor properties, and has generated significant attention in recent years because laulimalide shares the same mechanism of action as taxol.","Laulimalide demonstrates potent microtubule-stabilizing properties and also displays significant antitumor properties against numerous cell lines. For example, laulimalide displays cytotoxicity against the KB cell line with an ICvalue of 15 ng\/mL, and its cytotoxicity against P388, A549, HT29, and MEL28 cell lines ranged from 10\u201350 ng\/mL (ICvalues). In two drug-sensitive cell lines, MDA-MB-435 and SK-OV-3, laulimalide is a potent inhibitor of cell proliferation with ICvalues of 5\u201312 nM compared to 1\u20132 \u03bcM for taxol. Furthermore, laulimalide maintained a high level of potency against the multidrug resistant cell line SKVLB-1 (IC=1.2 \u03bcM). In contrast, isolaulimalide (a) is significantly less potent against the KB cell line (IC>200 nM) and the SKVLB-1 line (IC=2.6 \u03bcM). More importantly, laulimalide is 100-fold more potent than taxol against P-glycoprotein-mediated MDR cell lines.","The unique structural features, potent microtubule-stabilizing properties, and low natural abundance of laulimalide stimulated interest in its synthesis, structure-activity studies, tubulin binding properties, and molecular and cell biology. The first total synthesis of (\u2212)-laulimalide (2) was reported in A. K. Ghosh et al., 66, 8973\u20138982 (2001) and A. K. Ghosh et al. 122, 11027\u201311029 (2000), incorporated herein by reference.","Laulimalide also has a considerable structural resemblance to the epothilones, which have generated major interest due to their activity against drug-resistant cell lines. Laulimalide shares a common pharmacophore with respect to the epothilones, yet possesses unique structural features. Based upon a structural resemblance to the epothilones, and because laulimalide possesses the same mechanism of action, it initially was hypothesized that laulimalide shared the same binding site as the epothilones. However, it now is evident that the laulimalide binding site is distinct from the binding site of taxol and the epothilones. Research already has shown that epothilones are competitive inhibitors of taxol.","The present invention is directed to compounds that provide the benefits of taxol, while overcoming various disadvantages associated with taxol, including multidrug resistance. Such compounds are analogs of laulimalide and the epothilones, and can be used in methods of treating various carcinomas, including, but not limited to, breast, refractory ovarian, small-cell lung, myeloid leukemia, metastatic carcinomas, and carcinomas of the skin, head, and neck. More particularly, the present invention is directed to more potent and less structurally complex analogs of laulimalide and the epothilones, in optically active form, that demonstrate biological activities and are useful in the treatment of cancers.","The present invention is directed to potent microtubule stabilizing agents useful in the treatment of cancers. In particular, laulimalide and epothilone derivatives have been synthesized and have demonstrated significant microtubule stabilizing activity. Accordingly, compounds of the present invention can be used in methods of treating a cancer.","In one aspect, the present invention provides compounds having general structural formulae (Ia), (Ib), (II), (III), (IV), and (V).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"chemistry":[{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00003","num":"00003"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00003","he":"206.50mm","wi":"68.16mm","file":"US07109235-20060919-C00003.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00004","num":"00004"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00004","he":"99.65mm","wi":"65.96mm","file":"US07109235-20060919-C00004.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}]},"wherein Ris selected from the group consisting of hydro, OR, and Calkyl;","Ris selected from the group consisting of Cheterocycloalkyl, Cheterocycloalkenyl, Ccycloalkyl, Ccycloalkenyl, CalkyleneOR, OR, CalkyleneN(R), N(R), aryl, and heteroaryl;","Ris selected from the group consisting of heteroaryl, aryl, Cheterocycloalkyl, and Cheterocycloalkenyl;","Ris selected from the group consisting of Calkyl, OR, Ccycloalkyl, Cheterocycloalkyl, aryl, and heteroaryl;","X and Y, independently, are selected from the group consisting of CH, O, NR, and S;","Ris selected from the group consisting of hydro, Calkyl, Calkenyl, Calkynyl, heteroaryl, and aryl;","n is 0 or 1;","and pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates (e.g., hydrates), or prodrugs thereof.","The present invention also is directed to compounds having general structural formulae (VIa), (VIb), and (VII) through (XV).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"chemistry":[{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00005","num":"00005"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00005","he":"243.84mm","wi":"69.26mm","file":"US07109235-20060919-C00005.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00006","num":"00006"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00006","he":"246.21mm","wi":"70.87mm","file":"US07109235-20060919-C00006.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00007","num":"00007"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00007","he":"37.59mm","wi":"68.83mm","file":"US07109235-20060919-C00007.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}]},"wherein R, R, R, R, R, X, Y, and n are as defined above; Ris selected from the group consisting of hydro, Calkyl, Ccycloalkyl, Cheterocycloalkyl, aryl, and heteroaryl; p is 0 or 1; and q is 0 or 1,","and pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates (e.g., hydrates), or prodrugs thereof.","Another aspect of the present invention is to provide potent microtubule stabilizing compounds useful in the treatment of a cancer.

The second therapeutically active agent can be a second microtubule stabilizing agent, a cancer chemotherapeutic agent, or radiation, for example.","Another aspect of the present invention is to provide a kit for the treatment of a cancer comprising a compound of the present invention, or a composition containing the same, packaged with instructions for administration of the compound or composition to a mammal, including a human, to treat a cancer. In one variation, the compound of the present invention and a second therapeutically active agent for the treatment of cancer are packaged together in separate vials, separate dosage forms, or the like.","Yet another aspect of the present invention is to provide an article of manufacture for human pharmaceutical use, comprising (a) a package insert, (b) a container, and either (c1) a packaged composition comprising a compound of the present invention and a second pharmaceutical agent or (c2) a packaged composition comprising a compound of the present invention and a packaged composition comprising a second pharmaceutical agent. The second pharmaceutical drug typically is useful in the treatment of a cancer.","These and other aspects of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment.","Radiation and most chemotherapeutic agents are therapeutically beneficial because they take advantage of inappropriate tumor cell proliferation. Cellular processes, such as DNA damage repair and cell cycle checkpoints, protect tumor cells from the toxic effects of physical and chemical agents. Treatments that modulate the underlying molecular mechanisms of cell cycle progression and resistance to DNA damage can potentiate tumor cell killing and enhance the therapeutic index of the therapy.","Most chemotherapeutic agents act by disrupting DNA metabolism. Because these processes are shared by both normal and tumor cells, and because the maintenance of DNA integrity is essential to cell viability, anticancer drugs have the lowest therapeutic index of any drug class. By identifying and inhibiting cellular processes that tumor cells rely upon, the effectiveness of radiation and chemotherapy treatment regimens can be enhanced. The present invention is directed to compounds that improve cancer treatment regimens by stabilizing microtubules, and reducing or overcoming problems, such as multidrug resistance, associated with prior anticancer drugs, like taxol.","A compound is considered to be a microtubule stabilizing agent if the compound effectively stabilizes microtubules at a physiologically compatible concentration. To be useful as a therapeutic compound, the agent also must not be overtly toxic to a cell at such a concentration. Effective inhibition typically is defined as a compound that stabilizes microtubules by at least 50%, preferably at least 80%, and more preferably at least 90%, at a physiologically compatible concentration.","Microtubule stabilization typically is measured using a dose-response assay in which a sensitive assay system is contacted with a compound of interest over a range of concentrations at which no or minimal effect is observed, through higher concentrations at which partial effect is observed, to saturating concentrations at which a maximum effect is observed. Theoretically, such assays of the dose-response effect of stabilizer compounds can be expressed as a curve, expressing a degree of stabilization as a function of concentration. The curve also theoretically passes through a point at which the concentration is sufficient to stabilize microtubules to a level that is 50% that of the difference between minimal and maximal activity in the assay. This concentration is defined as the Inhibitory Concentration (50%) or IC. Comparisons between the efficacy of stabilizers often are provided with reference to comparative ICconcentrations, wherein a higher ICindicates that the test compound is less potent, and a lower ICindicates that the compound is more potent, than a reference compound.","Similarly, the potency of stabilizer compounds can be related in terms of the Effective Concentration (50%) or EC, which is a measure of dose-response activity in a cell-based or animal-based model. ECmeasurements are useful to relate properties of the compound that can influence its clinical utility, such as compound solubility, ability to penetrate cell membranes, partition coefficient, bioavailability, and the like. Two compounds can exhibit a divergence in comparative ICand ECvalues, i.e., one compound can be more potent in a biochemical assay and the second compound more potent in a cell-based assay simply due to different properties of the compounds.","A number of laulimalide and epothilone analogs useful as microtubule stabilizing agents have been synthesized and evaluated. Analogs of laulimalide and epothilone that have been synthesized, include, but are not limited to, (1) desoxylaulimalide and azadesoxylaulimalide; (2) analogs of desoxylaulimalide; and (3) analogs of desoxylaulimalide, azadesoxylaulimalide, and epothilone. One of the analogs, i.e., desoxylaulimalide (12a), has a potency similar to laulimalide (2) with respect to microtubule stabilization. These biological results are both new and unexpected in the art.","In particular, the microtubule stabilizers of the present invention have a general structural formula (Ia), (Ib), (II), (III), (IV), or (V):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"chemistry":[{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00008","num":"00008"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00008","he":"206.50mm","wi":"68.16mm","file":"US07109235-20060919-C00008.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00009","num":"00009"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00009","he":"99.65mm","wi":"65.96mm","file":"US07109235-20060919-C00009.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}]},"wherein Ris selected from the group consisting of hydro, OR, and Calkyl;","Ris selected from the group consisting of Cheterocycloalkyl, Cheterocycloalkenyl, Ccycloalkyl, Ccycloalkenyl, CalkyleneOR, OR, CalkyleneN(R), N(R), aryl, and heteroaryl;","Ris selected from the group consisting of heteroaryl, aryl, Cheterocycloalkyl, and Cheterocycloalkenyl;","Ris selected from the group consisting of Calkyl, OR, Ccycloalkyl, Cheterocycloalkyl, aryl, and heteroaryl;","X and Y, independently, are selected from the group consisting of CH, O, NR, and S;","Ris selected from the group consisting of hydro, Calkyl, Calkenyl, Calkynyl, heteroaryl, and aryl;","n is 0 or 1;","and pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates (e.g., hydrates), or prodrugs thereof.","Additional microtubule stabilizers of the present invention have a general structural formula (VIa), (VIb), or (VII)\u2013(XV).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"chemistry":[{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00010","num":"00010"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00010","he":"243.84mm","wi":"69.26mm","file":"US07109235-20060919-C00010.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00011","num":"00011"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00011","he":"246.21mm","wi":"70.87mm","file":"US07109235-20060919-C00011.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00012","num":"00012"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00012","he":"37.59mm","wi":"68.83mm","file":"US07109235-20060919-C00012.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}]},"wherein R, R, R, R, R, X, Y, and n are as defined above; Ris selected from the group consisting of hydro, Calkyl, Ccycloalkyl, Cheterocycloalkyl, aryl, and heteroaryl; p is 0 or 1; and q is 0 or 1,","and pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates (e.g., hydrates), or prodrugs thereof.","In some preferred embodiments, Ris H, OR, or CH; Ris an optionally substituted five- or six-membered heterocycloalkenyl group or an optionally substituted five- or six-membered heteroaryl group; Ris an optionally substituted five- or six-membered heteroaryl group; Ris Calkyl; Ris H or Calkyl; Ris H or Calkyl; X is O or NR; and Y is O or NR.","In other preferred embodiments, Ris H or OH; Ris an optionally substituted five- or six-membered, oxygen-containing cycloalkenyl group, or an optionally substituted five- or six-membered heteroaryl group; Ris an optionally substituted five- or six-membered heteroaryl group containing sulfur and\/or nitrogen atoms; Ris CH; Ris H or CH; Ris H or CH; X is O or NR; Y is O or NR; and n is 1.

A microtubule stabilizer of the present invention and the chemotherapeutic agent can be formulated as separate compositions that are administered at substantially the same time, i.e., simultaneously or sequentially, or the therapeutic agents can be administered from a single composition, such that all of the active agents are present in the host in a therapeutically effective amount. Alternatively, the therapeutic agents can be administered to the host at different times, i.e., separately, such that only one or two active agents at a time are present in the host in a therapeutically effective amount.","As used herein, the term \u201ccomposition\u201d is intended to encompass a product comprising the specified ingredients in the specified amounts, as well as any product which results directly, or indirectly, from admixing the specified ingredients in the specified amounts. Thus, the invention also provides a process of preparing a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the present invention comprising and mixing the compound with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier therefor. Further provided are articles of manufacture comprising a compound of the present invention and a second pharmaceutical drug, packaged separately or together, and an insert having instructions for using the active agents.","The present invention also is directed to a method of treating a cancer comprising administration of a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the present invention and administration of therapeutically effective amount of radiation to an individual in need thereof. The compound of the present invention and the radiation can be administered simultaneously or sequentially.","Compounds of the present invention contain one or more asymmetric center, and, therefore, can exist as stereoisomers. The present invention includes both mixtures and separate individual stereoisomers of the compounds of the present invention. Compounds of the present invention also may exist in tautomeric forms, and the invention includes both mixtures and separate individual tautomers thereof.","Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of the present invention can be acid addition salts formed with pharmaceutically acceptable acids. Examples of suitable salts include, but are not limited to, the hydrochloride, hydrobromide, sulfate, bisulfate, phosphate, hydrogen phosphate, acetate, benzoate, succinate, fumarate, maleate, lactate, citrate, tartrate, gluconate, methanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, and p-toluenesulfonate salts. The compounds of the present invention also can provide pharmaceutically acceptable metal salts, in particular alkali metal salts, alkaline earth metal salts, and amine salts, with bases. Examples include the ammonium, alkylammonium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium salts. In light of the foregoing, any reference to compounds of the present invention appearing herein is intended to include compounds of the invention, as well as pharmaceutically acceptable salts, prodrugs, and solvates thereof.","The term \u201cprodrug\u201d as used herein refers to compounds that are transformed in vivo to a compound of the present invention, for example, by hydrolysis. Prodrug design is discussed generally in Hardma et al. (Eds.), 9th ed., pp. 11\u201316 (1996). A thorough discussion is provided in Higuchi et al., 14, ASCD Symposium Series, and in Roche (ed.), , American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press (1987). Typically, administration of a drug is followed by elimination from the body or some biotransformation whereby the biological activity of the drug is reduced or eliminated. Alternatively, a biotransformation process can lead to a metabolic by-product that is more or equally active compared to the drug initially administered. Increased understanding of these biotransformation processes permits the design of so-called \u201cprodrugs,\u201d which, following a biotransformation, become more physiologically active in their altered state. Prodrugs, therefore, encompass compounds that are converted to pharmacologically active metabolites.","To illustrate, prodrugs can be converted into a pharmacologically active form through hydrolysis of, for example, an ester or amide linkages thereby introducing or exposing a functional group on the resultant product. The prodrugs can be designed to react with an endogenous compound to form a water-soluble conjugate that further enhances the pharmacological properties of the compound, for example, increased circulatory half-life. Alternatively, prodrugs can be designed to undergo covalent modification on a functional group with, for example, glucuronic acid, sulfate, glutathione, an amino acid, or acetate. The resulting conjugate can be inactivated and excreted in the urine, or rendered more potent than the parent compound. High molecular weight conjugates also can be excreted into the bile, subjected to enzymatic cleavage, and released back into the circulation, thereby effectively increasing the biological half-life of the originally administered compound.","Compounds of the present invention have demonstrated activity in stabilizing microtubules. Compounds of the present invention can be used alone or in combination with radiation and\/or chemotherapeutics used in the treatment of cancers and other cell proliferation disorders in humans or animals. Accordingly, cancers such as ovarian cancers, skin cancers, head cancers, neck cancers, breast cancers, myeloid leukemias, and lung cancers are susceptible to treatment with a microtubule stabilizer of the present invention.","Accordingly, the present invention provides pharmaceutical formulations comprising a compound of the present invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or prodrug thereof, together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and, optionally, other therapeutic and\/or prophylactic ingredients.","Compounds and pharmaceutical compositions suitable for use in the present invention include those wherein the active ingredient is administered in an effective amount to achieve its intended purpose. More specifically, a \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d means an amount effective to inhibit development of, or to alleviate the existing symptoms of, the individual being treated. Determination of the effective amount is well within the capability of those skilled in the art, especially in light of the detailed disclosure provided herein.","A \u201ctherapeutically effective dose\u201d refers to that amount of the compound that results in achieving the desired effect. Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such compounds can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD(the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED(the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index, which is expressed as the ratio of LDto ED. Compounds that exhibit high therapeutic indices (i.e., a toxic dose that is substantially higher than the effective dose) are preferred. The data obtained can be used in formulating a dosage range for use in humans. The dosage of such compounds preferably lies within a range of circulating concentrations that include the EDwith little or no toxicity. The dosage can vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed, and the route of administration utilized.","The exact formulation, route of administration, and dosage is chosen by the individual physician in view of the patient's condition. Dosage amount and interval can be adjusted individually to provide plasma levels of the active compound that are sufficient to maintain desired therapeutic effects.","Compounds of the present invention can be used in combination with radiation and chemotherapy treatment, including induction chemotherapy, primary (neoadjuvant) chemotherapy, and both adjuvant radiation therapy and adjuvant chemotherapy. In addition, radiation and chemotherapy are frequently indicated as adjuvants to surgery in the treatment of cancer. The goal of radiation and chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting is to reduce the risk of recurrence and enhance disease-free survival when the primary tumor has been controlled. Chemotherapy is utilized as a treatment adjuvant for lung and breast cancer, frequently when the disease is metastatic. Adjuvant radiation therapy is indicated in several diseases including lung and breast cancers. Compounds of the present invention also are useful following surgery in the treatment of cancer in combination with radio- and\/or chemotherapy.","Chemotherapeutic agents that can be used in combination with a microtubule stabilizer of the present invention include, but are not limited to, alkylating agents, antimetabolites, hormones and antagonists, radioisotopes, antibodies, as well as natural products, and combinations thereof. For example, an inhibitor compound of the present invention can be administered with antibiotics, such as doxorubicin and other anthracycline analogs, nitrogen mustards, such as cyclophosphamide, pyrimidine analogs such as 5-fluorouracil, cisplatin, hydroxyurea, and the like. As another example, in the case of mixed tumors, such as adenocarcinoma of the breast, where the tumors include gonadotropin-dependent and gonadotropin-independent cells, the compound can be administered in conjunction with leuprolide or goserelin (synthetic peptide analogs of LH-RH) Other antineoplastic protocols include the use of an inhibitor compound with another treatment modality, e.g., surgery or radiation, also referred to herein as \u201cadjunct anti-neoplastic modalities.\u201d Examples of chemotherapeutic agents useful for the method of the present invention are listed in
