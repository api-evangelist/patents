{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to media content. More specifically, the present invention relates to media content interaction by end users and consumers.","2. Background Art","Optical media players, including Blu-ray players, provide a rich array of media content to homes and businesses. Optical media players, including Blu-ray players, are able to deliver high quality audio and video media content, especially when compared to predecessor technologies, including compact discs (CDs) and digital video discs (DVDs).","Optical media players, including Blu-ray players, also bring unprecedented levels of interactivity to end-users. Interactivity layers in the file and application systems of optical media players, including Blu-ray players, allow end-users to actively navigate a sea of menus, graphics, and special features that may accompany a media title or media series. Similarly, users of optical media players, including Blu-ray players, with Internet access can journey through interactive video games, chat capabilities, and social networking tools, all in the physical space of a small device that can be integrated into a home entertainment system.","However, due to technological and other limitations, media developers and media producers cannot evaluate or analyze the needs of users of optical media players, including Blu-ray players. Existing analytical tools, including web analytical tools, do not adequately tell media developers and media producers either what viewers are watching or how viewers are interacting with their content. Media developers and media producers therefore lack a systematic schema to evaluate the actions of users of optical media players, including Blu-ray players. These problems persist where network connectivity to a given optical media player, including a Blu-ray player, is sparse or intermittent.","Accordingly, there is a need to overcome the drawbacks and deficiencies in the art by providing a solution that enables media developers and media producers to chronicle the journey of a user of an optical media player, including a Blu-ray players, through the media provided.","There are provided media playback systems and methods for monitoring usage of media contents, substantially as shown in and\/or described in connection with at least one of the figures, as set forth more completely in the claims.","The present application is directed to a system and method for monitoring the usage of media contents in a media player. The following description contains specific information pertaining to the implementation of the present invention. One skilled in the art will recognize that the present invention may be implemented in a manner different from that specifically discussed in the present application. Moreover, some of the specific details of the invention are not discussed in order not to obscure the invention. The specific details not described in the present application are within the knowledge of a person of ordinary skill in the art.","The drawings in the present application and their accompanying detailed description are directed to merely exemplary embodiments of the invention. To maintain brevity, other embodiments of the invention, which use the principles of the present invention, are not specifically described in the present application and are not specifically illustrated by the present drawings. It should be borne in mind that, unless noted otherwise, like or corresponding elements among the figures may be indicated by like or corresponding reference numerals.","Embodiments of the present invention allow media producers and media developers to chronicle the journey of a user through these high-quality and interactive media contents.  shows a high-level block diagram of how an embodiment of the present invention may implemented within network environment . As shown in , media playback system  may sit between end-user  and network . Media playback system  may be configured to include display . Media playback system  may also be configured to be connected to display  through cables or other communication means. As illustrated, display  may provide visual and audio signals  to end-user .","Media playback system  may also include optical media player , a unit that controls the operation of media playback system . As illustrated in , optical media player  may include processor  and memory . Optical media player  may be characterized by, for instance, the use of rapid and efficient modulation methods, robust error correction circuitry, the use of reliable wobbling address methods, and high speed recording phases.","In an embodiment of the present invention, optical media player  may include a file system and application environment. For example, optical media player  may incorporate Universal Disc Format (UDF), a file system that can provide the dual functionality of high-speed response to user input and high robustness and reliability necessary for the media content needs of a user, for example, end user . Other aspects of the UDF file system are addressed in , Revision 2.60 (Optical Storage Technology Association, Mar. 1, 2005), hereby incorporated by reference as if set forth fully herein.","As illustrated in , the application environment of optical media player  may facilitate the delivery of interactive media contents from media producers and media developers to end users, for example end user . For instance, media producers and developers may produce interactive contents using the Blu-ray Disc Java (BD-J) specification, which is used to support the Java Micro Edition (Java ME) platform on a media playback device, for instance optical media player . Media producers and developers may program advanced interactive content in the form of Xlets, small applications that perform a specific task within the context of the BD-J specification.","The application environment of optical media player  may provide an interactivity layer, defined as a set of application programming interfaces (APIs) or object classes that wrap or extend network and other media resources peculiar to interactive media contents. With the BD-J specification, media producers and developers may run multiple threads of execution (threads). Thus, multiple tasks may be run simultaneously. Other aspects of the BD-J specification, including interactivity and threading features, are addressed in -1-3 (Blu-ray Disc Founders, August 2004), hereby incorporated by reference as if set forth fully herein.","Embodiments of the present invention may be embedded inside media playback system  or, alternatively, may reside externally from media playback system . In the case that an embodiment of the present invention resides outside media playback system , the claimed system and method could reside in an external unit (not pictured) that is outside media playback system . In such an external embodiment, the external unit could possess a media playback system processor and a media playback system memory distinct from the respective processor and memory of optical media player .","Further, in such an external embodiment, the file and application systems of the external unit could be adapted to conform to the file and application systems of optical media player . For example, the external unit could have file and application systems consistent with the BD-J specification if the BD-J specification is implemented in the application system of optical media player . If media playback system  is a Blu-ray player, an external embodiment may require the hardware and software of the external unit to be compatible. The external unit could further include other elements, including data buses (not pictured), address buses (not pictured), and input and output devices (not pictured).","Alternatively, embodiments of the present invention may be embedded inside media playback system . In such an internal embodiment, the system and method detailed in the present application can be executed by processor . Files and data structures necessary to embodiments of the present invention may be stored in memory .","In an embodiment of the present invention as further illustrated in , internal input signal , which may reside on an internal bus or conductor, may connect display  to optical media player  within media playback system . Processor  may execute instructions related to data contained in internal input signal . Processor  may also create data structures and files, for instance analytic log file , inside memory . As noted above, media playback system  may be configured to output client signal  to network . Network server  may incorporate analytic tools, including web analytic tools, with which media producers and developers can analyze data contained in analytic log file .","The functionality and advantages attributable to optical media system  will now be described further in conjunction with .  presents flowchart , which describes a method for monitoring the usage of media contents in an optical media player, such as a Blu-ray player, according to one embodiment of the present invention. The steps shown in flowchart  are merely exemplary, however, so that a step may comprise one or more substeps or may include specialized techniques, as is known in the art. While steps  to  indicated in flowchart  are sufficient to describe one embodiment of the present invention, other embodiments may utilize steps different from those shown in flowchart , or may include more, or fewer steps.","Turning to step  of flowchart , step  comprises initiating the media playback system with a plurality of media titles or series of media titles. In an embodiment illustrated in , processor  may run instructions consistent with the file system and application environment of optical media player .","For instance, optical media player  may be configured to run standard disc initiation routines within the BD-J specification to initiate optical media player  with a plurality of media titles or series of media titles. The plurality of media titles or series of media titles could include, for example, video content, audio content, interactive video games, or other content. The plurality of media titles or series of media titles may correspond to predetermined media title or a predetermined media series from a media producer or developer.","Turning to step  of flowchart , step  comprises identifying an analytic log file corresponding to one of the plurality of media titles or series of media titles. In an embodiment of the present invention illustrated in , optical media player  may be configured to run a Blu-ray analytic boot loader sequence within the general boot disc loader sequence. In one embodiment, both the Blu-ray analytic boot loader sequence and the general boot disc loader sequence may run after disc initiation routines have completed. Consistent with the general boot disc loader sequence routines, the Blu-ray analytic boot loader sequence may be performed before the first application is loaded in optical media player .","For example, the Blu-ray analytic boot loader sequence may start with a search for whether the file and application systems of optical media player  comply with Blu-ray profile 2.0. If Blu-ray profile 2.0 is found on the file and application systems, the Blu-ray analytic boot loader sequence may evaluate whether there exists a virtual file system exists that is associated with a preexisting analytic log file, for example, analytic log file  in . In an embodiment of the present invention, the virtual file system may correspond to media titles or series of media titles within a predetermined title or series, or media titles or series of media titles produced by a specific media studio.","If a virtual file system is found on the file and application systems, the Blu-ray analytic boot loader sequence may allow for the writing of session identification data to the analytic log file, for example analytic log file . If the Blu-ray analytic boot loader sequence finds no virtual file system corresponding to an analytic log file, for example analytic log file , the Blu-ray analytic boot loader sequence may create a virtual file system and an analytic log file, for example analytic log file . The Blu-ray analytic boot loader sequence may also write session identification information to that analytic log file, for instance analytic log file .","After an analytic log file, for example analytic log file , has been identified, the Blu-ray analytic boot loader sequence could conclude with an attempt to contact a network source, for instance network server , and send the contents of the analytic log file, for example analytic log file , to that network source, for instance network server .","Turning to step  of flowchart , step  comprises collecting data relating to a plurality of events, wherein at least one of the plurality of events relates to the usage of one of the plurality of media titles or series of media titles. In one embodiment illustrated in , optical media player  may be configured to collect data relating to one or more events corresponding to use or interactivity features relating to media titles or series of media titles that are ultimately played by media playback system .","The plurality of events could include a list of predetermined Blu-ray events relating to menu parameters, including events relating to general play features, menu languages, subtitles, and audio languages. The plurality of events could also include Blu-ray events like application initiation parameters, common feature type parameters, navigation parameters, trailer features, resume features, time line parameters, season play features, and BD-Live event parameters.","In one embodiment of the present invention, data relating to the plurality of events can be collected in an analytical start function compatible with the file and application system of optical media player . The analytical start function may implement a step to deposit data relating to the plurality of events into data structures compatible with the file and application systems of optical media player . For example, the plurality of events could be collected in a data string or data array compatible with the BD-J application environment. Collected data could relate to: a disc identifier, a disc session identifier, a timestamp, a time proof parameter, and a Blu-ray event parameter. Collected data could also correspond to a hexadecimal representation of data of a disc identifier, a disc session identifier, a timestamp, a time proof parameter, and a Blu-ray event parameter.","An embodiment of the present invention may collect a timestamp. The timestamp may be taken from an application's running time or the time present on a network server, for example network server . In accordance with embodiments of the present invention, a timestamp also may only be calculated if a network connection is detected.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the analytical start function may be executed in an analytic thread. The analytic thread may be distinct from the main application thread that executes applications within the application system of optical media player .","Turning to step  of flowchart , step  comprises storing at least one of the plurality of events in the analytic log file. As shown in , optical media player  can be configured to write collected event data into analytic log file , residing in memory . In an embodiment of the present invention, analytic log file  could be adapted for use with web tracking technology. For instance, analytic log file  could contain values that appear to indicate the number and duration of website visits, the number of page views, or other values consistent with web tracking technology. Analytic log file  could contain hexadecimal values corresponding to the plurality of media titles or series of media titles collected under step  of flowchart .","In one embodiment of the present invention, data could be written using a data writing function compatible with the file and application systems of optical media player . Such an exemplary data writing function may convert previously collected event data to hexadecimal values. During conversion, the data writing function could use the real-time timestamp. (As detailed above in the context of step  of flowchart , such a timestamp could be collected by offsetting an application's running time from the server time.) An embodiment of the data writing function could also include a routine to determine whether the analytic log file is full. If the analytic log file is full, an exemplary routine could include a method to clear the oldest data from the analytic log file before attempting a write operation. The data writing function could conclude by appending the hexadecimal representation of the collected event data into a memory object adaptable to be sent over network .","In one embodiment of the present invention, the data writing function may be executed in an analytic thread. Such an analytic thread may be distinct from the main application thread that executes applications within the application system of optical media player .","Turning to step  of flowchart , step  comprises detecting a network connection to the media playback system. In , optical media player  could be configured to detect whether client signal  to network  indicates a connection to network . The detection could occur within a function compatible with the file and application systems of optical media player . The detection could include, for example, a \u201cping\u201d or other mechanism to test whether a host is reachable across an Internet protocol network. In an embodiment, the detection may repeat and may occur at predetermined time intervals. The detection may be executed in an analytic thread that is distinct from the main application thread of optical media player .","Turning to step  of flowchart , step  comprises sending the analytic log file to a remote network server if a network connection is detected.  illustrates, consistent with an embodiment of the invention, that the contents of analytic log file  may be sent through client signal  to network server , via network . In one embodiment of the present invention, data may be sent using a data sending function compatible with the file and application systems of optical media player . The data sending function may include a routine that attempts to send memory objects within analytic log file . The data sending function may send the memory object and clear analytic log file  so future write operations can be performed.","Alternatively, if the data sending function cannot send the memory object due to Internet connectivity problems or other problems, the data sending function may append the memory object to analytic log file  and return a value indicating that the memory object was not sent. In one embodiment, the data sending function may be executed in an analytic thread distinct from the main application thread of optical media player .","Consistent with network environment  in  and flowchart  in , the present invention may be used to monitor the usage of media titles or series of media titles. The present invention may also be used to monitor usage of media contents more generally. For example, steps corresponding to collecting, storing and sending a set of events corresponding to media titles or series of media titles may be adapted to collect, store and send media contents more generally. Accordingly, as detailed in the context of , media contents, including video, audio, interactive, and other media contents may be monitored by embodiments of the present invention.","Thus, the present application discloses a system and method for monitoring the usage of media contents. From the above description of the invention it is manifest that various techniques can be used for implementing the concepts of the present invention without departing from its scope. Moreover, while the invention has been described with specific reference to certain embodiments, a person of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that changes can be made in form and detail without departing from the spirit and the scope of the invention. It should also be understood that the invention is not limited to the particular embodiments described herein, but is capable of many rearrangements, modifications, and substitutions without departing from the scope of the invention."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The features and advantages of the present invention will become more readily apparent to those ordinarily skilled in the art after reviewing the following detailed description and accompanying drawings, wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 2"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
