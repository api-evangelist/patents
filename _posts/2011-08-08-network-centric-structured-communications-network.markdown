{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of the following provisional application, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety:","U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/371,879 filed Aug. 9, 2010, titled \u201cNetwork Centric Structured Communication Network.\u201d","Many businesses and governmental agencies experience huge time and cost overruns from managing the operations of large and complex undertakings, especially those involving disparate organizations, partners, teams, and multiple levels of suppliers. Company executives, project leaders, and individuals with interrelated commitments at all levels of operational responsibility lack the specific information they need to make timely and effective decisions in order to enable each organization involved to accomplish both its commitments to the enterprise mission objective and to remain in sync with strategic business objectives.","Traditional centralized management paradigms with assistance from existing tools ultimately place company executives, project leaders, or any individual with commitments at all levels of the corporate hierarchy in the position of being a critical path for information; information that they often do not have. Although traditional management paradigms may be effective when most individuals of a business are located in the same geographical location, as inevitable changes occur throughout the implementation of a project, the executives and project leaders often spend an inordinate amount of time just keeping up with all the changes instead of managing the more important issues. This is especially true when businesses and partnerships span multiple geographical locations around the world.","As a result, there remains a need for an improved system and method for individuals with interrelated responsibilities to understand, manage, and meet their commitments and to be able to alert others when they need to re-commit.","The present invention relates to a method of forming connected responsibilities and linking dependencies in a shared enterprise. The method includes receiving responsibility data comprising requirements data from a first node and assigning the responsibility data to a second node. The method further includes receiving a first sub-responsibility data having a first sub-requirements data from a second node based at least partially on the responsibility data assigned from the first node. Next, the system assigns the first sub-responsibility data having the first sub-requirements data of the second node to a third node. A transmission of at least one commitment for the first sub-requirements data of the first sub-responsibility data is sent to the second node. A further transmission of the first sub-responsibility data is sent to the first node. A connection is formed by receiving link data for horizontal input interdependencies and horizontal output interdependencies for the first sub-responsibility data of the second node. The requirements data can be updated based on receiving updated requirements data of the responsibility data for the second node or any other node and receiving at least one commitment to the updated requirements data of the responsibility data for the second node. The commitment of the requirements data of the responsibility data for the second node is sent to the first node, where, as connections are formed based on responsibilities and responsibilities updated and\/or completed, a dynamic network among nodes is formed.","Another object of the present invention is forming connected responsibilities and linking dependencies in a shared enterprise. A first sub-responsibility data having the first sub-requirements data of the second node is sent to a third node. The third node can receive a second sub-responsibility data having a second sub-requirements data from the third node based on the first sub-responsibility data assigned from the second node and receive link data for horizontal input dependencies and horizontal output dependencies for the second sub-responsibility data of the third node. Received requirements data is based on the responsibility data for the third node. The system receives commitments for the first sub-requirements data of the first sub-responsibility data from the third node and transmits the commitment of the third node to the second node.","Another object of the present invention is to form connected responsibilities and link dependencies in a shared enterprise. The method includes receiving a commitment update for a second node and identify interdependencies of the first sub-responsibility data of the second node in response to the commitment update and transmit, in response to the commitment update, at least one notification to at least one other node that is dependent upon first sub-responsibilities data of the second node. Further, connected responsibilities are formed and dependencies linked in a shared enterprise. The requirements data includes scope of the responsibility, required resources of the responsibility, scheduled start date, scheduled end date, responsibility values, and\/or responsibility objective. The responsibility data can include responsibility name, responsibility description, and\/or the responsible individual node. The sub-responsibility data includes a task and\/or a sub-task. A commitment can be at least one of a promised start date and promised end date for each responsibility. A notification can be an e-mail, a status update, a scheduled meeting request, or a real time meeting request. The status update can be defined, for example, but not limited to, as active, complete, delayed, inactive, pending, planning, or start up. The status update can cause the status indicator to fall below a predetermined threshold.","Another object of the present invention is a network centric management and communications system enabling users with commitments to communicate, manage, notify, assign, link, and\/or collaborate with other users. The system includes a database storing one or more user accounts corresponding to nodes on a network, the user accounts connected by interdependencies forming social connections between individual users having responsibilities and structuring communications via dependency links between interdependent users. The system includes a data server, receiving responsibility data comprising requirements data for creating the interdependencies, transmitting assigned commitments, and updating responsibility data. The system further includes a communications link to provide status updates and\/or notifications of responsibilities to affected users regarding their status so that appropriate corrective action may be taken before one or more commitments to requirements are broken, wherein one or more commitments of a responsibility are modified and\/or updated. The system can host multiple projects simultaneously in the data server. The data system can be a web or application server. The data server removes a completed responsibility and severs the social connection between the interdependent users. A dynamic social network is formed among the interdependent users as responsibility data and commitments as interdependencies are created and removed. The data server can provide automatic messages between users to communicate, manage, notify, assign, link, and\/or collaborate with other individuals. Users of the system include a responsibility assignment user, support services user, personnel manager user, and\/or executive oversight user. The data server can provide a responsibility assignment user interface including a responsibility assignment user environment; a support services user interface including a support services environment; a personnel manager user including an interface personnel manager environment; and\/or an executive oversight user interface including an executive oversight environment. The data server further provides the various environments or user interfaces to users or individuals across a variety of communication networks.","A computer readable medium is provided, having a program recorded thereon for performing connected responsibilities and linking dependencies in a shared enterprise. The computer readable medium includes receiving responsibility data comprising requirements data from a first node and assigning the responsibility data to a second node. The method further includes receiving a first sub-responsibility data having a first sub-requirements data from a second node based at least partially on the responsibility data assigned from the first node. Next, the system assigns the first sub-responsibility data having the first sub-requirements data of the second node to a third node. A transmission of at least one commitment for the first sub-requirements data of the first sub-responsibility data is sent to the second node. A further transmission of the first sub-responsibility data is sent to the first node. A connection is formed by receiving link data for horizontal input interdependencies and horizontal output interdependencies for the first sub-responsibility data of the second node. The requirements data can be updated based on receiving updated requirements data of the responsibility data for the second node or any other node and receiving at least one commitment to the updated requirements data of the responsibility data for the second node. The commitment of the requirements data of the responsibility data for the second node is sent to the first node, where, as connections are formed based on responsibilities and responsibilities updated and\/or completed, a dynamic network among nodes is formed.","An object of the present invention is to provide business, industry, and government operations with an Internet-based self-forming network-centric structured communication network paradigm. The present invention provides a structured enterprise communication network and early alert warning system that links executives, team leaders, and individuals with interrelated commitments to each other and their shared task commitment plans. The present invention also provides the means for communication to all that may be affected by potential upcoming delays to enable timely and appropriate corrective action. Those sharing a common task deliverable will be informed if their counterparts have re-committed, or have fulfilled their commitments. The present invention will facilitate the assignment of a person to a node in the network and will enable that individual to link to the deliverable and person responsible for providing the timely information needed to successfully meet his\/her commitment. Assignments of individuals to a node and this self-forming networking capability will facilitate effective communication of all who are in the network.","Another object of the present invention is to provide, at all levels of responsibility, real time updates via personalized dashboards with visibility of status, progress, and potential delays of any dependent or interrelated tasks. Properly structured project and enterprise information is passed up, down, and across the organizational and enterprise hierarchy to targeted individuals, and is traceable downward to the source of information.","The present invention uses a bottom up approach during implementation, linking individuals responsible for achieving specific results with varying levels of the undertaking and organizational hierarchy. Another object of the present invention is to connect key colleagues to one another on a communication network, allowing upper management and administrators alike to align project objectives with business needs. Upper management can track the functions necessary to maintain the extended enterprise and meet organizational goals. Project managers, team leaders, and unit heads can effectively manage daily operations. Individual team members can create links to others to stay informed on the progress of interrelated tasks.","Another object of the present invention is to provide a self-forming structured communication network and a network centric approach to management. This approach employs a distributed management methodology that empowers individuals to take responsibility for managing their own workload and to network directly and in real time with others working on interrelated tasks, so they can solve problems at their level of responsibility. Thus reducing time delays by taking corrective actions much sooner than is possible with the conventional \u201ccentralized\u201d management approach. This self-forming network is the means by which each individual contributes to the collective work of undertakings, irrespective of the size of the undertaking on which he or she has made a commitment to accomplish an assigned objective.","Under this approach, individuals communicate across organizational and geographical boundaries to collaborate and achieve shared goals. A team leader at each level starts assigning specific responsibilities for producing the deliverable to one or more individuals by providing a description of the deliverable, its strategic value to the organization, the project's business objective, and scheduled start and end date. Completion of the assignment becomes the responsibility of the assignee once he\/she accepts the responsibility and commits to the schedule; the responsibility includes planning how the expected results will be achieved and providing a commitment to complete each deliverable by a specific promised start and end date. These assignees are task or team leaders, who can either complete deliverables themselves or can, in turn, delegate pieces of their assigned deliverable to others. At any level of this network centric approach, deliverables can be assigned to members of an external organization. The Internet-based software facilitates the linking of individuals working in disparate organizations to enable communication with each other and teamwork, regardless of geographical or organizational barriers.","To support the above approach, a further object of the present invention is to provide real time dashboards enabling individuals to manage their commitments. The dashboards can be used for managing an individual's responsibilities, for example, tasks, projects, programs, portfolios; and with its multi-tier self forming networks, will also address business and manufacturing processes, and supply chains. Each deliverable and the person responsible for its completion can be linked to other deliverables and those responsible for interrelated tasks related to the common outcome objective, whatever the undertaking. Dashboard viewers can view and manage commitments. A task dashboard shows the commitments for each user, the scheduled and promised date that has been committed for each, and the status of any dependent or interrelated tasks. A user can reschedule or recommit deliverables in danger of being missed, which, in turn, automatically informs interrelated users (possibly from other organizations) that are waiting for the particular deliverable, providing all affected with valuable decision-making information that allows immediate action to be taken to realign their workload if discrepancies develop.","The self-forming structured communication network methodology of the present invention places responsibilities at the individual level. Each individual can form a negotiated commitment to complete their individual task or deliverable, instead of performing to dates planned and dictated by others. Under this model, individual users participate and plan a promised start and end date by which they can successfully complete the assignment and can negotiate with the assigner so that the project goals, organizational business objectives, and delivery dates are all in alignment. Even after an initial commitment date has been established, it can be adjusted if there is a risk that it may not be met. The changed promise date of any subtask or deliverable is provided to users at each level with a need to know. Users can then determine if interdependent tasks may still be met or, alternatively, are at risk. Users can update their information regarding potential impacts of a given change in real time, sharing decision-making information with the team members and others with higher level responsibility. Managers and executives can use the software to gain valuable insight into the operation of the organization.","Numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments. It will be understood by those skilled in the art, however, that the embodiments may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known operations, components, and\/or circuits have not been described in detail so as not to obscure the embodiments. It can be appreciated that the specific structural and functional details disclosed herein may be representative and do not necessarily limit the scope of the embodiments.","References throughout the specification to \u201cvarious embodiments,\u201d \u201csome embodiments,\u201d \u201cone embodiment,\u201d or \u201can embodiment\u201d means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment.

The account may be used to identify the particular user in the NCMC System . In one embodiment, upon first use of the NCMC System , the NCMC System  may prompt the user to create an account including login information. In response, the NCMC System , may build and\/or create an account associated with the particular user and store and\/or archive the account in one or more databases. Furthermore, each user's account may be associated with or include persistent data unique to each user in the NCMC System  and the persistent data may be updated and\/or modified by the NCMC System  as the users modify the various aspects of their account. The persistent data may include, but is not limited to indicator data, company data, group data, user data, user permissions data, associated project data, associated task data, associated standard process data, and associated step data, and\/or login data. The login data may include, but is not limited to, a user name and password, a user name and a hashed\/encrypted password, a one time key, a single unique identifier, and\/or any other information that may be used to identify and authenticate the user in the NCMC System .","Additionally, the NCMC System  may save, store, and\/or archive, at least one responsibility where each responsibility may include, but is not limited to, one or more projects having associated project data, one or more tasks having associated task data, and one or more steps having associated step data. The project data may include project name, project type, project status, the project priority, the responsible individual's name, the scheduled dates, the promised dates, the actual dates, status indicator data, dependency data which may include, but is not limited to, one or more input dependencies, one or more output dependencies, and\/or one or more vertical dependencies. The task data may include, but is not limited to, task name, task description, the responsible individual's name, the scheduled dates, the promise dates, the actual dates, one or more input dependencies, one or more output dependencies, and\/or one or more vertical dependencies.","The standard process data may include but is not limited to, standard process name, standard process type, standard process status, the standard process priority, the responsible individual's name, the scheduled dates, the promised dates, the actual dates, status indicator data, dependency data which may include, but is not limited to, one or more input dependencies, one or more output dependencies, and\/or one or more vertical dependencies.

In various embodiments, the web browser may be implemented by a computer and\/or by a mobile device, and may support computer programming languages, standards, web protocols and\/or technologies required by the NCMC System  to communicate with the users via their respective environments. Such computer programming language standards, web protocols, and\/or technologies may include, but are not limited to, HTML, XHML, XML, ActionScript, JavaScript, ECMAScript, Jscript, Basic, Visual Basic, VBScript, CSS, Asynchronous JavaScript, and XML (Ajax), Java, Python, Perl, C#\/.net and\/or any other suitable programming, scripting, or VM-based languages. To support the various programming language standards, web protocols and\/or technologies, the web browser may include a language interpreter such as a script and\/or runtime interpreter for computer programming languages such as JavaScript\u00ae, ActionScript\u00ae, VBScript\u00ae, C#, Jscript, or any other scripted and\/or interpreted programming languages that are interpreted in real time by the script, and\/or runtime interpreter which may be implemented within the web browser or by a plug-in. The runtime interpreters may include, but are not limited to, Flash\u00ae or Silverlight\u00ae or any other software module that executes source code, executes intermediate code translated from source code, or executes precompiled source code. Accordingly, in various embodiments, the NCMC Controller  may be coupled to one or more computers and\/or mobile devices across a variety of computer and\/or communication networks, for example, the Internet and\/or Intranet to provide to users the environments in various web browsers implemented on the one or more computers and\/or mobile devices.","In various embodiments, the NCMC Controller  may also be coupled to one or more databases across a variety of computer networks, for example, the Internet and\/or Intranet to store user accounts and associated persistent data in the one or more databases. The NCMC Controller  may also be coupled to one or more E-Mail Servers  and one or more SMS Gateway Providers  to provide e-mail and text message notifications to users or individuals. Additionally, the NCMC Controller , may transmit, communicate, send, and\/or output persistent data, project data, and\/or task data, generated, calculated, stored, and\/or computed by the NCMC Controller  to one or more user environments on one or more computers or mobile devices. The NCMC Controller , may also receive, communicate, and\/or store persistent data, project data, and\/or task data that is inputted, entered, created, generated, and\/or populated in one or more user environments on one or more computers or mobile devices. It may also be appreciated by a person skilled in the art that the controller may also be implemented, at least partially, in a high level and\/or low level programming language coupled to at least one Application Program Interface (API) for one or more software modules and\/or operating systems. The high level or low level programming language may be compiled to machine code native to the hardware and\/or operating system and linked to various software modules and\/or software libraries. The compiled and linked machine code may also be stored in a computer readable storage medium coupled to at least one processor and executed by at least one processor. Furthermore, it may be appreciated that the machine code or executable program instructions may be coupled to one or more aforementioned language interpreters via various remote procedural call mechanisms and\/or binary interfaces, for example, .Net Remoting and\/or Component Object Model (COM).","In various embodiments of the NCMC System , as persistent data, project data, task data, standard process data, and\/or step data are updated, added, removed, and\/or modified as described herein after, the NCMC System  may send notifications, in real time, to the affected users or individuals in the Responsibility Assignment Environment , users or individuals in the Support Services Environment , personnel manager users in the Personnel Manager Environment , and\/or executive oversight users or individuals in the Executive Oversight Environment . Each notification may contain one or more time stamps, e.g., the date and time of when the message was sent, the sender's name, the type of message, the priority of the message, the project the message relates to, the subject of the message and\/or the substantive content of the message. In a non-limiting exemplary embodiment, the notification may occur in the form of a message within the comments section associated with a responsibility or a status indicator of the responsibility, or within a communications section of the particular user's environment. Additionally, notifications may also be sent external to the user environments. In another non-limiting exemplary embodiment, messages may also be sent via e-mail using an e-mail server coupled to the NCMC Controller  and\/or a text message via one or more Short Messaging Service (SMS) gateway providers across one or more Public Switched Telephone Networks (PSTN) and\/or Public Land Mobile Networks (PLMN).","Although  illustrates a stand alone embodiment of the present invention, it will be understood that user environments may be integrated and\/or embedded within third party social\/professional networking services, for example, Facebook\u00ae or LinkedIn\u00ae. Moreover, the NCMC Controller  may be implemented in one or more computing systems associated with third party social networking services. In addition, the stored persistent data associated with users' accounts, project data, and\/or task data may co-exist, within any storage mechanisms implemented by third party social\/professional networking services or associated with third party social\/professional networking services.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["2","200","202","206","208","204","2","2","2","30","34","36"]},"Any individual, with proper user permissions data, may also create one or more responsibilities by for example, creating one or more projects, tasks, standard processes, or steps within the NCMC System . A project in the NCMC System  may be created to represent the breakdown of the work effort into one or more sub-responsibilities i.e., tasks as required to satisfy a customer request by a customer. The customer may be an external corporation or an internal unit of the corporation satisfying the request. It will be appreciated that each task may be further broken down into one or more tasks as justified by the work required. A standard process in the NCMC System  may be created to represent an operational procedure that is performed to satisfy ongoing or repetitive responsibilities. For example, a standard process may include, but is not limited to, the application of a software patch or upgrade to a purchased software tool. However, it will be appreciated that unlike tasks which may be further broken down into one or more tasks or sub-tasks and continuing on as necessary or justified by the work required, the standard process may only be broken down into a series of steps where the standard process is representative of a specific instance and steps being representative of the required step or segment to complete that instance of the standard process. Continuing with the above non-limiting example of the software patch or update to a purchased software tool, the steps may include, but are not limited to, the installation of a software patch or periodic update of the purchased software tool which may be the same step for every patch or upgrade that is applied. Just like tasks, each step may be assigned as a responsibility to a specific individual. Further, it will be understood that responsibilities such as projects may be grouped into one or more programs each having an associated program name.","In one non-limiting exemplary embodiment, the individual user may create a project in the NCMC System  by providing or inputting a project name, project type, project status, the project priority, the responsible individual's name, the scheduled dates, the promised dates, and eventually, the actual dates of the project. In addition, the projects may include one or more tasks wherein each task is associated with one or more deliverables. The deliverables may include, but are not limited to, a specific product or service, either tangible or intangible, that are produced at the completion of the task and\/or project. The NCMC System  may then save, store, and\/or archive the project related information as project data and\/or task data within one or more databases in the NCMC System  after the creation of one or more projects or tasks. After the creation of any responsibility, for example, a project, the NCMC System  may also notify the one or more responsible individuals identified in the respective responsibility data, for example, project data, and send notifications to the responsible individual in any of the mechanisms described herein. However, the creator of the responsibility may not be notified by the NCMC System . It will be appreciated that the individual user may create other responsibilities and\/or sub-responsibilities, such as tasks, standard processes, or steps by inputting and or entering one or more associated information for the particular responsibility or sub-responsibility as requested by one or more environments provided by the NCMC System  and transmitting, sending, and\/or submitting the associated information for the particular responsibility to the NCMC System .","Optionally, each responsibility may also be associated with one or more horizontal interdependencies. Horizontal interdependencies may include one or more horizontal input dependencies  and\/or one or more horizontal output dependencies . A horizontal input dependency  occurs when one or more pre-requisite responsibilities, conditions, resources, and\/or deliverables that must be completed or satisfied before the individual having a responsibility may begin or finish their assigned responsibility. Horizontal output dependency  occurs when one or more responsibilities is dependent upon the current responsibility held by the individual and the conditions, resources, and\/or deliverables must have occurred, freed, and\/or been completed by the current responsibility held by the individual before a dependent responsibility may begin or finish.","In the NCMC System , an assignor node, for example, Assignor A , may have one or more responsibilities where each responsibility may be associated with one or more objectives identified in the requirements that must be fulfilled. As a holder of responsibility, the assignor node may delegate or assign one or more sub-responsibilities to an assignee node, such as, for example Assignee\/Assignor B . The assignee node, for example, Assignee\/Assignor B , in response to the assigned sub-responsibility, may gain an understanding of the sub-responsibility requirements, the alignment of enterprise objectives, the commitment for specific deliverables and commit to the scheduled date of completion of the responsibility from the assignor node, for example, Assignor A  within the NCMC System . In a non-limiting exemplary embodiment, an assignee node, for example, Assignee\/Assignor B,  may commit to a responsibility within the NCMC System  by entering, modifying, and\/or updating the promised start and promised end dates of the assigned responsibility to conform to the scheduled start and scheduled end date provided by the assignor node, for example, Assignor A , to the NCMC System . After the responsibility has been committed, the assignee node, for example, Assignee\/Assignor B  may identify one or more interdependencies within the NCMC System  with other individual nodes, for example, Node D  and\/or Node E  in the NCMC System . After the assignee node, for example, Assignee\/Assignor B  identifies one or more interdependencies, the assignee node may link their current responsibilities within the NCMC System  with one or more horizontal interdependencies, for example, Node D  and\/or Node E .","Alternatively, based on the understandings and determinations of the assignee node, for example, Assignee\/Assignor B , the assignee node may also negotiate the requirements of the responsibility, for example, new promised date for the responsibility and commit to the new promised date for the responsibility within the NCMC System . In another non-limiting exemplary embodiment, the assignor node, for example, Assignor A , may modify and\/or update the scheduled dates for the assigned responsibility and in response, the assignee node, for example, Assignee\/Assignor B  modifies and\/or updates the promised start date and promised end date to conform with that of the modified and\/or updated scheduled dates thereby committing to the responsibility. Moreover, to determine or calculate whether the scheduled and promised dates are in conformity, the NCMC System  may compare the promised start date and promised end date is equal to or less than the scheduled end date. Therefore, if the promised end date is equal to or less than the scheduled end date, then the NCMC System  may determine that the dates are in conformity and the NCMC System  may indicate in the respective environments for each user or individual, for example, the Assignor A  and\/or Assignee\/Assignor B , that the responsibility has been committed by the assignee node, for example, Assignee\/Assignor B . After a commitment is made by the assignee node, for example, Assignee\/Assignor B  and approved by the assignor node, for example, Assignor A , a vertical interdependency is formed between the responsibility of the assignor node and the sub-responsibility of the assignee node, and the assignee node becomes a holder of responsibility. In response, the NCMC System  may create and\/or generate dependency data based on the vertical dependency link between the responsibility and assigned sub-responsibility and save store and\/or archive the created and\/or generated dependency data in Database  of .","As a new holder of responsibility, the assignee node, for example, Assignee\/Assignor B , is a child node within the organizational commitment's hierarchy of objectives where the assignor node is the parent node. The assignee node, for example, Assignee\/Assignor B , may separate or break down the assigned responsibility into a discrete set of sub-responsibilities and further delegate or assign one or more sub-responsibilities to other individual nodes, for example, Assignee C  thereby becoming an assignor node with respect to the other individual node, such as, for example Assignee C . As more and more individual nodes receive responsibilities, break down their responsibilities into sub-responsibilities, and delegate or assign their sub-responsibilities to other individual nodes, a sub-network of individuals working on interdependent responsibilities that is interconnected by vertical and horizontal interdependencies is formed within the NCMC System . Therefore, in accordance with one objective of the present invention, the network of interdependences form the backbone of the socially connected structured communications network in the NCMC System  where each dependency link between the interdependencies creates or sets up a communications link between those individual nodes responsible for completing interrelated responsibilities or sub-responsibilities.","Additionally, users or individuals within the NCMC System  may be connected by interrelated responsibilities where each responsibility may create or set up one or more communications link to other unique individuals regardless of organization and geographic boundaries. In one non-limiting exemplary embodiment of , the Node D  may be a Responsibility Assignment User  at company D located in city D responsible for manufacturing a widget, the Assignee\/Assigner B may be Responsibility Assignment User  at company B located in city B who is assigned the sub-responsibilities of receiving the widget from Node D , modifying the widget, and supplying the widget to Node E  by Assigner A , a Personnel Manager User , at company A located in city A, where Node E may be an Personnel Manager User  at company E located in city E. Additionally, modification of the widget may further be broken down into sub-responsibilities where one such sub-responsibility may be assigned to Assignee C  who may be a Responsibility Assignment User  or Support Services User  at company C located in city C. The interrelated responsibilities of receiving, modifying, and supplying the widget may create or setup a communication link from Assignee\/Assignor B  to Node A , Node D , Node E , and Node C . The communications link may then be used by the NCMC System  to provide real time status updates and\/or notifications of responsibilities and\/or sub-responsibilities to affected users or individuals regarding their status so that appropriate corrective action may be taken before one or more commitments to requirements are broken when one or more commitments of a responsibility are modified and\/or updated by any of their responsible or accountable users or individuals. It will be appreciated that as one or more responsibilities are completed by individuals, dependency data associated with horizontal and vertical dependencies of one or more interrelated responsibilities for the completed responsibility may be removed and\/or deleted and consequently, severing the communication link between the interrelated responsibility holders. Thus, as nodes connect based on their interconnected responsibilities with other nodes and disconnect from their nodes as responsibilities are completed, a dynamic social network among users and individuals is formed within the NCMC System .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["2","300","302","2","2","2","30","36","2","2","20","2","20","20","2"]},"As with any complex undertakings involving disparate organization, partners, teams, and multiple levels of suppliers, inevitable changes may occur throughout various phases of a large enterprise which may affect one or more promised or committed dates for one or more responsibilities. Therefore, to provide transparency of responsibility status to all individuals that may be affected by changes to one or more responsibilities, the NCMC System  may provide one or more monitors to the environments for display to the individuals. The one or more monitors may include, but are not limited to, workload (not shown), responsibility status, a current progress indicator, and\/or one or more status indicators for each responsibility. The responsibility status may be configured by any individual with access permission. The responsibility status indicators may include, but are not limited to, whether the responsibility is currently scheduled, started, and\/or completed, and\/or suspended. The current progress indicator may include an aggregate numerical value that is indicative of the amount of work already performed for a particular responsibility. The workload may include, but is not limited to a numerical value indicating the estimated number of hours and days required for an associated responsibility. The status indicators may include a Time Line Indicator, a Budget Indicator, a Resources Indicator, an Issues Indicator, and a Risks Indicator. The NCMC System  may calculate the Time Line Indicator based on the scheduled, promised, actual, and sub-task dates for an associated responsibility. Moreover, in one non-limiting exemplary embodiment, the NCMC System  may compare the scheduled, promised, actual, and sub-task dates, and provide an aggregate severity indicator for the particular responsibility. The Budget, Resources, Issues, and Risks Indicator may be set by the individual nodes accountable for the particular responsibility to provide notice and visibility to all individual nodes linked by interdependences of a particular responsibility on any budget matters, any resource matter, particular issues, and\/or risks for that particular responsibility. In another non-limiting exemplary embodiment, each indicator may be a color coded circle displayed in proximity or associated with each responsibility in the respective environments. Alternatively, at least some status indicators may include semi-circles with one half representing the current status of the particular responsibility, and the other half representing an aggregate status of the particular responsibility without consideration of any sub-responsibilities including the status of any interdependent responsibilities. Each color may be associated with a particular severity of the status for a particular status indicator. In a non-limiting exemplary embodiment, the red colored indicator may indicate the most severe condition for a particular status whereas a green color indicator may indicate that there are no outstanding issues of any concern for the particular status. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that indicators may not be limited to color coded circles and\/or semi-circles as any other means to place the user on notice regarding particular issues of one or more responsibilities may be appreciated, for example, a one or more numerical score in a fixed range for each indicator.","In one embodiment, an individual node with a newly assigned responsibility may further clarify their assigned objectives for the responsibility by creating a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS). A WBS is a deliverable-oriented hierarchical decomposition of work to be produced, executed, and\/or performed. Individual nodes may break their assigned responsibility into one or more sub-responsibilities (step ). In particular, the individual nodes may breakdown a project, a task or a standard process within the NCMC System , into discrete set component parts, where each part may fulfill the objective of the assigned responsibility. Based on the WBS for the assigned responsibility, the individual node may add one or more tasks or sub-tasks, in the NCMC System , within their assigned responsibility, for example, their assigned project to track progress of individual tasks within their assigned responsibility where each individual task may produce one or more deliverables that fulfills each individual task's objectives. Similar to other responsibilities, each task or sub-task may also be associated with one or more requirements which, as previously described, may include, but are not limited to, the output of the responsibility, i.e., a deliverable, a description of the responsibility, the responsibility's business objective, value of responsibility, objective of the responsibility, scheduled dates, promise dates, and\/or actual dates. To facilitate the individual nodes in assigning their sub-responsibility in the NCMC System , the NCMC System  may provide a planner, which enables the individual nodes to add new tasks or sub-tasks and\/or calculate a scheduled start and end date for each task or sub-task based on duration of the parent responsibility and lead times or lag times. Each task or sub-task added may be saved, stored, and\/or archived by the NCMC System  in one or more databases within the NCMC System  as task data.","In the embodiment of , after responsibilities have been broken down into sub-responsibilities, the sub-responsibilities may be provisionally assigned or delegated to a responsible individual node (step ). Accordingly, the NCMC System  may provide in the respective environments of individuals, input fields, boxes, and\/or other areas associated with the sub-responsibility for provisional assignment of one or more sub-responsibilities to one or more individual nodes. Additionally, the NCMC System  may receive the provisional assignments of sub-responsibilities to individual nodes from respective environments, and store the provisional assignments in one or more databases.","In the embodiment of , after the provisional assignments for responsibilities have been entered and\/or saved, stored, or archived within the NCMC System , the individual node may choose to implement the provisional assignment by delegating or assigning the responsibility (step ) to one or more responsible users or individuals such that the one or more responsible individual nodes may also receive one or more responsibilities where each responsibility is associated with a set of requirements. As previously described, the NCMC System  may provide notifications to the newly assigned responsible individual to notify him or her of the newly assigned responsibility and transmit, send, and\/or output the newly assigned responsibility in the respective user environment for display to the individual node. The NCMC System  may then perform the logic flow of  described herein based on, at least partially, the individual node's inputs in their respective environment.","Based on, at least partially, each individuals work load, work experience, scheduling conflicts, and\/or other factors that may affect the individual's velocity or capability to perform work, the individual may negotiate one or more requirements (step ) with the individual who assigned the responsibility i.e. the assignor node. Therefore, in accordance with another object of the present invention, the individual nodes may negotiate requirements (step ) which may include, but is not limited to a promise or committed start date and\/or promise or committed end date with their respective assignor node for their responsibilities and based on the negotiation, input one or more promised or committed dates within the NCMC System . In response, the NCMC System  may update the requirements data of the responsibility with the promised or committed dates and transmit, send, and\/or output the updated requirements data including the promised or committed dates to the assignor node for display. As previously described, if the user or individual provided schedule dates and promise dates are in conformity, then it is understood that the requirements of the responsibility are committed (step ) To facilitate negotiation between individual nodes, the NCMC System  may also provide one or more real time synchronous conferencing mechanisms. In a non-limiting exemplary embodiment, the NCMC System  may enable either the assignor node and\/or the assignee node to schedule and\/or initiate a real time conference using a text messaging conference or a real time voice communications protocol, for example, Voice Over Internet Protocol (VOIP) between the nodes for further negotiation on one or more requirements between individual nodes. Alternatively, in another non-limiting exemplary embodiment, the NCMC System , may also provide or create meeting requests in between the individual nodes and send e-mail notifications for meeting request using the e-mail server .","After the responsibility with requirements has been committed (step ), and sub-responsibilities, if any, are broken down into one or more sub-responsibilities and, optionally, assigned to other individual nodes, the individual node may identify and link one or more horizontal interdependencies (step ) within the NCMC System  and create a dependency link between the other responsibilities and the newly committed responsibility. Various types of dependency links may be created within the NCMC System . Accordingly, based on the specific nature of the responsibilities, the dependency link may be created for finish to start, start to finish, start to start, or finish or finish. Finish to start dependency link may be created when a second responsibility cannot begin before the first responsibility is completed. Start to finish dependency link may be created when the second responsibility cannot be completed before the first responsibility begins. Start to start dependency link may be created when the second responsibility cannot begin before the first responsibility begins. Finish to finish dependency may be created when the second responsibility cannot complete before the first responsibility completes. To facilitate the user in linking tasks and creating dependencies, the NCMC System  may retrieve from one or more databases a list of all projects, tasks, and sub-tasks stored within NCMC System  and transmit, communicate, send, and\/or output one or more projects and tasks for display to the individual in their respective environments. The individual may then select one or more tasks displayed and link the selected task to an existing task based on a selected dependency type. The NCMC System , in response, may create a communication link between those individuals responsible for completing the tasks, which may be used by the NCMC System  to notify the individuals, in real time, of one or more material changes that may affect at least one commitment date of one or more responsibilities. Additionally, the individual nodes may also modify the lead time or lag times in a specified unit of time (days, weeks, and\/or months) associated with each interdependent responsibility. After a dependency link is created, the NCMC System  may receive the dependency link data from respective environments, save, store, and\/or archive the dependency link in one or more databases as dependency data, and associate the dependency link between one or more interdependent responsibility.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["2","400","2","402","404","2","2","2","406","2","408","410","2","2"]},"In another embodiment of , if the status indicator update is one of Budget Indicator, Resources Indicator, Issues Indicator, and Risks Indicator, the NCMC System  may require the responsible individual node for the responsibility to provide an explanation or comment regarding the particular status indicator update if the particular status indicator update is below a predetermined threshold. In one non-limiting exemplary embodiment, if an individual node updates the Budget Indicator by downgrading below a certain predetermined threshold, the NCMC System  may prompt the individual node for input, such as an explanation or comment on the newly updated status. The NCMC System  may receive the newly updated status including explanation or comment and save, store, and\/or archive the status indicator update and any corresponding explanation or comment in one or more databases. To provide affected individuals with the most up-to-date status on their affected responsibilities, the NCMC System  may also transmit, send, and\/or output the newly updated status indicator including any explanation or comments to environments for display to the affected individuals. Additionally, notifications as previously described herein may also be sent to affected individuals regarding the status indicator for a particular responsibility accountable or responsible by the affected individual.","In another embodiment of , to further facilitate communications between the affected individuals regarding a particular status update, the NCMC System  may also provide one or more real time synchronous conferencing mechanisms as previously described. In a non-limiting exemplary embodiment, the NCMC System  may enable any of the affected individuals to schedule and\/or initiate a conference using a real time text messaging conference or a real time voice communications protocol, for example, Voice Over Internet Protocol (VOIP) between all affected individuals.","It will be understood that the NCMC System  may send or receive notifications not only in response to commitment updates as those illustrated with respect to the logic flow of . In one non-limiting embodiment, the NCMC System  may send notifications based on one or more system events in the NCMC System . In one non-limiting exemplary embodiment, the NCMC System  may send notifications via any of the mechanisms previously described herein to notify users and individuals of their upcoming promised dates before the date of their promised date. The number of dates to notify users and individuals may be predetermined by the NCMC System  or may be updated, modified, and\/or configured by the user and\/or individual in their respective environments. In another non-limiting embodiment, a user event may be created within the NCMC System  which may alert a user based on one or more pre-defined trigger events within the NCMC System . In another exemplary embodiment, notifications may be sent using any of the previously described mechanisms when a particular user or individual has not logged into the NCMC System  within a defined set number of days.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":["FIGS. 5","FIGS. 5"],"i":["a","b ","a","b"],"b":["5","2","5","2","2","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIGS. 5","i":["a","b "],"b":["5","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":["FIGS. 5","FIG. 5"],"i":["a","b ","b"],"b":["5","502","500","504","506","508","2","508","506"]},"Individuals may also select one or more responsibilities by clicking the name of the responsibility and view any of the responsibilities linked by vertical interdependencies or horizontal interdependencies.
