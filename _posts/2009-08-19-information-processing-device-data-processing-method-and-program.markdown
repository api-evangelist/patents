Field of the Invention","The invention relates to an information processing device, a data processing method, and a program, and more particularly, to an information processing device, a data processing method, and a program, which are configured to perform a content writing process or a content copying process on a recording medium.","2. Description of Related Art","DVD (Digital Versatile Disc), Blu-ray Disc (registered trademark), and the like are often used as recording mediums for various content such as music and movies. These information recording mediums having data recorded thereon include mediums (ROM type) not permitting the writing of new data thereto and mediums (R type, RE type, and the like) permitting the writing of data thereto. By using the data-writable information recording mediums, it is possible to copy or move content recorded in other mediums. For example, it is also possible to download and record content, for example, through a network or by the use of devices installed in public locations.","In addition to the DVD and the Blu-ray Disc (registered trademark), hard disks and flash memories are used as the recording mediums on which content is recorded.","Examples of a process type of recording content on a recording medium include the followings:","(a) a process of copying (or moving) content from a medium (for example, a ROM disk) having the content recorded thereon to another medium;","(b) a process of downloading and recording content from a server; and","(c) a process of recording content by the use of a terminal located in a public space such as a front of a store.","However, the copyright, the distribution right, and the like of various types of content such as music data and image data are possessed by the authors or sellers thereof. Therefore, when content is provided to users, predetermined usage restriction is generally taken, that is, the usage of the content is permitted to only a user having the regular right of usage and unauthorized copying is not permitted.","For example, AACS (Advanced Access Content System) is known as a standard for usage restriction of content. In the AACS standard, when a content is copied between the mediums like (a), this copy process is based on the premise that copy permission information should be acquired from a management server. That is, the copy process is permitted under predetermined management. This copy process is called managed copy (MC).","The content providing process of (b), that is, the download type content providing process, is called EST (Electric Sell Through). The content providing process of (c) using public terminals is called MoD (Manufacturing on Demand) The AACS standard requires these processes to be performed in accordance with a predetermined rule.","The following three processes will be described in brief with reference to :","(a) Managed Copy (MC);","(b) EST (Electric Sell Through); and","(c) MoD (Manufacturing on Demand).","(a) Managed Copy (MC)","For example, as shown in (a) of , the managed copy (MC) is a process of allowing a user  to set an information recording medium (disk)  having a content recorded thereon to an information processing device  performing a data recording and reproducing process and copying the content read from the information recording medium (disk)  to, for example, a data-writable R\/RE type disk such as an R type or RE type or a second information recording medium  such as a hard disk or a flash memory.","At the time of performing this content copying process, it is necessary that the data recording and reproducing device  accesses a management server  via a network  and obtains the permission to content copy from the management server .","A configuration for performing the content copying process between plural mediums by the use of a single information processing device, that is, only one device, is shown in , but two devices of a device having a medium as a copy source attached thereto and another device having a medium as a copy destination attached thereto may be connected to each other with, for example, a USB cable or the like.","(b) EST (Electric Sell Through)","The process of downloading content from a server and recording the content on an information recording medium is called EST (Electric Sell Through). As shown in (b) of , the EST is a process of fitting a user's medium, for example, a data-writable R or RE type disk , into an information processing device  such as a PC possessed by the user  and receiving and recording a content from a content server (EST server)  through a network .","(c) MoD (Manufacturing on Demand)","The content providing process using a public terminal is called MoD (Manufacturing on Demand). As shown in (c) of , the MoD is performed when a user  intends to record content on a medium using a content server  as a terminal installed in public spaces such as convenience stores or stations. The MoD is a process of allowing the user  to set the user's data-writable medium such as an R or RE type disk  into the content server (MoD server)  as the terminal of a convenience store  and recording desired content on the disk  according to the operation by the user  such as selection of content.","The processes of (a) to (c) are described, for example, in JP-A-2008-98765.","In this way, users can record content on data-writable mediums and utilize (reproduce and the like) the recorded content. However, for example, when the content is to be protected by copyright, it is necessary to control the usage of content to prevent unauthorized usage.","As described above, the AACS (Advanced Access Content System) is known as a standard for the content copyright protection techniques. In the AACS standard, usage control information (usage rule) corresponding to content is defined and the content is used in accordance with the usage control information (usage rule). In addition, strict usage control is realized by dividing content into units, preparing encrypted content using unit keys corresponding to the units, and allowing only a specific user to acquire the unit keys.","When the disk having content recorded thereon is a medium such as a ROM type disk permitting only reproduction and not permitting the writing of new data, additional writing or editing of new content is not performed on the medium. Therefore, it is possible to provide users with the content-specific control information (usage rule) or unit keys corresponding to the content recorded on the medium in a state where the usage rule or unit keys are recorded on the medium.","However, in an example where content is recorded on a data-writable R or RE type medium such as a disk, a hard disk, and a flash memory and used, the content recorded on the medium is not fixed but can be subjected to the data updates such as the recording of new content or the deleting of recorded content. The usage rule or the unit keys need to be updated with content stored in the medium.","In this way, when a user records content on a medium, it is necessary to perform various complex processes such as recording various accessory data corresponding to the recorded content, as well as recording the content.","Particularly, the key information and the like needs to be prevented from leaking, and various ID information and content management data are data that is not to be falsified. When the leakage of the key information or various ID information and the content management data is falsified, the possibility of non-permitted usage of contents increases.","It is desirable to provide an information processing device, a data processing method, and a program, which are configured to safely write and use data such as key data or ID information that is not to be leaked or falsified when storing content downloaded from a server or content copied from another medium in a local memory unit.","According to a first embodiment of the invention, there is provided an information processing device including: a local memory unit storing data including encrypted content; a memory storing data including key information used to reproduce the encrypted content; and a data processing unit performing a process of writing data to the local memory unit and the memory, and a process of reproducing the encrypted content. Here, the data processing unit performs a process of writing encrypted content downloaded from a server or encrypted content copied from a medium to the local memory unit, and performs a process of decoding the encrypted content or a validity authenticating process using the data stored in the local memory unit and the data stored in the memory when reproducing the encrypted content written to the local memory unit.","In the information processing device according to the embodiment of the invention, the data processing unit may transmit the information processing device-specific data stored in the memory to the server, receive server authentication information in which the transmitted data is signed with a secret key of the server, and store the received server authentication information in the local memory unit.","In the information processing device according to the embodiment of the invention, the data processing unit may perform a process of acquiring key information using a device-specific device key set stored in the memory on a key block stored in the local memory unit when reproducing the encrypted content written to the local memory unit.","In the information processing device according to the embodiment of the invention, the data processing unit may perform a process of downloading content from the server as well as performing a process of acquiring a volume-unique key correlated with the downloaded content and content management data and storing the acquired data in the memory.","In the information processing device according to the embodiment of the invention, the data processing unit may store the volume-unique key in the memory as data corresponding to a title of the content.","In the information processing device according to the embodiment of the invention, the data processing unit may store the content management data in the memory as data corresponding to a title of the content, a volume ID correlated with the content, a medium ID specific to a content-storing disk, and a falsification verification code.","In the information processing device according to the embodiment of the invention, the data processing unit may perform a process of reading a volume ID correlated with the content stored in the medium and a medium ID specific to a content-storing disk and writing the data to the memory when performing the process of copying and writing the encrypted content stored in the medium to the local memory unit.","In the information processing device according to the embodiment of the invention, the data processing unit may perform a process of acquiring key information using a device key set, which is stored in the memory, specific to the information processing device on a key block stored in the medium and perform a process of writing the acquired key information to the memory, when performing the process of copying and writing the encrypted content stored in the medium to the local memory unit.","In the information processing device according to the embodiment of the invention, the data processing unit may perform a process of transmitting information processing device-specific data stored in the memory to the server, receiving server authentication information in which the transmitted data is signed with a secret key of the server, and storing the received server authentication information in the local memory unit and perform a process of acquiring a content certificate for authenticating the validity of the copied content from the server and storing the acquired content certificate in the local memory unit, when performing the process of copying and writing the encrypted content stored in the medium to the local memory unit.","According to a second embodiment of the invention, there is provided a data processing method performed by an information processing device, including the steps of: allowing a data processing unit to perform a process of writing encrypted content downloaded from a server or encrypted content copied from a medium to a local memory unit; and allowing the data processing unit to perform a process of transmitting information processing device-specific data stored in memory other than the local memory unit to the server, receiving server authentication information in which the transmitted data is signed with a secret key of the server, and storing the received server authentication information in the local memory unit.","According to a third embodiment of the invention, there is provided a program for processing data in an information processing device, including: allowing a data processing unit to perform a process of writing encrypted content downloaded from a server or encrypted content copied from a medium to a local memory unit; and allowing the data processing unit to perform a process of transmitting information processing device-specific data stored in memory other than the local memory unit to the server, receiving server authentication information in which the transmitted data is signed with a secret key of the server, and storing the received server authentication information in the local memory unit.","The program according to the embodiment of the invention is a computer program which can be provided to a general-purpose computer system executing various program codes by a recording medium or a communication medium in a computer-readable manner. By providing the program in the computer-readable manner, processes corresponding to the program are carried out by the computer system.","Other advantages, features, and effects of the invention will become apparent by the following detailed description based on specific embodiments of the invention or the accompanying drawings. A system referred to in this specification means a logical set of plural devices and is not limited to a configuration in which the devices are disposed in the same chassis.","According to the above-mentioned embodiments of the invention, in the configuration for storing content downloaded from a server or content copied from a medium in a local memory unit, it is possible to safely store key data with high secrecy in memory other than the local memory unit. Accordingly, for example, even when data stored in the local memory unit is copied and leaks out, it is possible to prevent the non-permitted usage of the contents by preventing the data stored in the memory from being leaked out. In addition, the device-specific ID information and the like stored in the memory is transmitted to the server and the server authentication data is received and stored in the local memory unit. Accordingly, the correlation of the content stored in the local memory unit with the device is reliably carried out.","Hereinafter, an information processing device, a data processing method, and a program according to an embodiment of the invention will be described in detail with reference to the drawings.","First, a process example of the managed copy (MC) performed by an information processing device according to an embodiment of the invention will be described with reference to . As described above, the managed copy (MC) is a process of copying content to another medium on the condition that copy permission information is received from a management server.","In , a disk  having content recorded thereon, an information processing device  reading the content from the disk  and recording the read content to a data-writable second recording medium , a data-writable second recording medium  which is the copy destination of the content, and a management server  providing permission information for the content copying process or management data are shown from the left side.","The disk  is, for example, a ROM disk, and is a disk  such as Blu-ray Disc (registered trademark).","The data-writable second recording medium  as the copy destination of the content is a recording medium such as a hard disk, a R\/RE disk, and a flash memory.","The information processing device  is constructed, for example, by a PC, a recording and reproducing device, or the like and has a function of reading data from the disk  and writing the read data to the second recording medium .","As shown in the drawing, a BD-J application  which is a Java (registered trademark) application program, a managed-copy management file (MCMF) , management data , and an encrypted content  are recorded in the disk .","The BD-J application  is a program which is executed by the information processing device  at the time of performing a managed copy (MC) process and is used to perform, for example, a process of communication with the management server . The BD-J application  may be constructed by a single application program or a combination of plural BD-J applications performing specific processes.","For example, the plural BD-J applications can include a BD-J application making a communication with a server and a BD-J application performing a charging process. At the time of copying content, the plural BD-J applications are executed by the information processing device .","The managed-copy management file (MCMF)  is a file used to perform a content copying process and is an XML-described data file including the following information:","(a) a content ID which is an identifier (ID) uniquely representing content recorded in the information recording medium (disk );","(b) URI (URL) which is information for accessing a management server giving permission to copy at the time of copying content and generating a token by a binding process, for example, information for accessing the management server ; and","(c) directory name and file name which are information on names of a directory and a file in which data for permitting a copy process is recorded.","The management data  is management data defined by an AACS (Advanced Access Content System) which is a standard management system for content copyright protecting techniques and includes a CPS unit key file including keys (unit keys) used to decode the encrypted content , usage control information, a content certificate (CC) representing the validity of the content, and an MKB (Media Key Block) which is an encryption key block including key information (medium key) for acquiring the CPS unit keys.","The encrypted content  is an encrypted content according to, for example, the AACS standard. For example, the encrypted content includes an AV (Audio Visual) stream of moving image content such as HD (High Definition) movie content which is high-definition moving image data, music data, a game program, an image file, voice data, or text data.","The encrypted content  is configured to control usage by, for example, content management units (CPS units) and is an encrypted content to which different unit keys (CPS unit keys) are applied by the content management units (CPS units). Different keys (CPS unit keys) are assigned to the units, respectively, are encrypted, and are stored.","Two data processing units are set in the information processing device .","The first data processing unit is a BD-JVM (BD-J virtual machine) . The BD-JVM  is set as a virtual machine which is a virtual hardware environment for executing the BD-J application  recorded in the disk .","The second data processing unit is an AACS layer . The AACS layer  is set as a data processing unit for performing a data process according to the AACS standard, such as a process of acquiring an ID recorded in the disk , treatment of information with high security, and data transformation in a content copying process.","In this way, when a process of copying content recorded in the disk  to another medium is performed, the BD-JVM  as an execution area of the BD-J application  recorded in the disk  and the AACS layer  as an execution area of a program for performing the processes according to the AACS standard are established to transmit and receive process requests and process results therebetween.","In order to transmit and receive process requests and process results between the BD-J application and the AACS layer, an API (Application Programming Interface) is used. The API is a set of functions for performing various processes necessary for the content copying process. The API is recorded in the BD-J application  or other areas which can be read by the information processing device . A specific example of the API will be described in detail later.","The information processing device  executes the BD-J application  in the BD-JVM , communicates with the management server , and performs the process of acquiring the copy permission information  and the like.","When the content  stored in the disk  is copied to a second recording medium , it is necessary to transform the content or the usage control information (usage rule) depending on the medium as a copy destination. This process is performed in the program executing area (AACS layer ) for performing the processes according to the AACS standard.","The BD-J application  is a program for executing processes necessary for the content copying process and is executed in the BD-JVM  of the information processing device . The following processes are performed as the processes employing the BD-J application:","(a) a server accessing process using the URI of a managed-copy management file (MCMF);","(b) a process of acquiring a permitted process list from a server;","(c) a process of transmitting the user's process selection information to the server;","(d) a payment process;","(e) a process of acquiring copy permission information from the server, a check process, a process of outputting the copy permission information to a recording controller;","(f) a process of monitoring the content copying process, which is performed by the recording controller; and","(g) a process of monitoring a process of writing data downloaded from the server, which is performed by the recording controller.","As described above, the BD-J application  may be constructed by a single application program, but may also be constructed by a combination of plural BD-J applications performing specific processes. For example, the processes of (a) to (g) may be performed by plural BD-J applications.","The process of the BD-J application will be described now with reference to . The BD-J application is started in the BD-JVM  established in the information processing device , in step S shown in .","At the time of performing the process, a guide picture as a user interface such as a menu provided from the BD-J application is displayed on the display of the information processing device . A series of processes for performing the content copying process (managed copy) is started by a user's instruction.","The BD-J application first accesses the management server  using the server URI included in the managed-copy management file (MCMF)  in accordance with the user's instruction. At this time, a content ID corresponding to the content to be copied is transmitted to the management server .","In step S, the management server  generates a permitted process list which is list data of processes permitted for the content and transmits the generated permitted process list to the information processing device , on the basis of the content ID received from the information processing device . For example, the permitted process list is a list including information on whether the copying of the content is permitted and information on the fee of the copy process.","The information processing device  receives the permitted process list  from the management server  and displays the permitted process list on the display in step S so as to allow a user to select a process to be performed.","When the user selects a process to be performed, the information processing device  performs a payment process by transmitting payment data  to the management server . For example, the user inputs the data necessary for the payment such as a credit card number to the payment picture and transmits the payment data. Then, in step S, the management server  permits the process and transmits the copy permission information to the information processing device .","The information processing device  sends the copy permission information  received from the management server  to the AACS layer . The AACS layer  performs the process of step S and the processes subsequent thereto. The AACS layer  performs a process of transforming the management data  read from the disk  into management data based on the medium type of the second recording medium  such as a hard disk, an R\/RE disk, and a flash memory as a copy destination. For example, a process of adding an encryption key (unit key) corresponding to the copied content or a process of transforming the usage control information, the content certificate, and the like to data corresponding to the copied content. The information necessary for transforming the data is included in the copy permission information . The transformed management data  is recorded in the second recording medium .","In step S, the information processing device  reads the encrypted content  recorded in the disk  and outputs content copy data having been subjected to a data transformation such as a format transformation. In this way, the copied data of the content recorded in the disk  is recorded as the encrypted content  in the second recording medium . The management data  recorded in the second recording medium  includes the usage control information, the content certificate, the MKB, the CPS unit key file, and the token corresponding to the content recorded in the second recording medium .","At the time of performing the content copying process, the information processing device  and the management server  may perform a process of confirming the medium identifier (serial number) of the second recording medium  and a process of signing the medium identifier with a secret key of the management server  to generate a token. This token may be included in the management data. The management data including the token and the like is indicated by the management data  in the management server  in . The management data (CP data)  recorded in the second recording medium  may include the token information.","This content copying process has been roughly described with reference to . As described above, the content copying process is performed using the BD-J application and the program executed in the AACS layer. Therefore, the necessary information needs to be transmitted and received between the BD-J application and the program executed in the AACS layer. The API which defines various processes is employed in this process.","Plural process examples, which are performed by the information processing device according to the embodiment of the invention, using a server, will be described now with reference to . The following two processes are shown in :","Process Example 1: a process of allowing the information processing device (user device)  to download content A from the server  and to store the downloaded content in the local memory unit ; and","Process Example 2: a process of copying content B stored in the disk  to the local memory unit .","Process Example 1 corresponds to the content downloading process corresponding to the EST (Electric Sell Through) described with reference to (b) of .","Process Example 2 corresponds to the MC (Managed Copy) described with reference to  and is a process of acquiring copy permission information from the server  and copying content between mediums.","Process Example 1 will be roughly described now.","The ROM disk  having content such as a movie recorded thereon is first mounted on the information processing device . A program  recorded in the ROM disk  is then executed by the data processing unit  to perform a download process of acquiring content A from the server . The program  is a BD-J application program which is a Java (registered trademark) program corresponding to the BD standard, when the ROM disk  is the Blu-ray Disc (registered trademark).","The data processing unit  transmits a content download request to the server  in accordance with the program . The server  provides content A to the information processing device  in response to the request. The data processing unit  of the information processing device  stores content A downloaded from the server  in a local memory unit  in the device, for example, the local memory unit  constituted by a hard disk or the like.","At the time of downloading the content from the server , the following process may be performed concurrently. That is, the information processing device  transmits the ID (device binding ID) of the information processing device or a random number (binding nonce) to the server . The server signs the data with a secret key of the server to generate server authentication information (token) and provides the server authentication information to the information processing device .","When the downloaded content is used by the information processing device , the server authentication information (token) is verified to confirm that the acquired server authentication information (token) is valid. Only when this confirmation is made, the decoding and reproducing of the downloaded content is permitted. By this setting, the usage of the downloaded content is permitted to only a specific device (information processing device).","Process Example 2 shown in  will be described now. This process is a process of copying content B stored in the disk  to the local memory unit . Content B is content stored in the ROM disk  and is content to be subjected to usage control. Therefore, at the time of performing the copy process, it is necessary to acquire the copy permission information from the server .","The program for performing this serial copy process is a program (for example, BD-J application)  stored, for example, in the ROM disk . The program  is different from the program  recorded in the ROM disk  in Process Example 1 shown in . The program  is a program for performing the content downloading process and the program  is a program for performing the content copying process. The different programs may be stored in the ROM disk .","At the time of performing the copy process on the condition that the copy permission information is acquired from the server , that is, the managed copy (MC) process, the data processing unit  of the information processing device  reads and executes the program (BD-J)  from the ROM disk . The data processing unit  performs a series of processes such as a process of reading a medium ID recorded in the ROM disk , a process of transmitting the medium ID to the server , and a process of acquiring the copy permission information from the server  in accordance with the program . After these processes are performed, the process of copying the content recorded in the ROM disk  to the local memory unit  is performed.","In this way, various content such as the content downloaded from the server and the copied content from the ROM disk, that is, the content copied in the managed copy (MC) process performed under the control of the server by acquiring the copy permission information from the server, is recorded in the local memory unit .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0112","num":"0111"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["281","282","213"]},"The copied content and the downloaded content are divided into the units of titles and are stored in the directories  and . By this division and setting in the units of titles, data can be selected and copied at the time of performing the copy process on another medium.","However, it is not preferable that the process of reproducing the content recorded in the local memory unit can only be performed using the data recorded in the local memory unit. It is preferable that it should be necessary to use data recorded in an internal memory of the information processing device other than the local memory unit. This is because the data recorded in the local memory unit such as a hard disk can be copied to another medium and non-permitted usage of the content could be encouraged when the content can be reproduced using only the copied data.","An example of data stored in the local memory unit and the memory in the information processing device will be described with reference to  and the subsequent drawings. Plural examples of data storage will be described now in two patterns of (A) an example of data storage where the content downloaded from the server is stored in the local memory unit (see ) and (B) an example of data storage where the content copied from another medium is stored in the local memory unit (see ).","The data processing unit of the information processing device performs a process of recording the encrypted content downloaded from the server or the encrypted content copied from the medium in the local memory unit. The data processing unit makes a data communication with the server, which is performed along with the recording process, or performs a key block process such as the MKB. The data processing unit performs a content reproducing process accompanied with the process of decoding the encrypted content or the process of confirming the validity by using the data stored in the local memory unit and the data stored in the secure memory at the time of performing a process of reproducing the encrypted content recorded in the local memory unit.","The example (A) of data storage where the content downloaded from the server is stored in the local memory unit will be first described with reference to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0118","num":"0117"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["310","320","350","320","360","360"]},"In the example shown in , a device key set , a device binding ID , and a binding nonce  are stored in the secure memory .","The device key set  is a key set established to correspond to the information processing device  as a device. That is, the device key set is a key set specific to an information processing device as a device or set of plural information processing devices. This device key set  is used to generate a decoding key at the time of decoding the encrypted content  stored in the local memory unit . This device key set  needs to be managed in a secrecy required system.","The device binding ID  is an identifier specific to the information processing device as a device or a set of plural information processing devices. The binding nonce  is random number information and is generated and stored in the secure memory  by the information processing device , for example, at the time of downloading the content from the server .","The device binding ID  and the binding nonce  are data that must be transmitted to the server in order to acquire the server authentication information (token)  from the server  at the time of downloading the content from the server .
