{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","(1) Field of the Invention","This invention generally relates to an apparatus for flexure testing long, slender shapes.","More particularly, the invention relates to an apparatus for flexure testing long, slender shapes such as solid or hollow structural beams, tubes, pipes, cylinders, and the like in which a length of the specimen under test is not limited and the orientation of the specimens is not limited by a position of load columns on a load application device.","(2) Description of the Prior Art","The current art for flexure testing limit the specimen length to an inside distance between load columns of a load application device and require specimens to be oriented within the plane defined by the load columns.","The following patents, for example, disclose flexure testing, but do not disclose flexure testing in which a specimen is aligned perpendicularly to the load column plane such that no restriction is imposed on specimen length.","Specifically, Glassmeyer (U.S. Pat. No. 3,898,873) discloses an intermodel cargo container bottom lift tested by means of a test fixture including adjustable supports which are connected to the lower corner fittings to maintain the container in a raised position free of a supporting surface. The upper corner fittings are first connected to a suitable hoisting device and upon lifting are placed in tension. The lower corner fitting lifting capability of the container is then tested by releasing the tension in the cables, the bottom lift test fixtures being placed in compression.","Hayashi (U.S. Pat. No. 4,590,900) discloses a valve supporting arrangement of an internal combustion engine. The upper retainer is for retaining an upper portion of a valve spring shaped like a perforated spinning top and is axially dividable into two identical elements which are coaxially disposed about the upper portion of the valve stem when assuming its operative condition. The retainer has, when assuming the operative position, a configuration which comprises a collar portion which is sized to be coaxially disposed within an upper portion of the valve spring, an annular flange portion extending radially outward from the upper end of the collar portion and engaging with the upper end of the valve spring, and means for achieving a spline connection between the central portion of the retainer and the upper portion of the valve stem.","Maciejczak (U.S. Pat. No. 4,789,947) discloses, in conjunction with an unmanned, remotely controllable apparatus for inspecting, testing and viewing and for examination and evaluation of the general condition, state of repair, and of the quality of fabrication of mechanical structures including bridges, an assembly including a guide track carried by a space frame fastened to extend transversely of a bridge or other structure at an underside thereof. The track supports a carrier adapted for transporting, viewing, examining, treating and testing apparatus for controlled movement and manipulation of the apparatus along a path delineated by the guide track. In a preferred embodiment of the invention the carrier supports one or more turntables and one or more articulated arms and linked arm assemblies at remote ends of which selectable viewing and testing devices are attachable. The space frame itself may be moved lineally along the bridge, on an underside thereof so that through the combination of the transversely moving carrier and the lineally movable space frame, an entire aerial zone may be traversed.","Strong (U.S. Pat. No. 5,345,826) discloses a static load tester that provides tensile testing of plated test specimens to detect hydrogen embrittlement damage from plating processes. The functional components of the device are centrally aligned within a channel of an I-beam frame. A load cell and electronic readout provide the user with a measure of the tensile force applied to up to eight test specimens mounted end to end in a tester. Tension is applied to the specimens through use of a simple threaded rod and nut load application system at the base of the device. A static load tester may be incorporated into each channel of the I-beam frame, thereby providing a double testing unit. Additionally, a series of I-beam frame tester configurations may be incorporated into one multiple testing unit. Each multiple testing unit has a number of static load testers equal to double the number of I-beam frames mounted into the unit. The tension applied to any individual tester in a multiple testing unit may be displayed on a single electronic readout through use of a switch box coupled between the individual testers and the readout.","Diaz et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 5,386,442) discloses an apparatus and a method for measuring and controlling the crack growth rate within a double cantilever beam type test specimen. The arms of the test specimen are fitted with a pressure-actuated bellows to induce a predetermined load and with a sensing assembly to provide feedback on the amount of beam displacement resulting from the application of that load. In this manner, a loaded test specimen may be remotely mounted and adjusted inside the reactor pressure vessel or piping of a nuclear reactor in order to maintain a stress intensity which is constant or which varies in a predetermined manner for inducing stress corrosion cracking or corrosion fatigue in the specimen.","Tucchio (U.S. Pat. No. 5,448,918) discloses a biaxial compression testing device formed by two modified beams joined together to form an X-shape with the support structure, such as webs and upper flanges, removed in the region of the X intersection, thereby leaving a rectangular opening. The rectangular opening has dimensions slightly greater than the widths of the beams and is open from the upper surfaces downward to the lower surfaces which are joined together forming an X-configuration. This configuration has a flexing characteristic in the direction perpendicular to the plane of the joined beams. A test specimen support plate is attached to the underside of one of the upper surfaces and is located so as to slide below the opposing upper surface during flexing of the X-beam assembly. Each beam is supported by a roller pin. Additional roller pins are located on the specimen support plate between each beam upper flange and a specimen to be tested. The single actuating force is applied to cause the X-beams to flex into a concave shape thereby applying a part of the actuating force axially along each beam. The configuration provides a force transfer assembly which is actuated by a single load force, but provides a biaxial load to the test specimen.","Starostovic, Jr. (U.S. Pat. No. 5,699,274) discloses a performance testing system, i.e., performance of a material under a load concentrated in a single area. The system is computerized and automatically applies a load to a panel to be tested, reads and records deflection of the panel without operator involvement, and provides a printed test report.","Simonelli et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 5,913,246) discloses a machine for the cyclic load testing in tension, compression, torsion, shear, or any combination thereof of any one of a number of different sizes, types and configurations of test specimens at a fixed or adjustable predetermined load and cycle rate and comprising a machine frame in which is mounted a drive shaft, any number of intermediate shafts as required, and a camshaft or crankshaft. At the workstation of the machine, appropriate fixtures and tooling are either fixed, rotating, or in motion, as required to conduct the particular test to be performed. When the test specimen is to be in motion, the motion may be derived from a driving source separate from the primary mover or camshaft, for instance, but not limited to an independent motor or cylinder. This source of motion may also be taken through a drive train or any suitable means from the same driving source as the camshaft or from the camshaft itself or from any other moving member in the system. A motion is ultimately imparted to drive the test specimen bolder, thereby setting the test specimen in motion.","Miller et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 6,042,315) discloses a fastener body comprising a head and a shank fabricated from a composite material. The head has at least one side which extends beyond the side of the shank and has two other sides coplanar with the shank. A fastener for engaging a liner has perpendicular lengthwise and widthwise reference axes and a head and a shank, with the shank extending in a first lengthwise direction away from the head, the head further having at least one extension that extends in the widthwise direction beyond the shank for engaging the liner, wherein substantially all lengthwise directed load components transmitted from the liner to the head are transmitted through the extension.","Starostovic (U.S. Pat. No. 5,699,274) discloses a performance testing system for woodbased panels. The testing includes performance of a material under a load concentrated in a single area, performance of edge support systems under a concentrated load and performance of a material under static bending conditions. The system is computerized and automatically applies a load to a panel to be tested, reads and records deflection of the panel without operator involvement, and provides a printed test report.","Zhou (U.S. Pat. No. 6,216,531) discloses an adapter for use in the testing of shear strength of an adhesive as applied to a test specimen. The adapter has a structure that permits it to be used on testing machines either in a tension or in a compression mode. The adapter as a testing tool includes a pair of coacting force blocks which slidably engage each other and move relative to each other. Each such force block has a central opening into which a test specimen may be inserted. The openings in each of the force blocks engage a different one of the two test coupons that make up a testing specimen. The force blocks further have bearing surfaces that oppose each other so that they may engage the like opposing ends of the test specimen.","It should be understood that the present invention would in fact enhance the functionality of the above patents by providing an adjustable apparatus for supporting long span beams in a flexure testing machine regardless of their length or orientation.","Accordingly, it is a general purpose and primary object of this invention to provide an adjustable apparatus for supporting long span beams.","It is a further object of this invention to provide an adjustable apparatus for supporting long span beams in a flexure testing machine.","It is a still further object of this invention to provide an adjustable apparatus for supporting a long span beam specimen in an orientation normal to that of the operating structure on a load application device.","It is a still further object of the invention to provide an adjustable apparatus for supporting a long span beam specimen that is simple to operate and easily implemented into existing load testing devices.","To obtain the objects described, there is disclosed an adjustable apparatus for supporting a long span beam specimen in a flexure test by a load application device. The apparatus includes an upper support structure including an elongated support beam, at least one support bracket adjustably mountable along a longitudinal span thereof, and a saddle member selectively pivotally mounted in the at least one upper support bracket for engaging with a specimen under test. The upper support structure is positioned normal to the load application device and a lower support structure is positioned parallel and co-planar to the upper support structure. The lower support structure includes an elongated support beam, at least one spacing member adjustably mounted along a longitudinal span thereof, a lower support bracket adjustably mounted along a longitudinal span of the spacing member, and a saddle member selectively pivotally mounted in the lower support bracket for engaging with a specimen under test.","In general, the present invention is directed to a specimen supporting apparatus generally intended for use in flexure testing of long slender shapes (such as, but not limited to, solid or hollow structural beams, tubes, pipes, cylinders, and the like) in which the load-deflection or stress-strain characteristics of a specimen being tested are sought.","Referring first to , there is shown a perspective view of a specimen supporting apparatus  according to the present invention and in a working environment of a typical flexure testing device.","The specimen supporting apparatus  includes an upper support structure  and a lower support structure . These upper and lower support structures, , , are each formed in a basic I-beam shape. For the purposes of the present design shown, these upper  and lower  support structures are formed of aluminum 6061-T6 W6x25 I-beams, however, other materials known to those skilled in the art may be used.","Referring still to , it can be seen that the upper and lower support structures ,  are positioned parallel to and co-planar with each other. The upper support structure  is shown mounted transverse to a moving upper platen  of the testing device and the lower support structure  is shown mounted transverse to a lower stationary platen  of the testing device. The upper platen  is spaced from the lower platen  by a pair of hydraulically operated columns  as is known in the art such that the upper platen  is adjustably positioned with a testing force relative to the lower platen . Operation of the testing device is omitted for the sake of brevity and as having no part of the subject invention other than explanation of a suggested environmental use of the specimen supporting apparatus  being described.","Additional details of the upper support structure  and the lower support structure  of the specimen support device  are shown in each of , respectively and are intended to be referenced in connection with  and the following description.","The upper support structure  is shown in  in an inverted and exploded perspective view in order to better understand the parts thereof. Specifically, the upper support structure  is shown in an I-beam shape with opposing end plates ,  and an inner wall  perpendicular to and spacing apart the end plates , , thus defining the \u201cI\u201d shape of the structure. A plurality of paired and spaced apertures  are formed through one of the end plates  along an entire length thereof.","At least one support bracket  is mounted to the apertured end plate . The support bracket  includes a base portion  for surface contact with the apertured end plate  and side walls  projecting from opposing sides of the base portion  and away from the fixture . The base portion  of the support bracket  has apertures  formed therein which are aligned to mate with corresponding apertures  formed in the end plate  of the upper support structure . The connection of the support bracket  to the end plate  is with suitable fixing means such as screws, bolts, or the like.","Each of the projecting side walls  of the support bracket  include a centered slot  at the distal end thereof and a pair of apertures , one to each side of the centered slot . A saddle member  includes a saddle portion  and opposing pins  extending from outer ends of the saddle portion  such that the pins  seat into the centered slots  of the support bracket  with the saddle portion  fit between the side walls  and enabling pivotal rotation of the saddle member  with respect to the support bracket . Each pin  is secured in the centered slots  with a slotted fixing plate . The slotted fixing plate  is rectangular and includes a slot  formed in an edge thereof with an aperture  on each side of the slot . The slot  slides over the pin  of the saddle member  and the apertures  align with the apertures  of the side walls  for securement by any suitable means such as a screw, welding or the like. This securement enables movement of the saddle member  without separation from the support bracket .","Still referring to the upper support structure , if a single support bracket  is utilized, then it is positioned at the mid span of the upper support structure . This arrangement enables a three-point flexure loading in connection with the lower support structure .","If two support brackets  are utilized, then each support bracket  is equidistantly positioned to each other from a mid-point of the upper support structure  according to the matching paired aperture patterns  between the upper support structure  and the support brackets . This arrangement enables a four-point flexure loading in connection with the lower support structure . The upper support bracket , in whatever number utilized, is attached to the apertured end plate  of the upper support structure  with bolts or other suitable fastening means (not specifically shown for simplicity). It should be understood, however, that these support brackets  are movable along the length of the upper support structure  and should therefore be fixed with secure, yet removable means.","Referring now to details of the lower support structure , the lower support structure  is also shown in an I-beam shape with opposing end plates ,  and an inner wall  perpendicular to and spacing apart the end plates , , thus defining the \u201cI\u201d shape of the structure. A plurality of paired and spaced apertures  are formed through one of the end plates  along an entire length thereof. These paired and spaced apertures  are in the end plate  which faces the similarly formed apertures  of the upper support structure .","At least one offset member  is provided in connection with the lower support structure . This offset member  is bolted to the lower support structure  using a paired aperture pattern  that matches the spacing of the paired apertures  in the end plate  of the lower structure . The offset member  provides an offset clearance between a specimen under test and the lower support structure  such that the specimen under flexure loads will not deflect to the point where contact between the specimen and lower support structure  is made.","The offset member  is structurally similar in shape to the lower support structure  in that it is of an I-beam shape. The I-beam shape of the offset member  includes opposing end plates , , each having paired aperture patterns , and an inner wall  perpendicular to and spacing apart the end plates , . The offset member  is substantially shorter than the lower support structure , spanning only approximately three sets of paired apertures  thereon.","A slider  is adjustably positioned with respect to the offset member . The slider  includes a support leg  with a T-shaped base  and a support bracket  at an end opposing the T-shaped base . The support bracket  includes a base portion integrally connected to the support leg  and side walls projecting from opposing sides of the base portion and away from the offset member .","Each of the projecting side walls of the support bracket  include a centered slot  at the distal end thereof. A saddle member  is seated in the support bracket  and includes a saddle portion  and opposing pins  extending from outer ends of the saddle portion  such that the pins  seat into the centered slots  of the support bracket  with the saddle portion between the side walls and enabling pivotal rotation of the saddle member  with respect to the support bracket . Unlike the saddle member  of the upper support bracket , the pins  of the saddle member  in the lower support bracket  need not be secured in the centered slots . This is because the weight of the specimen to be tested will secure the saddle member  without separation from the support bracket .","A series of spacers  and overlying fixing plates  are attached to that end wall  of the offset member  which is not secured to the apertured end wall  of the lower support fixture . The spacers  and fixing plates  create a slide positioning mechanism securing the T-shaped base  of the slider  to the offset member  through paired apertures ,  of the spacers and fixing plates, respectively. These apertures ,  align with corresponding apertures  of the spacer . This provides a finer spacing control for adjustments less than the pitch distance between the matching paired apertures  in the offset member  and those apertures  in the lower support structure .","Due to the arrangement of spacers  and overlying fixing plates , there are two different ways to adjust the distance between saddles  mounted at opposite ends of the lower support structure .","In a first distance adjustment, a coarse adjustment can be made according to the selection of the bolt hole groups  used to secure the upper brackets  to the upper support structure  and, likewise, the paired apertures  used to secure the offset members  to the lower support structure .","In a second distance adjustment, a finer adjustment mechanism is included in between the offset member  and the slider . The series of spacers  and fixing plates  clamp the slider  to the offset member . This provides spacing control that is less than the pitch distance between the matching aperture patterns  in the offset member  and the paired apertures  in the lower support structure .","During operation and as shown in , the lower support structure  and the attached components as described are positioned normal to the load column plane of the columns  of the flexure testing device and centered on the stationary platen  (assumed to be the bottom platen) of the flexure testing device. It is desired that equal lengths of the end plates ,  of the lower support structure  overhang the front and rear sides of the plane defined by the load columns . Similarly, the upper support structure  and attached components are positioned normal to the load column plane and centered on the moving platen  (assumed to be the top platen) of the flexure testing device. The upper and lower support structures ,  are checked to be co-planar to each other and the complete assembly is checked to be normal to the load column plane.","The specimen is secured in the saddles  of the lower support structure  and the testing device applies the load by moving the upper support structure  downward such that the upper saddles  are pushing down on the specimen under test and the lower saddles  react the load upwards. The saddles ,  will rotate as the specimen deforms. This is the follower-loading mode.","To utilize the non-follower-loading mode, locking pins (not shown) are placed through corresponding holes in the side walls of the slider  and the pins  of the saddles . The same is done for the apertures  in the side walls  of the upper bracket  and the pins  of the saddles .","It should be understood that the subject specimen supporting apparatus  is known to accommodate 96 inches long specimens, however, there is no restriction for obtaining specimen lengths beyond 96 inches. Both coarse and fine adjustment mechanisms are included for setting the spans between load and support points. A full range of load and support point positions is thereby provided.","A rotational locking mechanism such as a pin is included in the saddle design to enable the user to test in either follower or non-follower loading modes. In a follower-loading mode, the saddles rotate as the specimen deforms since the resulting force vector remains in the same direction relative to the localized region of the specimen to which it is applied as the specimen deforms globally. In a non-follower loading mode, the force vector remains in the same global direction at all times and does not change directions as the specimen deforms. The non-follower mode will transfer the load from the saddle outer edge rather than along the saddle surface are. Accordingly, to operate in a non-follower monde, locking pins (not specifically shown) are inserted through corresponding holes in the sides of the bottom slider and the axles of the lower saddles, thereby securing them against rotation. The same is done for the holes in the sides of the top support and the axles of the upper saddles.","Other additional benefits are realized when coupling the specimen supporting apparatus  to a flexure testing device. These include, but are not limited to, testing the specimen in a load-controlled mode such as a constant loading rate of 10 pounds per minute; and testing the specimen in a displacement-controlled mode such as a constant displacement rate of 1.0 inch per minute. These types of tests are known in the art and are included as examples of the uses of the present invention.","There are several contemplated singular or combined alternatives to the described subject disclosure, and these are intended to be included within the scope of the invention, although the invention is not limited to these suggested alternatives.","In a first alternative, a T-shaped slotted block could be used as an alternative to the slide positioning mechanism of spacers  and fixing plates .","In a second alternative, the saddles  may be installed within the upper bracket  and the saddle  may be installed at the bottom sliders using bearings, needles, rollers, or the like to reduce rotational friction forces when using the follower loading mode.","Alternative structural shapes may be used for the various components, such as box beam shapes for the upper and lower support structures ,  rather than I-beam shapes.","The slide positioning mechanism of spacers  and fixing plates  shown in connection with the lower support structure  may also be implemented in connection with the upper support structure .","In view of the above detailed description, it is anticipated that the invention herein will have far reaching applications other than those of flexure testing of elongated materials.","This invention has been disclosed in terms of certain embodiments. It will be apparent that many modifications can be made to the disclosed apparatus without departing from the invention. Therefore, it is the intent of the appended claims to cover all such variations and modifications as come within the true spirit and scope of this invention."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The appended claims particularly point out and distinctly claim the subject matter of this invention.
