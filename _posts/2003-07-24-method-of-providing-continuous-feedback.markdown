title: Method of providing continuous feedback
abstract: A feedback component which adds on to a spooler and utilizes the spooler's connectivity with the network clients for communications. The network clients connect to the feedback component through the spooler's application programming interface (API) by making a request to register for feedback. Once the request is received, the feedback component continuously provides the network components with status of jobs in readable text and codes as the jobs progress in the underlying printing system. These status messages are not limited to just print status messages like printing, paused, printed, etc., but may include customized status messages for any device in the printing system such as scheduled, dialing, sending-fax, etc. In addition, a time delay may be introduced between messages in order to prevent excessive traffic being sent during times of heavy traffic.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION"],"p":["The present invention relates generally to printing systems and more particularly to a method and system for communicating network printer status changes.","Printing systems, and in particular network printers, offer a myriad of features in addition to plain printing. Some of these features include scheduling, printing, private print, fax, and other types of document handling features. Because of these extra features, there are more status changes in the print job's lifecycle than with standard printing, such as Printing, Processing, Paused, Deleting, etc. Since all jobs are submitted to the printing system through a standard print driver, there is a need to communicate job progress through the standard print driver, in addition to any special client software provided by the printer manufacturer. Furthermore, because these states are more dynamic than normal printing, for example fax progress such as dialing, connecting, transmitting, etc., there is a need to communicate job progress in a continuous manner, practically in real time.","Thus, there is a need for a component in the frontline of the printing system that is capable of monitoring the printing system by monitoring event progress and communicating the job progress status to the printing clients connected to the printing system, wherein the clients are connected to the printing system through various protocols.","In view of the aforementioned needs, the invention contemplates a component that is an add-on to a spooler and exploits the spooler's connectivity to the networking layers to receive print jobs. The component monitors the printing system by listening to status change messages and pushes the status changes to the clients as plain text that is localized to the client's language. While the preferred embodiment illustrates a component that is an add-on to a spooler, as those skilled in the art can readily appreciate the component may also be a part of the spooler.","One aspect of the present invention is a feedback component. The feedback component comprising means adapted for the component to register with the spooler's application programming interface. Once registered, the component can receive a status message from a spooler, receive a signal from an image output system, whereupon the image output system communicatively coupled to the spooler. The component determines a native language for a network client and sends a job state message to the network client. The job state is at least one of the group consisting of a status message and a signal from the printing system. The component translates the job state message to a format compatible with the network client, such as plain text.","Another aspect of the present invention is that it is customizable so that a network client may only receive a selected type of job status messages.","Still yet another aspect of the present invention is that the component may be adapted to delay sending the job status message for a first time period. If no other job status messages are received at the expiration of the first time period, the job status message is sent to the network client. However, if before the expiration of the first time period a second job status is received, the component waits until the end of a second predetermined time period before sending a status update, and normally sends only the most recent update. This is to avoid sending too many status messages in a short time period which may be irritating to the network client and would also prevent the printing system for bogging down networks with a high volume of network traffic.","Another aspect of the present invention is a method for providing continuous feedback from a printing system, comprising the steps of monitoring the printing system, receiving a status update, converting the status update to a format compatible with a network client; and sending the status update to the client. The component would ordinarily register with the printing system. The converting step may convert the status update to plain text, or to a foreign language compatible with the network client.","The method may further comprise waiting a first predetermined time period before sending the status update, and if another status update is received prior to the first predetermined time period, waiting a second predetermined time before sending a status update. The status update may comprise only the most recent status update, a plurality of status updates, or all of the status updates in a single message.","The method may also further comprise selecting a type of status update to be sent to the network client, wherein only messages of the selected type are sent to the network client. Thus the component would filter which status update messages are actually sent to the client. If method also includes the aforementioned time delay feature, only the selected status update messages are considered.","The present invention may be embodied in software, hardware or a combination thereof.","Still other objects of the present invention will become readily apparent to those skilled in this art from the following description wherein there is shown and described a preferred embodiment of this invention, simply by way of illustration of one of the best modes best suited for to carry out the invention. As it will be realized, the invention is capable of other different embodiments and its several details are capable of modifications in various obvious aspects all without from the invention. Accordingly, the drawing and descriptions will be regarded as illustrative in nature and not as restrictive.","Throughout this description, the preferred embodiment and examples shown should be considered as exemplars, rather than limitations, of the present invention.","The present invention is directed to a feedback component which adds on to a spooler and utilizes the spooler's connectivity with the network clients for communications. The network clients connect to the feedback component through the spooler's application programming interface (API) by making a request to register for feedback. Once the request is received, the feedback component continuously provides the network components with status of jobs in readable text and codes as the jobs progress in the underlying printing system. These status messages are not limited to just print status messages like printing, paused, printed, etc., but may include customized status messages for any device in the printing system such as scheduled, dialing, sending-fax, etc.","In addition, the feedback component registers itself with the printing system by making a request. This causes the printing system to provide signals to the feedback component indicative of activity in the printing system.","On receipt of a signal from the printing system, the feedback component engages in a dialog with the print system to determine the job state. The feedback component then translates the job state to human understandable message in the client's native language and then sends the message to a network component to be displayed by the client. The process occurs in real time.","Another aspect of the present invention is the ability of the feedback component to delay the response by a predefined time, for example T. This is to avoid sending too many feedback events to close together, especially in the event of heavy activity in the system.","Referring now to , there is a block diagram illustrating the various interconnections of the feedback component  which is added on to spooler  and uses the spooler's connectivity  with the network clients  for communication.","In addition, the feedback component  registers itself with the printing system  by making a request as shown by arrow . This causes the printing system  to send signals indicating job states as shown by arrow  to the feedback component . Upon receipt of signals as shown by , the feedback  component may engage in a bidrectional dialog as shown by  with the printing system . The feedback component  then translates the signals  into a human understandable language such as text or a language such as a foreign language native to the network client . When a network client  desires to receive feedback, it sends a request to register for feedback via its connectivity to the spooler's API as shown by arrow . From then on the spooler sends feedback messages to the client via the spooler as indicated by arrow .","Referring now to  with continued reference to , there is shown a method  for providing continuous feedback as contemplated by a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The method  begins at step  with a feedback component  connecting to a spooler . The feedback component  may be a separate module from the spooler  or may be a feature added on to the spooler . At step  a request to register for feedback is sent from a network client  via the spooler's  API (not shown). The feedback component  then registers with the printing system  at step .","At step  the feedback component  is monitoring the printing system  until a status update is received. At step  the feedback component determines if the status update is in plain text in the language of the client. If the status update is in plain text in client's language, then as shown in step  the status update is sent to the network client . If the status update is not in plain text or not in client's language, then as shown in step  the status update message is converted to plain text in client's language by the feedback component  and then sent to the network client at step . The feedback component  returns to monitoring the printing system  at step .","Another aspect of the present invention is the ability of the feedback component  to delay sending the response by a predefined time slice. This is illustrated by T on the time line of . Assuming that a status update eis received at the 0 of the time line, if no other status messages are received at time T, then the status message received at 0 will be sent to the network client . However, if another status update eis received before time T, then the system does not send a message at T, but instead waits to see if there is more rapid activity till another predetermined time T and then sends the latest message received at or before time T. For example if another message eis received after T, then message eis sent at time T. Typically, the message sent at T would be the latest status update, however, it is also contemplated that the system may send all of the messages received from 0 to T in one batch.","For example, if only event eis received before time T, then at time T event eis sent to the network client . However, if event eis received before T and is the only event received after e, then event ewill be sent to the network client  at T. Finally, if events eand eare received before T and event eis received before T then event eis sent to the network client. This prevents the excessive network traffic when many events are occurring continuously, but yet insures the network client  does receive timely updates (at least one update every T time period).","Referring now to  with continued reference to  and , there is shown a method  illustrating the time delay aspect of the invention. At step  the feedback component receives a signal indicating a status change from the printing system . At step  the feedback component  waits or delays until time T. At step  the feedback component determines whether another status change has occurred. If at step  another status change has occurred, then as shown at step  the feedback component  delays until T whereupon at step  the feedback component  sends the most recent status update to the network client  where it is displayed in plain text or in the native language of the network client . If at step  it is determined that no other status change message has been sent by the printing system , then the feedback component  sends the status message to the network client  for display ().","Another aspect of the present invention is that the feedback component  is customizable. The network client  may communicate to the feedback component  which status updates it desires to receive. All other status messages would then be filtered out by the feedback component .","The foregoing description of a preferred embodiment of the invention has been presented for purposes of illustration and description. It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed. Obvious modifications or variations are possible in light of the above teachings. The embodiment was chosen and described to provide the best illustration of the principles of the invention and its practical application to thereby enable one of the ordinary skill in the art to utilize the invention in various embodiments and with various modifications as are suited to the particular use contemplated.
