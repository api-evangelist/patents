title: Method for selectively exposing subscriber data
abstract: Methods, systems, and apparatuses for selectively exposing subscriber data include maintaining subscriber data at a digital data storage, wherein the digital data storage is protected by a service provider firewall. A request to expose subscriber data from a third-party requestor is received. Selected subscriber data and a security condition associated with the request are determined, wherein the security condition is based on an identity of the third-party requestor. The selected subscriber data is retrieved if the security condition is satisfied, and the selected subscriber data is transmitted to the third-party requestor.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present disclosure relates to selectively exposing subscriber data maintained by a telecommunications service provider to third parties.","Telecommunications service providers are currently looking for solutions that enable the monetization of their network assets beyond traditional models such as long-distance and toll-free calling services. For example, service providers can turn the vast amounts of data they have about their subscribers into valuable \u201ccontextual\u201d information for third-parties. However, this subscriber contextual data is often not readily accessible to third-parties, and is not typically exposed in a manner that is both efficient and secure.","Methods, systems and articles of manufacture for selectively exposing subscriber data may be implemented by maintaining subscriber data at a digital data storage, wherein the digital data storage is protected by a service provider firewall. A request to expose subscriber data from a third-party requestor is received via an application programming interface. Selected subscriber data and a security condition associated with the request are determined. The security condition is based on an identity of the third-party requestor. The selected subscriber data is retrieved if the security condition is satisfied, and the selected subscriber data is transmitted to the third-party requestor.","In accordance with an embodiment, selectively exposing subscriber data may be implemented by determining whether a subscriber opt-in rule is associated with the selected subscriber data. The selected subscriber data is retrieved if the subscriber opt-in rule is satisfied. The subscriber opt-in rule may be satisfied based on a subscriber opt-in response, such as a voice or text message response. A time-limit may be imposed for receiving the subscriber opt-in response.","In accordance with an embodiment, selectively exposing subscriber data may be implemented by updating the subscriber opt-in rule based on the subscriber opt-in response. A new subscriber opt-in rule may be generated based on the subscriber opt-in response.","In accordance with an embodiment, selectively exposing subscriber data may be implemented by maintaining the subscriber data in a cache memory. The selected subscriber data may include at least one of subscriber profile, device property or location data.","These and other advantages will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art by reference to the following detailed description and the accompanying drawings.","Subscriber data maintained by telecommunications service providers, including customer profile, device identity and customer authentication data may be selectively exposed to third-parties for improving customer-service applications (e.g., network-based call handling, and mobile payments), enabling customer-service applications and other uses. It should be appreciated that such applications may be web-based applications (e.g., browsers and social networks).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["102","104","102","106","106"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","202","200","204","206","200","208","202"]},"The subscriber data management element  may store and retrieve subscriber data from one or more subscriber databases, such as a subscriber database  protected by a service provider firewall at a telecommunications service provider . The subscriber data management element  may also update the subscriber data in a subscriber database  based on periodic or push-based notifications from a service provider .","The subscriber data management element  selectively exposes subscriber data to customers  in response to requests received via the APIs . As described in further detail below, the subscriber data management element  may employ a variety of security algorithms to selectively expose subscriber data. For example, the subscriber data management element  may require a subscriber  to affirmatively opt-in for the exposure of sensitive subscriber data, while subscriber opt-in may not be required for the exposure of other less sensitive data. As such, the opt-in management element  may manage subscriber opt-in information, and may also initiate message-based or offline Web-based subscriber opt-in capabilities by contacting a subscriber  for opt-in permission and allowing the subscriber data to be exposed only if a subscriber opt-in rule is satisfied.","The selective exposure of subscriber data may also include subscriber authentication. For example, a confidence level score (e.g., 0 to 100%) may represent a confidence level that a subscriber (or other requesting entity) is who they claim to be. In one embodiment, the subscriber data management element  may determine a confidence level score for authenticating a subscriber  by accessing a voice call platform  that monitors biometric characteristics of the subscriber's voice (e.g., via a voice recognition algorithm), in combination with other factors, such as a device's current location. For example, if the device location is known to be the subscriber's home or work address, the confidence level score may increase. On the other hand, if the device shows recent unusual calling or location patterns this could lower the score, or prompt the subscriber data management element  to make one or more additional authentication requests, such as for a personal identification number (PIN), password or the like. While the preceding example is exemplary, it will be appreciated that a variety of techniques (e.g., neural networks, advanced metrics and the like) may be used to determine a confidence level score, or otherwise determine that a subscriber or other requesting entity is who they claim to be, for authentication purposes.","For ease of understanding, the platform  is described as comprising discrete elements performing discrete tasks. However, one skilled in the art will appreciate that the functions of one or more of the elements may be combined and\/or performed by one or more consolidated elements, such as a processor in cooperation with memory. Further, a service provider  may wish to bundle the selective exposure of subscriber data with other services (e.g., legacy services such as toll-free and long distance applications). Therefore, it should be understood that one or more elements or functions of the platform  may be integrated into various elements or functions of a general application exposure platform .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["208","300","302","305"]},"In one embodiment, a mobile application  intercepts a call dialed from a mobile device  (e.g., a user equipment device such as a smart-phone) when subscriber opt-in is required before the call is connected. For example, a call directed to a customer  may be received at an API , and the subscriber data management element  may direct the mobile application  to present a graphical user interface (GUI) prompt asking whether the dialing subscriber wishes to opt-in to share data with the customer .","In another embodiment, certain trusted Web-based providers, such as browsers and social networks , may have a provider Web-based portal  for providing off-line customer services, such as authenticating subscribers. The platform  may include a portal integration module  for interfacing with a provider Web-based portal  to access subscriber authentication, new subscriber enrollment, off-line subscriber opt-in management and other capabilities in lieu of performing such operations internally. For example, a provider Web-based portal  may be allowed to opt-in for data exposure on behalf of a subscriber.","The platform  may also include a cache memory , such as for frequently exposed subscriber data that would typically be stored in the subscriber database . The cache memory  may be accessible for storing, pre-retrieving or reconstructing subscriber data  from one or more service providers  to avoid performance penalties during real-time data lookups. For example, new subscriber data and third-party application attributes may initially be stored in the cache memory  for increased speed and efficiency.","In another embodiment, when selected subscriber data from a particular service provider  is proprietary, or only a subset of subscriber data is available, the cache memory  may be accessible for reconstructing the unavailable, restricted or missing subscriber data from available data (e.g., a home time-zone update may be reconstructed based on a subscriber's known address).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","204","212","402","204","208","300","302","305","404","204","406","204","212","308","408","204"]},"As mentioned above, the platform  includes one or more APIs  interfacing with third-party applications , and in the various embodiments, the APIs  may include any function that relates to subscriber data maintained by one or more service providers .  is a chart illustrating API functions according to an embodiment. For example, APIs  may include functions related to subscriber profile management (get\/get all\/create\/modify\/delete subscriber data), subscriber identification (authenticate voice or get authentication PIN), application management (create\/get\/update\/delete application access, get all applications), device properties (get manufacturer\/model\/location), current call party attributes (secure caller ID, get confidence score\/liveliness phrase\/location, profile attributes (get current device user profile) or other features.
