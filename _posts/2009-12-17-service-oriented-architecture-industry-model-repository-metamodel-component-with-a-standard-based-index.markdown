{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The present invention relates to meta-models and more specifically to a service-oriented architecture industry model repository meta-model with a standard based index and a visual interactive client.","Today enterprises are adopting a model-driven development (MDD) approach to architecting and designing both their business architecture and the supporting IT systems and applications. In order to promote the best practices and interoperability, both software vendors and industry associations are aggressively developing and marketing industry models to support MDD. Enterprises gain enormous benefits of industry models, such as reusability, automation, traceability and speed to market. Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) projects receive acceleration from industry models.","There are strong requirements to map associations and create traceability of various types of industry models (e.g. processes, services and data models) in a meaningful granularity, and integrate with business requirements, goals and software development life cycle. However, because each type of industry models is created and maintained in its own tooling, building linkages across different tools in a meaningful granularity is very difficult.","Industry models are difficult to find within an enterprise since they can be stored in asset repositories, document management systems, websites, etc. . . . Plus, once they are found, it is challenging to link the various occurrences of the industry models together. It is also difficult to maintain associations between the abstract (a.k.a. master) and instance (a.k.a. customized) versions of industry models in a meaningful granularity. Furthermore, maintaining associations among different incarnations of models is also difficult.","With the challenges associated to linking the various occurrences of the industry models together, solutions currently used are to use a text search engine index and to define proprietary meta-models and manage associations in an industry model repository, typically in a relational database.","It is widely accepted in the Industry that the prescriptive reuse of models and other assets holds some promise in enabling the use of models to drive down the cost of software development and maintenance and therefore also make the use of model assets in the software development lifecycle accessible to a significantly broader group of practitioners than is the case today. It is therefore imperative that these practitioners have available a search mechanism to locate model assets in order to realize the potential of the model based approach to software development.","Many techniques are available to be used within a repository to search for assets. Recipes, taxonomies, ontologies, and classification schemas can all be used to aid in the search process. For example, a classification schema may be used to provide a structure for classifying assets. The values from the classification schema are stored in the asset's classification section. The most difficult and often least valuable approach for searching for assets is using keywords. However, using keywords is in fact the basis for most common search capabilities provided with model repositories today. The notion of expecting someone searching for specific assets to be able to enter a keyword that is exactly the same as was used when adding the asset (packaging the asset) into the repository is extremely hit and miss and results in many assets not being found. Furthermore, it is difficult enough even with structured searching mechanisms as above, to find and evaluate an asset, but it is even more difficult to understand how multiple assets can be used together when one is not familiar with them.","Two major styles of searching these kinds of repositories for specific content referred to as assets, are opportunistic searching and systematic searching. Assets may be organized and contained within folders in the repositories, which is an opportunistic approach to helping the user identify relevant assets.","With opportunistic searches, repositories are browsed, with or without a folder structure or searches based on keywords and phrases are conducted. While the text search engine index is easy to implement, it can only perform strict text search and the results are imprecise since they are based on the face value of text and lack inference logic and query language. The search results from the text search engine index will often result in too many results.","Proprietary meta models often use opportunistic searching since they can be constructed to allow precise and rich semantic indexing. The proprietary meta models manage abstract and not instance versions of industry models and is aware of artifacts in its own environment only. Opportunistic-style techniques are used in this kind of asset search and reuse, however searching in this manner is hit and miss and can therefore erode the value proposition of the assets, particularly if reuse is scaled to larger groups of people and across boundaries, teams, time zones, and skill sets.","The second style of searching is systematic searching which is a more prescriptive form of search. In systematic searching, associations among assets are defined or discovered and these relationships are used to narrow down and identify the assets being sought. Recipes are a good metaphor for this style of searching: In a recipe we have a list of ingredients (assets) and the guidance to \u201cmix\u201d them. Recipes also have the benefit of being customizable. Rather than searching for all the ingredients, a solution (the recipe) can be sought that points to all the ingredients (assets) needed. It offers the advantage of saving time. More value can be created by producing a set of recipes that mix multiple assets together to form larger-grained, yet customizable solutions.","According to one embodiment of the present invention a method of searching a service oriented architecture industry model repository is provided comprising a meta model service associated with a physical asset repository, the meta model service comprising: at least one topic map meta model with data specific to a particular topic or industry vertical included within an information model repository common meta-meta model, the information model repository common meta-meta model included within a meta-meta-meta model with a topic map based index. The method comprises: a computer receiving entry of a search term for the service oriented architecture industry model repository; the computer searching the service oriented architecture industry model repository for the search term; and displaying results of the searching of the service oriented architecture industry model repository as a topic map comprising data representing meta model service through a graphical interface.","According to another embodiment of the present invention a service oriented architecture (SOA) industry model repository (IMR) comprising a meta model service associated with a physical asset repository. The meta model service comprises at least one topic map meta model with data specific to a particular topic or industry vertical included within an information model repository common meta-meta model, and the information model repository common meta-meta model included within a meta-meta-meta model with a topic map based index; and a topic map displaying data representing the meta model service. The data from the at least one topic map meta model with data specific to a particular topic or industry vertical, data from the information model repository common meta-meta model, and data from the meta-meta-meta model with a topic map based index is transformed into the topic map for display through an interface.","With reference now to the figures, and in particular, with reference to , exemplary diagrams of data processing environments are provided in which illustrative embodiments may be implemented.

At the heart of the Internet is a backbone of high-speed data communication lines between major nodes or host computers, consisting of thousands of commercial, governmental, educational and other computer systems that route data and messages. Of course, network data processing system  also may be implemented as a number of different types of networks, such as, for example, an intranet, a local area network (LAN), or a wide area network (WAN).  is intended as an example, and not as an architectural limitation, for the different illustrative embodiments.","With reference now to , a block diagram of a data processing system is shown in which illustrative embodiments may be implemented. Data processing system  is an example of a computer, such as server  or client  in , in which computer usable program code or instructions implementing the processes may be located for the illustrative embodiments. In this illustrative example, data processing system  includes communications fabric , which provides communications between processor unit , memory , persistent storage , communications unit , input\/output (I\/O) unit , and display .","Processor unit  serves to execute instructions for software that may be loaded into memory . Processor unit  may be a set of one or more processors, or may be a multi-processor core, depending on the particular implementation. Further, processor unit  may be implemented using one or more heterogeneous processor systems in which a main processor is present with secondary processors on a single chip. As another illustrative example, processor unit  may be a symmetric multi-processor system containing multiple processors of the same type.","Memory  and persistent storage  are examples of storage devices . A storage device is any piece of hardware that is capable of storing information, such as, for example, without limitation, data, program code in functional form, and\/or other suitable information either on a temporary basis and\/or a permanent basis. Memory , in these examples, may be, for example, a random access memory or any other suitable volatile or non-volatile storage device. Persistent storage  may take various forms depending on the particular implementation. For example, persistent storage  may contain one or more components or devices. For example, persistent storage  may be a hard drive, a flash memory, a rewritable optical disk, a rewritable magnetic tape, or some combination of the above. The media used by persistent storage  also may be removable. For example, a removable hard drive may be used for persistent storage .","Communications unit , in these examples, provides for communications with other data processing systems or devices.

The processes of the different embodiments may be performed by processor unit  using computer implemented instructions, which may be located in a memory, such as memory .","These instructions are referred to as program code, computer usable program code, or computer readable program code, that may be read and run by a processor in processor unit . The program code in the different embodiments may be embodied on different physical or tangible computer readable media, such as memory  or persistent storage .","Program code  is located in a functional form on computer readable media  that is selectively removable and may be loaded onto or transferred to data processing system  for running by processor unit . Program code  and computer readable media  form computer program product  in these examples. In one example, computer readable media  may be in a tangible form, such as, for example, an optical or magnetic disc that is inserted or placed into a drive or other device that is part of persistent storage  for transfer onto a storage device, such as a hard drive that is part of persistent storage .

Additionally, a communications unit may include one or more devices used to transmit and receive data, such as a modem or a network adapter. Further, a memory may be, for example, memory  or a cache such as found in an interface and memory controller hub that may be present in communications fabric .","In accordance with one embodiment, a service oriented architecture component that builds meta-model services, and manages and maintains complex associations between requirements and various model assets. The meta-model is based on topic maps ISO standard. This component enables the engineering of a flexible dynamic framework to index, map and manage industry models by the concept of decoupling an asset from its physical occurrence. The industry model repository (IMR) using ISO-standard topic maps as a meta model includes an advanced search tool using visual techniques within a rich client for example Topic maps, providing a visual navigational aid to a user.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","1","102","102","104","105","102"]},"The semantic web RDF repository allows for versioning and merging of asset-requirement topic maps. With versioning and merging of asset-requirement topic maps, topic maps may be built by different domain experts and organized in conceptual spaces according to meaning. For example, a domain expert could build up an asset\u2014requirements topic map in the SOA information service space and another domain expert could build an assets-requirements topic map in the integration services space and both maps could then be easily merged together to provide multiple view on the topic map based on the role of who is using them. A user would only need to see the relevant subset of the asset-requirement topic map to help understand what particular assets are relevant to his requirements. An asset requirements domain expert would only see the relevant services topic map for his domain. An asset-requirements topic map admin would be able to see and navigate the entire map, create new association type of new topic types.","By providing an implementation for converting the SOA IMR topic map meta model to a semantic representation, the standards based query language of SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language (SPARQL) may be used to query the SOA IMR topic map meta model. SPARQL allows for very fast querying, will scale to millions of data items. Another advantage is that the requirement maps are maintained and information is kept up to date. By using a standards based query language, search and query requirement maps to understand the suitable industry model assets or combinations of assets to be used for a particular set of requirements. Querying of relevant information about a particular model asset can be carried out using the standard based query language, such as where the particular model asset can be found and what assets the particular model asset can be used in conjunction with new information such as associations between using assets can be uncovered using inference technology such as semantic web based query languages, such as SPARQL to provide answers to queries across the asset-requirements topic maps. The selection of an RDF based repository like Sesame provides support for the kind of querying to determine all of the assets that can be used to satisfy a particular requirement, even though some assets do not have explicit relationships with the requirement.","By using semantic web technologies of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), such as OWL and RDF a user has the OWL capabilities and tools for expressing constraints, doing constraint checking and automated reasoning\/inference, and for querying and visualization of ontology. In addition using semantic web technologies for converting the SOA IMR topic map meta model to an OWL-DL representation also has many additional benefits. Using semantic web technology allows the complex model-model, model requirement, and requirement-requirement associations both abstract and instance data to be expressed mathematically inform of triples (subject, predicate) which may be continuously checked for consistency to ensure the integrity of the data. Automatic tools can be used for consistency checking. Additional constrains can also be introduced depending on the particular industry model. Since the semantic web technologies are mathematically based, inference of the data can be performed to identify new associations. By using standard XML based technologies of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) such as OWL and RDF, a variety of tools such as security can be leveraged. Controlled access to the topic maps, maps or subsection of the maps is supported using the family of XML security based standards.
