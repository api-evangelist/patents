Field of the Invention","The invention relates generally to resource management, and in particular, to monitoring resources in a computing environment.","2. Background Information","A business typically uses a number of hardware and software assets to support the operation of the business and to provide services to customers. These assets typically include traditional computing hardware such as workstations, servers and printers, network hardware such as routers, switches and firewalls, and software assets such as billing systems, customer databases and network management applications.","To effectively manage these assets, businesses typically make use of a number of specialist software applications that are focused on addressing a specific need. For example, a network management application focuses on managing the computing and network assets used by the business. Typically, such applications employ various techniques to manage the assets, such as: Discovery technology to find assets and the relationships between them; A model, typically based on a standard, such as Distributed Management Task Force Common Information Model (DMTF CIM), and typically implemented using an relational database management system (RDBMS); A user interface that allows the user to interact with the managed resources; A configuration mechanism that allows the behavior of the management application to be tailored to suit the business needs; An event\/alarm database and associated functions such that the resources may be actively polled or that events\/alarms originating from the managed resources may be categorized, managed, and archived; A system, commonly referred to as a Root Cause Analysis (RCA) engine, that attempts to identify the impact of events\/alarms in context of the topology held in the applications model; etc.","A summary of certain characteristics of how resources are typically monitored is provided below. An example is that which typically results in an event or alarm being created, updated or deleted in an event management system (such as IBM Tivoli Netcool Omnibus). A resource may be actively monitored by a management application in a number of ways including, but not limited to, ICMP echo polling (pings) and Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) data retrieval. A management application may passively listen for alarms originating from managed resources. Typically these include SNMP traps or informs. A management application may parse log files generated by resources for specific information. The management application may use resource-specific probes to obtain information in a resource-specific way, such as via a published API (Application Programming Interface). Events or alarms resulting from the points identified above typically have a notion of severity that indicates how the event should be considered with respect to whether or not it is a problem or resolution. Varying degrees of severity are typically provided for, such as clear (a resolution event), warning (be aware of a certain condition) and critical (a managed resource has a problem that requires attention). A management application may apply some additional processing to events or alarms relating to resources. This processing includes thresholding of data to upgrade or downgrade severity if an aspect of the event\/alarm data exceeds or drops below an arbitrary threshold, or considering an event or alarm with respect to a topology or resource model. Although such techniques may satisfy typical use-cases, the monitoring capabilities of management applications remain limited.","The invention provides a method and system for monitoring resources in a network of resources in a computing environment. One embodiment includes: discovering resources in the network; constructing a topology model including event information for each discovered resource; providing queries for polling the models for event information, such that the resources need not be polled; executing one or more queries against one or more models; evaluating the query results to ascertain whether or not an event has affected what is considered to be normal for the result of each query; and presenting the evaluation results to enable monitoring of the resources.","These and other features, aspects and advantages of the invention will become understood with reference to the following description, appended claims and accompanying figures.","The following description is made for the purpose of illustrating the general principles of the invention and is not meant to limit the inventive concepts claimed herein. Further, particular features described herein can be used in combination with other described features in each of the various possible combinations and permutations. Unless otherwise specifically defined herein, all terms are to be given their broadest possible interpretation including meanings implied from the specification as well as meanings understood by those skilled in the art and\/or as defined in dictionaries, treatises, etc.","The invention provides a method and system for enhancing the management of managed resources in a computing environment, by improving monitoring capabilities through the use of external data sources. One embodiment includes utilizing topology and resource models to enhance resource monitoring capabilities. Arbitrary queries against a set of data are utilized to ascertain whether or not an event has affected what is considered to be normal for the result of the query. The topology and resource model may include data and concepts that are not native to a specific application, further enhancing monitoring functions (such as monitoring and Root Cause Analysis (RCA) capabilities). This enhances monitoring and RCA capabilities against managed resources using a topology and resource model such that the resources need not be actively or passively polled.","Users are provided with a mechanism for defining arbitrary queries to be made under a specific condition such that an evaluation can be made as to whether or not a deviation from the expected results set has been made. The topology and resource model polls may be changed such that they may be assembled to perform a set of tasks against a topology or resource model. A computing device that gains or loses redundancy of either internal components, such as redundant power supplies and\/or connectivity to other devices and\/or networks, is identified. It is verified that a given service or application depends on an expected set of computing and\/or network hardware and\/or associated software applications or configuration. It is further verified that a given resource is related to an expected set of resources by utilizing connectivity, containment, dependency and membership relationships. One example involves ensuring that an Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) router is connected to a set of expected OSPF routers via a set of ports\/interfaces and that these resources are in specific OSPF areas.","One implementation involves enhancing the monitoring capabilities of management applications (e.g., management software applications) by treating the topology or resource models held by management applications as a source of pollable data. This need not be the same as RCA although the invention may be used to further enhance RCA capabilities. This is because the data retrieved by management application discovery systems is typically subject to data processing such that a defined topology and resource model is constructed. The invention provides a process to use topology and resource models used by management applications, to enhance the monitoring capabilities of management applications. Models may include a variety of concepts such as information about:\n\n","Consider an example scenario, whereby a network management application, such as IBM Tivoli Network Manager IP Edition, is managing a set of network resources and includes a model that contains information including connectivity data, relationships between resources, device containment data, and relationships between components of a device. Referring to the functional block diagram of a computing environment  in , according to an embodiment of the invention, users are provided with enhanced management capabilities for devices such as Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) connectivity between managed resources. The computing environment  comprises a network in which a number of resources  (e.g., BGP speaking routers) are connected together.","A management application  maintains a topology and\/or device resource model  of each of the resources . The model  includes data and concepts for the specific application. In one example, each topology model  includes event information for a corresponding resource . A model  may be based on a standard, such as Distributed Management Task Force Common Information Model (DMTF CIM), and implemented using a relational database management system (RDBMS). A model  may include data and concepts that are not native to a specific application, further enhancing monitoring functions such as RCA capabilities. This enhances monitoring and RCA capabilities against managed resources using the topology and resource model  such that the resources need not be actively or passively polled.","Each BGP speaker  is connected to at least one other BGP speaker . The BGP speakers  are members of an Autonomous System (AS)  which is identified by a number, and can be resolved to a name (e.g., AAA, BBB and CCC). The BGP speakers  may be connected to other BGP speakers that are in networks not managed by the user of the management application . In this scenario, the BGP speakers and the Autonomous System are a member of, or are part of, the topology model but are not managed.","The management application  implements enhanced monitoring and\/or RCA capabilities by referencing external data sources. External data sources include, for example, application-specific databases, Configuration and Change Management Databases (CCMDBs), file systems and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). As such, monitoring functions of the management application  perform database or API queries against a topology and\/or device resource models , wherein the queries enable retrieving a set of data to be evaluated in the context of a regular resource poll (typically performed by management applications).","In one example, a user of the management application  is interested in knowing that the BGP speaker BGP 172.20.11.4 in Autonomous System BBB is peering with, or is connected to, other BGP speakers that are themselves members of an Autonomous System. It is assumed the computing environment (e.g., BGP network) , being managed by the management application , has a typical behavior whereby each BGP speaker is expected to be peering with a given number of other BGP speakers in specific Autonomous Systems. The user requests information about whether peering relationships of any of the BGP speakers deviate from the expected behavior and, if so, what such deviations are.","In order to satisfy this request, the management application  performs a query (i.e., query polling) of the resource topology models  to identify the set of connections and autonomous system membership for each BGP speaker. This requires two steps: one is to identify a query which returns the requested information, and the other is to define normal peering relationships such that a deviation from normal peering relationships can be detected.","Any query can be performed, and, as a result, a significantly large number of scenarios may be considered for query polling. Referring to the example computing network  in  including multiple managed networks (e.g., networks , ), according to an embodiment of the invention, such query polling may further include querying an external data source  such as a CCMDB. A CCMDB federates the data from a number of management applications  and, as a result, provides the ability to greatly enhance the scope of query polling to make use of data that is not natively available to any one management application . Furthermore, the invention provides sets of query polls that can be evaluated against a topology or resource models , the benefits of which are further enhanced if the topology or resource models are kept up-to-date by corresponding management applications  to reflect changes in the managed resources .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["30","12","13","1","15","12","11","2","16","12","13","11","17","12","31"]},"A user utilizes a user interface  to interact with the management application . When the user requests information about whether peering relationships of any of the resources  deviate from the expected behavior (and if so, what such deviations are), in process block , a query polling module  of the management application  executes one or more polling queries  to query the resource topology models  to identify the set of connections and autonomous system membership for each discovered resource . As noted, this involves identifying a query which returns information about peering relationships of any of the resources , and detecting which peering relationships deviate from normal.","In process block , a configuration module  () of the management application  uses metadata to ascertain whether or not each query definition for polling queries  requires reevaluation or re-execution based on certain conditions. An example condition involves when a definition is making use of a trigger that executes a query based on another event, such as an Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) link down trap, wherein the configuration module  executes the relevant definitions for reevaluation of the results.","An evaluation module  () of the management application  evaluates the query results and presents them to the user (e.g., via the user interface  including event lists and topology maps, or via e-mails and SMS messages, etc.). In one example, a user defines queries to be made under a specific condition such that an evaluation can be made as to whether or not a deviation from the expected results set has been made. The results include information about whether peering relationships of any of the resources  deviate from the expected behavior, and if so, what such deviations are.","Table 1 below provides example pseudo code, demonstrating the above process in conjunction with . Assume that the management application  has discovered the managed resources  and constructed an appropriate model  for each resource. Furthermore, assume that the focus of a query poll is to ascertain the BGP peering characteristics of BGP 172.20.11.4 in , and that metadata is defined such that the query poll is executed on receipt of an SNMP link down trap on BGP 172.20.11.4.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0036"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"266pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"\u2003\u2003let resourceId = \u2018BGP 172.20.11.4\u2019"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003let events = the set of events in the management application"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003let event = \u2018Link Down Trap for BGP 172.20.11.4\u2019"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\/\/ an event in the set of events"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003events.add(event);"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003let definitions = the set of definitions in the present invention"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003let definition = { name = \u2018BGP Validation\u2019,"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\/\/ name of the definition"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003triggerOn = \u2018Link Down Trap\u2019,"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\/\/ the type of thing fireing the trigger"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003action = \u201c"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\/\/ No resulting action from the trigger"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"238pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003triggeringResource = [\u2018BGP 172.20.11.4\u2019,\u2018BGP 172.20.15.12\u2019,...],","\/\/the"]},{"entry":"set of resources that fire the poll"},{"entry":["\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003periodicity = \u2018Listen\u2019,","\/\/ how"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"266pt","align":"left"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"to evaluate the meta data, i.e."},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003queryType = \u2018RDBMS\u2019,"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\/\/ the type of query to make, i.e. API\/DB"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003query = \u2018SELECT ...
