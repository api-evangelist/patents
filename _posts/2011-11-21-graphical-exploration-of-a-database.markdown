{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL BACKGROUND","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This disclosure relates to providing graphical exploration of a database, such as an in-memory database.","Business users of software in a business enterprise may utilize a virtual workspace to browse, view, modify, and\/or otherwise manipulate data related to the business enterprise. Such data may include a variety of information in many different forms, such as sales data, revenue data, human resources information, business hierarchy information, and otherwise. Graphs, tables, charts, electronic communications, web services, reports, and other forms of data, may be viewable in the user's workspace. The workspace may allow or facilitate the resolution of business issues and\/or problems by the user. The business data may be presented to a user in a particular view, or data cube, allowing the user to analyze the business data with respect to different contexts, such as a particular business issue, a product or service, an organizational unit, or other relevant contexts. Each data cube may be defined at design time prior to analysis of a data cube by a user. Further, defining a particular data cube may require knowledge of the underlying structure of business data to be represented in the data cube and the dimensions of the data cube that are to be joined.","One general embodiment according to the present disclosure includes techniques implemented in methods, computer-readable media apparatus, and systems for graphically exploring an in-memory database include: identifying a selected data object; searching an in-memory database for a data element associated with a search term; and determining a relationship between the data element and the selected data object; and generating a displayable graph of the relationship as a path between the data element and the selected data object, the path comprising at least two nodes, where a first node represents the selected data object and a second node represents a node associated with the data element.","A first aspect combinable with the general embodiment includes receiving a selection of a particular node on the path; and generating a new data object based on the selection.","In a second aspect combinable with any of the previous aspects, the new data object includes a view of data in the in-memory database different from a view associated with the selected data object.","In a third aspect combinable with any of the previous aspects, the new data object includes the particular node on the path.","In a fourth aspect combinable with any of the previous aspects, a plurality of data objects associated with the search term are identified in response to searching the in-memory database.","In a fifth aspect combinable with any of the previous aspects, a plurality of relationships are determined between the selected data object and the plurality of data objects.","In a sixth aspect combinable with any of the previous aspects, each of the plurality of relationships is displayed in at least one of a plurality of paths, each of the plurality of paths sharing the selected data object as a common node.","In a seventh aspect combinable with any of the previous aspects, the search term is not associated with a dimension of the selected data object.","In an eighth aspect combinable with any of the previous aspects, the at least one path further includes a third node representing an intervening node between the first and second nodes.","In a ninth aspect combinable with any of the previous aspects, the third node represents a data object associated with the data element, and the data object is different from the selected data object.","In a tenth aspect combinable with any of the previous aspects, the selected data object is a data cube.","Various embodiments of providing graphical exploration of an in-memory database according to the present disclosure may have one or more of the following features. For example, the displayed paths representing relationships between a selected data cube and data objects returned in a search of an in-memory database may allow a user to identify particular nodes or data to include in a new data cube. Accordingly, a selection of a particular node on the path is received, and a new data cube is generated based on the selection. The new data cube may include a view of data in the in-memory database different from a view associated with the selected data cube. The new data cube may also include the particular node on the path. Searching the in-memory database may return a plurality of data objects associated with the search term. A plurality of relationships may be determined between the selected data cube and the plurality of data objects, wherein each of the plurality of relationships is displayed in at least one of a plurality of paths, each of the plurality of paths sharing the selected data cube as a common node. Further, the search term may not be associated with a dimension of the selected data cube. The at least one path further includes a third node representing an intervening node between the first and second nodes. The third node represents a data object associated with the data element, the data object different from the selected data object.","These general and specific aspects may be implemented using a device, system or method, or any combinations of devices, systems, or methods. The details of one or more implementations are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, objects, and advantages will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"100"},"Typically, data cubes are defined during design time, prior to execution of queries for business data associated with the data cubes. Graphical exploration of an in-memory database, however, may allow creation of new data cubes in real-time in addition to the predefined data cubes. The new data cubes may be created based on generating a data structure graph of the underlying business data and allowing selection of specific data cubes or nodes in the data structure graph. Queries may be executed on data in an in-memory database. The search results may return data objects associated with other data cubes or nodes. The other data cubes and nodes are linked to an initial data cube, and the relationship between data cubes may be represented in the data structure graph. A user may then select specific data objects, data cubes, or nodes to be included in a new data cube. In some instances, technical experts are not needed to define the new data cubes, as is usually required for a traditional online analytical processing (OLAP) system.","The illustrated computing environment  includes a server system , a client system , and a remote computing system  communicably coupled through a network . Although illustrated as single systems, each of the systems , , and  may include more than one system and\/or more than one computing device (e.g., computer, laptop, server, mobile device, and otherwise) within a distributed computing environment. In general, computing environment  depicts an example configuration of a system capable of providing stateful execution of stateless applications in a substantially transparent way, as well as dynamically determining the particular application's mode of operation in response to requests from its clients (e.g., client appliances ).","The illustrated server system  includes one or more server appliances  having corresponding graphical user interfaces (GUIs) . In general, the server appliance  is a server that stores one or more applications, where at least a portion of the applications are executed via requests and responses sent to users or clients within and communicably coupled to the illustrated environment  of . In some instances, the server appliance  may store a plurality of various hosted applications, while in other instances, the server appliance  may be a dedicated server meant to store and execute only a single hosted application (e.g., the contextual workspace (server)  or the graphical exploration module ). In some instances, the server appliance  may comprise a web server, where the applications, such as the graphical exploration module , represent one or more web-based applications accessed and executed via network  by the client appliances  of the environment  to perform the programmed tasks or operations of the hosted applications.","At a high level, the server appliance  comprises an electronic computing device operable to receive, transmit, process, store, or manage data and information associated with the environment . Specifically, the server appliance  illustrated in  is responsible for receiving application requests from one or more applications (e.g., associated with the clients  of environment ) and responding to the received requests by processing said requests in the associated hosted application , and sending the appropriate response from the hosted application  back to the requesting client application . In addition to requests from the external clients  illustrated in , requests associated with the hosted applications  may also be sent from internal users, external or third-party customers, other automated applications, as well as any other appropriate entities, individuals, systems, or computers.","As used in the present disclosure, the term \u201ccomputer\u201d is intended to encompass any suitable processing device. For example, although  illustrates a single server appliance , environment  can be implemented using two or more server appliances , as well as computers other than servers, including a server pool. Indeed, server appliance  may be any computer or processing device such as, for example, a blade server, general-purpose personal computer (PC), Macintosh, workstation, UNIX-based workstation, or any other suitable device. In other words, the present disclosure contemplates computers other than general purpose computers, as well as computers without conventional operating systems. Further, illustrated server appliance  may be adapted to execute any operating system, including Linux, UNIX, Windows, Mac OS, or any other suitable operating system.","The illustrated server appliance  is communicably coupled with in-memory database  in the server system . In some embodiments, server  and\/or certain of its components may be integrated with database  so that, for instance, processing (e.g., all or partial) may be performed directly on in-memory data with processing results passed (e.g., via a communication channel) directly to a client. In alternative embodiments, the in-memory database  may be located external to the server system  and communicably coupled to one or more of the server system  and\/or client system  through the network . The illustrated in-memory database  may include integrated processing, i.e., all business and\/or analytic operations done in processing memory. Moreover, content from business content sources (described more fully below) may be replicated from one or more transactional systems (e.g., coupled to the network ) to the in-memory database  immediately. Thus, the in-memory database , in some aspects, may handle the analytical systems for all business data in real-time, as opposed to, for instance, computational processing systems that have separate transactional and analytical systems that connect through relational databases (i.e., relational databases stored on magnetic memory that require a process, e.g., ETL, to transfer data from one system to another not in real time but with a delay of an hour, day, week, or longer).","In some embodiments, the in-memory database  may expose business data and capabilities to improve an end-solution for end users (e.g., the client appliances ). The in-memory database  may reside on top of a computational engine (e.g., in the server appliance  or otherwise) that facilitates fast manipulations on large amounts of business data and\/or replication of entire business suite information. Thus, in some embodiments, the in-memory database may provide for the following design principles\/concepts: business data in real-time (e.g., GUI patterns for constantly updated business data); well modeled tables and data cubes (e.g., in order to provide semantic services); a highly parallelized computational engine (e.g., for computationally intensive GUI patterns such as real time alerts and\/or suggestions); close coupling of business logic and business data (e.g., eliminating indexing and caching).","The illustrated in-memory database  stores one or more data objects . The data objects  may include and\/or reference a variety of objects that store and\/or include business data. For instance, the data objects  may be data cubes, such as OLAP (online analytical processing) cubes. The data cubes may consist of a data structure that allows for columnar data storage rather than, e.g., row data storage; different types of indices compared to relational databases; and in-memory technology as compared to data stored in relational databases. The data cube may also allow manipulation and\/or analysis of the data stored in the cube from multiple perspectives, e.g., by dimensions, measures, and\/or elements of the cube. A cube dimension defines a category of data stored in the cube, for example, a time duration of certain business data, a product or service, business user roles, and a variety of other categories. In other words, a cube dimension may be one way to slice business data stored in the cube according to some business logic (e.g., logic within and\/or associated with the contextual workspace modules). In some instances, the data cube may have three-dimensions, but any number of dimensions may be designed into the cube (e.g., a hypercube).","A cube measure may be a fact, such as a numeric fact, that is categorized into one or more dimensions. Measures may include, for example, specific product sales data according to a set period of time. Measures may also include, for example, manufacturing efficiency data for a particular organizational unit of a business enterprise. In short, measures may include any appropriate business data that may be manipulated according to business logic to assist or support the business enterprise.","One or more functions may be performed on a data cube. For instance, the data cube may be pivoted, in various ways. Each pivot provides the business user with a distinct view of particular business data stored in the cube. For instance, in one view, a business user may be presented with sales data of a specific data within a particular geographic region across a particular time period with a particular focus on the sales vs. geography relationship. In another view, the same data (e.g., the same measures and elements) may be presented with a different focus, e.g., the sales vs. time period relationship. In some aspects, pivoting a data cube in real-time may allow the business user to more efficiently analyze the business data.","Other functions performable on data cubes may be, for instance, slice, dice, drill down\/up, and roll-up. A slice operation identifies a subset of a multi-dimensional array corresponding to a single value for one or more members of the cube dimensions not in the subset. A dice operation is a slice operation on more than two dimensions of a data cube (or more than two consecutive slices). A drill down\/up operation allows the business user to navigate the data cube's levels of data to reveal levels containing the most summarized (up) data to the most detailed (down) data. A roll-up operation involves computing all of the data relationships for one or more dimensions of the data cube.","The data objects  may include and\/or store other forms of data along with or in place of data cubes. For example, the data objects  may represent, store, and\/or reference data from one or more content sources, such as web content, feeds, REST services, business data repositories, reports, status updates, discussions, wikis, blogs, and other content sources. Of course, while illustrated as contained in the in-memory database , the data objects  may also be stored, for example, in one or both of the memories , in the remote computing system , and\/or a separate repository communicably coupled to the network . In some embodiments, the data objects  may be stored in a raw, compiled, or compressed form or combination thereof.","The illustrated client system  includes one or more client appliances  having corresponding GUIs . Each client appliance  may be any computing device operable to connect to or communicate with at least the server system  and\/or via the network  using a wireline or wireless connection. Further, as illustrated, each client appliance  includes a processor , an interface , and a memory . In general, each client appliance  comprises an electronic computer device operable to receive, transmit, process, and store any appropriate data associated with the environment  of . It will be understood that there may be any number of client appliances  associated with, or external to, environment . For example, while illustrated environment  illustrates three client appliances, alternative implementations of environment  may include a single client appliance  communicably coupled to the server system , or any other number suitable to the purposes of the environment .","Additionally, there may also be one or more additional client appliances  external to the illustrated portion of environment  that are capable of interacting with the environment  via the network . Further, the term \u201cclient\u201d and \u201cuser\u201d may be used interchangeably as appropriate without departing from the scope of this disclosure. Moreover, while each client appliance  is described in terms of being used by a single user, this disclosure contemplates that many users may use one computer, or that one user may use multiple computers. As used in this disclosure, client appliance  is intended to encompass a tablet computing device, personal computer, touch screen terminal, workstation, network computer, kiosk, wireless data port, smart phone, personal data assistant (PDA), one or more processors within these or other devices, or any other suitable processing device. For example, each client appliance  may comprise a computer that includes an input device, such as a keypad, touch screen, mouse, or other device that can accept user information, and an output device that conveys information associated with the operation of the server system  or the client appliance  itself, including digital data, visual information, any application, or the GUI . Both the input and output device may include fixed or removable storage media such as a magnetic storage media, CD-ROM, or other suitable media to both receive input from and provide output to users of the client appliances  through the display, namely, the GUI .","The illustrated network  facilitates wireless or wireline communications between the components of the environment  (i.e., between the server system  and the client system ), as well as with any other local or remote computer (e.g., remote computing system ), such as additional clients, servers, or other devices communicably coupled to network  but not illustrated in . The network  is illustrated as a single network in , but may be a continuous or discontinuous network without departing from the scope of this disclosure, so long as at least a portion of the network  may facilitate communications between senders and recipients. The network  may be all or a portion of an enterprise or secured network, while in another instance at least a portion of the network  may represent a connection to the Internet. In some instances, a portion of the network  may be a virtual private network (VPN), such as, for example, the connection between the client system  and the server system .","Further, all or a portion of the network  can comprise either a wireline or wireless link. Example wireless links may include 802.11a\/b\/g\/n, 802.20, WiMax, and\/or any other appropriate wireless link. In other words, the network  encompasses any internal or external network, networks, sub-network, or combination thereof operable to facilitate communications between various computing components inside and outside the illustrated environment . The network  may communicate, for example, Internet Protocol (IP) packets, Frame Relay frames, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) cells, voice, video, data, and other suitable information between network addresses. The network  may also include one or more local area networks (LANs), radio access networks (RANs), metropolitan area networks (MANs), wide area networks (WANs), cellular networks, all or a portion of the Internet, and\/or any other communication system or systems at one or more locations.","The illustrated remote computing system  is communicably coupled to one or both of the server system  and client system  through the network . In some instances, as illustrated, the remote computing system  stores and\/or references third party content , such as, for example, data objects, web content, electronic communications, content feeds, and other data sources. Although illustrated as a single appliance, the remote computing system  may include any number of appliances (e.g., servers, clients, mobile devices, and otherwise) coupled to the network  individually and\/or in groups. For instance, in some embodiments, the remote computing system  may be a web content server delivering web content to one or more of the client appliances  in response to a request. In some embodiments, the remote computing system  may be a repository storing one or more data objects, such as data cubes or other form of database storing business data.","The illustrated communication interfaces  (shown as part of the server appliance  and the client appliance ) facilitate communication among appliances in, for example, the client system , the remote computing system , and the server system . The interfaces  may also facilitate communication among the illustrated systems and other systems in a client-server or other distributed environment (including within environment ) connected to the network. Generally, the interfaces  include logic encoded in software and\/or hardware in a suitable combination and operable to communicate with the network . More specifically, the interfaces  may include software supporting one or more communication protocols associated with communications such that the network  or interface's hardware is operable to communicate physical signals within and outside of the illustrated environment .","The illustrated processors  (shown as part of the server appliance  and the client appliance ) may be a central processing unit (CPU), a blade, an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), or another suitable component. Generally, the processors  execute instructions and manipulate data to perform the operations of the respective server appliance  and client appliance  and, specifically, the contextual workspace module (server)  and, contextual workspace module (client) ), and the graphical exploration module , as well as any other applications. Specifically, the server appliance's processor  executes the functionality required to receive and respond to requests from the client appliances  and their respective applications (e.g., contextual workspace (client) ), as well as the functionality required to perform the other operations of the contextual workspace module (server) .","Regardless of the particular implementation, \u201csoftware\u201d may include computer-readable instructions, firmware, wired or programmed hardware, or any combination thereof on a tangible medium operable when executed to perform at least the processes and operations described herein. Indeed, each software component may be fully or partially written or described in any appropriate computer language including C, C++, Java, Visual Basic, assembler, Perl, any suitable version of 4GL, as well as others. It will be understood that while portions of the software illustrated in  are shown as individual modules that implement the various features and functionality through various objects, methods, or other processes, the software may instead include a number of sub-modules, third party services, components, libraries, and such, as appropriate. Conversely, the features and functionality of various components can be combined into single components as appropriate. Although illustrated as a single processor  for each of the respective server appliance  and client appliance  in , two or more processors may be used according to particular needs, desires, or particular embodiments of environment .","The illustrated memories  (shown as part of the server appliance  and the client appliance ) may include any memory or database module and may take the form of volatile or non-volatile memory including, without limitation, magnetic media, optical media, random access memory (RAM), read-only memory (ROM), removable media, or any other suitable local or remote memory component. Each memory  may store various objects or data, including classes, frameworks, applications, backup data, business objects, jobs, web pages, web page templates, database tables, repositories storing business and\/or dynamic information, and any other appropriate information including any parameters, variables, algorithms, instructions, rules, constraints, or references thereto associated with the purposes of the respective server appliance  and client appliance . Additionally, each memory  may include any other appropriate data, such as VPN applications, firmware logs and policies, firewall policies, a security or access log, print or other reporting files, as well as others.","As illustrated, memory  of the server appliance  includes and\/or stores one or more server content objects . Memory  of the client appliance  includes and\/or stores one or more client content objects . In some embodiments, the server content objects  and\/or the client content objects  may be similar to the data objects  stored in the in-memory database . For example, the content objects  and  may be data cubes, tables, reports, or other content sources, such as web content, electronic communications, feeds, and otherwise. Regardless of the form of the content objects  and , these objects may contain and\/or reference business data on which business logic may be applied, e.g., by the contextual workspace module (server)  and\/or contextual workspace module (client) , in order to realize and\/or accomplish a task in a business environment.","The illustrated computing system  includes a contextual workspace module (server)  and a contextual workspace module (client) , and a graphical exploration module . At a high level, each of the contextual workspace module (server)  and contextual workspace module (client)  (referred to collectively as the contextual workspace modules), and the graphical exploration module , is any application, program, module, process, or other software that may execute, change, delete, generate, or otherwise manage information according to the present disclosure, particularly in response to and in connection with one or more requests received from the illustrated client appliances  and their associated applications. In certain cases, only one contextual workspace module (server)  may be located at a particular server appliance . In others, a plurality of related and\/or unrelated contextual workspace module (server)  may be stored at a single server appliance , or located across a plurality of other server appliances  in the server system , as well.","In certain cases, the contextual workspace modules and the graphical exploration module  may be implemented as composite applications. For example, portions of the composite application may be implemented as Enterprise Java Beans (EJBs) or design-time components may have the ability to generate run-time implementations into different platforms, such as J2EE (Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition), ABAP (Advanced Business Application Programming) objects, or Microsoft's .NET, among others. Additionally, the contextual workspace modules may represent web-based applications accessed and executed by remote client appliances  or client applications via the network  (e.g., through the Internet).","Further, while illustrated as internal to server appliance , one or more processes associated with the contextual workspace module (server)  or the graphical exploration module  may be stored, referenced, or executed remotely. For example, a portion of the contextual workspace module (server)  may be a web service associated with the application that is remotely called, while another portion of the contextual workspace module (server)  may be an interface object or agent bundled for processing at a remote client appliance  via the contextual workspace module (client) . Moreover, any or all of the contextual workspace modules or the graphical exploration module  may be a child or sub-module of another software module or enterprise application (not illustrated) without departing from the scope of this disclosure.","As explained more fully below, one, all, or a combination of the contextual workspace modules  and , and the graphical exploration module , may present or facilitate presentation of a user interface, e.g., through GUI  and\/or GUI , to a business user to perform a variety of tasks. For instance, the contextual workspace modules  and  may present one or more workspace modules containing business data relevant to the business user in a variety of forms, e.g., tables, graphs, notes, and otherwise. The relevant business data may be sourced from, for example, the data objects  or other content sources. The graphical exploration module  may present a graphical depiction of relationships between different data cubes or specific data objects, allowing a user to select particular elements of the graphical depiction for generating new data cubes.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIGS. 2A-2B","FIG. 1","FIGS. 4A-D","FIG. 5"],"b":["200","250","200","250","200","250","100","200","250"]},"Turning to , the illustrated distributed computing system  includes a web portal  communicably coupled to a virtual appliance  and an in-memory database . In some embodiments, the web portal  provides an authentication portal allowing a single point of access to applications, business data, and services both within and external to a business enterprise. For instance, an employee or user of the business enterprise may access the virtual appliance  and\/or the in-memory database  via the web portal . In other words, the web portal  may provide a front end accessible through a client appliance located at the business enterprise.","The illustrated web portal  includes a client enterprise workspace . In some aspects, the client enterprise workspace  may be substantially similar to the contextual workspace module (client)  shown in . For instance, the client enterprise workspace  may present or facilitate presentation of a user interface (e.g., one or more workspace modules described more fully below) to the business user to perform a variety of tasks.","The illustrated virtual appliance  may be substantially similar to the server appliance  illustrated in  and include a server enterprise workspace , a business intelligence module , and an open source module . The server enterprise workspace , in some implementations, may be substantially similar to the contextual workspace module (server)  shown in . For instance, the server enterprise workspace  may provide for a customizable and dynamic virtual workspace accessible to a client and\/or user via a GUI, e.g., through the web portal . In some aspects, as explained more fully below, such a virtual contextual workspace may provide for a number of functional features and advantages, such as, for instance, providing semantic context to relevant business data, providing suggestions to the user to add semantic and\/or social data, and generating a number of ranked suggestions to add semantic data to the workspace according to social criteria.","The illustrated business intelligence module , at a high level, provides software and\/or middleware services for performance analytics (e.g., supports organizational efforts to develop sophisticated visual representations of processes and performance, providing organizations with new insights that can help them make more informed decisions, assess and plan a business intelligence strategy, deploy dashboard tools, generate management and operational reports, and build an IT infrastructure that provides high scalability for users and data); services for analytic applications (e.g., provides guidance and deployment expertise in implementing analytic applications, offering pre-built analytics and data models to help a customer with a specific business problem in various industries, helping organizations to efficiently deploy applications); and introductory business intelligence services (e.g., introduces organizations to the dynamics of using business intelligence, providing the ability to leverage the functionality of business intelligence\u2014such as executive dashboards and operational reports\u2014without initiating a full-scale implementation).","The illustrated open source module , in some embodiments, may be an open source web application framework, such as, for example, a Rails (or RoR) for the Ruby programming language. In some embodiments, the module  may provide generic services like authentication, authorization, repository, logging, and otherwise","The illustrated virtual appliance  is communicably coupled to a business object repository  in order to consume (e.g., retrieve, modify, manipulate or otherwise) business objects relevant to the business enterprise. Each business object stored on the repository , for example, a capsule with an internal hierarchical structure, behavior offered by its operations, and integrity constraints. In general, the overall structure of the business object model ensures the consistency of the interfaces that are derived from the business object model. The derivation helps ensure that the same business-related subject matter or concept can be represented and structured in the same way in various interfaces. The business object model defines the business-related concepts at a central location for a number of business transactions. In other words, it reflects the decisions made about modeling the business entities of the real world acting in business transactions across industries and business areas. The business object model is defined by the business objects and their relationship to each other (the overall net structure).","Business objects are generally semantically disjointed, i.e., the same business information is represented once. In some embodiments, the business objects are arranged in an ordering framework such that they can be arranged according to their existence dependency to each other. For example, in a modeling environment, the customizing elements might be arranged on the left side of the business object model, the strategic elements might be arranged in the center of the business object model, and the operative elements might be arranged on the right side of the business object model. Similarly, the business objects can be arranged in this model from the top to the bottom based on defined order of the business areas, e.g., finance could be arranged at the top of the business object model with customer relationship management (CRM) below finance and supplier relationship management (SRM) below CRM. To help ensure the consistency of interfaces, the business object model may be built using standardized data types as well as packages to group related elements together, and package templates and entity templates to specify the arrangement of packages and entities within the structure.","A business object may be defined such that it contains multiple layers. Typical business object may contains four layers: a kernel layer, an integrity layer, an interface layer, and an access layer. The innermost layer of the example business object is the kernel layer. The kernel layer represents the business object's inherent data, containing various attributes of the defined business object. The second layer represents the integrity layer. The integrity layer contains the business logic of the object. Such logic may include business rules for consistent embedding in a computing environment and the constraints regarding the values and domains that apply to the business object. Business logic may comprise statements that define or constrain some aspect of the business, such that they are intended to assert business structure or to control or influence the behavior of the business entity. It may pertain to the facts recorded on data and constraints on changes to that data. In effect, business logic may determine what data may, or may not, be recorded in business object. The third layer, the interface layer, may supply the valid options for accessing the business object and describe the implementation, structure, and interface of the business object to the outside world. To do so, the interface layer may contain methods, input event controls, and output events. The fourth and outermost layer of the business object is the access layer. The access layer defines the technologies that may be used for external access to the business object's data. Some examples of allowed technologies may include COM\/DCOM (Component Object Model\/Distributed Component Object Model), CORBA (Common Object Request Broker Architecture), RFC (Remote Function Call), Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Java, among others. Additionally, business objects of this embodiment may implement standard object-oriented technologies such as encapsulation, inheritance, and\/or polymorphism.","The illustrated system  includes the in-memory database  communicably coupled to the web portal  and the virtual appliance . For example, as illustrated, the in-memory database  may be invoked by either or both of the web portal  and the virtual appliance . The in-memory database  may be substantially similar to the in-memory database  described in . Further, the in-memory database  includes in-memory business logic  (which, as illustrated, may be invoked by either or both of the web portal  and the virtual appliance ). The in-memory business logic  may include a combination of one or more of software, middleware, and hardware (or other logic) operable to manipulate one or more data objects (e.g., stored in-memory on the database ). For instance, the in-memory business logic  may perform functionality associated with and\/or used by the enterprise workspace (client)  and\/or enterprise workspace (server) , such as the methods described with reference to  and , as well as other functionality disclosed herein.","The illustrated in-memory database  is communicably coupled to a business suite . In some embodiments, as described above, complete or partial processing may be done directly on a database, thus rendering making components like the \u201cdatabase,\u201d \u201cserver,\u201d and\/or \u201csuite\u201d substantially similar or identical. At a high level, the business suite  may consist of one or more integrated enterprise applications enabling, e.g., business enterprises, to execute and optimize business and IT strategies, such as performing industry-specific, and business-support processes.

For instance, while some business data may be stored on the in memory database  and therefore, be accessible in real-time, some business data may be available to and\/or exposed by the in-memory business logic , such as the third party content .","The illustrated system  also includes one or more clients . For instance, as illustrates, the clients  may include a mobile client , and a web workspace . One or more of the clients  may invoke, for example, the enterprise workspace (server) , on the virtual appliance  in order to access and\/or expose the functionality of the in-memory business logic . For example, the mobile client  may facilitate invocation of the enterprise workspace (server)  from a mobile device (e.g., cell phone, smart phone, email mobile device, PDA, or other mobile device). The web workspace  may, for instance, facilitate invocation of the enterprise workspace (server)  through a network connection, such as the global network known as the world wide web.","Turning to , the illustrated distributed computing system  includes the web portal  communicably coupled to an in-memory application server , which, in turn, is communicably coupled to the clients , the business object repository , and a business financial management module .

For example, the module gallery  may include an index (e.g., stored in a repository) of the current workspace modules being viewed by the user in the contextual workspace.","The illustrated layout manager , in some embodiments, may determine how one or more selected and\/or requested workspace modules may be arranged on the contextual workspace. For example, the layout manager  may determine a size and\/or placement of each module on the contextual workspace in order to, for instance, better manage the contextual workspace in the GUI presented to the user.","The illustrated data orchestrator , in some embodiments, may determine, for example, one or more available views and\/or functionality available to the user with respect to a data cube (e.g., an OLAP cube storing business data exposable to the user). For example, the data orchestrator  may determine how to present or show any data model, including a data cube, to the user (e.g., icon, full screen, or something in between). In some embodiments, for example, the data orchestrator  may function along with other components of the illustrated architecture (e.g., the workspace manager , the module gallery , the layout manager , and other components) to perform the functionality described in  and , as well as other processes and methods described herein.","The illustrated contextual assistance module , in some embodiments, may include functionality that provides the user of the contextual workspace generated by the architecture  with additional business data contextually relevant with business data being currently viewed in the workspace. For instance, the contextual assistance module  (or other modules included in the illustrated architecture ) may identify semantically related information to that currently viewed on the contextual workspace by the user. The semantically related information may be suggested to the user, for example, to add to the contextual workspace through one or more workspace modules.","The illustrated global filtering module , in some embodiments, may provide for functionality that, for example, ranks and\/or filters various suggestions for content (e.g., semantically related content or socially related content) to be added to the user's contextual workspace through architecture . For instance, the global filtering module  (or other modules included in the illustrated architecture ) may rank suggestions to add semantically related data to the user's contextual workspace according to one or more social metrics.","The illustrated data annotations module , in some embodiments, may provide for functionality that, for example, allows a user to generate notes (or other annotations) that provide specific context to data within one or more workspace modules in the contextual workspace.

For instance, the data streaming module  may manage the speed at which data is transferred to the web client  to, for example, expose on one or more workspace modules of the contextual workspace generated and presented to the user.","The illustrated timeline module , in some embodiments, may provide for functionality that allows a user to \u201ctime travel\u201d through one or more previous views of a contextual workspace. For instance, in some embodiments, each distinct contextual workspace (i.e., each view with a distinct set, combination, and\/or number of workspace modules included within the contextual workspace) may be time stamped with a particular time (e.g., hour\/minute\/day, date, week, month, or other granularity). The time stamp may be part of the metadata of the contextual workspace generated by and presented to the user. In some aspects, the user may \u201ctime travel\u201d back in time to view previous versions of the contextual workspace according to the time stamp. Thus, not only the data contained in the contextual workspace, but the user's subjective view on the data (e.g., which workspace modules were selected) can be retrieved. The user may filter the contextual workspace versions by the time stamp, data exposed in the contextual workspaces, keywords, and\/or other metrics.","The illustrated connectivity module  includes, in some embodiments, context sources module  and a content fetching module , and, in some aspects, may provide connection functionality for the web client  to communicate with, for example, the web server , the in-memory computing engine , the data sources , and\/or other content repositories or sources. The illustrated context sources module , in some embodiments, may provide for functionality to the web client  to connect to various sources of contextually relevant (e.g., semantically relevant) data related to one or more workspace modules in the contextual workspace.

The illustrated context discovery module , in some embodiments, may provide functionality related to searching for and\/or exposing semantically relevant content related to data on the contextual workspace, e.g., in one or more workspace modules. For example, semantically relevant data may include information related to data that the user works with or views in the contextual workspace and\/or arranges (according to his\/her expertise) within the contextual workspace. For instance, the arrangement of data (e.g., which workspace modules are selected and\/or viewed) may provide at least a portion of the overall context of the workspace apart from the data (numerical or otherwise). The semantically relevant data may be related, e.g., according to keywords, metadata, cube dimensions, cube measures, cube views, table headings, etc., which may be unknown to the user (due to, for instance, the vast amount of data available to the user).","The illustrated suggestions and rankings module , in some embodiments, may include functionality that provides suggestions of semantically relevant data to the user to add to the contextual workspace. The suggestions and rankings module  may also include functionality that ranks a number of suggestions of semantically relevant data according to, for example, matching keywords, matching metadata, social metrics, and\/or other criteria.","The illustrated events and alerts module , in some embodiments, may include functionality that allows the user set an alert, e.g., at a given point of time when a particular event is occurring.

The suggested business data may also be contextually relevant to one or more workspace modules active in the user's contextual workspace.","The illustrated semantic suggestions module , in some embodiments, include functionality that provides suggestions of semantically relevant data to the user to add to the contextual workspace. For instance, the suggestions may include business data that has some related contextual similarity with data exposed in one or more workspace modules in the user's contextual workspace. For example, the semantically relevant data may be business data from a data cube having one or more similar dimensions and\/or measures as compared to a data cube currently being viewed and\/or analyzed in the contextual workspace. As another example, the semantically relevant data may be business data from a table having a similar heading to a table currently being viewed in the contextual workspace. Thus, the suggested semantically relevant data may be business data that provides insight to the user that the business user would not have known about otherwise.","The illustrated alert engine , in some embodiments, in some embodiments, may include functionality that allows the user set an alert, e.g., at a given point of time when a particular event is occurring.

For instance, the illustrated event insight , in some embodiments, may provide alerts to the web client  and\/or web server  to present to the business user through one or more workspace modules of the contextual workspace. The illustrated social intelligence , in some embodiments, may provide social business data (e.g., social connections between one or more business users in a business enterprise) to the web client  and\/or web server  to present to the business user through one or more workspace modules of the contextual workspace. For example, the social business data may be a graph and\/or chart showing business connections between employees, such as, for instance, a degree of connection between the employees (e.g., through one or more known business contacts). The illustrated text analysis , in some embodiments, may identify business data located in documents or other data objects through, for instance, a keyword search or metadata search of the text in the documents.

Typically, the external content providers  provide for a number of UI applications that may be interfaced by a user, e.g., through the web client  or otherwise. The business suite app , for example, may be business applications that provide integration of information and processes, collaboration, industry-specific functionality, and scalability. For instance, the business suite app may include one or more constituents, such as CRM (Customer Relationship Management), ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning), PLM (Product Lifecycle Management), SCM (Supply Chain Management), and\/or SRM (Supplier Relationship Management). The business intelligence app , for example, may provide for a UI application that may be used in identifying and extracting business data (e.g., ETL) and analyzing such business data. The business data may include, for example, sales revenue, profits, and\/or costs broken down by products and\/or departments. In some aspects, the business intelligence app may provide for historical, current, and\/or predictive views of business operations, such as reporting, online analytical processing, analytics, data mining, process mining, business performance management, benchmarking, text mining, and\/or predictive analytics.
