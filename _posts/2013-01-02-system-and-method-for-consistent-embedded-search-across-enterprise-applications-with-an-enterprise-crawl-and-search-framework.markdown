The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure, as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.","Embodiments of the invention are generally related to enterprise applications, and to systems and methods for providing an enterprise crawl and search framework, including features such as use with middleware and enterprise application environments, pluggable security, search development tools, user interfaces, and governance.","Enterprise resource planning (ERP) or enterprise applications are commonly used by larger companies and organizations to run important aspects of their business. A typical enterprise application environment may include a database of business content, combined with end-user applications such as customer relationship management (CRM), human capital management (HCM), and business intelligence (BI).","Examples of such environments include Oracle E-Business Suite, and Oracle Fusion Applications, each of which is designed for handling complex business tasks within a large organization.","Organizations have become increasingly interested in greater integration of their business content with their business processes, including the use of transaction processing systems or application servers, such as Oracle WebLogic or Oracle Fusion Middleware, to deliver a higher quality of service in today's increasingly complex business environment. Such organizations can benefit from a richer search experience within their enterprise, which in turn requires rethinking traditional search methodologies. For example, since those company employees seeking particular information are also likely to have the best knowledge regarding their particular situation, it is important that they can obtain the information within that context. These are the general areas that embodiments of the invention are intended to address.","In accordance with various embodiments, described herein are systems and methods for providing an enterprise crawl and search framework, including features such as use with middleware and enterprise application environments, pluggable security, search development tools, user interfaces, and governance.","As described herein, in accordance with an embodiment, the system includes an enterprise crawl and search framework which abstracts an underlying search engine, provides a common set of application programming interfaces for developing search functionalities, and allows the framework to serve as an integration layer between one or more enterprise search engines and one or more enterprise application applications. An application development framework allows an application developer to make searchable view objects that are associated with a plurality of enterprise applications. At runtime, a searchable object manager loads searchable objects from persistent storage, validates the searchable object definitions, and provides the searchable objects to the framework for use in searching across the plurality of enterprise applications.","As described above, organizations have become increasingly interested in greater integration of their business content with their business processes, including the use of transaction processing systems or application servers, to deliver a higher quality of service in today's increasingly complex business environment.","In particular, today's enterprise search specialists are looking to several important aspects of enterprise searching for use with their systems, including:\n\n","To address this, in accordance with an embodiment, described herein are systems and methods for providing an enterprise crawl and search framework (ECSF), including features such as use with middleware and enterprise application environments, pluggable security, search development tools, user interfaces, and governance.","In accordance with an embodiment, the enterprise crawl and search framework can be used with environments such as Oracle Fusion Applications and\/or Oracle WebLogic application server, or other enterprise application and computing environments, to consolidate business content information, and enable transactional search in a business context.","In accordance with an embodiment, the enterprise crawl and search framework includes an open architecture that supports different types of search engine in a plug-and-play manner, e.g., the use of Oracle Secure Enterprise Search (SES) or another open source or proprietary search engine. An administrator can add, define, configure and change search engines; define repositories to be supported; and administer external repositories, such as defining their location, defining and configuring connectors, indexing external data, and defining parameters related to federated search.","In accordance with an embodiment, the enterprise crawl and search framework can support features such as searching across different objects that have 1:1,1:M, M:1 or M:M relationships with each other, as defined by the organization's business process; and the use of searchable objects, which allow users to control which objects can be exposed and made searchable.","In accordance with an embodiment which uses Fusion Applications, the enterprise crawl and search framework can be provided as part of an integrated environment that includes the framework itself; one or more search engines that provides the fundamental search capability that includes indexing, querying, and security; and a source system, such as a relational database, which stores searchable business content or other information.","In accordance with various embodiments described herein, some of the features and advantages of the enterprise crawl and search framework include:\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","102","120","130"]},"In accordance with an embodiment, the enterprise crawl and search framework includes a searchable object manager component , a search designer component , a runtime (e.g., managed bean, Mbean) component , a semantic engine component , a command line administration utility component , and one or more security service , data service , and query service . Each of the above components is described in further detail below.","In accordance with an embodiment, the enterprise crawl and search framework integrates with an enterprise search engine (e.g., SES), which provides capabilities for crawling and indexing metadata and objects exposed by the framework. In accordance with an embodiment, the enterprise search engine can include one or more security plugin component , crawler plugin component , and search federation component . Each of the above components are also described in further detail below.","In accordance with an embodiment, each enterprise application can include a search user interface (UI) , and an application repository .","In accordance with an embodiment, the enterprise search environment including the enterprise crawl and search framework can be accessed by a developer or another user using an application development framework  (e.g., Oracle JDeveloper); and by an administrator or another user using an administration system  (e.g., Oracle Fusion Applications Control, or Oracle Enterprise Manager).","Searchable Object Manager","In accordance with an embodiment, the searchable object manager component serves as a metadata manager, manages searchable objects, and provides the runtime interface for accessing these objects. At runtime, the searchable object manager loads searchable objects from persistent storage, validates the searchable object definitions, and provides the searchable objects to a crawlable factory component of the data service. In accordance with an embodiment, the searchable object manager is also responsible for the lifecycle management of the searchable objects, which allows administrators to deploy, customize, and enable or disable searchable objects via the command line administration utility component, or the administration system.","Search Designer","In accordance with an embodiment, the search designer component can be provided, e.g., as a page in JDeveloper, including an interface for defining metadata that describes the business objects to be indexed. A developer or another user can use this design interface to specify the security mechanism to be used to protect the data, and to define the searchable object search characteristics, which include advanced search, faceted navigation, and actionable results.","Semantic Engine","In accordance with an embodiment, the semantic engine component leverages the semantic information of searchable object definitions to create context around the search, by interpreting searchable object definitions with relation to the runtime user information during both crawl and query time.","Administration System","In accordance with an embodiment, the administration system can be provided, e.g., as an Enterprise Manager extension that provides a user interface for registering searchable objects in the framework schema of, e.g., the Fusion Applications database, as well as for administering the runtime parameters of the framework, the target search engine, and the configuration of parameters.","Command Line Administration Utility","In accordance with an embodiment, the command line administration utility component is a standalone command line interface that provides a user interface for registering searchable objects in the framework schema of, e.g., the Fusion Applications database. A developer, administrator, or other user can also use the command line administration utility to configure and administer the framework without external dependencies on the administration system.","Security Service","In accordance with an embodiment, the security service component is responsible for providing security information to the search engine. During query time, the security service retrieves the security keys of the user performing the search, and passes those keys to the search engine, where they are used to filter the query results.","In accordance with an embodiment, the security service server component is also invoked during crawl time, to add security information (access control lists, ACL) to data before inserting or creating indexes on the search engine. An ACL identifies the users who can access an associated object, and specifies the user's access rights to that object. The ACL values generated by the security service during crawl time should match the corresponding keys generated during query time.","In accordance with an embodiment, the security service component is implemented as a security engine with a plug-in interface. The security plug-in determines the format of the ACL keys. For custom security models, a new\/custom security plug-in can be implemented. In accordance with an embodiment, the security service can use, e.g., Oracle Platform Security for Java, to authenticate users and call the security plug-in to retrieve security values for a given searchable object.","Data Service","In accordance with an embodiment, the data service component is the primary data interface between the enterprise crawl and search framework and the search engine. In accordance with an embodiment, the data service can use a proprietary Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed format. In addition to supporting the flow of metadata between the framework and the search engine, the data service can support attachments, batching, and error handling.","In accordance with an embodiment, the data service authenticates each search engine crawl request by using, e.g., Platform Security for Java, to validate the user credentials and permissions for crawling the data source. A crawlable factory component, which is part of the data service, determines how searchable objects are broken down, and manages the construction of RSS feeds to the search engine.","Query Service","In accordance with an embodiment, the query service component provides a search interface for the enterprise application's search user interface (UI), and handles all search requests. In accordance with an embodiment, the query service performs query rewrite, parameter substitution, and other preprocessing operations, before invoking the underlying configured search engine. Search results are also serviced via this service. Hooks can be provided to preprocess and postprocess data, which facilitates the capability to filter search results.","Search Engine","In accordance with an embodiment, the search engine component (e.g., SES) enables a secure, uniform search across multiple enterprise repositories. The enterprise crawl and search framework integrates with the search engine to provide full-text search functionality in enterprise applications (e.g., Fusion Applications).","Security Plug-In","Some search engines, such as SES, provide an API for writing security plug-ins or connectors, e.g., in Java, which allows a developer to provide a security plug-in to meet their requirements. In accordance with an embodiment, the enterprise crawl and search framework can interface with this security plug-in. The security plug-in invokes the security service to retrieve keys, to which the user has access, for filtering the results that are delivered to the query service. In accordance with an embodiment, a proxy user must be set up on the search engine in order to invoke the security service, and must have security privileges for the enterprise applications (e.g., Fusion Applications).","Crawler Plug-In","In accordance with an embodiment, the crawler plug-in component is a search engine module that implements the modified RSS feed format between the enterprise crawl and search framework and the search engine. In accordance with an embodiment, the crawler plug-in component deserializes data communicated by the framework, via the data service component, and interfaces with the search engine components that create the indexes.","Search Federation","In accordance with an embodiment, the search federation component provides support for the user of federated search engine instances.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0060"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"]},"As shown in , in accordance with an embodiment, a business intelligence (BI) server environment , such as an Oracle Business Intelligence environment using WebLogic application server, can include a BI server , and a web services component , that provides access to a BI web catalog of business content, data, or other information .","In accordance with an embodiment, one or more BI applications  can include an enterprise crawl and search framework API , which allows a developer or other user  using an application development framework and\/or administration system, to configure the BI application(s) to take advantage of the enterprise crawl and search framework, including leveraging the enterprise search engine , search instances , and search engine database , to provide full-text search functionality across the applications.","Consistent Embedded Search Across Enterprise Applications","In accordance with an embodiment, a system including the enterprise crawl and search framework can include support for consistent embedded search across enterprise applications.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0064"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0005","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0005-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0006","list-style":"none"},"li":["An enterprise application (e.g., Fusion Applications) developer  uses an application development framework (e.g., JDeveloper)  to create  one or more searchable objects.","The enterprise application developer also configures appropriate security rules , , for use with the search objects.","An enterprise application administrator  deploys the searchable objects to the ECSF runtime environment, by registering the searchable objects in the enterprise application repository or database .","The enterprise application administrator deploys  the searchable objects  to the ECSF and the enterprise search engine (e.g., SES).","The search engine crawls  the searchable objects in the enterprise application, and indexes the searchable objects as documents.","The enterprise application administrator creates search categories containing the searchable objects, and deploys the search categories to the search engine.","When an enterprise application user subsequently uses the ECSF to issue a search query in connection with the enterprise application, the enterprise application search user interface (UI)  performs the query  through the ECSF query service .","The query service applies enterprise application-specific rules , including any security rules previously indicated by the developer, and sends the query  to the search engine.","The search engine returns the result set  to the query service.","The query service applies post query security rules and constructs the search hits, and the search UI renders the search results to be returned to the enterprise application user."]}}}},"In accordance with an embodiment, in addition to providing search against enterprise crawl and search framework data sources (i.e., view object-based data sources deployed via an ECSF administration utility), and data sources that are crawled via ECSF, the framework also supports search against registered data source groups that contain external data sources.","In accordance with an embodiment, such external data sources can include data sources such as Intranet, mail, database, and federated data sources (data sources crawled in separate engine instances). Searchable data source groups can also contain federated ECSF data sources (data sources created in different logical engine instances via the ECSF administration tools).","In accordance with an embodiment, the ECSF synchronizes categories with the data source groups provided by the enterprise search engine; the data sources themselves are not synchronized.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0078"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0007","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0007-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0008","list-style":"none"},"li":["An application user  imports data source groups  from the enterprise search engine (e.g., SES) using an administration system  (e.g., Fusion Applications Control, or Enterprise Manager).","The enterprise applications (e.g., Fusion Applications) database is synchronized ,  with the data source groups from the enterprise search engine.","The enterprise crawl and search framework (ECSF) sets a flag (e.g., an IS_EXTERNAL flag) as true on those records identified as external search categories; and both the ECSF-created search categories, and external search categories are accessible via a function call (e.g., a getSearchGroups( ) function call) .","The ECSF uses the above function calls to create searchable objects , which can be identified as query results , and provided via an ECSF query API  to one or more custom UI , enterprise application search UI , sample or other UI .","In some instances, the underlying data can be federated to other search engine instances , ."]}}}},"The above-described process flows are provided for purposes of illustration.
