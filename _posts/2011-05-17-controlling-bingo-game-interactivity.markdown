The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent disclosure, as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent files or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever. Copyright 2011, WMS Gaming, Inc.","Embodiments of the inventive subject matter relate generally to wagering game systems and networks that, more particularly, control interactivity between bingo game applications and additional wagering game applications.","Wagering game machines, such as slot machines, video poker machines and the like, have been a cornerstone of the gaming industry for several years. Traditionally, wagering game machines have been confined to physical buildings, like casinos (e.g., resort casinos, road-side casinos, etc.). The casinos are located in specific geographic locations that are authorized to present wagering games to casino patrons. However, with the proliferation of interest and use of the Internet, shrewd wagering game manufacturers have recognized that a global public network, such as the Internet, can reach to various locations of the world that have been authorized to present wagering games. Any individual with a personal computing device (e.g., a personal computer, a laptop, a personal digital assistant, a cell phone, etc.) can connect to the Internet and play wagering games. Consequently, some wagering game manufacturers have created wagering games that can be processed by personal computing devices and offered via online casino websites (\u201conline casinos\u201d). However, online casinos face challenges and struggles. For instance, online casinos have struggled to provide the excitement and entertainment that a real-world casino environment provides. Some online casinos have struggled enforcing cross jurisdictional restrictions and requirements. Further, some online casinos have struggled adapting the online gaming industry to a traditionally non-wagering game business environment. As a result, wagering game manufacturers, casino operators, and online game providers are constantly in need of innovative concepts that can make the online gaming industry appealing and profitable.","In some embodiments, a computer-implemented method comprises providing gaming content for use during a bingo game, where the gaming content includes a representation of a bingo game card, the representation of the bingo game card includes card identifiers arranged in a distinct pattern on the representation of the bingo game card, and the card identifiers are usable during the bingo game to track game identifiers, with equivalent values, when drawn during the bingo game. In some embodiments, the computer-implemented method further comprises selecting one of the card identifiers of the representation of the bingo game card, in response to user input, where the selecting indicates a user-prediction that one of the game identifiers, equivalent in value to the one of the card identifiers, will be drawn during the bingo game. In some embodiments, the computer-implemented method further comprises associating the selecting of the one of the card identifiers with a secondary wagering game, placing a bet for the secondary wagering game on the selecting of the one of the card identifiers, detecting a draw of the one of the game identifiers during the bingo game, and using the draw of the one of the game identifiers as an outcome for the bet of the secondary wagering game. In some embodiments, the computer-implemented method further comprises determining a first period of game play for the bingo game, and limiting a second period of game play for the secondary wagering game based on the first period of game play for the bingo game. In some embodiments, the computer-implemented method comprises determining a betting restriction for the secondary wagering game based on a number of the game identifiers that have previously been drawn during the bingo game, and imposing the betting restriction on the bet before placing the bet. In some embodiments, the bingo game and the secondary wagering game operate independently from each other, and the placing the bet for the secondary wagering game has no impact on game play for the bingo game. In some embodiments, the computer-implemented method further comprises selecting, at random, a customized graphic provided via additional player input, where the additional player input is associated with a wagering game player account, presenting the customized graphic on the representation of the bingo card in association with the bingo game, and awarding the wagering game player account with a multiplier for the bet in the secondary wagering game. In some embodiments, the computer-implemented method comprises providing an interface for the secondary, wagering game, and detecting an additional user input, via the interface, where the additional input indicates a bet value for the bet. In some embodiments, the computer-implemented method comprises randomly selecting the one of the game identifiers for the bingo game, and providing an indication one of the game identifiers to the secondary, wagering game via an application programming interface. In some embodiments, the computer-implemented method comprises presenting an additional wagering game in response to the draw of the one of the game identifiers, determining that, the draw of the one of the game identifiers results in a winning outcome for the additional wagering game, and providing a reward for the winning outcome for the additional wagering game.","In some embodiments, one or more machine-readable storage media, having instructions stored thereon, which when executed by a set of one or more processors cause the set of one or more processors to perform operations that comprise presenting a wagering game on a graphical display, where the wagering game includes wagering game elements with images that change configurations during each play of the wagering game during a wagering game session. The operations can further include detecting an appearance of one configuration of the images during one play of the wagering game, determining that the appearance of the one configuration of the images is associated with one of a plurality of game identifiers for a bingo game, where the plurality of game identifiers are drawn during the bingo game. The operations can further include presenting a graphic of a bingo game card, where the graphic of the bingo game card includes a plurality of card identifiers, and where plurality of card identifiers are as subset of the plurality of game identifiers. The operations can further include determining that one of the plurality of card identifiers is equivalent in value to the one of the plurality of game identifiers.

The wagering game module is configured to, via the one or more processors, detect, via a first user input, a purchase of bingo game cards for a bingo game during a wagering game session, where each of the bingo game cards includes card identifiers arranged on each of the bingo game cards in unique patterns that distinguish each of the bingo game cards. The wagering game module can further be configured to detect a selection, via a second user input, of a first of the card identifiers that appear on a first of the bingo game cards, and swap the first of the card identifiers with a second of the card identifiers from a second of the bingo game cards in response to the selection of the first of the card identifiers that appear on the first of bingo game cards. In some embodiments, the wagering game module can further be configured to require a payment of a fee from a player account, detect a payment of the fee from the player account, via a third user input, before swapping the first of the card identifiers with the second of the card identifiers, and swap the first of the card identifiers with the second of the card identifiers after the payment of the fee. In some embodiments, the wagering game module can further be configured to present an additional wagering game during a wagering game session contemporaneously with the bingo game, detect an occurrence of an outcome for the additional wagering game, and swap the first of the card identifiers with the second of the card identifiers based on the occurrence of the outcome for the additional wagering game. In some embodiments, the wagering game module can further be configured to detect that a game identifier, equivalent in value to the second of the card identifiers, has been drawn during the bingo game, and provide an award for the second of the card identifiers appearing on the first of the bingo game cards.","In some embodiments, an apparatus comprises means for presenting a bingo game card during a bingo game, wherein the bingo game card comprises card identifiers that are a subset of game identifiers that can potentially be drawn during the bingo game, and wherein the card identifiers are usable during the bingo game to track one or more of the game identifiers when drawn. The apparatus can further comprise means for selecting, in response to player input, a portion of the card identifiers of the bingo game card, where the means for selecting indicates a user-prediction that a portion of the game identifiers with equivalent values to the portion of the card identifiers will be drawn during the bingo game. The apparatus can further comprise means for associating the portion of the card identifiers with a secondary wagering game, where the bingo game and the secondary wagering game operate independently from each other. The apparatus can further comprise means for determining a betting restriction for the secondary game based, at least in part, on a total number game identifiers that have been drawn for the bingo game. The apparatus can further comprise means for placing a bet for the secondary wagering game, according to the betting restriction, based on the selecting of the portion of the card identifiers. The apparatus can further comprise means for detecting a draw of the portion of the game identifiers during the bingo game session.

The second section describes example operating environments while the third section describes example operations performed by some embodiments. The fourth section describes additional example embodiments while the fifth section describes additional example operating environments. The sixth section presents some general comments.","This section provides an introduction to some embodiments.","Wagering games are expanding in popularity. Many wagering game enthusiasts are demanding greater access to wagering games and content related to wagering games. As stated previously, some wagering game companies have created online wagering game websites that provide a way for wagering game enthusiasts to play wagering games while connected to the Internet (e.g., via a web-browser). Some online wagering game websites provide various features, such as social networks and social networking functionality. Social networks allow wagering game players (\u201cplayers\u201d) to create social network user accounts with one or more unique identifiers that represent an online persona. One example of a unique identifier is an \u201cavatar.\u201d Avatars are graphical, cartoon-like depictions of a social network persona. These online personas and associated avatars add to the fin of belonging to an online gaming community. Many wagering game providers, however, continue to search for new and innovative ways to make their content appeal to a broader audience, such as gaming audiences that enjoy different types of wagering games, including bingo.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","137","150","122","100","170","122","170","104","104","101","137","101","103","150","150","140","104","103","104","150","140","100","108"]},"In some embodiments, the system  can present a secondary wagering game, separate from the bingo game, but that uses elements of the bingo game, for example, to determine outcomes for the secondary wagering game. For instance, the system  provides controls, or other means, for a player to select one or more desired game spaces (e.g., game space ) on the bingo card . In this description, selected game spaces, such as game space , may be referred to as a \u201cplayer-specified\u201d game spaces because the game space(s) are specified by a player using a selection device (e.g., a mouse cursor ). In some embodiments, a player can select multiple game spaces in a configuration that the player desires. , described in more detail further below, shows an example where a player selects an entire column of game spaces (e.g., column ) indicated by check boxes (e.g. checkbox ). In this description, configurations of selected game spaces, may be referred to as \u201cplayer-specified\u201d configurations because a player specifies (e.g. selects, indicates, etc.), the locations of game spaces on a bingo card. In some embodiments, a player-specified configuration can be a pattern, a random grouping of spots or numbers, or whatever the player wants to specify.","At stage \u201cA\u201d in , a player selects the game space  using the mouse cursor . At stage \u201cB,\u201d after the player selects the game space , the player indicates a bet amount for a secondary bet, using a bet value control , then selects a bet placement control  to enter the bet. The player places the bet amount for a prediction that an identifier  (i.e., \u201cG43\u201d) associated with the game space  will be drawn during the bingo game. If the identifier  is drawn, then the player wins the bet amount or some money value related to the bet amount. The secondary wagering game can use the secondary bet for the secondary game only, such as a side bet related to the secondary game so that when the player-specified configuration hits and wins an award in the secondary game, the player wins the bet amount for the secondary wagering game only, and the underlying bingo game continues unaffected. The bet, therefore, is not a bet for the bingo game. The bet, instead, is for the secondary wagering game that occurs concurrently with the bingo game, and uses the elements of the bingo game, but is performed separate and independent from the bingo game. In other words, the secondary wagering game uses the game elements of the bingo card  to determine results for the secondary wagering game. However, the secondary wagering game uses separate rules from the bingo game. For instance, a bingo game may include a first set of rules that require a player to fill in an entire row or column of a bingo card to win the bingo game. However, the secondary wagering game can include rules that determine whether player-specified spaces are drawn during the course of the bingo game, but the rules of the secondary game do not interact with, or affect, the course of the bingo game.","The secondary wagering game can also impose a restriction, such as a time limit, a restriction on a number of draws, etc., on the secondary wagering game that is related to a restriction for the bingo game. For example, the system can require that the player-specified configuration be completed before the bingo game completes. In one embodiment, the system  provides a limit control , which limits the period in which the secondary bet for the secondary wagering game is active. For example, the limit control  can indicate a number of subsequent calls, or draws, for the bingo game during which the bet is active (e.g., a player indicates the number \u201c4\u201d in the limit control  to indicate that the player predicts that the identifier  (i.e., \u201cG43\u201d) will be called within the next four calling turns, or draws, of the bingo game (i.e., within the next four draws of bingo game pieces). In one embodiment, at stage \u201cC,\u201d the wagering game server  calls the identifier  within the number of turns, or draws, of the bingo game indicated in the limit control  after the player has placed the secondary bet. At stage \u201cD,\u201d the wagering game server  then pays the secondary bet to the player account .","The system can also propose minimum betting limits (e.g., impose a minimum bet amount, impose a minimum bet increment amount, etc.) for the player's secondary bet. The minimum betting limits can depend on a complexity or difficulty in fulfilling a player-specified configuration based on a history of the bingo game play, a number of card spaces completed on the bingo card , a time limit, a number of play turns indicated by a player's prediction, etc. The system can pay out more for player selections of configurations that are complex or difficult, and as a result may require a higher minimum betting increment. For example, the system  can determine a complexity or difficulty of a specific configuration indicated on the bingo card  based on the number, indicated in the limit control , of subsequent bingo turns, or draws. A higher number on the limit control  would provide greater odds that the identifier  would be drawn. A lower number on the limit control  would provide lower odds that the identifier  would be drawn. As a result, the system  can modify a minimum bet increment amount that is tied to the number of the limit control , such as requiring lower minimum bet increment amounts for lower numbers and higher minimum bet increment amounts for higher numbers. The system  can indicate the minimum bet increment amount in a minimum bet indicator . The system  can also automatically restrict the bet control  from presenting less than the minimum bet increment amount. In other example, the system  can modify a payout amount for the game depending on the aforementioned complexity or difficulty in fulfilling a player-specified configuration based on the history of the bingo game play, the number of card spaces completed on the bingo card , the time limit, the number of play turns indicated by a player's prediction, etc.","Further, some embodiments of the inventive subject matter describe examples of controlling interactivity between bingo game applications and additional wagering game applications in a network wagering venue (e.g., an online casino, a wagering game website, a wagering network, etc.) using a communication network, such as the communications network  in . Embodiments can be presented over any type of communications network that provides access to wagering games, such as a public network (e.g., a public wide-area-network, such as the Internet), a private network (e.g., a private local-area-network gaming network), a file sharing network, a social network, etc., or any combination of networks. Multiple users can be connected to the networks via computing devices. The multiple users can have accounts that subscribe to specific services, such as account-based wagering systems (e.g., account-based wagering game websites, account-based casino networks, etc.).","Further, in some embodiments herein a user may be referred to as a player (i.e., of wagering games), and a player may be referred to interchangeably as a player account. Account-based wagering systems utilize player accounts when transacting and performing activities, at the computer level, that are initiated by players. Therefore, a \u201cplayer account\u201d represents the player at a computerized level. The player account can perform actions via computerized instructions. For example, in some embodiments, a player account may be referred to as performing an action, controlling an item, communicating information, etc. Although a player, or person, may be activating a game control or device to perform the action, control the item, communicate the information, etc., the player account, at the computer level, can be associated with the player, and therefore any actions associated with the player can also be associated with the player account. Therefore, for brevity, to avoid having to describe the interconnection between player and player account in every instance, a \u201cplayer account\u201d may be referred to herein in either context. Further, in some embodiments herein, the word \u201cgaming\u201d is used interchangeably with \u201cgambling.\u201d","Although  describes some embodiments, the following sections describe many other features and embodiments.","This section describes example operating environments and networks and presents structural aspects of some embodiments. More specifically, this section includes discussion about wagering game system architectures.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","270","270","270","270","270"]},"The wagering game system architecture  can also include a wagering game server  configured to control wagering game content, provide random numbers, and communicate wagering game information, account information, and other information to and from a client . The wagering game server  can include a content controller  configured to manage and control content for the presentation of content on the client . For example, the content controller  can generate game results (e.g., win\/loss values), including win amounts, for games played on the client . The content controller  can communicate the game results to the client . The content controller  can also generate random numbers and provide them to the client  so that the client  can generate game results. In some embodiments, the content controller  can further control interactivity between bingo game applications and additional wagering game applications. For example, the content controller  can control effects of gaming conditions (e.g., events, properties, states, etc.) between wagering applications, such via an application programming interface (API) for bingo game applications and\/or for additional wagering game applications. For example, the content controller  can detect a first condition in a bingo game and cause a separate second condition to occur in an additional wagering game in response to the first event, or vice versa. The wagering game server  can also include a content store  configured to contain content to present on the client . The wagering game server  can also include an account manager  configured to control information related to player accounts. For example, the account manager  can communicate wager amounts, game results amounts (e.g., win amounts), bonus game amounts, etc., to the account server . The wagering game server  can also include a communication unit  configured to communicate information to the client  and to communicate with other systems, devices and networks.","The wagering game system architecture  can also include the client  configured to present wagering games, and receive and transmit information to control interactivity between bingo games and additional wagering games. The client  can be a computer system, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a cell phone, a laptop, a wagering game machine, or any other device or machine that is capable of processing information, instructions, or other data provided via the communications network . The client  can include a content controller  configured to manage and control content and presentation of content on the client . The client  can also include a content store  configured to contain content to present on the client . The client  can also include a wagering game module  configured to process communications, commands, or other information, where the processing can control interactivity between bingo games and additional wagering games. The wagering game module  can perform any function that any other system component can perform regarding controlling bingo game and additional wagering game interactivity and\/or processing data and control information provided by any of the other system components.","The wagering game system architecture  can also include a web server  configured to control and present an online website that hosts wagering games and other wagering activity.","The wagering game system architecture  can also include a secondary content server  configured to provide content and control information for secondary games and other secondary content available on a wagering game network secondary wagering game content, promotions content, advertising content, player tracking content, web content, etc.). The secondary content server  can provide \u201csecondary\u201d content, or content for \u201csecondary\u201d games presented on the client . \u201cSecondary\u201d in some embodiments can refer to an application's importance or priority of the data. In some embodiments, \u201csecondary\u201d can refer to a distinction, or separation, from a primary application (e.g., separate application files, separate content, separate states, separate functions, separate processes, separate programming sources, separate processor threads, separate data, separate control, separate domains, etc.). Nevertheless, in some embodiments, secondary content and control can be passed between applications (e.g., via application programming interfaces), thus becoming, or falling under the control of, primary content or primary applications, and vice versa.","The wagering game system architecture  can also include a marketing server  configured to utilize player data to determine marketing promotions that may be of interest to a player account. The marketing server  can also analyze player data and generate analytics for players, group players into demographics, integrate with third party marketing services and devices, etc. The marketing server  can also provide player data to third parties that can use the player data for marketing. In some embodiments, the marketing server  can analyze player data to award a random bonus depending on how much a player has lost. The award can be a monetary award, an advertising coupon, free bingo cards, etc.","Each component shown in the wagering game system architecture  is shown as a separate and distinct element connected via the communications network . However, some functions performed by one component could be performed by other components. For example, the wagering game server  can also be configured to perform functions of the wagering game module  and other network elements and\/or system devices. Furthermore, the components shown may all be contained in one device, but some, or all, may be included in, or performed by, multiple devices, as in the configurations shown in  or other configurations not shown. For example, the account manager  and the communication unit  can be included in the client  instead of, or in addition to, being a part of the wagering game server . Further, in some embodiments, the client  can determine wagering game outcomes, generate random numbers, etc. instead of, or in addition to, the wagering game server .","As mentioned previously, in some embodiments, the client  can take the form of a wagering game machine. Examples of wagering game machines can include floor standing models, handheld mobile units, bar-top models, workstation-type console models, surface computing machines, etc. Further, wagering game machines can be primarily dedicated for use in conducting wagering games, or can include non-dedicated devices, such as mobile phones, personal digital assistants, personal computers, etc.","In some embodiments, clients and wagering game servers work together such that clients can be operated as thin, thick, or intermediate clients. For example, one or more elements of game play may be controlled by the client or the wagering game servers (server). Game play elements can include executable game code, lookup tables, configuration files, game outcome, audio or visual representations of the game, game assets, or the like. In a thin-client example, the wagering game server can perform functions such as determining game outcome or managing assets, while the clients can present a graphical representation of such outcome or asset modification to the user (e.g., player). In a thick-client example, the clients can determine game outcomes and communicate the outcomes to the wagering game server for recording or managing a player's account.","In some embodiments, either the client or the wagering game server(s) can provide functionality that is not directly related to game play. For example, account transactions and account rules may be managed centrally (e.g., by the wagering game server(s)) or locally (e.g., by the client). Other functionality not directly related to game play may include power management, presentation of advertising, software or firmware updates, system quality or security checks, etc.","Furthermore, the wagering game system architecture  can be implemented as software, hardware, any combination thereof, or other forms of embodiments not listed. For example, any of the network components (e.g., the wagering game machines, servers, etc.) can include hardware and machine-readable storage media including instructions for performing the operations described herein.","This section describes operations associated with some embodiments. In the discussion below, some flow diagrams are described with reference to block diagrams presented herein. However, in some embodiments, the operations can be performed by logic not described in the block diagrams.","In certain embodiments, the operations can be performed by executing instructions residing on machine-readable storage media (e.g., software), while in other embodiments, the operations can be performed by hardware and\/or other logic (e.g., firmware). In some embodiments, the operations can be performed in series, while in other embodiments, one or more of the operations can be performed in parallel.

In some embodiments, the system can present secondary games associated with bingo games. Activities or outcomes for the secondary games can depend on bingo game events. Examples of bingo game events can include a bingo game outcome, a unique outcome value from the bingo game, an occurrence of a specific bingo game space identifier, a completion of a row or column in a bingo game, etc.","The flow  continues at processing block , where the system places a bet on the secondary wagering game for a prediction that the first event will occur during game play of the bingo game.","The flow  continues at processing block , where the system detects that the first event occurs during the game play of the bingo game and provides a reward to the player account for the bet in the secondary wagering game.  above illustrated one example of a wagering game system that can transact bets made on predicted game activities, or occurrences of specific outcomes, in a bingo game, but that transacts the bets as part of a secondary wagering game separate from the bingo game. For instance, as described previously in , the system  presented the bingo card  during a bingo game session, and selected, in response to player input, one of the identifiers identifier ) or a game space  associated with the identifier, of the bingo game card. The system  associated the selection by the player with a secondary wagering game and placed a bet for the secondary wagering game on the selecting of the identifier . The system  can detect a call, or draw, of the identifier  during the bingo game session, and can use the draw of the identifier  as an outcome for the bet of the secondary wagering game. The system  can further provide an award for the secondary wagering game in response to the placing the bet.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 4","FIG. 1"],"b":["400","437","437","402","400","402","404","404","440","404","440","400","437","442","440","400","442","406","442","442","400","406","400","442","411","100","400","413","440","435","442","413"]},"In some embodiments, the system  can detect an event from a bingo game and, randomly select player-customized images (e.g., customized patterns, textures, graphics, etc.). For instance, in , a player can choose a unique symbol before the bingo game begins. Other players can also choose symbols that are unique to the other players. During the bingo game, the system  can randomly select one or more of the symbols (e.g., player-customized image ) for one or more of the players to mark the bingo card  for some of the game identifiers that are called, or drawn, during the bingo game. When the system  randomly selects the player-customized image , the system  can cause events to occur within the bingo game or in secondary wagering games. For example, the system  can increase a player's chances to win in the bingo game. In another example, the system  can increase a win amount in a secondary wagering game.","In some embodiments, the system  can use an occurrence of a randomly selected player-customized image to affect sweepstakes types of games. For example, the system  can cause an entry into a sweepstakes, add additional playing elements, or entries, for a player into a sweepstakes, cause a multiplier effect on existing entries in a sweepstakes, etc. A specific type of sweepstakes game is a \u201cball drop\u201d game, which utilizes unique looking balls that a player has customized as entries into a sweepstakes. A player customizes the look of a ball with an avatar, a personal graphic, a specific set of colors, etc., and the system  present a player-customized image associated with a customized ball during the bingo game. For instance, the system  presents the player-customized image  in the bingo game as a marker for the bingo card . The player-customized image  may be associated with a customized ball by the player for a ball drop game. When the player-customized image  appears in the bingo game, the system  adds a corresponding ball into a ball bag for the ball drop game. The system  can then trigger a beginning to the ball drop game. The ball drop game can then draw player's customized balls from the ball bag. Depending on when a player's ball is drawn during the ball drop game, the system  can provide higher or lower awards. For example, the ball drop game can provide greater rewards as fewer balls remain in the ball bag, where the highest award goes to the last ball selected from the ball bag. In some embodiments, the system  may repeat presentation of the player-customized image  during the bingo game. For each repetition of the player-customized image , the system  can add an additional instance of the corresponding ball to the ball drop game. Thus, in some embodiments, as the player-customized image  is repeatedly presented, more balls are added for the player to the ball drop game, and the player's chances increase more in the ball drop game of having a ball that is selected last. In other embodiments, however, when the player-customized image  is presented more than once, instead of adding another ball into the ball drop bag, the system  can add a multiplier effect to the corresponding customized ball that is already in the ball bag. Thus, if the player's ball wins during the ball drop game, the system  would apply the multiplier to any award.","The flow  continues at processing block , where the system presents an additional wagering game. The additional game can be a secondary wagering game independent from the bingo game, but associated with the bingo game's activity.","The flow  continues at processing block , where the system causes a third event to occur in the additional wagering game based on the occurrence of the first event.","The flow  continues at processing block , where the system determines that the third event results in a winning outcome for the additional wagering game and provides a reward to the player account for the winning outcome for the additional wagering game. For example, in some embodiments, the system can provide a community bingo card with a single winning combination. The system can present the community bingo card as a secondary game in connection with the bingo game. In some embodiments, however, community bingo card can be presented by other wagering games (e.g., slot games) instead of or in addition to, being presented by the bingo game. The system displays the community bingo game to every player (i.e., on every player's computer the system presents one bingo card). For example, in , the system  presents the community bingo card . A player can use the system  to place a secondary wager for the community bingo card  at any time during the bingo game. Similarly as described above, player's can place additional side-bets on predictions of game identifiers for the community bingo game card . The amount of the additional side-bets can depend on how close the community bingo card  is to completing and triggering the community bonus. As the community bingo card  continues to complete, the system  increases a minimum bet limit level. In some embodiments, the system  can use events that occur to game elements of the bingo game associated with the bingo card  or to the secondary game associated with the bingo game. For example, the system  can determine whether the bingo game draws a certain game identifier that appears on the bingo card , then, in response, launches the community bingo card . In another example, the system  can determine whether the player makes and\/or wins a secondary bet, then, in response, launches the community bingo card .","In some embodiments, the system  can present another wagering game, such as reels that spin based on an event in the bingo game. For example, the system  can present reel(s)  to appear on the display . The system  can cause the reel(s)  to spin based on an event in the bingo game. The system  can also provide awards for configurations of reel elements that occur when the reel(s)  spin. In some embodiments, the configurations (e.g., outcomes) of the reel elements can affect the bingo game, such as by providing multipliers for the bingo game. Other embodiments may use playing cards, a roulette wheel, dice, or other types of wagering game elements, instead of, or in addition, to reels to present outcomes based on an event in the bingo game.","In some embodiments, the system  can select random \u201chot spots\u201d associated with game spaces on the bingo card . When the system  draws a game identifier for one of the hot spots, the system  can subsequently spin the reel(s) . For instance, the system  draws the identifier \u201cO27\u201d on the bingo card , which corresponds to the game space  on the bingo card . The identifier \u201cO27\u201d is a hot spot selected randomly by the system . Thus, the system  can cause the reel(s)  to spin based on the drawing of the \u201cO27\u201d identifier and the appearance on the game space  on the bingo game card . In other embodiments, instead of hot spots, the system  can present \u201ccold spots\u201d or poopers in the bingo game (e.g., when a cold spot is selected, the system  can replace an already drawn and marked bingo card identifier with an undrawn, or unmarked bingo card identifier, when a cold spot is selected, the system  can reduce award values in the reel game, etc.). In some embodiments, the system  has complete control over the reel(s) , or in other words, the system  does not provide any control to the player to spin the reel(s) . The system  can cause the reel(s)  to spin entirely dependent on the hot spots of the bingo game. The reel(s)  can have an associated pay table and the system  can generate payouts based on the pay table. The reel(s)  can also have a bonus symbol that triggers several different bonus opportunities, such as a picking game, a free spin game, entries into a community game free future bingo cards, etc. The bonus game could also award a multiplier that would be applied to the bingo card  that triggered the spin. If the bingo card  happens to be a winning card for the bingo game, the amount that the card pays out can be multiplier for awards provided from outcomes for the reel(s) . In some embodiments, the game with the reel(s)  runs on its own random generated numbers, which are separate from random generated numbers for the bingo game. In some embodiments, a player can have some input or other control on the reel(s) . For example, the player can choose a specific wagering game theme or denomination to use for the reel(s) . The system  can make a player's degree of control on the reel(s) , or elements associated with the reel(s) , dependent on a number of loyalty points or a degree of status that the player has. In some embodiments, the system  can pay for awards for reel outcomes using a portion of wagers made for the bingo game. In some embodiments, the system  can also accept secondary wagers on the outcomes of the reel(s) . The secondary wagers are separate from wagers made for the bingo game, and therefore can be any value higher or lower than minimum or maximum bet amounts for the bingo game.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 6","FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 6","FIG. 5"],"b":["500","500","502"]},"The flow  continues at processing block , where the system presents a wagering game and detects a first event that occurs in the wagering game. The wagering game can be a primary wagering game or \u201cbase\u201d game. Examples of primary games include slot games, electronic poker games, etc. where a player can place wagers on each play or turn in the game (e.g. place a bet on each reel spin, place a bet on each turn of a card, place a bet on each spin of a roulette wheel, place a bet on each round of poker play, etc.).","The flow  continues at processing block , where the system presents a bingo game in response to the first events and causes a second event to occur in the bingo game based on the first event in the wagering game.","The flow  continues at processing block , where the system detects that a winning outcome occurs in the bingo game because of the second event, and provides a reward to the player account for the winning outcome that occurs in the bingo game.","For instance, in , a wagering game system (\u201csystem\u201d)  includes a wagering game machine .

The poker game includes community cards , , ,  and  (i.e., cards -) as well as player cards , . The combination of community cards - and the player cards ,  provide a game outcome for the player. One of the outcomes can include a specific poker hand, such as a royal flush (i.e., the combination of community cards , ,  and player cards ,  which together present at least five cards with the same suit having the card values from 10 through Ace). The system  can present a secondary game, such as a bonus bingo game represented by the bingo card . The system  can then cause an event to occur in the bonus bingo game. In some embodiments, the system  can prompt the player to select wild spaces on the bingo card  because of the event that occurred in the primary wagering game  (e.g., the system  can prompt the player to select three wild spaces on the bingo card ).","The system  can also cause specific events to occur in the bingo game when certain game cards elements appear in the primary wagering game  or when bingo game elements appear in the primary wagering game . For example, when the community card  (i.e., King of Hearts) appears in the primary wagering game , either by design or by random selection, the system  can present an identifier  and a graphic  on the community card . If the identifier  is on the bingo card , for instance at bingo card space , the system  can place a marker  on the bingo card space , or in some other way indicate that the bingo card space  is wild in response to the graphic  appearing along with the identifier  on the community card .","In some embodiments, the system  can detect the appearance of a unique graphic (e.g., player-customized graphic ).
