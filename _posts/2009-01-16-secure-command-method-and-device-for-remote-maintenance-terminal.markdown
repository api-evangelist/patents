{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["The present invention relates to maintenance operations and functional tests performed in aircraft, and more particularly to a secure command method and device for a remote maintenance terminal, so that functional tests on the assembly line or during operation of an aircraft can be carried out from a remote station.","To optimize the reliability of aircraft and increase their profitability, on-line maintenance operations are frequently performed between the flying phases.","In general, such operations, for maintenance operators, for example, consist in analyzing data stored in memory during flight, in modifying certain parameters of the aircraft or certain software data and\/or in launching test software applications. The analyzed data are often obtained from transducers and stored in memory in a central diagnostic and storage device accessible via a man-machine interface of MCDU type (initials for Multi-Control Display Unit in English terminology) or of OMT type (initials for Onboard Maintenance Terminal in English terminology). This interface, via which interactive operations can be launched, makes it possible to analyze data stored in memory, to access parameters of the aircraft and more generally to execute test and maintenance functions. By way of illustration, the Airbus A320, A330 and A340 are equipped with MCDUs and the Airbus A380 is equipped with an OMT (Airbus A320, A330, A340 and A380 are trademarks).","Access to aircraft maintenance systems is generally limited to fixed physical stations provided on board in the cockpit. Thus, when the aircraft is on the ground, a maintenance operator can board the aircraft to access and analyze the data stored in memory, to modify the parameters thereof if necessary and to launch test applications.","In order to optimize task sequencing, the current devices generally require the ongoing presence of an operator, in order to verify that the operations have taken place properly.","Similarly, during aircraft assembly, the teams of the final assembly sequences rely on interactive maintenance tools to perform all or part of the functional tests of the airplane.","However, despite the performances of the maintenance stations, means for automating certain tests do not exist.","In fact, although certain maintenance stations provided on board aircraft can be connected to a communication network for exchange of data between the aircraft and remote equipment, the network connection does not permit remote control of the applications implemented on board the aircraft or transmission of applications, for security reasons.","The invention is able to solve at least one of the problems mentioned in the foregoing.","The object of the invention is therefore a method for executing at least one instruction in an on-board maintenance device from a remote system connected to the said maintenance device via a communication network, this method comprising the following steps:","receiving at least one datum representative of at least one command associated with the said at least one instruction;","filtering the said at least one received datum; and,","if the said filtered command is valid, identifying the said at least one instruction.","Thus a vehicle such as an aircraft adapted to employ the method according to the invention has at its disposal means for accessing the interactive maintenance tools remotely, without reducing its level of security. In addition, such a method offers optimized service to the operators of final assembly sequences for the conduct of functional tests, by providing the possibility of developing means for automating tests.","In addition, since the operators are able to connect a mobile terminal and to use all or some of the automatic test routines, the method according to the invention offers the possibility of performing non-regression functional tests on the production flow up to delivery.","Advantageously, the method additionally comprises a step of verifying a signature of the said at least one received datum permitting authentication thereof.","According to a particular embodiment, the method additionally comprises a preliminary step of storing in memory the said correspondence between the said at least one datum and the said at least one instruction.","Advantageously, the said filtering step is an iterative filtering step based on at least two distinct criteria for optimizing the processing times.","According to a particular embodiment, at least one of the said at least two criteria is associated with the protocol for transmission of the said at least one datum. Similarly, according to a particular embodiment, at least one of the said at least two criteria is related to the encoding of the said at least one datum representative of the said at least one command.","Advantageously, the method additionally comprises a step of transmitting at least one information item related to execution of the said at least one instruction, making it possible to transmit a result in response to a command. Preferably, to permit authentication of the said at least one information item, the method additionally comprises a step of signing the said at least one information item.","Another object of the invention is a device comprising means adapted to employment of each of the steps of the method described in the foregoing as well as an aircraft comprising such a device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","105","110","110","1","115"]},"Device , for example, is connected to control transducers (not illustrated) of the engines and actuators of the landing gear and control surfaces.","An on-line remote maintenance station , located in a maintenance center , for example, is connected to device  by a communication network  and port -.","Thus, when aircraft  is on the ground, during assembly or operation thereof, a maintenance operator is able, by means of remote station , to analyze the data of the aircraft, to modify the parameters thereof and\/or to monitor the execution of maintenance application modules implemented in aircraft .","In addition to its standard functions, device  comprises means for employing the invention that are advantageously based on a software architecture comprising substantially the three following modules, which may be implemented within a single software application or in the form of independent modules,","a communication module;","a filtering module; and","a conversion or translation module.","Alternatively, these three modules or some of them may be implemented in one or more other devices.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIGS. 2"],"i":["a ","b, "],"b":"2"},"According to the first example illustrated in the software architecture adapted for employment of the invention is implemented in the maintenance device. As illustrated, maintenance device  in this case comprises maintenance application modules . Although all of these modules are represented here in the form of a single element, it must be understood that in general they are separate modules. The maintenance application modules are connected to the network in order to receive and\/or transmit data.","Maintenance device  additionally comprises a communication module , a filtering module  and a conversion module . Communication module  is preferably a secure communication module.","Communication module  is connected to the network via a standard link such as an Ethernet link, for receiving and\/or transmitting data. Such a link may be hard-wired or wireless. Communication module  is also connected to filtering module , which in turn is connected to conversion module .","According to the second example illustrated in the software architecture adapted for employment of the invention is implemented in a device separate from the maintenance device. As illustrated, maintenance application modules  are implemented in a maintenance device , separate from device \u2032 comprising communication module \u2032, filtering module \u2032 and conversion module \u2032.","The purpose of communication module  or \u2032 is to receive the data transmitted via the network to which it is connected and to transmit data over this same network.","Advantageously, the exchanged data are signed. It is recalled here that the signature makes it possible to authenticate the source of a datum as well as the integrity of data.","Alternatively, only the received data, the transmitted data or certain types of data are signed.","In complementary manner, it is possible to encipher the data in order that they are comprehensible only to the recipient.","According to a particular embodiment, the communication module and the remote station each comprise keys for adding a signature to the transmitted data and for verifying such a signature. In this way it is possible to authenticate the data source and to verify that the exchanged data are correct and reliable.","The signature mechanisms employed are preferably standard algorithms based on hash functions such as the MD5 or SHA-1 algorithms.","The purpose of filtering module  or \u2032 is to filter the data received from the network in order to transmit only the correctly formatted data to the conversion module, meaning that only the information items comprehensible to the conversion module are transmitted thereto.","The filtering module is preferably based on the screen principle, or in other words on an interactive mechanism, according to which a plurality of filter levels is used to optimize the processing time. It is therefore composed of a plurality of elements for progressively finer filtration of the received data, in order to pass only the data corresponding to valid commands generated by remote stations.","The filtering module requires that a command format be defined, so that only a certain type of network frames is processed. The format and the associated transport protocol may be defined in the form of parameters accessible to the filtering module. For example, such parameters may specify that the commands are received in the form of Ethernet frames, indicate the sources authorized to transmit such commands, impose a maximum frame lifetime beyond which the frames are no longer considered and indicate the characters that can be validly used to encode a command in a frame.","By way of illustration, the filtering of Ethernet frames may be effected in three steps.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":"300"},"Firstly, each frame is analyzed by verifying, for example, the physical source and destination addresses  and  respectively, especially the MAC addresses (acronym for Media Access Control in English terminology), the protocol type  and the signature  of the complete frame. The data  of the frame are not analyzed in this first step.","If the physical source and destination addresses  and  respectively, the protocol type  and the signature  are not in conformity with the parameters of the filtering module, the frame is rejected.","In contrast, if the physical source and destination addresses  and  respectively, the protocol type  and the signature  are in conformity with the parameters of the filtering module, a second filtering step is performed.","It should be noted here that the first filtering step may be applied to data other than those cited, or else to fewer data.","The second step consists, for example, in analyzing the data header . In particular, this second filtering step may consist in verifying the IP version (initials for Internet Protocol in English terminology) , the header length , the service type , the total data length , the identification  used to reconstitute the fragments, the lifetime , also known as TTL (initials for Time To Live in English terminology), the protocol  and the source and destination addresses  and  respectively.","Once again, if not all of these information items are in conformity with the parameters of the filtering module, the frame is rejected. In contrast, if all of these information items are in conformity with the parameters of the filtering module, a third filtering step is performed.","It should be noted here also that the second filtering step may be applied to data other than those cited, or else to fewer data.","The third step consists in this case of analyzing the characters of the useful data  of the frame. This step therefore makes it possible to verify that the characters necessary for construction of the command cannot be used to construct the executable code. Advantageously, all the characters of the useful data must be chosen from the ASCII table, within the values between 032 and 090, as illustrated in .","If a character of the useful data  does not belong to the values between 032 and 090 of the ASCII table, the frame is rejected. On the other hand, if all of the characters of the useful data  belong to the values between 032 and 090 of the ASCII table, the frame is transmitted to conversion module  or \u2032.","Naturally the third filtering step may be applied to other criteria, especially to more restrictive criteria.","The purpose of conversion module  or \u2032 is to establish an interface between the application modules  of the maintenance device and the network.","This module is preferably developed in such a way that only the commands linked to instructions corresponding to types of applications hosted on the maintenance software platform of the aircraft will have any action. This means that this module knows the instructions that may be executed by each application. In other words, a list of instructions or instruction sequence is preferably stored in memory beforehand. Such a list defines a set of configurations of possible strings of instructions. This list may also define the prohibited combinations.","This configuration is constructed in such a way that the string of instructions of an application is known a priori. This permits the conversion module to verify that the commands that it receives and the string of associated instructions is in conformity with what the application is supposed to execute. This verification permits the conversion module to reject any unexpected string and thus ensures that dangerous operations cannot be executed.","In a particular embodiment, the conversion module uses a table of correspondence between the command names and the effective functions, or in other words instruction sequences, in order to associate one or more instructions with the names of commands received from the remote station. It should be noted here that the instructions may assume a plurality of forms. They may be, for example, pointers directed at functions or else commands interfaced with the operating system of the maintenance device. The instructions make it possible in particular to simulate an action entered by a user via the interface of the maintenance device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0069"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","220","220"]},"Correspondence table  in this case comprises two columns: one column  containing the command names and one column  containing the list of instructions associated with each command.","Row  illustrates an example of a command to test a flight management device, known as FMU (initials for Flight Management Unit in English terminology). The name of the command that can be used by a maintenance operator from a remote station in this case is TEST: FMU. As illustrated, this command corresponds to execution of the instruction sequence comprising the instructions Set_Param(a, b, c), AutoTest_FMU and AutoTest_FMU.","After a command has been analyzed and declared to be in conformity, the conversion module transmits the corresponding instructions to the application in question. The application executes the instructions and in general returns a response. This response is received by the conversion module, which constructs a response message, preferably signed.","By way of illustration, and returning to the example illustrated in , the mode of operation for execution of instructions corresponding to the TEST: FMU command is the following,","the operator enters the command TEST: FMU at the remote station;","the TEST: FMU command is signed then transmitted to the aircraft via a communication network;","the signature of the command received by the aircraft is verified;","the command is filtered;","the sequence of instructions corresponding to the filtered command is identified, being in this case the instructions Set_Param(a, b, c), AutoTest_FMU and AutoTest_FMU;","these instructions are transmitted by a software layer of API type (initials for Application Programming Interface in English terminology) to the intended applications (as if the command had been generated by keystrokes at a fixed station);","the applications in question execute the instructions according to the command and transmit the results to the conversion module via the software layer of API type; and","the conversion module forms a response message, for example by constructing a screen page or part of a screen page comprising the results, signs the response message to attest as to the origin and integrity of the information furnished and transmits the response message to the remote station via the communication network.","It is also possible, in the case of automatic tests, to use a software application implemented in the remote station to generate a string of commands in order to create a complete test scenario.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0084","num":"0083"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},"After data that may correspond to one or more names of commands have been received (step ), the signature of the received data is verified (step ) according to a standard algorithm. The validity of the data is then tested (step ). If the data are valid, a filtering step is performed (step ) and a new validity test is performed (step ). If the data are valid, the instructions corresponding to the data are identified (step ).","The identified instructions are then executed by the associated applications (step ) and the result of execution of these instructions is formulated and signed (step ) before being transmitted to the remote station (step ).","If the data are not valid, an error message is preferably transmitted to the remote station (step ).","A device adapted for employment of the invention or part of the invention is illustrated in .
