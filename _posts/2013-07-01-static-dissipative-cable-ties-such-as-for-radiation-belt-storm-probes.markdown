No. 12\/777,312, filed May 11, 2010, which claims priority to and the benefit of prior-filed U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/314,424, filed Mar. 16, 2010, now expired, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties.","This invention was made with government support under contract number NAS5-01072 awarded by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The government has certain rights in the invention.","1. Technical Field","Methods of processing an article formed of a static dissipative ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE) resin, such an such as to reduce an electrical resistivity and\/or to increase a tensile strength of the article, and ETFE-based articles produced in accordance with methods disclosed herein.","2. Related Art","Poly(ethylene-co-tetrafluoroethylene), commonly referred to as ethylene tetrafluoroethylene, or ETFE, is a polymer having a relatively high melting temperature, relatively high corrosion resistance and strength over a relatively wide temperature range, and relatively high electrical and high-energy radiation resistance properties. ETFE also tends to have better mechanical toughness and chemical resistance compared to polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), a synthetic fluoropolymer of tetrafluoroethylene, such as DuPont Teflon\u00ae.","ETFE is used in space, nuclear, and aviation industries for cable ties and wire coatings. ETFE based cable ties tend to have a relatively high strength to weight ratio and relatively low outgassing characteristics.","ETFE also tends to have relatively high volumetric and surface electrical resistivity, which may lead to electrical charging or static build-up. For example, in an extraterrestrial environment, elements of a spacecraft or satellite may become electrically charged due to photoelectric effects (sunlight) and\/or electron flux. Satellites in geosynchronous orbits are particularly susceptible to electron flux found in outer regions of the outer radiation belt.","Another concern is deep dielectric discharge (DDD). In a flux of relatively high-energy electrons, electrons may penetrate an outer surface of a spacecraft and enter dielectric materials such as circuit boards and coaxial cable insulation.","When the charge build-up exceeds a threshold, such as a dielectric strength of a material, the charge may suddenly discharge to and\/or through other elements, such as electrical circuits and\/or sensors. This may cause severe and potentially catastrophic damage.","An ETFE resin may include carbon black or other additive to provide a measure of static dissipation. For example, a Tefzel\u00ae HT-2170 fluoropolymer is marketed by E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, of Wilmington, Del., U.S.A., as a static-dissipating semi-conductive resin. According to marketing materials, DuPont\u2122 Tefzel\u00ae fluoropolymers are melt-processible thermoplastics, and are part of a family of fluorine-based products that include Teflon\u00ae PTFE, Teflon\u00ae FEP, and Teflon\u00ae PFA fluoropolymers resins.","It has been observed that, while a sheet formed of such a static dissipative resin may have an electrical resistivity as low as 1.4 Mega Ohms as measured between points located over approximately 4 inches apart, cable ties formed from the resin have been observed to have an electrical resistivity several orders of magnitude greater.","Disclosed herein are methods of processing an article formed of a static dissipative ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE) resin, such an such as to reduce an electrical resistivity and\/or to increase a tensile strength of the article, and ETFE-based articles produced in accordance with methods disclosed herein.","An article formed of a static dissipative ETFE resin may include, for example and without limitation, a cable strap to wrap, support, and\/or secure one or more wires or cables, such as a cable tie.","An article formed of a static dissipative ETFE resin may be processed with repeated heating and cooling cycles, such as to reduce an electrical resistivity and\/or to increase a tensile strength of the article.","An upper temperature of a heating and cooling cycle may be within a range of approximately 150\u00b0 C. and a melting point of the article. The melting point of the article may be in a range of, for example, approximately 220\u00b0 C. to 250\u00b0 C. The upper temperature may be within a range of approximately 180\u00b0 C. and 200\u00b0, inclusively.","A lower temperature of a heating and cooling cycle may correspond to an ambient or room temperature, which may be approximately 25\u00b0 C.","An article formed of a static dissipative ETFE resin may be irradiated, such as to increase a tensile strength of the article. An ETFE-based article may be irradiated to within a range of approximately 5 mega rads (Mrads) to 10 Mrads, inclusively, wherein a rad is a measurement of radiation equal to 10 milligrays of radiation.","An ETFE-based article may be heat-treated and irradiated.","In the drawings, the leftmost digit(s) of a reference number identifies the drawing in which the reference number first appears.","Disclosed herein are methods of processing articles formed from static dissipative ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE) resin, such as to improve one or more of electrical conductivity and tensile strength. Such an article may include, for example and without limitation, a cable strap to wrap, support, and\/or secure one or more wires or cables, such as a cable tie.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","104"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":"100"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["100","302"]},"Lock portion  includes a channel  therethrough to receive strap portion , such as illustrated in .","Lock portion  further includes a lock mechanism , which may include a frangible tab, such as illustrated in , to lockingly engage features  of a first surface  of strap portion , as strap portion  is inserted through lock portion .","Lock portion , or portions thereof, such as lock mechanism , may include and\/or may be implemented with metal.","In , features  are illustrated as alternating ridges and depressions of first surface .","In , a second surface  of strap portion  may be relatively smooth.","Cable tie  is an example article having a strap portion to wrap, support, and\/or secure one or more wires or cables.","A plurality of cable straps, such as cable ties , may be used to bundle wires or cables of wires in an electrical assembly or system, such as to reduce or eliminate movement of the wires relative to one another and\/or to guide the wires in accordance with a wire routing plan.","Where the electrical resistivity of a cable strap is relatively significant, electrical charge may accumulate on the cable strap until a critical charge level is reached, at which point a sudden discharge may occur.","For some environments, such as extraterrestrial environments, wires or cables may be wrapped with a static dissipative covering, such as electrically conductive metal foil and\/or other electrically conductive material. This may help to reduce or prevent charge buildup on wire insulation and\/or other dielectric materials. Additionally, cable straps formed from a static dissipative resin, such as, for example and without limitation, DuPont Tefzel\u00ae HT-2170 resin, may be utilized.","A cable strap formed of static dissipative EFTE resin may be evaluated with respect to one or more properties, including, without limitation, resistivity, tensile strength, and outgassing characteristics. One or more such properties may be of relatively critical importance to an application. For example, specifications for an extraterrestrial application may include a relatively low resistivity and a relatively high tensile strength. With respect to outgassing, an extraterrestrial application may call for a relatively low total mass loss (TML), and relatively low collected volatile condensable materials (CVCM).","As disclosed herein, an article formed of a static dissipative ETFE resin may be heat-treated, such as to reduce an electrical resistivity and\/or to increase a tensile strength.","As further disclosed herein, an article formed of a static dissipative ETFE resin may be irradiated, such as to increase tensile strength.","Heat Treatment",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","400","100"]},"At , an article formed of a static dissipative ETFE resin is heated to a temperature within a range of approximately 150\u00b0 C. and a melting point of the article.

Subsequent iterations of the heating at  and\/or the cooling at  may be performed with respect to one or more other temperatures within the corresponding ranges.","Thermal cycling in accordance with method  may reduce electrical resistivity of an article by reducing residual stress in the ETFE polymer of the article. As the polymer chains move or adjust to relieve stress, static dissipative and\/or electrically conductive elements of the ETFE resin, which may include carbon black particles, may be segregated away from the polymer. This may lead to longer chains of static dissipative or conductive particles, and may improve the strength of the polymer. A lower bulk resistivity of the article is measurable.
