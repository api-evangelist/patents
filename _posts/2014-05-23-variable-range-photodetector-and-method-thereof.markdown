No. 61\/827,079 entitled \u201cPhotodetector With Polarization Induced Electron Filter And Method Thereof,\u201d filed May 24, 2013, which is incorporated herein by reference.","The embodiments herein may be manufactured, used, and\/or licensed by or for the United States Government without the payment of royalties thereon.","In avalanche photodiodes or photodetectors, incoming light is used to generate carriers (i.e., free electrons or holes). Semiconductor materials are selected for photodiodes based upon the wavelength range of the radiation that is desired to be utilized or detected. Group III-nitride avalanche detectors can presumably be widely functional between 1900 nm and 200 nm (i.e. infrared to ultraviolet radiation). Generally, the binary alloys utilized in such semiconductor devices are Indium Nitride (bandgap of 0.65 eV corresponding to approximately 1900 nm), Gallium Nitride (band gap of 3.4 eV corresponding to approximately 365 nm) and Aluminum Nitride (bandgap of 6.1 eV corresponding to approximately 200 nm). By varying the relative mole fractions of these binaries, ternary or quaternary alloys may be composed that can achieve radiation absorption at intermediate wavelengths to the stated values.","III-Nitride semiconductors are commonly grown in the wurtzite crystal structure and are therefore a polar semiconductor as discussed by Ambacher in O. Ambacher, \u201cGrowth and Applications of Group III Nitrides, \u201cJ. Phys. D: Appl. Phys. 31 (1998) 2653-2710, herein incorporated by reference as though fully rewritten herein.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,326,654 to Ruden (hereinafter Ruden '654; hereby incorporated by reference) entitled \u201cA Hybrid Ultraviolet Detector,\u201d discloses a semiconductor material avalanche photodiode photodetector. The detector of Ruden '654 is an avalanche photodetector comprised of a group III-nitride semiconductor material, such as aluminum gallium nitride (AlGaN), serving as a photon to charge carrier transducer, and an avalanche charge carrier multiplication region comprised of different semiconductor materials such as silicon (see abstract).","Deep ultraviolet (DUV) photodetectors sensitive at wavelengths shorter than 260 nm are useful in numerous medical and military applications, including chemical and biological identification and non-line of sight communications. Often, these applications require very low light level or single photon detection and, as a result, photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) are widely used. However, in addition to being large and fragile, photomultiplier tubes require the use of expensive filters to limit the bandwidth of detection. Therefore, a need remains for low cost, compact, high sensitivity devices that offer a narrow and tunable bandwidth. Silicon Carbide (SiC) has emerged as an attractive candidate for DUV pin and avalanche photodetectors (APDs) due to their very low dark currents, small k factor, and high gain. Previously demonstrated APDs exhibit peak quantum efficiency (QE) of 60% at 268 nm and gain values reaching over 1000. Despite this success, SiC is still characterized by poor responsivity below 260 nm and a long absorption tail out to 380 nm. The deep ultraviolet response in pin detectors is hindered by the absorption of high energy photons in the heavily doped surface layer (p- or n-type) where photo-generated carriers are trapped by surface states or recombine due to the short diffusion length of minority carriers. The long wavelength tail results from weak absorption associated with the indirect bandgap of 4H-SiC at 3.23 eV.","In accordance with the present invention, a preferred embodiment photodetector for detecting photons in a predetermined wavelength range comprises a substrate; a p-type layer located above the substrate; a first region in which the absorption and multiplication of carriers occurs, the first region having a crystalline structure having a growth direction and a first total polarization having a magnitude and direction; a second region adjacent to the first region having a second total polarization, the second region comprising a crystalline structure having a growth direction and a second total polarization having a magnitude and direction, the first and second regions forming a first interface therebetween, the magnitudes and directions of the first and second total polarizations being such that a scalar projection of second total polarization on the growth direction is less than a scalar projection of the first total polarization projected onto the growth direction thereby creating a positive first interface charge; and a third region suitable for forming an n-metal contact thereon, the third region having a crystalline structure having a growth direction and a third total polarization with a magnitude and direction, the second and third regions forming a second interface therebetween, the third total polarization having a scalar projection on the growth direction that is greater than the scalar projection of the second polarization onto the growth direction, creating a negative second interface charge; the first and second interface charges separated by the thickness of the second region creating an electrostatic potential barrier to carriers of differing energy levels; the electrostatic barrier defining a predetermined wavelength range of the photodetector.","In accordance with the present invention, an alternate preferred embodiment photodetector for detecting photons in a predetermined wavelength range comprises a substrate; a n-type layer located above the substrate; a first region in which the absorption and multiplication of carriers occurs, the first region having a crystalline structure having a growth direction and a first total polarization having a magnitude and direction; a second region adjacent to the first region, the second region having a crystalline structure having a growth direction and a second total polarization having a magnitude and direction, the first and second regions forming a first interface therebetween, the magnitudes and directions of the first and second total polarizations being such that a scalar projection of second total polarization on the growth direction is greater than a scalar projection of the first total polarization projected onto the growth direction thereby creating a negative first interface charge;

The thickness of barrier region or layer  may be as thin as 5 nm. The region or layer  is predominantly transparent to photons of interest for conversion in that these photons are generally not converted to electrons and holes in region or layer . The SiC epitaxial layers or regions may be grown on n-type Si-face 4H-SiC substrate . The III-polar AlGaN epitaxial layers or regions may be heteroepitaxially grown by plasma assisted molecular beam epitaxy at 780\u00b0 C. directly upon the SiC epitaxial layers or regions. The two AlGaN layers or regions  and  may be combined into a single layer and may be fully strained to the AlN region , which is relaxed, as determined by high resolution x-ray diffraction. Epilayers were fabricated into 250 \u03bcm diameter, circular mesas with seven degree beveled sidewalls. The n-AlGaN Ohmic contact  comprises of a stack comprising Ti 10 nm\/Al 100 nm\/Ni 30 nm\/Au 50 nm metallization scheme while the p-SiC Ohmic contact  consists of Ni 25 nm\/Ti 35 nm\/Al 100 nm\/Ni 80 nm. The contacts  and  are similar to element number  in the U.S. Pat. No. 8,269,223, , herein incorporated by reference. The selection of metals for the contact layer depend upon metal work-function, adhesion, as well as impurity diffusion considerations. There are a number of Ohmic contacts schemes to n-AlGaN and p-SiC reported in the literature. The stacks that may be used are commonly employed. The constraint is that the contacts make a low resistance Ohmic contact; in contrast to a Schottky contact.","The semiconductor absorption\/multiplication region  (which may be designated as a first region), barrier region or layer  (which may be designated as a second region) and the third region  each have a total polarization P, P and P, respectively. In accordance with the principles of the present invention, the magnitude of the total polarization of the barrier region  having a polarization magnitude P (defined in terms of absolute value) that is greater than either of the magnitudes of the total polarizations of the absorption\/multiplication region , which has a total polarization of P, or the transparent region , which has a total polarization of P. This results in interface charge densities due to the discontinuity in polarization at the heterointerfaces between regions ,  and  that enable a large electrostatic potential barrier and therefore a large electric field across region  that suppresses the collection of photogenerated carriers excited to the lower energy band gaps of region . As a result, this structure eliminates or reduces the requirement for an optical filter for tuning the bandwidth of the photodetector near the lower energy band gaps of absorption\/multiplication region.","It is important to note that the dipole strength and energy barrier presented for carrier transport by the barrier layer  is dependent on the net total charge at the heterointerfaces between the barrier layer  and the absorption multiplication layer  as well as interface between the barrier layer  and the n-metal contact layer  or , and the doping of these layers may be used to further modify the dipole strength and energy barrier. Specifically, the introduction of ionized acceptor impurities at the heterointerface between the barrier layer  and the absorption multiplication layer  or ionized donor impurities at the heterointerface between the barrier layer  and the n-metal contact layer  or  may be used to reduce the net total charge at either of these interfaces and therefore reduce the dipole strength and energy barrier. Conversely, the introduction of ionized donor impurities at the heterointerface between the barrier layer  and the absorption multiplication layer  or ionized acceptor impurities at the heterointerface between the barrier layer  and the n-metal contact layer  or  may be used to increase the net total charge at either of these interfaces and therefore increase the dipole strength and electrostatic potential barrier. By adjusting the charge, the height (in terms of energy needed to surmount it) of the electrostatic potential barrier may be adjusted.","By using a transparent layer or region  comprising AlGaN in conjunction with the preferred embodiment  shown in , the short wavelength cutoff of AlGaN can be tuned from 365 to 200 nm.","An alternative preferred embodiment assembly  is illustrated in . The preferred embodiment  comprises a p-metal contact layer or region  which may be positioned or formed on a substrate , such as a bulk SiC substrate. The absorption\/multiplication region or layer  is formed on the p-metal contact layer  as shown in . Barrier layer or region  is formed on region  and N-metal contact layer or region  is formed on the barrier region . As illustrated in , the magnitude of the total polarization P of the barrier region  (which may be denoted as the second region) is greater than the magnitude of the polarization of either of the regions  (P) (which may be denoted as the first region) or  (P) (which may be denoted as the third region). The interface charge densities that arise due to the discontinuity in polarization at the interfaces between regions  and  with respect to barrier region  enable a large electrostatic potential barrier and therefore a large electric field across barrier region  that suppresses the collection of photogenerated carriers excited to the lower energy band gaps of absorption\/multiplication region , as depicted in general by the band diagram shown in .","Material selection for the regions ,  and  may include any semiconductor materials for which the conditions |P|>|P| and |P| are satisfied. That is, the magnitude of the polarization of the barrier region  is greater than the magnitude of the polarization of the n-metal contact layer  and the absorption\/multiplication region . For example, the regions could be alloys of AlGaN where different amounts of aluminum are used to regulate the magnitude of polarization. Other examples are magnesium zinc oxide, aluminum gallium arsenide, indium gallium arsenide, and indium gallium nitride. A further example is where the P material is chosen as silicon and the P and P regions aluminum gallium nitride. The electrostatic potential energy barrier in barrier region  is significantly enhanced by the dipole formed by the fixed interface polarization charge induced by the difference in polarization between the barrier region and the absorption\/multiplication and n-contact regions. As is known, without a barrier, holes migrate to the p contact and electrons migrate to the n contact. The barrier region , in  prevents hole transport and collection from the AlGaN layer ( in  in ). High energy photogenerated electrons in the SiC absorption\/multiplication region () can traverse the barrier region and be collected in the n-metal contact region  in . Lower energy photogenerated electrons in SiC absorption\/multiplication region  cannot traverse the barrier layer, so those carriers are not collected. As a result, long wavelength photoresponse is suppressed without using an optical filter.","The employment of polarization induced charge densities arising from the difference in polarization between the barrier layer  and the surrounding regions results in significant suppression of long wavelength response in the device without requiring an optical filter. As shown in the band diagram of , the barrier region of a Group-III Nitride material, which in this case is AlN, creates a barrier for the transport of electrons excited to the L and M conduction bands of the absorption multiplication region , which in this case is SiC, (shown to the left of ). When referring to the polarization of the regions , , and , the polarizations are compared using the Scalar Projections S, S, S, which are defined as the absolute values of the magnitudes of the polarizations P, P, P times the cosine of the angle between the direction of the polarizations and the growth direction. In , a positive polarization charge is formed at the interface of the material where S<S(i.e., AlN\/SiC interface), while a negative polarization charge is formed at the interface of the material where S<S(i.e., AlN\/AlGaN interface). Note that each of S, Sand Sare negative. The barrier region , in an AlGaN\/AlN\/SiC photodetector constructed in accordance with the principles of the present invention, enables a solar-blind detector structure that can leverage the low dark current, and high gain of SiC while suppressing its long wavelength response without using an optical filter. In addition, the barrier height presented by region  is adjustable by varying the bias voltage, as increasing the reverse bias voltage results in lowering the barrier. The long wavelength photoresponse is suppressed through the formation of an energy barrier that prevents the collection of carriers generated by lower energy photons that are absorbed in the detector. This energy barrier is principally due to the dipole formed across the barrier region that arises from polarization interface charge densities induced by the difference in total polarization between the barrier region and the surrounding regions in the structure; including on one side larger magnitude spontaneous polarization of AlN (barrier region ) over SiC (absorption-multiplication region ), and, on the opposite side, over AlGaN region  in  in . The barrier height increases with barrier region layer  thickness in association with the first and second interface charges and can be significantly larger than band offsets. With respect to the embodiment of , the barrier region  blocks collection of holes photogenerated in AlGaN contact window region . Likewise, with respect to the embodiment of , the barrier  blocks collection of holes generated in AlGaN metal contact region . As shown in the band diagram of , the barrier permits transport of electrons generated in an upper conduction band valley of SiC (see E(\u0393)), but blocks transport from lower valleys (see E(M) and E(L)). Increasing reverse bias reduces the barrier height to permit collection of some electrons generated in lower conduction bands, thereby increasing long wavelength response.","The embodiment of  (incorporating a transparent window ) is preferred in that, with reference to , the distance over which the potential is dropped within the n-contact region can be modified by adjusting the doping profile within the extended n-contact region (or transparent region ). In the embodiment of , the doping on the transparent region  adjacent to the AlN barrier region  has been reduced. Reduction of the doping in the region adjacent to the barrier region  is represented by . If the doping was high throughout the n-contact layer, as in the case of , a much sharper drop in potential would occur in this layer; leading to a larger electric field that may be desirable in some instances.","The preferred embodiments of the present invention shown in  comprise a heterogeneous n-III-Nitride\/i-p-SiC structure operable to extend the deep ultraviolet (DUV) response of SiC below 260 nm, while suppressing the long wavelength response. Since the direct bandgap of aluminum gallium nitride (AlGaN) can be engineered from 3.4 eV to 6.1 eV depending on the AlN to GaN mole fraction, these alloys are employed as UV transparent, n-type contact windows (for example, the transparent windows  and  in ) to increase the collection of carriers created by absorption of high energy photons in the high electric field depletion region of the nip structure. As described in the following, photo-generated carriers in the AlGaN windows do not contribute to photoresponse and can therefore be used to adjust the high energy cutoff wavelength of this device.","In order to suppress the long wavelength response of SiC between 260 nm and 380 nm, the preferred embodiments  and  of , respectively, utilize polarization charge densities induced at the interfaces using a barrier region  to create a large barrier to transport and allow only electrons excited by high energy photons to higher energy bands within the SiC region to be collected. Further utilizing a transparent window in the embodiment  of , this transparent window  and electron filter (barrier ) facilitate the fabrication of high responsivity, narrow bandwidth detectors in which the spectral response can be adjusted though the window and barrier properties.","Note that the barrier region  functions in a manner different from the interface charge control layer disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 8,269,223 ('223 Patent). As shown in FIG. 24 of the '223 Patent, an AlGaN interface charge control layer (ICCL) 5F operates to improve the transport of holes generated in the GaN:UID layer into the 480 nm SiC:UID layer. Note further that in the '223 Patent, the thickness of interface charge control layer is much thinner than the thickness of barrier region  of the embodiments shown in  herein. The reduced thickness in the '223 Patent results in conduction and valence band bending associated with the formation of a dipole over a very short distance. As a result, this facilitates the transfer of holes from the GaN absorption region to the SiC multiplication region in the heterogeneous GaN\u2014SiC separate absorption and multiplication (SAM) APD and was called a nitride interface charge control layer (ICCL) (see '223 Patent for details). The coinventors have now theoretically found that this only occurs if the thickness of the AlN region is less than 5 nm; at thicknesses greater than that the barrier created by the dipole will prevent photogenerated holes in the GaN:UID from being collected in the SiC:UID layer. In comparison to U.S. Pat. No. 8,269,223, the thickness of AlN is about one percent of the thickness of the barrier region . Thickness reduction results in band bending over a very short distance (\u02dc1 nm), that facilitates tunneling of holes from the GaN absorption region to the SiC multiplication region. In the GaN\u2014SiC structure disclosed in the '223 patent, the photoresponse is primarily associated with hole injection to the p-contact layer. In preferred embodiments of , the AlN barrier region  is sufficiently thick so that the hole transport from the n-contact layer  or transparent AlGaN region  to the absorption\/multiplication region  is blocked. However, the barrier in the conduction band allows the transport of high energy photogenerated electrons in the SiC region to cross into the III-Nitride region while simultaneously suppressing the collection of electrons generated by lower energy photons in SiC associated with wavelengths between 260-380 nm.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIGS. 1A and 2A","FIGS. 1B and 2B","FIGS. 1A and 2A","FIG. 1A","FIG. 2A","FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["14","14","2","13","1","15","16","3","14","14"],"sub":["x","(1-x)","x","(1-x)"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},"The origins of the observed spectral response can be understood by considering the influence of the AlN barrier region .  shows an illustration of the band alignment between the direct E(\u0393) and indirect (E(L), E(M)) conduction band valleys of 4H-SiC and the direct \u2296\u2014valley of the III-Nitride region at zero bias under UV illumination. For the solid lines shown in the central portion of , this illustrates the case where lowest conduction band of SiC is in alignment with AlN. The transition energy between the \u0393-M, \u0393-L and \u0393-\u0393 valleys of SiC was assumed to be 3.25 eV, 4 eV, and 5 eV, respectively, as provided by the Ioffe Physico-Technical Institute. It should be noted there is some uncertainty in these values, especially for the \u0393-\u0393 transition which may lie between 5-6 eV.","At zero bias, there is a large field generated in the AlN region as a result of the positive polarization induced interface charge at the SiC\/AlN interface and negative polarization induced interface charge at the AlN\/AlGaN interface. This field, combined with the difference in bandgap, creates a large interface barrier which impedes the injection of holes from AlGaN to SiC and electrons from SiC to AlGaN, depending upon the energy of the conduction band valley into which the electrons are photoexcited. As shown in , under optical excitation, photogenerated holes in AlGaN accumulate at the AlN\/AlGaN interface forming a 2 dimensional hole gas (2 DHG) and electrons in the lower, M and L valleys of SiC accumulate at the SiC\/AlN interface forming a 2 dimensional electron gas (2 DEG). These accumulated charges partially cancel the polarization charge at each interface and reduce the overall barrier height. Photogenerated holes in the AlGaN region are still unable to overcome this barrier and therefore no response from AlGaN is observed, as evidenced by the high energy cutoff in the photoresponse shown in  that corresponds to absorption in this layer. Likewise, there is approximately a 2 eV barrier between the M valley of 4H-SiC and AlN which impedes electron injection across the interface leading to a suppressed long wavelength response from SiC. On the other hand, this barrier has a minimal impact on the transport of electrons excited to the \u0393 valley across the interface and therefore these carriers are collected as illustrated by the lightly shaded electrons in . The presence of the 226 nm peak in both the DC and modulated measurements at zero bias is therefore likely due to the direct collection of carriers excited to the \u0393 valley. This conclusion is supported by the lack of phase delay in the modulated photoresponse at wavelengths shorter than 226 nm, which indicates that the signal experiences no time delay associated with the accumulation of carriers at the interface. Due to the large electric field in the SiC region , it is expected that the carriers in the \u0393 valley are hot when they reach the barrier and are able to overcome it without difficulty. It is interesting to note that the reported hot electron energy relaxation time in 4H-SiC is about 2.5 psec. Using a saturation velocity of 2\u00d710cm\/sec for electrons in SiC, the calculated average time for an electron to reach the SiC\/AlN interface is about 1.7 psec. Considering the strong absorption due to the \u0393-\u0393 transition, most carriers excited at 226 nm are likely generated within 1\/\u03b1 cm of the SiC\/AlN interface and therefore the average time may be even shorter. However, since the QE measured in this work at 226 nm is only 20%, considerably lower than expected, the hot electron energy relaxation time in the \u0393 valley might be even shorter than 2.5 psec.","As indicated in , increasing the reverse bias voltage increases (decreases) the electric field in the SiC (AlN) region; thus lowering the barrier for carrier injection across the interface. The field is increased in the SiC region and decreased in the AlN region. Although reduced, the barrier continues to impede photo-generated holes in the AlGaN layer. However, as indicated by the redshift (shifting to a longer wavelength) in the DC photoresponse, hot electrons in lower energy bands of SiC are able to overcome the barrier and be collected. The peak QE of 76% at 40 V is almost double that of typical SiC pin diodes, which exhibit approximately 40% QE at 242 nm under unity gain. This enhanced DUV response is not due to photoconductive gain since the operation of this device relies on the accumulation of both holes and electrons at the interface to lower the barrier. In the modulated measurement at large reverse bias voltages, the long wavelength response experiences a\u02dc50 degree phase delay as compared to the 226 nm peak and can be attributed to the charge-accumulation process discussed previously. Considering the spontaneous polarization charge density of 5\u00d710C\/cmand the photogenerated current density of 3\u00d710A\/cmat optical power of 100 nW and wavelength of 242 nm, the phase delay in these measurements is reasonable. The 226 nm peak exhibits no bias dependence in DC or modulated measurements indicating that this signal is due to the collection of carriers directly from the \u0393 valley and not from carriers that have relaxed from the \u0393 valley to lower energies. Collection of relaxed carriers would likely have a bias dependence based on the lowering of the barrier. The negative quadrature component at 228 nm represents the on-set of the interaction with the barrier and is due to hot electrons in the bottom of the \u0393 valley able to tunnel through the barrier. As a result, this signal does experience a phase delay and is bias dependent. This further indicates that the collection of electrons leading to the 242 nm peak are from the lower energy L valley. At low bias voltages, these carriers are impeded by the barrier and therefore their contribution to the photoresponse is suppressed, while at large bias voltages, these carriers are delayed as compared to the 226 nm signal due to interaction with the barrier. Although not shown here, increasing the power of the optical illumination results in a reduced phase lag of the long wavelength signal due to a faster barrier lowering process.","For all bias voltages, the long wavelength (<260 nm) response from the collection of carriers in the M valley is strongly suppressed as shown in the DC photo-response in . This suppression effect is due to the same barrier that creates the bias dependent operation. At large reverse bias voltages investigated in this work, electrons in the M valley of SiC are unable to overcome the barrier at the interface. These carriers instead accumulate at the interface as described previously. The long wavelength filtering effect is slightly less effective in the chopped response due to the time required to accumulate charge at the interface. Under low reverse bias operation, the charge accumulation results in a measureable displacement current indicated by a leading phase, indicated by the positive quadrature component at 10 V. At higher reverse bias voltages (20V-30V), the barrier is lowered and fewer charges are required to form the 2 DEG and 2 DHG. Under these conditions, the photo-current dominates the displacement current resulting in the phase lag of the signal.","The use of AlGaN alloys as a transparent n-type window increases the collection of electrons created by absorption of high energy photons in the high-field n-SiC region. Peak QE of 76% at 242 nm has been measured and attributed to the minimization of the effects of surface states and absorption in heavily doped layers currently hindering homogeneous SiC devices. Utilizing the large polarization induced interface charges in these material systems to create a barrier at the interface has been demonstrated to filter the long wavelength response by prohibiting collection of carriers from the M valley of SiC. Adjusting the field in the barrier region through the difference in polarization and thickness adds further control over the long wavelength cutoff and also voltage response.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 4","FIG. 5"],"sub":["x","(1-x)","c"]},"Referring now to , some of the material layers forming the photodetector are generally formed of atoms from Groups II and VI or Groups III and V.

Solar-blind ultraviolet detectors are useful for bioagent detection-identification systems for hospitals, and commercial HVAC systems as well as compact water quality monitoring systems for disaster relief workers and outdoor enthusiasts.","Currently system designers requiring high sensitivity and low noise UV detectors for spectroscopy and single photon counting have the option of employing PMTs or UV enhanced Si APDs. Generally speaking PMTs have significant shortcomings including high cost, bulky packaging, requiring high voltage for operation (>1000 V) and cooling for high sensitivity. UV enhanced Si APDs can provide high gain, but can have high dark current and significant long wavelength response that can make them suboptimal for certain applications. SiC APDs are still in the developmental stage but they can have high gain and very low dark current. However, these devices exhibit low quantum efficiencies at long wavelength approaching the band gap (\u02dc380 nm) because of poor absorption due to the indirect band gap of SiC. Most of these detectors are inherently broad band thus expensive optical filtering is often required to narrow the spectral response to a desired band such a solar-blind or visible-blind. Operation in the solar blind region is useful for imaging\/detecting human-generated phenomena against a solar background. These devices are critical for developing systems for sniper fire detection, UV communications, biological-chemical agent identification and detection, and water quality monitoring.","In contrast, the preferred embodiments of the present invention utilize a novel approach to provide a long wavelength cut-off to the photoresponse of a photodetector that leverages the polarization interface charge that occurs at the heterointerfaces between materials with different polarity. By inserting an appropriate barrier layer within the photodetector design, the long wavelength response can be significantly suppressed. One embodiment of particular military and commercial interest is the development of solar-blind or visible-blind detectors with no, or greatly reduced, optical filter requirements. A solar-blind AlGaN\/AlN\/SiC Electron Filter Photodetector (EFP) (illustrated schematically in ) has been demonstrated that has significant cut-off of long wavelength response at 260 nm. These devices are attractive as a replacement for PMTs and UV enhanced Si APDs for system designers because of (1) lower cost\u2014an AlGaN\/AlN\/SiC EFP can be produced at significantly lower cost than PMTs; (2) room temperature operation\u2014An AlGaN\/AlN\/SiC EFP can be operated at room temperature, while PMTs often require thermoelectric cooling depending upon the sensitivity required, and (3) Fragility\u2014PMTs require the cathode detection material and dynode gain medium to be encased within a vacuum sealed tube. This packaging is inherently more fragile than that employed for semiconductor based detectors; (4) Solar\/Visible blind detection\u2014An AlGaN\/AlN\/SiC EFP can be made inherently visible\/solar blind by tuning the relative AlN, InN and GaN compositions of the III-Nitride barrier and contact layers. In contrast, UV-enhanced Si APDs require external filters that can be costly depending upon the level of rejection required. AlGaN\/AlN\/SiC EFPs (shown schematically in ) exhibit peak unity gain quantum efficiency (QE) of \u02dc76% at 242 nm that is significantly higher than what is observed for conventional homogeneous SiC pin photodiodes and a long wavelength cut-off at 260 nm.","As used herein (in the drawings, specification, abstract and claims), the term \u201clight\u201d means electromagnetic radiation, unless specifically noted to the contrary.
