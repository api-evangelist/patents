title: Multiple-frequency signal classification through use of a second-order statistic
abstract: A multi-frequency (also known as multiple-frequency) signal, such as a dual-tone signal, can be a repeating signal that indicates a character designated on a keypad. The signal can be processed such that the character is identifiable. This processing can include using first and second-order statistics of the signal to determine an estimated average frequency of the signal. A table can be accessed that lists individual characters of the keypad and specific average frequency values can be associated with the individual characters. The specific average frequency value that is closest to the estimated average frequency can be identified and the character associated with this closest specific average frequency value can be appointed as the character indicated by the signal. Thus, the multi-frequency signal can be classified as communicating the appointed character.

A receiver that receives the communication signal, whether the receiver is a receiver intended by the transmitter or not, can attempt to process the communication signal. Processing of this signal can be a relatively long process. Further, if a specific piece of information is desired from the signal, then it can be considered resource intensive to decode the whole single for the piece of information.","A system is disclosed comprising an identification component configured to identify an average frequency of a multi-frequency signal. The system also comprises a determination component configured to determine a data set associated with the multi-frequency signal through use of the average frequency, where the data set is outputted and where the identification component, the determination component, or a combination thereof is, at least in part, implemented through non-software.","Another system is disclosed comprising a computation component, a correlation component, a causation component, and a processor. The estimation component can be configured to make an estimation of an average of a high frequency of a dual-tone frequency signal and a low frequency of the dual-tone frequency signal, where the estimation is made through use a second-order statistic of the dual-tone frequency signal. The correlation component can be configured to make a correlation of the average with a character. The causation component can be configured to cause an output of the character. The processor can be configured to execute at least one instruction associated with the computation component, the correlation component, the causation component, or a combination thereof.","Yet another system is disclosed comprising a non-transitory computer-readable medium configured to store processor-executable instructions that when executed by a processor cause the processor to perform a method. The method can comprise correlating an estimated average frequency of a dual-tone frequency signal with a key of a digital communication keypad, where the dual-tone frequency signal comprises a high frequency and a low frequency that is different from the high frequency and where the average frequency is an average of the high frequency and the low frequency. The method can additionally comprise causing an output of the key after the correlation.","A multi-frequency (also known as multiple-frequency) signal, such as a dual-tone signal, can be a repeating signal that indicates a character designated on a keypad. The signal can be processed such that the character is identifiable. This processing can include using first and second-order statistics of the signal to determine an estimated average frequency of the signal. A table can be accessed that lists individual characters of the keypad and specific average frequency values can be associated with the individual characters. The specific average frequency value that is closest to the estimated average frequency can be identified and the character associated with this closest specific average frequency value can be appointed as the character indicated by the signal. Thus, the multi-frequency signal can be classified as communicating the appointed character.","Aspects disclosed herein can be related to communications and signal detection. Aspects can be used to detect a dual-tone multi-frequency or other signal used for synchronizing patterns and preambles preceding user data in data communications protocols, signaling information in telephony as well as radio communications, supervisory audio tones in cellular telephony, predefined bit sequences on a specific channel that provides phase reference of other associated channels, etc.","In one example, a system can be is transmitting voice, data, image or video. Embedded in this signal can be one or more synchronizing patterns which identify the beginning of a frame, or form a preamble to user data, a predefined bit sequence that provides a timing reference, signaling information, etc. These synchronizing signals can be, at least in part, a dual-tone multi-frequency signal.
