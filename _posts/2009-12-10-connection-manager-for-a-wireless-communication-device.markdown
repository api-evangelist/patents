Field","The present disclosure relates generally to communication, and more specifically to techniques for supporting communication for a wireless communication device.","II. Background","Wireless communication networks are widely deployed to provide various communication content such as voice, video, packet data, messaging, broadcast, etc. These wireless networks may be multiple-access networks capable of supporting multiple users by sharing the available network resources.

The processing for each radio  may be dependent on the radio technology supported by that radio and may include encoding, decoding, modulation, demodulation, encryption, decryption, etc. Memory  may store program codes and data for modem processor  and connection manager .","Connection manager  may perform various functions to support communication for active applications and services via available radios. Within connection manager , a connection manager (CnM) controller  may be responsible for the overall control of connection manager . CnM controller  may communicate with operating system  and host processor  via messages exchanged through a host interface, which may be common inter-processor communication (IPC). CnM controller  may determine which applications are active, obtain the requirements of the active applications, and provide information on the available or selected radios. CnM controller  may also coordinate the operation of other managers and controllers within connection manager , e.g., through messages exchanged via a common bus .","A system policy manager  may manage policies associated with the radios, activate and de-activate radios in response to events, and manage handoffs\/handovers between wireless networks. The policies may be used to determine which radio(s) to use for any given application. A system resource manager  may interface with system policy manager  to perform resource management such as conflict resolution, power management, link quality of service (QoS), admission control, etc. An auxiliary service manager  may support clients\/agents for auxiliary services, which are described below. Auxiliary service manager  may support a plug-in environment for introducing new clients of auxiliary services, which may simplify updating of technologies and features on wireless device .","A profile manager  may create, update, and prioritize profiles, which are described below. The profiles may indicate preferences for connectivity, as defined by various entities. Profile manager  may determine one or more applicable profiles for the current configuration and may generate operating rules based on the applicable profile(s). A call manager  may manage call, change phone settings, register\/de-register supplementary services, and notify applications regarding call status, phone state\/status, and service status. Call manager  may operate based on network operator rules, which may be provided via a preferred roaming list (PRL) in 3GPP2, a list of preferred public land mobile networks (PLMNs) in 3GPP, etc. A mobility manager  may manage service continuity using Mobile Internet Protocol (IP), neighbor channel measurements, better system detection, pre-authentication and security key exchange, and other functional units for voice and data services. A peer-to-peer (P2P) manager  may support peer-to-peer communication between wireless device  and other wireless devices with or without infrastructure, as described below.

Radio controller  may be part of connection manager  (as shown in ) or may be external to connection manager . Radio controller  may perform functions to support voice call continuity (VCC) and data call continuity (DCC). Radio controller  may also implement handoff mechanism for voice call continuity between a circuit-switched network and a packet-switched network. Radio controller  may also implement handoff mechanism for (i) data service continuity defined in 3GPP I-WLAN and (ii) Mobile IP defined in 3GPP and Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).

A profile database  may store profiles that may be used to obtain connectivity. A services database  may store service clients that have been downloaded onto wireless device . Other databases may also be used to store other types of information for wireless device .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["240","110","240","240"]},"1. Embedded Connection Manager","In an aspect, connection manager  may be embedded and may reside within radio subsystem , e.g., as shown in . Embedded connection manager  may be different from a conventional connection manager residing on an external host outside of a radio subsystem, as described below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 3A","b":["310","320","330","340","350","310","340","350","310","350","330"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 3B","b":["312","342","352","312","332","352","352","342","352","312"]},"In general, an embedded connection manager, such as connection manager  in  or connection manager  in , may reside in a radio subsystem and below the OS\/HLOS. The radio subsystem does not include an OS\/HLOS and further does not include an application that implements connection manager functionality or utilizes OS\/HLOS functionality. The radio subsystem intrinsically or natively implements the embedded connection manager functionality, independent of any host entity that introduces an OS\/HLOS, an applications environment, etc. This may simplify porting of the embedded connection manager across OS\/HLOS. The embedded connection manager operates independently of the OS\/HLOS for the wireless device and may interface with the OS\/HLOS through a host interface. The embedded connection manager may also be independent of the applications and any user interface. The applications may be unaware of radio selections. Service continuity may be provided via the embedded connection manager in an applications-transparent fashion for improved user experience.","The embedded connection manager may be more efficient because it is located closer to the radios and is able to communicate with the radios via lower level signaling. For example, the embedded connection manager may provide the following advantages:\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 2"],"b":["400","110","240","1","240","242","260","2","290","260","240","3"]},"Connection manager  may perform various functions such as authentication, registration, arbitration, and connection evaluation for the radios (step ). Authentication may include verifying the user (e.g., password) and\/or performing authentication with a wireless network to authenticate wireless device . Registration may include communicating with the wireless network to inform the network of the presence of wireless device . Arbitration may include resolving any conflict between multiple radios. Connection evaluation may include determining whether each radio has a good radio link\/connection based on the RSSI, BER, and\/or other link metrics. Connection evaluation may also include determining whether each radio has a good data path. A \u201cradio link\u201d may refer to a communication channel from a radio within wireless device  to a station in a wireless network, e.g., an access point in a WLAN or a base station in a cellular network. A \u201cdata path\u201d may refer to an end-to-end communication channel from wireless device  (e.g., via a radio link and the Internet) all the way to an endpoint such as a server that is hosting a desired web page. Connection manager  may provide link metrics and\/or path metrics.","In one design, connection manager  may select M radios to use, where 1\u2266M\u2266N (step ). Connection manager  may then send the M selected radios to the applications (step ). In another design, connection manager  may determine which radios are available and may provide the available radios to the host processor. The host processor may select which radios to use from among the available radios provided by connection manager . In any case, the K applications may be mapped to the M selected radios based on an application-to-radio mapping, and each application may connect to its radio(s) (step ). For example, two applications may be active, application  may connect to one selected radio, and application  may connect to another selected radio.","2. Radio Selection and Management","In general, one or more applications may be active at any given moment. Each application may have certain requirements. One or more radios may be selected to provide connectivity for the active application(s). Each radio may have certain capabilities and may provide connection for one or more active applications.","In another aspect, multiple radios may be selected to provide connectivity for one or more active applications, which may be referred to as a multi-connectivity scenario. The number of radios to select and which particular radios to select may be dependent on the capabilities of the radios and the requirements of the active application(s). The multi-connectivity scenario may provide improved performance over a single-connectivity scenario with one radio being selected for each active application.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["240","240","240","110"]},"The mapping of the K active applications to the M selected radios may be static or semi-static. The mapping may be updated whenever a change is detected, e.g., due to an active application terminating, a new application becoming active, a selected radio being out of coverage, a new radio being detected, etc. The mapping may also be dynamic and may change more frequently due to handoff to support seamless mobility.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["240","1","2","3","1","2","3"]},"Connection manager  may manage flow mobility for the K active applications. Each active application may have one or more data flows. A data flow may be described as communication or transfer of data from an application or service agent through one or more radios within a wireless device to one or more stations. A station may be an access point in a WLAN, or a base station in a cellular network, or a peer device. A peer device may connect to an access point or a base station, which may thereafter proceed to one or more communication endpoints such as an Internet server providing a web page or other information. A data flow may therefore generally be considered a \u201cone [application] to many [radios, access points, and endpoints]\u201d function. The data flows for the K active applications may be dynamically routed between multiple radios based on radio link quality, data requirements of the applications, congestion in the wireless networks or core networks, and\/or other conditions.","An example of mobility management and flow mobility (not shown in ) may be as follows. A user may be browsing the Internet using WLAN in a coffee shop. The user may receive a phone call and may answer the call via a CDMA 1X network, as determined by connection manager . A remote caller may request to show the user some information that may require a VideoShare application. The VideoShare application may be launched on an EVDO network, as determined by connection manager  based on an operator profile. The EVDO network may be the only wireless network of the network operator that can meet the quality requirements of the VideoShare application. The user may then have three connections to three wireless networks at this moment. The user may thereafter leave the coffee shop, and WLAN connectivity may decline. Connection manager  may maintain the VideoShare application on the EVDO network and may move the browser application from WLAN to the EVDO network. Connection manager  may thus perform handoff of the browser application from one wireless network to another wireless network. Alternatively, connection manager  may detect adequate WLAN connectivity and may maintain all three connections but may migrate some of the WLAN browser traffic to the EVDO network. Connection manager  may thus support flow mobility and may migrate an application data flow partially between two or more wireless networks.","Connection manager  may provide capability to enable wireless device  to trigger handoff from one wireless network to another wireless network. This capability may be implemented by connection manager  and supported by profile database . This capability may extend to multi-radio scenarios (e.g., 3GPP cellular to WLAN, 3GPP2 cellular to WLAN, 3GPP cellular to 3GPP2 cellular, etc.) and may include multi-operator scenarios where handoff between network operators (e.g., for different radio technologies such as 3GPP to 3GPP2) is enabled.","The example shown in  and the example described above are two examples in which a wireless device centric implementation of connection manager  may result in little impact to the wireless networks and core networks. Some mobility protocols such as Mobile IP (e.g., client-based Mobile IP implementation such as Dual Stack Mobile IP version 6 (DSMIPv6)) may be used to maintain IP (or other) connectivity when switching between networks. These may be built into the system or may be provisioned as embedded connectivity clients.","Mobility may be implemented in a variety of ways, including wireless device  acting autonomously, in conjunction with other wireless devices, and\/or in conjunction with operator network or Internet based entities, such as Mobile IP Home Agent (HA) and Foreign Agent (FA).","3. Profiles","In another aspect, profiles may be used to provide connectivity for wireless device . A profile may contain preferences for specific actions that wireless device  should perform to obtain connectivity. For example, a profile may identify preferences for certain radios over other radios, preferences for a particular radio under certain conditions, etc. Different profiles may be defined by different entities such as a user, a network operator, an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) or wireless device manufacturer, an auxiliary service, etc. The profiles may allow for conformance to the requirements of the different entities.","Profiles may be implemented in various manners. In one design, profiles may be implemented via software programs that may be modified to suit the desired operations. In another design, profiles may be implemented via databases within wireless device , as described below.","A number of profiles may be defined. In one design, some or all of the following profiles may be defined:\n\n","A user profile may store preferences for connectivity defined by the user. The user may define the preferences based on various considerations such as cost, privacy, battery usage, etc. The user-defined preferences may be used to select radios to provide connectivity for applications. For example, the user profile may select a home WLAN when the user is at home, may select a company WLAN when at work, and may switch off WLAN in the car to save battery power.","An exemplary scenario for the user profile may be as follows. The user may set the user profile to invoke wireless device  to always use WLAN to connect from home. Wireless device  may then switch connectivity to WLAN whenever it determines that it is at home, e.g., based on a WLAN service set identifier (SSID), a neighbor cell tower identity (ID), GPS, etc. When WLAN-in-public is detected, wireless device  may prompt the user to select a wireless network. When no WLAN is detected, wireless device  may select a cellular network. If wireless device  supports both 3GPP and 3GPP2 networks, then wireless device  may select either 3GPP or 3GPP2 network based on user-defined preferences, which may be made anytime after purchase of wireless device .","An operator profile may store preferences for connectivity defined by a network operator. The network operator may prefer wireless device  to use some radios over other radios when several radios are available within wireless device . The operator preferences may be based on various considerations. For example, the network operator may prefer to route traffic data via a preferred network of the operator or to offload traffic data when an alternative access point is available, e.g., in a WLAN of the network operator. The operator preferences may be defined based on a PRL for 3GPP2 networks or a preferred PLMN list for 3GPP networks. In one design, the network operator may specify a list of preferred wireless networks. The list of preferred wireless networks may be defined as follows:","{Operator's UMTS network, Operator's WLAN, any WLAN, any WWAN}.","An exemplary scenario for the operator profile may be as follows. When wireless device  is powered on or is in an idle mode, it may select a cellular network based on the operator profile. When an application requests a connection, wireless device  may select a wireless network (e.g., a cellular network or WLAN) based on the operator profile and possibly other profiles. For example, some applications such as video telephony (VT) or VideoShare may function on only certain wireless networks. The wireless operator may offload traffic to WLAN in certain situations.","An OEM profile may store preferences for connectivity defined by an OEM or manufacturer of wireless device . The OEM profile may be defined based on capabilities of wireless device , which may be dependent on which specific radios are included in wireless device , the available resources in wireless device , etc. The available resources may be given by radio capabilities, processing capabilities (e.g., CPU MIPS), memory capacity, battery power, coders\/decoders (codecs), etc. The OEM profile may store rules\/preferences based on the available resources. For example, a rule may be defined as follows:","{If battery power<20%, then perform action A, else perform action B}.","Different decisions may be made based on all of the rules in the OEM profile.","The OEM profile may be defined based on tradeoffs between resource usage and speed\/bandwidth to provide better user experience. For example, the user may be downloading on WLAN when a video teleconference (VT) call is started. The VT call may run on either an EVDO network or a WCDMA network. If battery power (which may be one type of resources) is low, then wireless device  may place the VT call on the EVDO network, may move the download to the EVDO network as well, and may shut down WLAN to save battery power. Otherwise, if battery power is high, then wireless device  may continue downloading on the WLAN and may connect the VT call on the EVDO network.","An applications profile may store preferences for connectivity for applications on wireless device . The preferences may be based on the requirements of the applications. For example, some applications may be supported by only certain wireless networks but not others. Some applications may also require certain minimum data rate for satisfactory performance. The various requirements may be captured in the applications profile, which may be used to select the proper radios to provide connectivity for the applications. For example, a given application may require a particular radio technology for connectivity, e.g., a VideoShare application may require EVDO. If another application is launched that may compromise the operation of a high priority application (such as VideoShare), then connection manager  may preserve the integrity of the high priority application and may route the other application elsewhere.","A services profile may store preferences for connectivity for service clients on wireless device . The network operator and\/or other business entities may offer a collection of auxiliary services that the user can download onto wireless device , e.g., in similar manner as downloading of applications from an Apple App Store. Some exemplary auxiliary services are described below. An auxiliary service may operate between a service server in a network and a service client\/agent in wireless device . The user may download the auxiliary service, which may establish the service client in wireless device . The operation of the auxiliary service may be governed by the services profile.","A learned profile may store preferences for connectivity determined based on past activities or behavior of wireless device . Patterns and behaviors of wireless device  may be gathered and used to create a new profile or to update an existing profile. The learned profile may also be established by local conditions such as the location of wireless device .","An exemplary scenario for the learned profile may be as follows. The user (a mom) may have a regular schedule of taking a child to preschool before going to work every weekday. It may take the mom 30 minutes to take the child to preschool at 7 AM, then 20 minutes to drive to work afterward. The mom may leave work at 4 PM to pick up the child and may arrive home by 5 PM. Based on this repeated pattern, wireless device  may create a user profile with specific actions during active time periods and may power off unused features (such as WLAN) during inactive time periods.","Six types of profiles have been described above. Fewer, different, and\/or additional profiles may also be defined and used to provide connectivity.","A profile may be static and defined once, semi-static and changed once in a while, or dynamic and updated periodically or asynchronously. A profile may be updated by the user and\/or other entities such as wireless device  via an internal learning entity, another user via a wired or wireless connection, the operator network, a service server, etc. A profile may be loaded into wireless device  automatically without user involvement or may require user approval for loading.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0081","num":"0090"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["250","240","250"]},"Within profile manager , a profile provisioning manager  may receive inputs from one or more entities to create profiles and\/or to update profiles. For example, manager  may receive (i) user inputs via a local mechanism such as a keyboard or a touch screen on wireless device , (ii) local inputs via a local mechanism such as a PC through a wired connection (e.g., USB) or a wireless connection (e.g., Bluetooth or WLAN), or (iii) over-the-air (OTA) inputs from the operator network or a service server via a one-way mechanism such as short message service (SMS), a two-way mechanism such as Open Mobile Alliance Device Management (OMA DM), etc. Manager  may also receive other inputs from wireless device  itself and may use these inputs to update profiles, e.g., the learned profile. In general, manager  may receive information used to create or update profiles from external entities or wireless device . Manager  may create or update the profiles based on the received information. Profile database  may store the profiles for wireless device .","A profile operations manager  may receive one or more applicable profiles from database , e.g., when a connection request is received. For example, the applicable profile(s) may be dynamically selected based on environment, location, or some other predefined and\/or learned criteria. Manager  may determine the priorities of the applicable profile(s) and may arbitrate between conflicting profiles as necessary. The priorities of the profiles may be determined (e.g., locally) based on an algorithm, which may be implemented with embedded logic or software. The priorities of the profiles may also be updated via profile provisioning manager . Manager  may determine operating rules for wireless device  based on the applicable profile(s) and further in accordance with an algorithm. The operating rules may be used to select radios, to map active applications to the selected radios, etc. The profile database and the algorithms for managing and\/or using the profiles may be updated by external entities, which may or may not be the same entities that can create and update the profiles.","Profile database  may store profiles that can control the operation of wireless device  and may be maintained within wireless device , as shown in . Profile database  may also be mirrored and stored on an external entity such as a service server. Storing the profile database externally may provide certain benefits. For example, the externally stored profile database may enable backup, may allow for modification by the user and\/or an external entity via Internet access (such as from a fixed or mobile device, or from a management entity), and may allow for sharing among a defined user community.","The profiles may control connectivity for applications and services, as described above. The profiles may also control other features. For example, the profiles may be used to control push services update, e.g., to determine when applications or services should be downloaded onto wireless device . The profiles may also be used to control power consumption, e.g., to determine how power management should be performed within wireless device .","Wireless device  may have capability to communicate (e.g., via a wired or wireless link) with an external entity to establish a new kind of connectivity and options. However, if no or insufficient communication with the external entity is available, then wireless device  may operate based on (i) existing information within the wireless device, which may be provided by the OEM or seller of the wireless device, or (ii) the last sufficient communication with the external entity, which may be the network operator, a business entity, etc.","4. Auxiliary Services","As noted above, a collection of auxiliary services may be offered by the network operator and\/or other business entities and may be downloaded onto wireless device . Each auxiliary service may be associated with a service server on the network side and a service client on wireless device . The service client may communicate with the service server in order to obtain the associated auxiliary service. Wireless device  may have any number of service clients for any number of auxiliary services. Each service client on wireless device  may be executed (e.g., in accordance with the services profile) to obtain the associated auxiliary service. Various auxiliary services may be supported, and some examples are described below.","An exemplary auxiliary service may be for Wi-Fi hotspot identification with authentication. The auxiliary service may download onto wireless device  a list of Wi-Fi hotspots and authentication credentials. The download may be triggered based on the location of wireless device , the time of day, user request, etc. The service client may receive and process the downloaded information and may establish a specific connection based on the downloaded information. The service client and the service server may jointly maintain various parameters associated with the connection, such as billing, type of transactions, issues with the connection (e.g., number of tries needed to connect), etc.","Another exemplary auxiliary service may be for connectivity auction client. Airtime on cellular networks may be sold or auctioned in small time increments to users. A connectivity auction service may be able to find the cheapest and\/or best connectivity method, e.g., on a 3GPP cellular network, a 3GPP2 cellular network, or WLAN. Wireless device  may download the connectivity auction service and may invoke the service, as necessary, to obtain the cheapest and\/or best connectivity. For example, wireless device  may run this service when roaming, or when the user requests a communication service that is not offered by the network operator, etc.","In one design, a service client may communicate with an associated service server for a particular auxiliary service. In another design, a service client may communicate with multiple service servers to obtain connectivity information for different wireless networks. The service client may aggregate the connectivity information received from all service servers and may determine one or more wireless networks to access based on the aggregated connectivity information.","The service servers for the auxiliary services may reside in one or more networks. The service servers may provide functionality to assist connection manager  to provide connectivity for wireless device .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0093","num":"0102"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":"240"},"Connection manager  may receive one or more connection requests from the K active applications and the S active service clients. Connection manager  may determine that P profiles are applicable among the Q total profiles, where P and Q may be any values. Connection manager  may also receive information indicative of the operating state, the available resources, and\/or the location of wireless device . Connection manager  may determine operating rules based on the P selected profiles and the received information for wireless device .","Connection manager  may determine that N radios are available for use among the R total radios, where N>1. Connection manager  may select M of the N available radios to provide connectivity for the K active applications and the S active service clients, where M\u22671. Connection manager  may then map the K active applications and the S active service clients to the M selected radios based on the operating rules. In the example shown in , one active application and one active service client may be mapped to one selected radio, another active application and another active service client may be mapped to another selected radio, and yet another active application and two active service clients may be mapped to the last selected radios based on the operating rules. Each active service client may communicate with its associated service server. Each active application may communicate with any entity to obtain the desired communication service. In , the dashed lines indicate the flow of the auxiliary services (service clients and service servers), whereas the solid lines indicate the flow of the active applications. The endpoints for both auxiliary services and applications are shown in the \u2018cloud\u2019, which may be the Internet.","The active applications and\/or the active service clients may change. Furthermore, one or more selected radios may no longer be available (e.g., due to mobility) and\/or other radios may become available or may be more preferred. Connection manager  may update the selected radios, as needed, due to changes in the active applications, the active service clients, the available radios, the applicable profiles, the device operating state, the available resources, and\/or other factors.","5. Operating Pillars","Wireless device  may obtain connectivity via one or more of the following:\n\n","In general, wireless device  may include radios, drivers, protocol stacks, middleware, applications, reference hardware, etc. Connection manager  may unite the radios to provide improved communication services while hiding complexity from the user. Connection manager  may provide intelligent management of the radios, perform system selection, handle connection continuity and\/or handoff, control configuration of options, etc. Connection manager  may also support peer-to-peer applications and auxiliary services. The auxiliary services may allow for provisioning of wireless device  from a network server for network management and services management.","For basic connectivity, connection manager  may support system selection, handoff between different wireless networks, and radio on\/off management. For system selection, connection manager  may select the best available wireless networks based on applicable profiles. System selection may enable the active applications to have the best connectivity using the radios that best suit the communication needs of the user, whether the user is at home, at work, in public, etc. For handoff, connection manager  may handle handoff from cellular networks to WLAN (e.g., based on the profiles) for voice, data, etc. Connection manager  may also handle handoff from cellular networks to cellular networks for voice, data, etc. Connection manager  may also ensure service continuity in an active mode (with applications running) when switching between different domains, e.g., circuit-switched and packet-switched domains. Connection manager  may also perform system reselection in an idle mode (with no applications running) and may perform registration, association, and authentication, as needed. Connection manager  may also perform system selection and\/or acquisition for system loss. For radio on\/off management, connection manager  may turn radios on or off intelligently to save battery power while providing the desired performance.","For extended connectivity, connection manager  may support peer-to-peer communication, which may be defined as communication between wireless devices with or without infrastructure equipment. Some examples of infrastructure-less peer-to-peer communication may include Infrared Data Association (IrDA) and Bluetooth. Some examples of infrastructure-based peer-to-peer communication include WLAN (via an access point) and cellular (via network entities). A service server may serve as an intermediary for peer-to-peer connectivity.","Connection manager  may also support extended reachability (or extended peer-to-peer) for direct communication with wireless devices beyond the local link. Extended reachability may enable device-to-device communication across wireless networks and sub-networks, and applications may be unaware of intermediate nodes in the networks. For example, wireless device  may communicate with a device in the user's home for remote PC control and may be able to reach this device beyond a WLAN Access Point with Network Address Translation (AP\/NAT\/firewall). Connection manager  may also support peer-to-multi-peer or multi-peer-to-multi-peer communication. The algorithms to enable extended reachability may be provided via service clients in connection manager , and the services clients may communicate with service servers for provisioning and maintenance. An exemplary protocol is Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE), which specifics a methodology to carry out communications across networks.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0103","num":"0115"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["110","110","112","100","102","114","112","110","240","110","112","112","240","112","110","112"]},"Wireless device  may function more than a wireless gateway that simply bridges incoming communications to outgoing communications. In particular, wireless device  may be a multi-radio device with both incoming and outgoing traffic flows. Wireless device  may support multiple radios (e.g., for WCDMA, EVDO, LTE, WLAN, etc.) and may route incoming communications to one of several possible cellular networks such as a WCDMA network, an EVDO network, an LTE network, etc. Wireless device  may also be capable of running its own applications, possibly while supporting the pass-through connection from wireless device . Wireless device  may thus be more than a simple wireless gateway and may have capabilities similar to those of wireless device .","Wireless network  may be a serving network for wireless device . Wireless network  may be a home network for wireless device . Wireless device  may communicate with wireless network  via wireless device , e.g., for communication with wireless device  or some other entity. Wireless device  may also communicate with wireless network  via wireless device , e.g., to download configuration information such as profiles, a PRL, a preferred PLMN list, etc.","For auxiliary services, wireless device  may be provisioned with auxiliary services by service servers via wireless and\/or wireline. The auxiliary services may support end-to-end network management, services\/subscriber management, push software updates\/applications, etc.","The embedded connection manager described herein may provide various advantages. The connection manager may provide increased chipset functionality, which may allow for a more competitive OEM offering and quicker time to market. The connection manager may support profile-driven connectivity, e.g., system selection based on rules for applications, available resources, handoff, etc. The profiles may be field updateable, self-learning, and\/or shareable. The profiles may simplify development of applications related to the connection manager, since a profile may be changed instead of rewriting an application. The profiles may also enable operator connection management services for dynamic profile maintenance and control.","The connection manager may support both open and cellular-controlled WLAN access types. The connection manager may enable future cell\/cell system selection and handoffs. The connection manager may provide improved performance due to algorithms and tighter radio control, including cell-cell operation and coexistence. This may result in (i) improved system selection (e.g., including more choices via multi cellular options), (ii) improved cell\/WLAN handoffs, (iii) a common connection manager platform for advanced capabilities and services, and (iv) support for extended reachability and future extended personal area network (PAN) and peer-to-peer communication.","For clarity, connection manager  capable of controlling multiple radios  in wireless device  has been described above. A connection manager may also be used for a wired device, which may support wired communication via different wired radio technologies. For example, the wired device may include a telephone or DSL modem for communication via a telephone line, a cable modem for communication via cable, etc. The wired radios in wired device may be controlled in similar manner as the wireless radios in wireless device .
