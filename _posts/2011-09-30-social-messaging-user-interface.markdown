{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 12\/914,773, filed Oct. 28, 2010, entitled \u201cSocial Messaging User Interface,\u201d which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61\/255,847, filed on Oct. 28, 2009, entitled \u201cSearch, Navigation, and Docking with a Mobile Computing Device,\u201d the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.","This specification relates to a hub for social interaction via electronic devices.","It has been said that \u201cno man is an island.\u201d Perhaps unsurprisingly, humans have developed electronic devices and mechanisms that promote social interaction by facilitating the exchange of messages, photos, media, and other information between individuals. For example, mobile phones allow users to speak with one another without being tied to a fixed landline. Electronic mail and text messages are delivered nearly instantaneously. Photo sharing websites host photos posted by individuals for their friends and associates to view. Social networks such as FACEBOOK and MYSPACE allow large groups to remain in contact. Message boards allow communities with common interests to share information and discuss relevant issues. Blogs and other pages allow people to comment on content and converse with even unknown individuals.","This specification describes a hub and corresponding user interface for the social interaction that occurs via electronic devices and mechanisms. The hub can be a center where information regarding different social interaction mechanisms is gathered and organized. The hub can allow a user to integrate those social interaction mechanisms by providing an overview of the different mechanisms and allowing users to facilely transition between different mechanisms.","In one aspect, a data processing device includes a display screen displaying a social interaction hub, the social interaction hub including a collection of records. Each record includes a counterparty identifier identifying a counterparty of a past social interaction event, a mode indicium identifying a mode by which the past social interaction event with the counterparty occurred, and a collection of mode indicia each identifying a mode by which a future, outgoing social interaction event with the counterparty can occur. The counterparty identifier, the mode indicium, and the collection of mode indicia are associated with one another in the records of the social interaction hub.","This and other aspects can include one or more of the following features. The collection of mode indicia can be limited to modes of social interaction that are available for social interaction with the counterparty. At least one of the records can include an availability indicator labeling a first mode indicium in the collection of mode indicia. The availability indicator can indicate that the counterparty is presently available for social interaction via the mode identified by the first mode indicium. The first mode indicium can identify an electronic messaging mode. Each record can also include an interactive graphical element that triggers display of the collection of mode indicia in response to user interaction. Each record can also include a description of a subject of the past social interaction event. For example, a first description of the subject of a first past social interaction event can include a subject line of an electronic mail or text message. A second description of the subject of a second past social interaction event can include an excerpt of a posting on a social network. The mode indicia can identify both direct social interaction modes in which information can be exchanged directly with the counterparty and modes mediated by a social network server. At least some the mode indicia in the collection can be variants of the mode indicium identifying the mode by which the past social interaction event occurred. The social interaction hub can include information describing a disposition of the currently displayed social interaction records within a larger collection of social interaction records and an interactive graphical element that triggers display of additional social interaction records within the larger collection in response to user interaction.","In another aspect, a data processing device includes a display screen displaying a social interaction hub. The social interaction hub includes a collection of records each characterizing a past social interaction event. The characterized social interaction events including direct social interaction events in which users have exchanged information directly with one another and a social interaction event mediated by a social network server.

The first entity can include a social network server. The first interface module can be configured to excerpt a post by the at least one of the potential counterparties available on the social network server. The display screen can be a touch screen. The first and second graphical elements can be interactive elements displayed on the touch screen. The one or more data processors can be programmed to detect user interaction with a selected one of the first and second graphical elements and trigger the outgoing social interaction indicated by the selected one of the first and second graphical elements in response to the user interaction. A social interaction hub displayed on the display screen can include the graphical elements indicating that outgoing social interaction mediated by the first and second entity is available.

The account information including a first record characterizing a first representation of a first of the potential counterparties at a first account provided by a first entity that mediates social interaction and a second record characterizing a second representation of the first of the potential counterparties at a second account provided by a second entity that mediates social interaction. The first and second records characterizing the first and second representations each includes data drawn from the respective of the first and second entities and are dispersed among other records characterizing other representations of others of the potential counterparties. The one or more data processors are programmed to access the database of integrated contact information and identify the first and second records using the identifier of the at least one potential counterparty and display, at the same time on the display screen, a first graphical element indicating that outgoing social interaction mediated by the first entity is available and a second graphical element indicating that outgoing social interaction mediated by the second entity is available.","This and other aspects can include one or more of the following features. The database can include an row in a data table comprising an identifier of the category of the first account, wherein the identifier is selected from the group consisting of an identifier of a social network account and an identifier of a photo sharing network account. The data processors can also programmed to implement a first interface module for interfacing with the first entity to obtain information characterizing the first of the potential counterparties from the first entity and a second interface module for interfacing with the second entity to obtain information characterizing the first of the potential counterparties from the second entity. The first entity can be a social network server. The first interface module can be configured to excerpt a post by the at least one of the potential counterparties available on the social network server. The display screen can be a touch screen. The first and second graphical elements can be interactive elements displayed on the touch screen. The one or more data processors can be programmed to detect user interaction with a selected one of the first and second graphical elements and trigger the outgoing social interaction indicated by the selected one of the first and second graphical elements in response to the user interaction. A social interaction hub displayed on the display screen can include the graphical elements indicating that outgoing social interaction mediated by the first and second entity is available. The data processing device can be a handheld device that comprises a phone interface.","In another aspect, a data processing device includes a display screen, one more data storage devices, and one or more data processors. The one more data storage devices storing account information including a first record characterizing a first representation of an individual at a first account at a first entity that mediates social interaction, first status update information characterizing a first status update drawn from the first account, the first status update information including a characterization of the updated first status and a characterization of the time when first status was updated, a second record characterizing a second representation of the individual at a second account at a second entity that mediates social interaction, and second status update information characterizing a second status update drawn from the second account, the second status update information including a characterization of the updated second status and a characterization of the time when the second status was updated. The one or more data processors are programmed to access the first and second representations of the individual and identify the characterizations of the times when the first and the second status were updated, compare the times when the first and the second status were updated to determine the more recent of the first and the second status updates, and display, on the display screen, the more recent of the first and the second status updates based on the comparison of the times when the first and the second status were updated.","This and other aspects can include one or more of the following features. The first record can be an row in a data table comprising an identifier of the category of the first account, wherein the identifier is selected from the group consisting of an identifier of a social network account and an identifier of a photo sharing network account. The one or more data processors can be programmed to display the more recent status update in a social status record that comprises an identifier of the individual and a collection of indicia that identify modes by which a future outgoing social interaction event with the individual can occur. The social status record can include a location description that describes either the present location of the individual, an availability indicator that indicates that the individual is presently available for social interaction via one of the modes, or both. The first and second status update information can be found in respective first and second status update records. The first and second records can be instantiated as first and second rows in a first data table. The first and second status update information is found in two different rows of a second data table. The rows of the second data table can each reference a respective one of the first and second rows in the first data table. The one or more data processors can be programmed to display the more recent status update on a display screen in a social interaction record that includes a visual indicium characterizing a social interaction event with the individual that has already occurred. The social interaction record can include one or more visual indicia representing multiple modes by which a future, outgoing social interaction events with the individual can occur. The display screen can be a touch screen. The visual indicia representing multiple modes can be interactive elements displayed on the touch screen. The one or more data processors can be programmed to detect user interaction with a selected one of the visual indicia representing multiple modes and trigger the outgoing social interaction represented by the selected one of the visual indicia in response to the user interaction.","These and other aspects can, in certain of the implementations described herein, provide the following advantages. An application may provide access to communication with a user's acquaintances through a variety of communication modes, including by social networking sites. A user's contact list may be displayed on a mobile device in alphabetical order. When the user presses an image of an acquaintance, a control bar can be generated that shows each of the mechanisms by which the acquaintance can be communicated with. The user of the device may then select an icon for one of the modes to begin communicating immediately via that mode. For example, pressing the telephone icon can cause the acquaintance's telephone number to be dialed, while pressing a social networking icon can cause a text box to be presented so that one can write on the other user's wall.","Other manipulation of the input control can cause recent communications by the particular mode of communication to be displayed. For example, long pressing on a social networking icon can cause the last five posts to the acquaintances wall to be display for the user.","The interface may also be genericized, so that any image of acquaintances can be an object that exhibits the behavior shown here. Thus, for example, whenever a user sees a photo of an acquaintance, the user will know that he or she can quickly access modes of communicating with that acquaintance.","Data for such an application may be provided via a standard and public API. For example, when a user makes the interactions described above, the user's device may make requests to data sources internal to the device (e.g., contact information) and to services outside the device (e.g., social networks), which may then return information according to the pre-determined requests. Such services may also authenticate a user before providing the user with certain forms of information.","The details of one or more implementations of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.","Like reference numbers and designations in the various drawings indicate like elements.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","105","105","105"]},"In the illustrated implementation of system , mobile device  includes two wireless data communication components, namely, a mobile phone transceiver and a WiFi transceiver. The mobile phone transceiver is able to exchange messages  with a phone base station . The WiFi transceiver is able to exchange messages  with a WiFi access point  and messages  with a peer mobile device  that also includes a WiFi transceiver. Peer mobile device  is associated with another individual user.","Phone base station  and WiFi access point  are connected for data communication with one or more data communication networks  via data links ,  and can exchange information with social interaction servers , , , . In some implementations, peer mobile device  may also be able to exchange messages  with WiFi access point  (or another WiFi access point) for data communication with data communication networks  and access to social interaction servers , , , . One or more additional mobile devices , which are associated with one or more other individual users, may also be able to exchange messages  with phone base station  (or another base station) for data communication with data communication networks  and access to social interaction servers , , , . One or more personal computing devices , which are associated with one or more other individual users, may also be connected for data communication with one or more data communication networks  via a data link  for access to social interaction servers , , , .","System  supports both direct and server-mediated social interaction by the users with whom device , , ,  are associated. Direct social interaction allows users to send messages, photos, or other media directly to one another. For example, the user with whom device  is associated can telephone the user with whom device  is associated. These user can talk to one another directly, without intermediation by a server. As another example of direct social interaction, the user with whom device  is associated can establish a peer-to-peer wireless link with the user with whom device  is associated. These users can, e.g., text one another or send photos to one another.","Server-mediated social interaction allows users to exchange messages, photos, or other media with a server data processing device mediating the exchange. The illustrated implementation of system  includes four different examples of servers that can mediate such social interaction, namely, an electronic mail server , a social network server , a text message server , and a photo server . Each of social interaction servers , , ,  includes one or more data processors that are programmed to perform data processing activities that mediate social interaction. For example, electronic mail server  is programmed to allow a user to access electronic mail from an electronic mail client. Social network server  is programmed to allow users to access a social network where messages, photos, and\/or other media are exchanged. For examples, social network server  can support social networks such as FACEBOOK\u2122, MYSPACE\u2122, YAHOO! 360\u2122, LINKEDIN\u2122, ESSEMBLY\u2122, ORKUT\u2122, FRIENDSTER\u2122, and others.","Text message server  is programmed to allow a user to exchange text messages with other users. Photo server  is programmed to allow a user to access a collection of one or more photographs posted to photo server  by other individuals. In some implementations, photo server  may restrict a user to accessing photographs posted by other individuals who have somehow approved the user's access.","For each user with whom a device , , ,  is associated, social interaction events provided by system  can be classified as either \u201coutgoing\u201d or \u201cincoming.\u201d In the context of a user with whom device  is associated, outgoing social interaction events include, e.g., outgoing phone calls and text messages, e-mail messages sent to other users, photographs posted to photo server , comments posted on a social network hosted by social network server , posts to message boards, comments on blog or other pages, and the like. In the context of a user with whom device , , ,  is associated, incoming social interaction events include, e.g., incoming phone calls and text messages, e-mail messages received from other users, comments posted by other users on photographs posted to photo server , comments posted on the user's page in a social network hosted by social network server , responses to that users posts to message boards or blog or other comments, and the like.","In addition to one or more wireless or wired data communication components, mobile device  can also include a display screen  and one or more input devices . In some implementations, display screen  can act as both an input and an output. For example, display screen  can be a touch screen that both displays graphical elements on a screen and detects the presence and location of interaction with the screen. Input devices  can include one or more, e.g., key, pad, trackball, or other component that receives mechanical, audio, or other input from a user. In some implementations, mobile device  can include additional components such as a GPS unit, accelerometers, a digital camera, audio jacks, and the like.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","105","200","195","205","210","215","220","205","210","215","220"]},"In the illustrated implementation, social interaction records , , ,  are arranged chronologically, e.g., in the vertically downward direction in the order in which they occurred regardless of the nature of the social interaction that they characterize. Thus, in the illustrated implementation, the outgoing telephone call event characterized in social interaction record  occurred before the electronic mail event characterized in social interaction record . In turn, the events characterized in both records ,  occurred before the social network event characterized in social interaction record , which in turn occurred before the social network event characterized in social interaction record . In other implementations, social interaction records , , ,  are arranged in accordance with one or more other parameters. For example, social interaction records , , ,  can be arranged alphabetically or by the mode of the past social interaction event.","Each social interaction record , , ,  includes an indicium  identifying the counterparty involved in a past social interaction event, an indicium  identifying the category of that past social interaction event, and a collection  of indicia identifying modes by which future, outgoing social interaction events can occur. Counterparty indicium  can be one or more of text (e.g., a person's name), a photo, a glyph, a telephone number, or other symbol identifying the involved counterparty. For example, in the illustrated implementation, counterparty indicium  in record  identifies that \u201cPeter Rabbit\u201d was the counterparty in the social interaction event characterized by record  whereas counterparty indicium  in record  identifies that \u201cPeter Piper\u201d was the counterparty in the social interaction event characterized by record .","Each category indicium  can be one or more of text, a photo, a glyph, or other symbol that identifies the mode of the past social interaction event. For example, in the illustrated implementation, category indicium  in record  identifies that the social interaction event characterized by record  was a telephone call. Category indicium  in record  identifies that the social interaction event characterized by record  was an electronic mail event. Category indicia  in records ,  identify that the social interaction events characterized by records ,  were postings on a social network. In some implementations, category indicia  identifying that social interaction events as postings on a social network can include, e.g., a logo or other identifier of the social network, as described further below.","In some implementations, social commerce interaction events can be identified by category indicia . Social commerce interaction events are commercial offers, or information about commercial offers, that are distributed directly from peer-to-peer rather than through, e.g., mass media. One example of a social commerce interaction event is a printable coupon or discount link that is forwarded from one individual to another. Another example of social commerce interaction event are events that are tailored for commerce that relies on near field communication for, e.g., mobile ticketing, mobile payment, and the like. Commercial offers, or information about commercial offers, that are recognized by near field communication devices can be exchanged between individuals. Such exchanges can be can be identified by category indicia  in social interaction hub .","In some implementations, social interaction hub  can be limited to records that characterize either incoming or outgoing past social interaction events. In other implementations, social interaction hub  can include records that characterize both incoming and outgoing social interaction events. In some implementations, the records can be limited to characterizing either incoming or outgoing social interaction events for some modes of social interaction but characterize both incoming and outgoing social interaction events for other modes of social interaction. For example, in some implementations, social interaction hub  can include records characterizing both incoming and outgoing telephone calls but only outgoing postings on a social network or outgoing electronic mail. This approach can help limit the characterization of social interaction events that occur very frequently, such as postings by others on a social network.","In some implementations, category indicia  can identify whether the past social interaction event was an incoming event or an outgoing event. For example, category indicium  in record  includes an arrow symbol  indicating that the past social interaction event characterized by record  was an outgoing telephone call rather than an incoming telephone call. Category indicia  can identify whether the past social interaction event was an incoming event or an outgoing event in a variety of way, including color, highlights, and other graphical devices.","In some implementations, social interaction hub  can exclude certain categories of social interaction events altogether. For example, social interaction hub  can exclude all text messages from characterization by a social interaction records. In other implementations, social interaction hub  can use a single record to characterize a group or a collection of events of the same category. For example, a chain of related electronic mail correspondence or a series of text messages exchanged with the same counterparty or counterparties can be characterized in a single record in social interaction hub .","In some implementations, social interaction hub  can be limited to social interaction events involving specified counterparties. For example, social interaction hub  can be limited to social interaction events involving a defined group of contacts, such as a user's social contacts.","Indicia collection  can include text, photos, glyphs, or other symbols that identify modes by which a future outgoing social interaction event can occur. The modes identified in each indicia collection  can be limited to the modes which are available for social interaction with the same counterparty identified by the person indicium  of that record. For example, indicia collection  in record  only identifies two modes which are available for social interaction with the counterparty \u201cPeter Piper\u201d identified by counterparty indicium  in that same record. As another example, indicia collection  in record  identifies five modes which are available for social interaction with the counterparty \u201cPeter Rabbit\u201d identified by counterparty indicium  in that same record. If a mode of interaction is not available for the counterparty identified by the person indicium , a mode indicium for that mode of interaction can be omitted.","In general, the indicia in indicia collection  are also interactive elements that allow a user to trigger social interaction with the counterparty identified by the person indicium  of that record via the identified mode. For example, a mobile device  can present graphical elements tailored for social interaction via the mode identified by an indicium or attempt to establish social interaction via the mode identified by an indicium in response to user interaction with that indicium.","Five different example mode indicia , , , ,  are shown in the illustrated implementation. Each mode indicium , , , ,  can identify a different mechanism by which users can interact socially. For example, in the illustrated implementation, the presence of mode indicium  in a collection  identifies that text messages are available for social interaction with the counterparty identified in that record. Mobile device  can, e.g., present a text entry screen or other modality for entering text messages in response to user interaction with mode indicium .","The presence of mode indicium  in a collection  identifies that a photosharing network is available for social interaction with the counterparty identified in that record. Mobile device  can, e.g., navigate to a website of the photosharing network in response to user interaction with mode indicium .","The presence of mode indicium  in a collection  identifies that the counterparty identified in that record can be telephoned. Mobile device  can, e.g., place a telephone call to a counterparty in response to user interaction with mode .","The presence of mode indicium  in a collection  identifies that the counterparty identified in that record can be electronically mailed. Mobile device  can, e.g., present a text entry screen or other modality for entering electronic mail messages in response to user interaction with mode indicium .","The presence of mode indicium  in a collection  identifies that a social network is available for social interaction with the counterparty identified in that record. Mobile device  can, e.g., navigate to a website of the photosharing network in response to user interaction with mode indicium .","In some implementations, the symbols used in mode indicia , , , ,  can closely resemble the symbols used as category indicium . For example, mode indicia , , , ,  can be identical to or resized and\/or differently colored variants of various category indicia . Thus, in some implementations, mode indicia , , , ,  identifying that a social network is available for social interaction can include, e.g., a logo or other identifier of the social network.","In the illustrated implementation, indicia collection  includes only one mode indicium for each category of social interaction. This is not necessarily the case. For example, mode indicia that identify different social networks which are available for social interaction with the same counterparty can be included in a single indicia collection . As another example, mode indicia that identify different telephone numbers which are available for social interaction with the same counterparty can be included in a single indicia collection .","As shown, unlike a call log on a cellular phone, the records in social interaction hub  are not constrained to characterizing only one or a limited number of different modes of social interaction. Instead, the records in social interaction hub  can characterize multiple modes of social interaction, including social network interaction. Further, the records in social interaction hub  are not constrained to characterizing social interaction that is implemented by a single data communication component. For example, in the context of mobile device  of system , social interaction hub  can characterize events that are implemented using a mobile phone transceiver and events that are implemented using a WiFi transceiver. The events characterized in a single social interaction hub  can be both direct social interaction events and server-mediated social interaction events.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","105","240","245","250","255","260","235","305","305","225","305","260","305","240"]},"Availability indicators  can label a mode indicium in a variety of ways.

For example, different numbers of different kinds of accounts can be associated with each contact. The account information is stored in data structures that can accommodate not only a variety of different types of accounts but also new types of accounts as they are developed by different entities that mediate social interaction. In some implementations, information characterizing the accounts can be stored in a single data table, with records characterizing different kinds of accounts interspersed among each other.","A single most recent status update can be stored for each different kind of account, along with information identifying the time when status was last updated by the contact at the corresponding account. In some implementations, the timestamps when status was last updated at the different accounts is used to select one of the status updates for display as the most current status update, e.g., in a social status record  ().","Information drawn from a variety of different entities that mediate social interaction can be stored in a single location and integrated for use in presenting one or more of social interaction hubs , , , , ,  () or a social interaction hub that is limited to social status records on a mobile device .","Further, access to the information in database schema  is facilitated by database schema .

Examples of communication networks include a local area network (\u201cLAN\u201d) and a wide area network (\u201cWAN\u201d), an inter-network (e.g., the Internet), and peer-to-peer networks (e.g., ad hoc peer-to-peer networks).","The computing system can include clients and servers. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other. In some embodiments, a server transmits data (e.g., an HTML page) to a client device (e.g., for purposes of displaying data to and receiving user input from a user interacting with the client device). Data generated at the client device (e.g., a result of the user interaction) can be received from the client device at the server.","While this specification contains many specific implementation details, these should not be construed as limitations on the scope of any inventions or of what may be claimed, but rather as descriptions of features specific to particular embodiments of particular inventions. Certain features that are described in this specification in the context of separate embodiments can also be implemented in combination in a single embodiment. Conversely, various features that are described in the context of a single embodiment can also be implemented in multiple embodiments separately or in any suitable subcombination. Moreover, although features may be described above as acting in certain combinations and even initially claimed as such, one or more features from a claimed combination can in some cases be excised from the combination, and the claimed combination may be directed to a subcombination or variation of a subcombination.","Similarly, while operations are depicted in the drawings in a particular order, this should not be understood as requiring that such operations be performed in the particular order shown or in sequential order, or that all illustrated operations be performed, to achieve desirable results. In certain circumstances, multitasking and parallel processing may be advantageous. Moreover, the separation of various system components in the embodiments described above should not be understood as requiring such separation in all embodiments, and it should be understood that the described program components and systems can generally be integrated together in a single software product or packaged into multiple software products.","Thus, particular implementations have been described. Other implementations are within the scope of the following claims. In some cases, the actions recited in the claims can be performed in a different order and still achieve desirable results. In addition, the processes depicted in the accompanying figures do not necessarily require the particular order shown, or sequential order, to achieve desirable results. In certain implementations, multitasking and parallel processing may be advantageous."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIGS. 2-8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIGS. 10, 11, and 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 14"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
