title: Business information warehouse toolkit and language for warehousing simplification and automation
abstract: A method for use with an information (or data) warehouse comprises managing the information warehouse with instructions in a declarative language. The instructions specify information warehouse-level tasks to be done without specifying certain details of how the tasks are to be implemented, for example, using databases and text indexers. The details are hidden from the user and include, for example, in an information warehouse having a FACT table that joins two or more dimension tables, details of database level operations when structured data are being handled, including database command line utilities, database drivers, and structured query language (SQL) statements; and details of text-indexing engines when unstructured data are being handled. The information warehouse is managed in a dynamic way in which different tasks—such as data loading tasks and information warehouse construction tasks—may be interleaved (i.e., there is no particular order in which the different tasks must be completed).

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION","EXAMPLE 1","EXAMPLE 2","EXAMPLE 3","EXAMPLE 4"],"p":["The present invention relates generally to the field of information storage and retrieval and, more particularly, to automating and simplifying information warehouse management system tasks using a high-level declarative information warehousing language and runtime system components to make system operational details transparent to the user.","Rapidly leveraging information analytics technologies (e.g., to mine the mounting information in structured and unstructured forms, derive business insights and improve decision making) is becoming increasingly critical to today's business success. One of the key enablers of new information analytics technologies will be an information warehouse management system (IWMS) that processes different types and forms of information, as well as builds and maintains the information warehouse (IW) effectively. Although traditional multi-dimensional data warehousing techniques, coupled with the well-known extract, transform, and load (ETL) processes, may meet some of the requirements in an IWMS, they generally lack adequacy in several major respects: 1) they often lack comprehensive support for both structured and unstructured data processing; 2) they usually are database-centric and require detailed database and warehouse knowledge to perform IWMS tasks, and hence are tedious and time-consuming to operate and learn; 3) they are often inflexible and insufficient in coping with a wide variety of on-going IW maintenance tasks\u2014such as adding new dimensions and handling regular and lengthy data updates with potential failures and errors.","Although data warehousing techniques\u2014such as multi-dimensional data warehouse models and ETL processing\u2014have been widely practiced in industry, they are increasingly inadequate in their functionalities due to major changes in today's information dynamics, where there is a need for comprehensive support for structured and unstructured data, simple and high-level IW operations, and on-going IW maintenance operations.","Existing data warehousing techniques are mainly designed to handle structured data. However, a large fraction of business enterprise data is in unstructured data formats, e.g., call center problem tickets and customer complaints. Because it is vital for an IWMS to support both structured and unstructured types of data, there is a need for comprehensive support for structured and unstructured data.","The prominent and rapid adoption of information analytics technologies\u2014such as text mining and business intelligence (BI) tools\u2014mandates simple and efficient IWMS systems that can quickly process various information sources and build information warehouses. Current data warehouse systems, however, are typically hard to use and require detailed database and data warehouse knowledge. Even with skilled staff, building data warehouses often takes multi-person weeks and months to complete. With the need to support unstructured data, knowledge and skills about full-text indexers and search engines have become necessary. It is often unrealistic to assume the existence of such knowledge and skills in the business world. For instance, organizations that want to use BI and text mining tools may not have strong database administrators (DBAs) for handling complex ETL processing. Thus, there is a need for IWMS that provide simple and high-level IW operations.","Currently existing ETL solutions for information warehouse management generally focus on the single aspect of building the information warehouse. It is often assumed that once the information warehouse is fully constructed and the data are completely loaded from the given set of data sources, the project is completed. In other words, no subsequent modifications to the data warehouse will be needed. In practice, however, information is constantly changing. It is common for users to frequently adjust the information warehouses by adding new dimensions to an existing IW or modifying and loading new data on a regular basis. All such operations must ensure the overall IW integrity and consistency. Furthermore, due to the on-going data updating and loading, it becomes extremely important for the IWMS system to cope with various forms of system failures and potential error conditions. Current IWMS generally have little or no support for fast failure recovery, error correction, or on-going IW schema changes. The common practice is to simply rebuild the data warehouses from scratch each time that changes are required or to perform lengthy and error-prone manual IW operations. Thus, there is a need for an IWMS that provides on-going IW maintenance operations.","As can be seen, there is a need for information warehouse management systems that provide comprehensive support for structured and unstructured data; simple and high-level warehouse operations; and on-going IW maintenance operations.","In one embodiment of the present invention, a method for information warehouse construction comprises providing a language specification for information warehouse construction, the language specification having information warehouse (IW) level commands and dimension level commands; and constructing an information warehouse based on a script comprising at least one of the IW level commands and the dimension level commands according to the language specification for information warehouse construction.","In another embodiment of the present invention, a method for data loading in an information warehouse comprises providing a language specification for data loading in an information warehouse, the language specification having source mapping commands and data loading commands; and loading data into an information warehouse based on a script comprising at least one of the source mapping commands and data loading commands according to the language specification for data loading.","In yet another embodiment of the present invention, a method for data maintenance of an information warehouse comprises providing a language specification for information warehouse (IW) maintenance in an information warehouse, the language specification having failure recovery commands and error correction commands; and performing an IW maintenance operation on the information warehouse based on a script comprising at least one of the failure recovery commands and error correction commands according to the language specification for IW maintenance.","In still another embodiment of the present invention, an information warehouse system comprises a front-end graphical user interface that accepts inputs from a user and generates commands in a declarative information warehouse language; an information warehouse language processor that receives the commands from the user interface and provides system level, database level, and indexing engine level commands for performing tasks specified by the commands from the interface; and a warehouse builder that receives the system level, database level, and indexing engine level commands from the information warehouse language processor and performs tasks specified by the system level, database level, and indexing engine level commands to build an information warehouse according to the commands from the user interface, the system level, database level, and indexing engine level commands being hidden from the user.","In still another embodiment of the present invention, a computer program product for use with an information warehouse comprises a computer useable medium including a computer readable program, in which the computer readable program when executed on a computer causes the computer to accept commands of a declarative information warehouse language provided by a script; parse the commands from the script; generate data description language commands from the parsed commands; and execute the data description language commands to construct an information warehouse.","In a further embodiment of the present invention, a computer program product for use with an information warehouse comprises a computer useable medium including a computer readable program, in which the computer readable program when executed on a computer causes the computer to accept commands of a declarative information warehouse language provided by a script; parse the commands from the script; extract desired data from a source file according to the parsed commands; transform the extracted data into a target format according to the parsed commands; and load the transformed data into information warehouse tables and file system locations according to the parsed commands.","These and other features, aspects, and advantages of the present invention will become better understood with reference to the following drawings, description, and claims.","The following detailed description is of the best currently contemplated modes of carrying out the invention. The description is not to be taken in a limiting sense, but is made merely for the purpose of illustrating the general principles of the invention, since the scope of the invention is best defined by the appended claims.","Broadly, embodiments of the present invention provide systems and methods for information warehouse (IW) users without SQL (sequential query language) and database expertise to perform IW tasks without significant training. Embodiments of the present invention may provide information warehouse management systems (IWMS) that 1) support high-level operations for users to specify what they want to do, 2) automatically figures out the details of how to do what the user specifies, and 3) handles the IW operations accordingly. IWMS in accordance with embodiments of the present invention may improve system usability, robustness and performance for businesses that increasingly rely on vast amounts of information. Data warehousing may be considered an essential step towards exploring, understanding and analyzing business information for better and faster decision making. Embodiments of the present invention may be useful to commercial enterprises that build and maintain increasingly large information warehouses to enable advanced information analytics and to improve the \u201cbusiness value\u201d of information.","Embodiments of the present invention may provide novel information warehouse management systems that provide support for both structured and unstructured types of data, in contrast to prior art systems\u2014such as traditional multi-dimensional data warehouses that are mainly designed for on-line analytical processing (OLAP) applications of structured data alone and whose main focus is warehouse schema design and data mining operations for structured data. Embodiments of the present invention, by way of contrast, may support both text mining as well as BI applications and integrate both structured and unstructured data in each.","Prior art data warehousing also generally assumes that skilled database administrators (DBAs) are available for most of the data warehousing tasks. Embodiments of the present invention use a high-level declarative language to enable a much simpler, more efficient, and more easy-to-use IW toolkit than ETL (extract, transform, load) products existing in the prior art\u2014such as: Kalido\u00ae, Sunopsis\u00ae, IBM DB2\u00ae Data Warehouse Edition\u00ae, IBM WebSphere\u00ae Information Integrator (also referred to as Ascential\u00ae), and Microsoft BI Accelerator\u00ae, which are often too complex (lacking in simple, high-level operations) to be usable or cannot handle structured and unstructured data in the same system.","Also, no incremental data maintenance operations are supported in these products, in contrast to, for example, failure recovery for data loading (e.g., using checkpointing) provided by embodiments of the present invention; error recovery (e.g., using versioning for undo and redo operations of data loading); and other maintenance operations provided by embodiments of the present invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","101","102","103","104","105"]},"Typically, the first task involved in information warehousing is to construct an information warehouse (e.g., perform building warehouse tasks ) by designing the right data warehouse model, designing the appropriate schemas, e.g., tables and dimensions that constitute the information warehouse  (which may comprise file system  and database ), and implementing the schema in the designated information warehouse . With current IW systems, such tasks are generally time-consuming and complex. It is desirable for the next generation IWMS to allow warehouse administrators (such as user ) to build an information warehouse  in an easy, quick and flexible fashion without burdening the warehouse administrators  with the details of data warehouse models and database (file system) specific operations required, for example, to operate file system  and database .","Once an information warehouse  is defined, the next step is typically to load data into the warehouse  (e.g., perform loading data tasks ). Loading data may be tightly related to the well-known ETL (i.e., extract, transform, load) process in that proper data fields need to be extracted, transformed, and loaded into the target information warehouse . Due to the requirements originating from unstructured data, the IWMS  may support flexible data extraction for various sources with different formats, such as XML files, sophisticated data transformations, and efficient loading mechanisms for large amounts of data. None of the prior art ETL tools known can handle the level of flexibility, complexity, and efficiency imposed by semi-structured data and unstructured data.","Because of the potential changes in information sources and the need for different types of analytics, an IWMS  in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention may allow flexible changes (e.g., perform maintaining data tasks ) to information warehouse  while automatically maintaining the data consistency and integrity (e.g., data and their indices in RDBMS and full-text indices). Furthermore, IWMS  may provide, via maintaining data tasks , the ability to cope with various failure and error situations without requiring users  to rebuild information warehouse .","An IWMS  may support actions (e.g., perform cleaning data tasks ) to clean the data already loaded in the information warehouse  or before the data are loaded. Such cleansing may include, for example, cleansing for structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data, e.g., changing and merging dimension values, coping with invalid XML files, and handling different character encodings.","Once the information warehouse  is built, it may be used to serve various forms of queries (e.g., perform querying data tasks ). An IWMS  may support efficient processing of IW queries, e.g., OLAP operations, as well as text search and retrieval operations.","IWMS  may include a general and declarative high level language (GIWL)  to simplify and automate the IW tasks -. With GIWL , users  may need only to specify what they want rather than how to execute the operations for performing tasks -. An analogy, for example, is that of sequential query language (SQL) and its relationship to relational database management systems (RDBMS). With SQL, users  only need to define what they want in the query result rather than how to execute the query. The runtime system, e.g., information warehouse system  shown in , may handle the query automatically. Similarly, GIWL language  can be used to declaratively define various IW tasks (e.g., from among tasks -). The runtime system, e.g., information warehouse system , may provide inherent support to carry out operations automatically without human intervention. Information warehouse system  may manage both structured and unstructured data. Information warehouse system  may use databases (such as database ) to store and index structured data, and file systems (such as file system ) or databases (such as database ) for unstructured data. To support high performance and complex keyword queries, information warehouse system  may integrate with full text indexers (e.g., Juru and Lucence as known in the art) to automatically build indices for unstructured data. Information warehouse system  may maintain the data and index consistency between databases and file systems at all times.","The overall system architecture for information warehouse system  may contain the front-end GUI  and the back-end IWMS engine , as shown in . The back-end IWMS engine  may include a command line based GIWL processor  and its associated runtime modules, for example, the warehouse builder  for constructing the IW (e.g., performing building warehouse tasks ), the data loader  for loading data (e.g., performing loading data tasks ), and the warehouse maintainer  for IW maintenance (e.g., performing maintaining data tasks ). The front-end GUI  may be a Web based graphical user interface for the back-end IWMS engine . GIWL processor  may employ input from database and full text indexer knowledge base  to generate commands for modules , , .","As seen in , the front-end GUI  may contain six modules: warehouse design manager , source mapping manager , data loading manager , maintenance manager , source data manager , and system configuration manager . The modules , , ,  may generate GIWL commands for the IW building (e.g., tasks ), schema-mapping and data loading (e.g., tasks ), and IW maintenance (e.g., tasks ) tasks. Such a front-end allows users to work with the information warehouse system  without even knowing the details of the GIWL language . A more intuitive GUI front-end  may automatically generate the appropriate GIWL scripts. The generated commands may be passed  to the back-end IWMS engine  for execution. The source data manager  may manage the source data. The system configuration manager  may manage and configure the IW settings, e.g., for information warehouse .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","101","110","200","301","302","303","304","301","306","304","307","207","207","308","307","106"]},"Such a high-level system architecture for an IW system  may be extensible and support different databases while hiding the RDBMS details. Besides the fact and dimension tables, IW system  may also maintain several internal system tables to record the IW design. In particular, IW system  may record all the information about warehouses (i.e., warehouse names, their storage databases, their fact tables, dimension tables, dimension models, dimension attributes, attribute types and index types) in the internal system tables. In the IW construction phase (e.g., building warehouse tasks ), file system storage and full text indexers may not be involved, but may play a role in the data loading stage (e.g., loading data tasks ).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","102","110","200","401","402","403","404","406","405","405","406","408","407","409","403","402","410","409","107","108","106","410","101","410","207","400"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","103","110","200","500","502","504","502","106","506","502","508","500","508","510","508","512","500","508","514","500","512","510","510","500","514","502","516","502","508","500","518","504","520","106","500","508","106","106"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6"]},"One of the major issues with current information warehouse tools is that they are often system-dependent (as are, for example, DB2\u00ae, Oracle\u00ae, and SQL Server\u2122). Current information warehouse tools typically require detailed RDBMS, IW modeling, and text indexing knowledge on the part of the user. Moreover, they often require highly skilled IW administrators to perform tedious, time-consuming, and error-prone customization when utilized in different customer environments. Such customizations may be necessary due to idiosyncrasy of different RDBMSs, file systems, and full-text indexers. Even though there are standards\u2014such SQL for RDBMS and POSIX\u00ae for file systems\u2014such standards often contain many non-standard variations, even for simple operations, which require customization at customer sites. The following examples may illustrate some variations in different relational database management systems. Such customization tasks can create barriers for timely information warehouse construction and may require significant training even for proficient DBAs.","Databases may use different keywords for defining the same data type. For instance, for the integer data type, DB20 uses \u201cINTEGER\u201d and MySQL\u00ae uses \u201cINT\u201d; for the large object data type (LOB), DB20 uses \u201cCLOB (size)\u201d and MySQL\u00ae uses \u201cTINYBLOB\u201d, \u201cBLOB\u201d, \u201cMEDIUMBLOB\u201d, and \u201cLONGBLOB\u201d.","Databases may have different ways to drop an index. For instance, in DB2\u00ae, Oracle\u00ae and PostgreSQL\u2122, the syntax is \u201cDROP INDEX index_name\u201d. In SQL Server\u2122, however, the syntax is \u201cDROP INDEX table_name.index_name\u201d. MySQL\u00ae uses \u201cALTER TABLE table_name DROP INDEX index_name\u201d.","Databases may have different ways to define automatically incremental attributes. For instance, in DB2\u00ae, the syntax is \u201cNOT NULL GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY\u201d. In MySQL\u00ae, the syntax is \u201cNOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT\u201d. In SQL Server\u2122, the syntax is \u201cNOT NULL IDENTITY\u201d. Other databases may also have their own syntax.","Since creating (and dropping) databases are not supported in Java\u00ae database connectivity (JDBC) and open database connectivity (ODBC), to create (and drop) a database, one has to use database-specific command line utilities that are often different from one database to another. For instance, DB2\u00ae has its command line utility \u201cdb2\u201d, MySQL\u00ae has \u201cmysql\u201d, and SQL Server\u2122 has \u201csqlcmd\u201d. Each of the command line utilities just mentioned may have its own set of options to execute distinct from all the others.","Similar to the examples just given, full-text indexers are typically even less standardized than file systems and RDBMS systems. For example, building text indices may require users to link in very different libraries (e.g., Juru\u2122 versus Lucene\u2122). Also for example, in order to integrate structured and unstructured data in a single information warehouse, IW designers may need to be a highly skilled DBA, a data warehouse modeling expert, and a file system and full-text indexer expert. Such needs can create significant roadblocks for the adoption of IW, text mining, and BI technologies. Embodiments of the present invention may address such needs by utilizing a high level declarative language GIWL to clearly separate the high-level IW design and low-level IW implementation. Using IW system , for example, IW designers may design an information warehouse by creating a language script (such as language script  shown in ) that contains a set of declarative statements defined in GIWL. The language script (e.g., language script ) may indicate which database and full text indexer the user (e.g., user ) wishes to use and what tasks need to be carried out. IW system  may, for example, automatically generate low-level database-specific and full-text indexer-specific commands at runtime based on the script and execute them without human (e.g., user ) intervention. Such an approach may remove the customization burden from users (e.g., user ) and enable overall IW task simplification and automation.","The following describes an exemplary detailed language specification for IW construction. The language specification for constructing an information warehouse may include two levels: an IW level and a dimension level. The IW level commands may define the language syntax at the granularity of entire information warehouses, such as creating, using, and dropping an information warehouse. The dimension level commands may define the language syntax at the granularity of facts and dimensions, such as creating, altering, and dropping a dimension. The concepts of facts and dimensions are well known in the art of data warehousing. In the language specification below, the lower-case words may indicate the command attributes that require user inputs and uppercase words may designate the command names.","IW Level Commands","To create an information warehouse, for example, \u201ciw_name\u201d in a database \u201cdb_name\u201d, use:","CREATE INFORMATION WAREHOUSE iw_name IN DATABASE db_name;","A single \u201cdb_name\u201d database may hold multiple information warehouses.","To list all information warehouses on a database server, use:","SHOW INFORMATION WAREHOUSES;","To delete a specific information warehouse, for example, \u201cdb_name.iw_name\u201d, use:","DROP INFORMATION WAREHOUSE db_name.iw_name;","To use an existing information warehouse, use:","USE INFORMATION WAREHOUSE db_name.iw_name;","Dimension Level Commands","To set the name of the fact table, use:","SET FACT_TABLE=fact_table_name;","To create a dimension, having a name \u201cdimension_name\u201d, for example, use:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"CREATE DIMENSION dimension_name FIELDS("},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2002attribute_def, ..., attribute_def)"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2002MODEL USING [MEASURE | STAR | SNOWFLAKE |"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2002NEWFACT | FILE] ON [ FACT | dim_name];"},{"entry":"attribute_def: attr_name TYPE [DATETIME | INT | BIGINT | FLOAT |"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2002VARCHAR (size) | CLOB (size) | ...]"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2002INDEX [NO | DB | TEXT];"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"To list all dimensions in an information warehouse, use:","SHOW DIMENSIONS;","To delete a dimension in an information warehouse, use:","DROP DIMENSION dimension_name;","Each dimension may consist of a set of attributes. Each attribute may be defined by a triplet: attribute name (e.g., attr_name), data type, and index type. Data types may include all standard types such as INT, BIGINT, FLOAT, DATETIME, VARCHAR, and CLOB. Index type can be an index in database or index in full text indexer, or no index. In addition, each dimension may require a schema model to be defined by the user (e.g., user ). In one implementation, the schema model can be one of: MEASURE, STAR, SNOWFLAKE, NEWFACT, and FILE. A dimension can be associated with either the fact table or another dimension, which can be set using the \u201cON\u201d keyword.","The above-named models are known in the data warehousing art and have conventional meanings. In order to support integration of structured and unstructured data, however, in one IWMS system, e.g., IW system , modifications may be given to the meanings as listed below so as to help simplify information warehousing tasks. Given the tradeoffs of different models and usage patterns, there may not be a single model that would fit all situations. Hence, supporting different models by IW system  may provide users with flexibility while still hiding the low-level system-specific details during model construction.","1. MEASURE: A dimension with the MEASURE model means that the attributes in this dimension may be put in the fact table. No new tables are created for this type of dimension. MEASURE model may only be meaningful when associating with the fact table. Hence, a dimension with the MEASURE model should always use \u201cON FACT\u201d in the creation statement.","2. STAR: A dimension with the STAR model means that the primary key of this dimension may be a foreign key of the fact table or another dimension, depending on the setting of the \u201cON\u201d keyword. Therefore, a traditional snowflake model can be constructed by using a sequence of STAR models in IW system .","3. SNOWFLAKE: A dimension, D, with the SNOWFLAKE model means this dimension may be linked to the fact table, F, or another dimension, D\u2032, through a map table, or named bridge table. The map table may describe the n:n relationship between D and F or D and D\u2032.","4. NEWFACT: A dimension with the NEWFACT model means that the primary key of this dimension may also be the primary key of the fact table or another dimension it links to. The NEWFACT model may be needed for efficient incremental IW construction, such as adding new measure attributes or new attributes into existing dimensions after the IW has been constructed and data have been loaded. This model may be used to accommodate the RDBMS limitation on adding new columns for already constructed tables.","5. FILE: A dimension with the FILE model means that the dimension data may be stored in file systems instead of databases. Such a model may be designed to handle unstructured data. Although most databases also include text indexing and storage capabilities, such support in RDBMSs may typically be premature and unscalable to large amounts of unstructured data. On the other hand, file systems traditionally are more friendly to full-text indexers and storing unstructured data. In the FILE model, unstructured files may be directly associated with the primary key of the fact table.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0079","num":"0078"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 7"],"b":["600","300","600","700","300"]},"To construct an IW such as \u201csales\u201d, the following steps may be taken:","1. A user (e.g., user ) may first use IW level commands to indicate the intention of creation of the warehouse \u201csale\u201d as shown in .","2. The user may set the name of the fact table to be \u201csales\u201d and create a set of dimensions. In the \u201csale\u201d example, the user created a dimension \u201camount\u201d with two measure attributes \u201cdollars_sold\u201d and \u201cprofit\u201d in the fact table \u201csales\u201d. Both attributes need indexes in databases. The user also created a dimension \u201cdate\u201d with the STAR model associated with \u201csales\u201d.","3. A dimension \u201cbranch\u201d with the STAR model on \u201csales\u201d is created.","4. A dimension \u201clocation\u201d with the STAR model on \u201cbranch\u201d is created. Note that the \u201clocation\u201d dimension is traditionally considered as a snowflake model in the IW design. But in IW system , it is viewed as a STAR model for its directly linked dimension.","5. The user also created a dimension \u201cproduct\u201d with the SNOWFLAKE model on \u201csales\u201d. As a result, a table called product_map may be generated to connect the \u201cproduct\u201d table and the \u201csales\u201d table.","6. A dimension \u201cfeedback\u201d with the NEWFACT model on \u201csales\u201d is also created. From , it can be seen that, although the attribute \u201cfeedback\u201d may be stored in a database, its index can be built using a full text indexer.","7. The user created a dimension \u201cattachments\u201d with the FILE model, which uses file systems to store the attachment texts.","After the information warehouse (e.g., information warehouse ) is constructed, data loading can begin, using, for example, IW system  shown in . Data loading typically requires users (e.g., user ) to first specify how the source data (e.g., data ) is mapped to the target IW schema before the data are loaded according to the mappings. Source-to-target mapping generally entails two tasks: data extraction (i.e., extracting pieces of data of interest from the source data) and data transformation (i.e., transforming the extracted data into appropriate formats and\/or values for the target information warehouse). IW system  may be implemented, for example, to work with any XML formatted sources. XML may be selected to illustrate the present examples because XML is commonly used and also may represent a combination of structured and unstructured data. That is, XML data typically contains both structured fields as well as unstructured texts. XML data may also have a complex schema model. Loading data using IW system  may entail separate requirements for data extraction, data transformation, and data loading.","Data Extraction: Typically, to support analytics applications, only a subset of the source data fields needs to be populated into the target information warehouse. Thus, the data extraction mechanism may desirably be flexible to allow accurate extraction of the desired source data fields from source data. For XML data, for example, this may be especially challenging due to XML data's highly flexible formats. For instance, exactly the same data content can be organized very differently in XML format as shown in .","Each of segments () through () shown in , although having very different document type definitions (DTD), contains the same data content (i.e., the first and last names of two authors: \u201cJim Gray\u201d and \u201cJeffrey Ullman\u201d). Yet, some of the segments put data as text values (i.e., segments () and ()) while others as put data attribute values (i.e., segments () and ()). Some of the segments put last name and first name as tag names (i.e., segment ()), while other segments put last name and first name as attribute names (i.e., segment ()) or attribute values (i.e., segments () and ()).","To resolve the issues described above, IW system  may use XPath\u00ae to locate the desired data fields.

Assuming that users would like to retrieve fields for each article, and given an article node context, the xpath to locate all the authors in segments (), (), () is \u201c.\/author\u201d, while the xpath to locate all the authors in segment () is \u201c.\/item[@attr=\u2018author\u2019 ]\u201d.

That is, if two attributes Aand Ahave certain dependencies in the source data (e.g., source data ), such dependencies may be required to be maintained in the target information warehouse (e.g., information warehouse ) as well. Similarly, if two attributes Aand Aare independent in the source data, it may be required that they be so in the target information warehouse.  shows different data relationships for three seemingly similar XML segment examples (1), (2), and (3).

In segment , B and C are grouped together at all times. Segment  also has B and C grouped together, but within each group, their values are independent. Such groupings indicate that the data loading results for the dimension table that contains B and C may be different in each case (1), (2), and (3), as shown in .","The following describes an exemplary detailed language specification for IW loading data.

Assuming that the XML data (e.g., source data ) contains all the attributes used in , the script (e.g., script ) shown in Table 1 may first create a mapping profile \u201cmth\u201d and set the xpath of all the records to be \u201c\/doc\/A\u201d which may locate all document records to be loaded. The script of Table 1 may then create a set of mappings. For example, there may be three sample mappings to the value dimension: value1 may contain an xpath, value2 may contain a data transformation function \u201cSubstring\u201d, and value3 may contain nested functions. The question mark in the function may be used to represent the values extracted from the xpath.","The example script of Table 1 also shows a dimension with 1:n schema mapping for the \u201cdate dimension\u201d. In this example, a 1:n schema mapping may be decomposed into n individual simple mappings, where each mapping utilizes the function \u201cSplitSelect\u201d to split and select the desired portions of data. The reverse, i.e., a dimension with an n:1 schema mapping, is illustrated in Table 1 using the \u201cname\u201d dimension, where multiple xpaths may be used to specify the desired data, e.g., the first name and last name and the function \u201cConcat\u201d concatenates them for the target field in the dimension, where \u201c?1\u201d denotes the extracted data from the first xpath and \u201c?2\u201d extracted data from the second xpath. Similar to schema matching, Table 1 shows two data mapping examples, i.e., 1:n data mapping for the \u201cauthor\u201d dimension and n:1 data mapping for the \u201ccomment\u201d dimension. The 1:n data mapping may use the function \u201cSplit\u201d, for example, to split the data value into multiple data values, and the n:1 data mapping may use the function \u201cMerge\u201d, for example, to merge multiple data values into one value.

IW system  may provide two key types of maintenance capabilities, e.g., the ability to efficiently recover from data loading failures and the ability to correct data errors efficiently. Without such capabilities, failures or errors occurring in a lengthy data load typically result in complete IW reloads. Even if DBAs would manually clean up the failed loads, there is often a danger of breaking the overall IW data integrity and consistency in such manual processes.","Failure recovery may describe a situation where a data loading (e.g., data loading ) may fail due to unexpected system errors, e.g., machine or network crash, and an IWMS must properly clean up the incomplete records from the information warehouse and be able to resume loading data from where it was left off without breaking data integrity and consistency. To cope with such situations, two logical actions, \u201cabort\u201d and \u201cresume\u201d, may be provided, for example, by IW system . Similar to the transaction rollback concepts in databases (e.g., RDBMS), \u201cabort\u201d may roll the IW state (of information warehouse , for example) back to a consistent state before the failure point. Likewise, \u201cresume\u201d may allow users (e.g., user ) to resume the failed data load from that last consistent state without reloading everything from scratch. No known prior art RDBMS has readily available support for such failure recovery operations. Yet, \u201cabort\u201d and \u201cresume\u201d may be extremely important for an IW environment, and \u201cabort\u201d and \u201cresume\u201d may also be useful when users intentionally wish to abort a data load.","Error correction may describe a situation where the data (e.g., source data ) may be loaded successfully but users may find errors in some loaded data content in the information warehouse (e.g., information warehouse ) and hence wish to revert some portion of the data load and reload some of the data using corrected contents. To allow flexible error corrections for the loaded data, IW system  may support \u201cundo\u201d and \u201credo\u201d operations. Such \u201cundo\u201d and \u201credo\u201d operations may also be used to facilitate data modifications.","The following describes an exemplary detailed language specification for IW maintenance.
