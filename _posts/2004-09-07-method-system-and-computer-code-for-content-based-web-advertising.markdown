{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCES TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/483,092, filed Jan. 14, 2000 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,804,659, which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08\/995,616, filed Dec. 22, 1997 now abandoned, both of which are incorporated by reference herein.","The present invention relates to online advertising management and more particularly to techniques for targeting information in the Internet environment. Specific embodiments can target advertising and other marketing information.","With the rapid development of electronic commerce, the number of Internet companies offering free services with the goal of creating a customer base for web advertising has increased dramatically. Typically, Internet companies host web pages using a portal, a web page with links to many other web pages. Portals contain web advertisements. Companies advertising on the portal pay a royalty to the portal provider. Examples of popular portals include MYYAHOO, MYEXCITE, NETSCAPE NETCENTER, and HOTMAIL.","While there are perceived advantages to using web portals, further efficiencies can be had. For example, web portals are unable to provide advertising to the user once the user exits the realm of web pages controlled by the portal. Internet service providers (ISPs), such as America On Line (AOL), have more control over the advertising reaching their subscribers because the ISPs retain control over pages served to the user. However, to continue to provide advertising on every web page served to a user currently requires reformatting the web page or popping up annoying windows with advertisements in them.","What is needed is a technique for targeting advertising to online users without compromising user privacy.","According to the present invention, an internet target marketing system, method and computer program for distributing online advertising to viewers based upon the viewers' interests is provided. Specific embodiments according to the present invention can use an n-way matching of user's concepts of interest, advertiser's concepts and concepts contained in a currently viewed document to target advertising to the viewer of the current document. Some embodiments can generate a contextually sensitive advertisement for each page viewed in a browser, thereby associating an advertisement with every page in a document. Specific embodiments can associate advertising with documents that are substantially free of embedded advertisements, for example. Alternative embodiments can include embedded advertising, however.","In a specific embodiment according to the present invention, a method for targeting advertising to a user based upon content of an active document is provided. An active document can be one that is presently displayed to a user, for example. However, in some embodiments, an active document can be one that is being processed by a daemon or background process. The method includes analyzing at least one document to identify discussion of information corresponding to one or more user selectable concepts of interest. This analysis can provide a user concept relevance, which can comprise a measure of relevance of the document to one or more concepts defined by the user. The method can also include analyzing the document to identify discussion of information corresponding to one or more advertiser selectable concepts of interest. This analysis can provide an advertiser concept relevance, which can comprise a measure of relevance of the document to one or more concepts defined by the advertiser. The method can also include comparing the user concept relevance and the advertiser concept relevance for the document to determine an overall relevance. Selecting advertising having a particular overall relevance can also be part of the method. The particular relevance can be the greatest relevance, least relevance, or within a range of greatest or least relevance, for example. The method can also include displaying the advertisement selected to a user.","In another embodiment according to the present invention, a system for targeting advertising to a user based upon content of one or more documents displayed to the user is provided. The system comprises a profile content recognizer that analyzes contents of documents for information corresponding to one or more user selectable concepts. The profile content recognizer provides an output of concepts contained in the document that correspond to the one or more user selectable concepts. The system also comprises an advertising content recognizer that analyzes content of documents for information corresponding to one or more advertiser selectable concepts. A comparator compares the output from the profile content recognizer and the output from the advertising content recognizer and selects from a plurality of stored advertisements ones that are relevant to the information contained in the documents based upon the comparison.","In a further embodiment according to the present invention, a computer program product for targeting advertising to users based upon a content of one or more documents displayed to the user comprises code for analyzing the documents to identify discussion of information corresponding to one or more user selectable concepts of interest is provided. This code can provide a user concept relevance indication, which can comprise a measure of relevance of the document to one or more concepts defined by the user. Code for analyzing the documents to identify discussion of information corresponding to one or more advertiser selectable concepts of interest is provided. This code can provide an advertiser concept relevance indication, which can comprise a measure of relevance of the document to one or more concepts defined by the advertiser. Code for comparing the user concept relevance and the advertiser concept relevance for the document in order to determine an overall relevance is also part of the product. Code for selecting advertising having a particular overall relevance and a computer readable storage medium for holding the codes are also part of the product. The particular relevance can be the greatest relevance, least relevance, or within a range of greatest or least relevance, for example.","In a yet further embodiment according to the present invention, a method for automatically associating advertising objects with web objects is provided. The method includes analyzing one or more web objects to identify information corresponding to at least one first concept of interest and analyzing the one or more web objects to identify information corresponding to at least one second concept of interest. Determining a relevance between the first concepts of interest and the second concepts of interest can also be part of the method. The method can also include associating the one or more web objects with the one or more advertising objects based upon the relevance.","In a still further embodiment according to the present invention, a computer program product for automatically associating advertising objects with web objects is provided. Code for analyzing one or more web objects to identify information corresponding to at least one first concept of interest can be part of the product. Code for analyzing the one or more web objects to identify information corresponding to at least one second concept of interest can also be part of the product. The product can also include code for determining a relevance between the first concept of interest and the second concept of interest. Code for associating the one or more web objects with the one or more advertising objects based upon relevance and a computer readable storage medium for holding the codes can also be part of the product.","Numerous benefits are achieved by way of the present invention over conventional techniques. The present invention can provide a way to target advertising relevant to the viewer's current interests along with web pages on a single screen. Embodiments according to the present invention can achieve more specific targeting than techniques known in the art. For example, some embodiments can detect that one user's definition of sports includes hunting and fishing, while another user's idea of sports may include marathon running. Such embodiments can provide better targeting of advertisements than conventional techniques. Some embodiments according to the present invention can provide better protection of viewers' privacy than conventional web browser user interfaces. Embodiments according to the invention can provide more information to the user than known techniques. Many embodiments according to the invention will enhance the user's web browsing experience by providing indication of which links are likely to be of most interest. These and other benefits are described throughout the present specification.","A further understanding of the nature and advantages of the inventions herein may be realized by reference to the remaining portions of the specification and the attached drawings.","According to the present invention, an interest profile based target marketing system, method and computer program for distributing online advertising to viewers based upon the viewers' interests is provided. An embodiment according to the present invention has been reduced to practice under the name Reader's Helper\u2122.","Representative embodiments according to the present invention provide one or more marketing information areas on a web browser, for example. The marketing information areas can provide viewers access to advertising, public service information and the like. The marketing information display area can provide consistent, unobtrusive access to marketing information. Embodiments according to the present invention are operable with many of a wide variety of web browsers known to those of ordinary skill in the art, such as web browsers provided by NEOPLANET, a company with headquarters in Phoeniz, Ariz. (www.neoplanet.com), MICROSOFT CORPORATION's Internet Explorer, NETSCAPE Navigator, and the like. The marketing information display area can provide a location for advertising, and the like, which does not interfere with the document's content.","Targeted advertising refers to the organized exposure of marketing information to persons determined to be most likely to buy the product or service being advertised. Targeting can be performed based upon persons' demographic and other information, for example. The determination is made based upon a profile for a particular person developed from information about the person's usage of products or services, and the like. For example, information about the web pages a person visits can be gathered and analyzed to provide a profile of the person's interests and the like. Web advertisement objects likely to appeal to a particular user can be displayed in marketing information area of the user's browser. In another embodiment, marketing information can be distributed based upon information about the web \u201cchannels\u201d a person uses. In one embodiment, users who view web pages and use channels via a particular portal provide information that can be used to target advertising using the marketing information area in the user's browser. Embodiments can analyze the Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) associated with the web pages browsed by the user. Other embodiments can analyze the content of the web pages themselves to gather information about the user's interests.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 1A","FIG. 1A","FIG. 1A","FIG. 1A","FIG. 1A"],"b":["10","12","12","12","14","14","14","10","16","16","16","14","14","14","18","17","17","17","14","14","14","17","17","17","16","16","16","10","17","17","17","21"],"i":["a","b ","c ","a","b ","c","a","b ","c ","a","b ","c","a","b ","c ","a","b ","c","a","b ","c ","a","b ","c ","a","b ","c "]},"It is a noteworthy aspect of embodiments according to the present invention that advertisers can update their corresponding marketing information substantially independently of interfering with the clients' viewing of the information. In a presently preferable embodiment, advertisers can also monitor usage of their marketing information by the clients by, for example, counting the \u201chits\u201d on a particular web object corresponding to the advertiser's marketing information to indicate usage.

In some specific embodiments, the annotated phrases in the portion of the document being viewed and\/or all phrases in the portion of the document being viewed can be used to pinpoint what a user might be interested in. For example, the user may be viewing a portion of a document which contains many highlighted keywords related to the user's concepts of interest. The user can be sufficiently interested in such a document portion to closely read the contents. Therefore, advertising can be targeted based upon the information that the user is currently reading. In this case, the highlighted words can be compared with the advertising concepts in order to determine an appropriate advertisement to display at that time. Such embodiments can provide better advertising for a user as the user reads a document, and can change the advertisement being displayed as the user scrolls through the document.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 1C","FIG. 1C"],"b":["105","105","107","345","105","109","111","938"],"sub":"j"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["210","220","230","240","250","270","270","250"]},"In a preferred embodiment, computer system  includes a Pentium\u00ae class based computer, running Windows\u00ae NT operating system by Microsoft Corporation.

The concept indicator illustrates the results of analyzing documents the user browses for content relevant to the user selectable concepts of interest. A value is assigned based upon a determined likelihood that the document is of interest to the user. In a presently preferable embodiment, key phrases used throughout a document are automatically highlighted according to their relevance to the user's selectable concepts of interest so that the user can find relevant information more efficiently. Each user-defined concept of interest can include a collection of key phrases that describe important features in documents about that concept. The concept indicator can provide an indication to a user whether a document is about the concept and worth reading. Concept indicators are described in greater detail in a commonly owned copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08\/995,616, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.","Embodiments according to the present invention can provide the ability to create advertising and other marketing information which target viewers of web pages or documents that are most likely to be read by people who would be interested in their products. For example, techniques according to the present invention can determine that advertisements for \u201cOutside\u201d magazine would be of interest to readers of documents or web pages that contain information about mountaineering or trekking, as well as readers indicating a preference for these concepts of interest, for example. Advertisements for conferences, for example, can be triggered by displaying abstracts of papers from a previous conference on the same subject matter, for example.","In a particular representative embodiment according to the present invention, advertising can be targeted based upon the user's concepts of interest and how relevant these concepts are for a particular document. Relevance can be determined using a scoring or other method as described below. This information, in conjunction with the actual content of the document, can be used to target advertising to users. Concepts, which define sets of interests, can be collected from user input or other mechanisms. In a presently preferable embodiment, user privacy can be maintained because user profiles are not shared with advertisers. User profiles can be stored locally on the client computer, or at an ISP server, or a proxy service, for example. In some specific embodiments, advertisers can be provided statistical information recorded by the user's browser, for example.","In a yet further embodiment according to the present invention, advertising can be selected based on content analysis. Advertising can be associated with web page contents for portals and the like based upon a system of assigned concepts. Providers of web portals, for example, can create a set of associations between web pages linked to the portal web page and the advertisement. In a particular embodiment, content analysis techniques can provide the associations between advertising objects and web objects based upon particular categories.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 4A","FIG. 4A","FIGS. 5\u20138"],"b":["401","402","404","402"]},"Then, in a step , the contents of the document is again analyzed using the same technique as in step , to determine relevance between the document and concepts which represent advertiser definitions. In a specific embodiment, these advertising concepts can be keywords that advertisers have identified as being relevant to their product, for example. In a specific embodiment, a probability estimate can be generated for each advertising concept for each document. Then, in a step , a collection of relevant concepts can be produced based upon such probability estimates determined in step .","Next, in an optional step , the collection of concepts produced in step  can be delivered to a web browser configured to display indications of relevancy of the document to user. Then, in a step , a comparison can be made between the collection of user concepts provided by step  and collection of advertising concepts provided by step  in order to determine which advertising concepts are most similar, for example, to the user concepts. Then, in a step , the selected advertising can be delivered to the user.

In one representative embodiment, a matching technique uses a document similarity method, in which each user and advertising concept could represent a document, i.e. a collection of terms. Some specific embodiments can use a term-frequency measure, in which vector representations for both the user and advertising concepts are created. These vectors can be compared to create a new vector the size of the target vector with 1 's representing matches and 0's representing non-matches, for example. In a representative example, a user concept C can be represented as a vector of terms, C=<t, t, t, . . . , t>, and an advertising concept A can be represented as a vector of terms, A=<t, t, t, . . . , t>.
