{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["REFERENCE TO PRIORITY APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application is a continuation-in-part of and claims the benefit and priority to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/570,945, titled, \u201cUnified Interface and Routing Module for Handling Audio Input\u201d, filed on Sep. 30, 2009 and also claims the benefit and priority to Provisional U.S. Patent Application No. 61\/348,183, titled, \u201cGenius Button Secondary Commands\u201d, filed on May 25, 2010, to the same inventor herein, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein.","Over the past thirty years, telephony has significantly evolved from the once-ubiquitous public switched telephone network service. Advances in technology have added an ever increasing array of features and capabilities to telecommunication devices, such as touch screens, video and still cameras, web browsing capabilities, email sending and receiving capabilities, music and video download, storing and playback capabilities, calendar and contact managing capabilities, global positioning system (GPS) location and navigation capabilities, game playing capabilities, and television capabilities, to name a few. Many of these features and capabilities are provided through specialized applications resident on the telecommunication devices. For example, many telecommunication devices allow the user to further customize the telecommunication device through custom configuration options or by adding third-party software. Such software is available for many different functions, not limited to communications.","In addition, traditional components have been utilized to provide new capabilities. The microphones of telecommunication devices, for example, are now used for capturing a user's audio input outside the context of a phone call between the user and another person or system. Applications, such as those mentioned above, accept and process audio input provided through a telecommunication device microphone. Such applications may utilize audio input to create recorded audio notes, voice annotations of a picture, or search queries to be executed on a remote search engine. While these numerous applications all utilize audio input, each provides a different interface and requires different user inputs to initiate the capture of audio input. The captured audio input is then processed by the application triggering the audio capture and is utilized only for the purposes of that application","Overview","Described herein are telecommunication devices configured with unified audio interfaces and audio routing modules for capturing and handling audio input provided to the telecommunication devices. The unified audio interface includes a dedicated key or button, such as a physical or graphical key, which can be pressed, pressed and held, or otherwise actuated regardless of the execution context of the telecommunication device having the button\/key. For example, the button\/key may pressed during an audio communication (e.g., telephone call) or while interacting with an application, such as an email application, a text messaging application, instant messaging application, or any other sort of application or process of the telecommunication device. Upon detecting a press or actuation of the button\/key, the unified audio interface captures audio input from a user of the telecommunication device or ambient audio in the area of the telecommunication device and provides the audio input to one or more audio recognition modules, which includes at least a speech recognition component. After audio recognition is performed, the resulting recognized audio input, such as a text translation of speech received from the user of the telecommunication device, is received by an audio routing module of the telecommunication device. The audio routing module evaluates the audio input to determine whether the audio input should be handled as an audio command, as a request of telecommunication device application(s), or as a network search request.","In various implementations, the audio routing module utilizes configurable rules or priorities, such as user-configurable or carrier-configurable rules or priorities, in determining how the audio input should be handled. The audio routing module may also or instead rely on a collection of recognized commands which, when encountered within the audio input, indicate that the audio input is to be handled as a command. The audio routing module may also be associated with an application programming interface (API) which enables developers of applications for the telecommunication device to register with the telecommunication device and to provide commands or macros which the audio routing module may utilize in determining how to handle the audio input.","In some implementations, the unified audio interface detects the press or actuation of the button\/key while the telecommunication device is engaged in communication with another device. Upon detecting the press or actuation, the telecommunication device may capture, process, and evaluate the audio input. In evaluating the audio input, the audio routing module of the telecommunication device may perform the determining of how to handle the audio input based at least in part on a context or data associated with the communication with the other device.","Illustrative Environment",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["106","104","102","106","104","102","108","106","104","110","104","104","112","112","104","114","106","116","118","112","104","120","122","104","124","102","106"]},"In various implementations, the audio routing module  performs the determining based on configurable rules or priorities which may be added or modified by the user  via a rules or priorities process  or by a carrier. Also or instead, the determining may be performed based on commands or macros stored in a term or macro data store . In some implementations, commands or macros are registered with the audio routing module  via an API . The API  may be utilized by developers  of applications or processes for the telecommunication device  to register with or interact with the audio routing module .","As illustrated, the telecommunication device  that captures the audio input  may be any sort of computing device known in the art. For example, the telecommunication device  may be a telecommunication device such as a mobile phone or a PDA, a landline phone, an Internet phones, or may be a media player, a personal computer (PC), a laptop, a netbook, a reading device or any sort of mobile or stationary computing device. As mentioned above, the telecommunication device  may have a button or key . The button or key  may be disposed on a location on a shell or casing of the telecommunication device , on a headset associated with the telecommunication device , or rendered on a display of the telecommunication device , as well as applications, OS, etc. . Also, the telecommunication device  may be configured with or store any one or more of the audio recognition module , the audio routing module , the rules or priorities process , the term or macro data store , and\/or the API . An example telecommunication device  is illustrated in greater detail by  and is described further below.","In some implementations, the telecommunication device  or an associated headset may include a microphone or some other means of capturing audio input . The audio input  may be any sounds captured by the microphone\/capturing means either while the button\/key  is pressed\/actuated and held, during a pre-determined time period following the press\/actuation, or following a first press\/actuation until a second press\/actuation is received. In one implementation, the telecommunication device  is configured with a signature\/identifier of the user's audio that can be used to filter audio input  prior to processing the audio input . Such a signature\/identifier may have been previously captured using the telecommunication device  or another device and may comprise a pre-determined string of words that the user  is asked to read aloud. In another implementation, rather than requiring a signature\/identifier unique to the user , the telecommunication device  may be configured with a signature\/identifier for a language that can be used to filter the audio input  to ensure that the audio input  comprises spoken words belonging to a given language. In other implementations, the audio input  may be received as an audio file from another computing device, the other computing device acting as a proxy for the user .","In various implementations, the button\/key  may be a physical control disposed on a casing of the telecommunication device . Such a control may be disposed on a front, side, top, bottom, or back of telecommunication device  and may signal that it has been pressed or actuated through traces or by contact with a capacitive surface. In one implementation, the button\/key  may be one of a plurality of keys of a keyboard. The button\/key  may include a physical control that is pressed towards the telecommunication devices or a switch that is slid or toggled relative to the plane of the telecommunication device  on which the button\/key  is disposed. In one implementation, the button\/key  is disposed on a removable, attachable shell which mates with the cover\/casing of the telecommunication device . In a further implementation, the button\/key  may be a dedicated button\/key associated with initiating an audio capture process. Such a dedicated button\/key may not be re-programmable or re-assignable by the user . In another implementation, the button\/key  is disposed on a headset associated with the telecommunication device .","In other implementations, as illustrated further in , the button\/key  is a graphic user interface (GUI) key which is rendered to the display of the telecommunication device , the display being a touch sensitive display which comprises a capacitive surface or a set of light sensors. The GUI key  may be rendered on each and every user interface (UI) displayed by the telecommunication device , including UIs such as menus, application interfaces, and other interfaces of the telecommunication device . In one embodiment, the GUI key  is located in the same place relative to the bounds of the telecommunication device display in each displayed UI. Thus, by making the GUI key  available on every display, the GUI key  is made available regardless of the execution context of the telecommunication device .","The button\/key  and the associated processes for capturing audio input  may comprise a unified audio interface for the capture of any commands, requests, queries, or other interactions that a user  may have to be executed or processed on the telecommunication device . Either while the button\/key  is pressed\/actuated and held, between two presses\/actuations of the button\/key , or for a pre-determined time period thereafter, the unified audio interface captures audio input . As mentioned above, it may even filter the audio input . Once the audio input is captured and stored in temporary storage (such as a buffer) or in permanent storage, the unified audio interface may provide the audio input  to one or more audio recognition modules  which includes at least a speech recognition module. In another implementation, the unified audio interface may provide the audio input  to an audio recognition module  in real time, as the audio input  is received.","In various implementations, the audio recognition module  may comprise any process or processes capable of receiving audio input  in the form of an audio file or buffer and producing a text translation of the audio input , the text translation comprising \u201crecognized\u201d audio input . The audio recognition module  may be a process of the telecommunication device , of a remote server (as shown in ), of a telecommunication service provider, or of some other remote service provider. In one implementation, the audio recognition module  may comprise processes implemented on multiple devices. As mentioned above, in one implementation, the audio recognition module  may receive the audio input  in real time, as it is provided.","The audio recognition module  may utilize any technique or techniques known in the art to recognize the received audio input . In some implementations, the audio recognition module  may utilize learning models that make progressively better translations of the audio input  based on results of previous translations (e.g., such as whether the user is required to choose between multiple options to disambiguate the audio input ). The audio recognition module  may start with a learning model associated with a language or associated with a specific group sharing a language and some common trait (e.g., age). The learning model may also be selected and pre-loaded by a carrier, for example, based on a billing zip code of the user . In one implementation, the audio recognition module  may then refine that learning model to take into account idiosyncratic patterns (i.e., voice characteristics) in the user's speech. The refined learning model can comprise a speaker profile and be associated with a user login or identifier, with a telecommunication services account, or with the telecommunication device . If associated with a user login, identifier, or account, then the same refined learning model may be accessed and utilized by multiple telecommunication devices.","In some implementations, the audio recognition module  may facilitate training of the learning model based on inputs of user . Either in response to the user  selecting a training mode or automatically at pre-determined training opportunities, the audio recognition module  may allow the user to speak a number of different phrases and, if necessary, select between disambiguating options. Based on the training, the audio recognition module  may refine and update the learning model.","In further implementations, rather than utilizing a learning model customized for the individual user, the audio recognition module  can utilize a group learning model that is refined and updated based on results of translations performed for users of the group.","In some implementations, the audio recognition module  or another process of the telecommunication device  may provide potential meanings of the audio input  to the user  to resolve the meaning of the audio input  when the audio input  is ambiguous. For example, if the user  were to say something that is recognized as \u201cbrable\u201d, the user could either have said (or be trying to say) \u201cstable\u201d or \u201ctable.\u201d The audio recognition module  or process could provide both of these and perhaps other suggestions to the user  for the user  to select from. Such suggestions and selections could be made and received either through a GUI or through further audio output\/input. In one implementation, the audio recognition module  might recognize a term, but not recognize whether the user  intends the term as a command for an application or as a search request. If the user  were to say \u201cwallpaper\u201d, the user  could mean \u201cchange the wallpaper\u201d or \u201cshow me wallpapers\u201d, the first being a command and the second being a search request that could be fulfilled by an application or search service. Again, the audio recognition module  or process could provide both of these and perhaps other suggestions to the user  for the user  to select from.","In further implementations, audio recognition module  may perform the disambiguation of the audio input  with reference to application or context information, such as contact lists, browsing history, a call log, etc. For example, if user  speaks the name \u201cThorbjorn\u201d, the audio recognition module  may have trouble understanding the input (i.e., which \u201cThorbjorn\u201d is being referred to). To disambiguate the input, the audio recognition module  may examine the contact list and note that the name Thorbjorn Janssen is included in the list. The audio recognition module  may then either assume that the contact is who\/what the user  was referring to, or may suggest the contact as one of a plurality of disambiguation suggestions for the user  to select from. If multiple Thorbjorns are found in the contact lists, the audio recognition module  may examine the call log and guess whichever Thorbjorn has been called the most as the Thorbjorn being referred to.","In some implementations, as mentioned above, the audio recognition module  may receive the audio input  in real time, as the user  is speaking it. To speed along disambiguation, the audio recognition module  may present to the user  a guess as to what the user  is saying as the user  is saying it. Such a guess may be refined repeatedly as the user  is speaking. In one implementation, if the audio recognition module  is guessing incorrectly, the user  may terminate the audio input  (by, e.g., releasing the button\/key ) and may again attempt to provide audio input . The audio recognition module  may interpret such a cancellation as an incorrect guess and may refine a learning model accordingly.","Once the recognized audio input  has been generated by the audio recognition module , the audio recognition module  may provide the recognized audio input  to the audio routing module . In some implementations, before providing the recognized audio input  to the audio routing module , the audio recognition module  may provide the recognized audio input  back to the user  to confirm that the recognized audio input  matches the audio input . The recognized audio input  may be displayed to the user, or may be translated by the audio recognition module  from text to audio and may be played to the user  by the telecommunication device . In one implementation, further action may not proceed until the user  confirms that the recognized audio input  is correct.","In various implementations, the audio routing module  comprises processes and rules for evaluating the recognized audio input  to determine how the recognized audio input  should be handled. The rules and processes comprising the audio routing module  may be implemented entirely or partially on the telecommunication device , or may be implemented on another device, such as a server of a telecommunication service provider. The audio routing module  may be implemented as a state machine comprising a finite number of states, each state associated with a different mechanism for handling the recognized audio input . Such states could be associated with mechanisms for handling the recognized audio input  as a request  made of a telecommunication device application or process, as an audio command , and\/or as a network search request .","The audio routing module  could determine the state\/mechanism based on a set of rules and\/or priorities, such as the configurable rules or priorities added or modified by the rules or priorities process  (described further below) or by a carrier. For example, the set of rules may include a first rule that attempts to treat the recognized audio input as an audio command . In accordance with this rule, the audio routing module  may determine whether the recognized audio input  includes any known commands, such as the commands stored in the terms or macros data store  (described further below). Example commands may be navigational commands, such as a command to direct a user interface (UI) to open an application, return to a home screen, or perform other actions navigational operations within the UI. If the audio routing module  determines that the recognized audio input  includes one or more of the commands, then the audio routing module  may handle the recognized audio input  as an audio command . If not, then the audio routing module  may next attempt to handle the recognized audio input  as a request  made of a telecommunication device application or process or as a network search request , depending on priorities specified by the set of rules. In one implementation, the rules may give priority to first attempting to handle the recognized audio input as a request  made of a telecommunication device application or process. In such an implementation, the audio routing module  may determine whether the recognized audio input  is associated with any sort of macros or data indicating an association between specific inputs and an application or process. For example, a weather application may be associated with a set of terms or phrases and\/or may include a macro for recognizing certain terms or phrases and invoking the weather application. Such macros and terms or phrases may also be stored in the terms or macros data store . If the audio routing module  does not find a match or application\/process capable of handling the recognized audio input , then the recognized audio input  may be treated as a network search request  and sent, for example, to a search service provider, such as Google\u00ae or Yahoo\u00ae.","In another implementation, the rules may give priority to first attempting to handle the recognized audio input as a network search request . The audio routing module  may submit the recognized audio input  as a query to search service. If the search results indicate, however, that no matches were found for the recognized audio input , then the audio routing module  may handle the recognized audio input as a request  made of a telecommunication device application or process. As described above, handling the recognized audio input  as a request  may involve comparing the recognized audio input  to terms or phrases associated with an application or to macros for interacting with an application, such as macros for invoking and passing the recognized audio input  to the application. Such terms or macros may be stored in the terms or macros data store .","In some implementations, the audio routing module  may determine how to handle the audio input  based on the interaction of the user  with the button\/key . For example, if the user  presses and holds the button\/key  for a predetermined amount of time (e.g., 3 seconds), the audio routing module  may handle audio input  as a query made of telecommunication device applications . If the user  presses and quickly releases the button\/key , however, the audio routing module  may handle the same audio input  as a network search request . To enable this differential handling based on button\/key  pressing behavior, different pressing behaviors may be associated with different rules or priorities.","In further implementations, the audio routing module  or an associated process may gather context information about the telecommunication device, such as location information, date\/time, contacts, call log, browsing history, application execution context, etc., and perform the evaluating based at least in part on the context information. For example, if the user  is engaged in a phone call with another user and, while engaged in the phone call, provides as recognized audio input  the command \u201csend calendar\u201d, the audio routing module  may determine that the user  wishes to send his or her calendar to the other user based on the fact that the user is engaged in a phone call with the other user. As mentioned above, to provide audio input  while engaged in another activity, including an activity that also involves providing audio input, the user  may press the button or key , which will cause the audio input  received during or after the press to be treated as the audio input  that is to be evaluated by the audio routing module . In other implementations, the execution context may indicate that the user  is involved in a chat session, an instant messaging session, or an email message exchange by writing the communication, speaking the communication, reading the communication, and\/or listening to the communication. Such other execution contexts may each be taken into account by the audio routing module  in determining how to handle the recognized audio input . In one implementation, the context may provide a default that may be overridden by the contents of the recognized audio input . For example, if the user  were to say \u201csend calendar\u201d, the audio routing module  may interpret the recognized audio input  as a command  to send the calendar to the other user with whom the user  is currently communicating. If, on the other hand, the user  specifies a name in the audio input , such as the name of a contact of the user  stored in a contact list, the audio routing module  may ignore the context. Thus, if the user  were to say \u201csend calendar to Eric Smith\u201d while engaging in a phone call with Betty Crocker, the audio routing module  may send the calendar to Eric Smith rather than Betty Crocker. In one implementation, the audio routing module  may be configured (by rules or priorities) to, for example, send the calendar to both the name specified and the current communication partner.","In some implementations, while engaged in communication with another user and while providing audio input , the audio input  may, by default, not be relayed to the other user. In such embodiments, the default may be associated with a rule or priority which may be configured by user  or a carrier. Thus, for example, the user  may change the rule or priority to provide the audio input  by default. Also, in one implementation, words such as \u201cprivate\u201d or \u201cpublic\u201d, when included in the audio input , may be used to override a default.","In a further example, if the gathered context information is location information and the audio routing module  determines that the recognized audio input  should be handled as a network search request , the audio routing module  may include the location information as part of the network search request .","In some implementations, the audio commands  may include both commands executed on the telecommunication device  and commands executed on a remote server. Such commands  may include commands related to telecommunication device settings, telecommunication device personalizations, and\/or on telecommunication device applications, such as applications, OS, etc. . For example, the audio routing module  may determine that the recognized audio input  matches a command associated with an airplane mode setting of the telecommunication device , and the audio routing module  may handle the command  by setting the airplane mode according to the recognized audio input  (e.g., turn airplane mode on or off). The audio routing module  may be configured to execute the command  or invoke an application or process to execute the command .","In another example, the audio routing module  may determine that the recognized audio input  matches a command associated with a query of a service provider for account information. Upon making the determination, the audio routing module  may provide the recognized audio input  to the service provider, which may comprise a remote server, as a query for account information.","In further implementations, the recognized audio input  may be handled as a command  that is simultaneously executed on multiple applications or settings. If the audio routing module  determines that the recognized audio input  matches terms or phrases associated with multiple applications, then the audio routing module  may handle the recognized audio input as a command  to be executed on each of those applications or settings. For example, if the recognized audio input  is determined to include the words \u201cturn on away message\u201d, which match phrases associated with each of an email application and a text messaging application, then the audio routing module  may handle the input by executing (or invoking the applications to execute) the command  on both applications simultaneously. In one implementation, whether the recognized audio input  is executed on both applications simultaneously or only on one prioritized application may be determined by the user-configurable rules and priorities discussed above and below.","In some implementations, the recognized audio input  may be handled as a set of audio commands  associated with a macro. For example, if the recognized audio input  is \u201ctell my wife that I will be home late for dinner\u201d, the audio routing module  may locate a macro associated with the term \u201ctell\u201d which launches an email, call, or message with the contents \u201chome late for dinner\u201d. Those contents are then communicated to the person named in the recognized audio input .","In various implementations, the applications, OS, etc.  comprises any executing instructions on the telecommunication device . Such instructions include, for example, an OS of the telecommunication device , drivers for hardware components of the telecommunication device , applications providing interfaces to settings or personalizations of the telecommunication device , applications made specifically for the telecommunication device , and third party applications. Collectively these applications\/processes are hereinafter referred to as applications, OS, etc. . Such applications, OS, etc.  may be entirely or partially implemented on the telecommunication device . In some implementations, the applications, OS, etc.  may be implemented partially on another device or server.","In some implementations, as mentioned above, the applications, OS, etc.  may be invoked by the audio routing module  to execute a command  or a request . Such commands  may ask the applications, OS, etc.  to perform some task, such as initiate a call to a person specified in the recognized audio input  or change a setting of an application, OS, etc. . The requests  may ask the applications, OS, etc.  to return some data, such as the weather at a specified location, or pictures taken on a specified date. To execute both the commands  and requests , the audio routing module  must initialize an executing instance of the application, OS, etc. \u2014or discover such an instance\u2014and invoke a function of the application, OS, etc. for receiving and processing recognized audio input  and associated commands  and requests . Such recognized audio input  and an indication of the sort of request  or command  may be passed as parameters to the function of the application, OS, etc. . To initialize and invoke the application, OS, etc. , the audio routing module  may make use of telecommunication-device-level macros stored in the terms or macros data store . For the OS and for applications  that come loaded on the telecommunication device  at the time of its sale to the user , the macros may also be provided and stored. For third party applications  installed by the user  on the telecommunication device , the macros may be received and stored at the time of installation, or at some later time. In some implementations, described further below, macros may be built for the telecommunication device  by application developers  of third party applications  using the interfaces provided by the API  associated with the telecommunication device .","In further implementations, the application, OS, etc.  invoked by the audio routing module  may also be being used by the user  to enable communication with another user of another device. For example, the application, OS, etc. may be a telephony application  providing a local endpoint of a phone call. In such an example, the received command  may be a command  to conference in a third party. In response to receiving the command , the telephony application  may call and conference in the third party. In other implementations, the user  may be interacting with one application, OS, etc. , and the audio routing module  may invoke a different application, OS, etc. . For example, the user  may be using the telephony application  to engage in a phone call with another user, and the audio routing module  may initialize and invoke an email application  to, for example, email a calendar to another user, such as the other user conversing with the user  through the phone call.","In various embodiments, rather than executing a command or request contained in the recognized audio input  locally, the audio routing module  may send the determined command  or network search request  to a remote computing device via a networking fabric . The networking fabric  represents any one or more networks known in the art, such as cellular networks and\/or data networks, including wide area networks (WANs), local area networks (LANs), personal area networks (PANs), and\/or the Internet. For example, telecommunication device  could be connected to both cellular and data networks and the remote computing device could be connected exclusively to data networks. A connection between one of the telecommunication devices  and the remote computing device may be through a number of routers, base stations, and\/or telecommunication devices acting as bridges between cellular and data networks. Communications between the remote computing device and telecommunication device  utilize any sort of communication protocol known in the art for sending and receiving messages, such as the Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol (TCP\/IP) and\/or the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).","The remote computing device, in some implementations, may be associated with a search engine of a search service provider. Such a search engine may receive the recognized audio input  in the form of network search request  and may handle the network search request  as a search query. The search engine may then provide the search results to the telecommunication device  via the networking fabric . In other implementations, the remote computing device may be associated with the telecommunication service provider and may provide account information in response to receiving the recognized audio input  as a command\/request for the account information. In yet other implementations, the remote computing device may be any sort of computing device known in the art, such as a web server, database server, or any other sort of server or device and may have any sort of application or data known in the art which may be the object of a command  or request  by the audio routing module  of the telecommunication device .","In various implementations, the results  of the execution of the request , command , or network search request  may be received by the telecommunication device  from the application, OS, etc.  or from a remote computing device via the networking fabric . The results  may then be provided to the user  in some form, such as via a UI or audio output. If the recognized audio input  was handled as a command  by the audio routing module , the results  may simply comprise an indication that the command  was executed successfully or an error message indicating that the command  did not execute successfully. In one implementation, no results  may be provided in response to execution of a command . If the recognized audio input was handled as a request \/, then the information that was the object of the request \/ may comprise the results  that are provided to the user . In one implementation, if the user is engaged in communication with another user of another device, the results  may be provided to both users. Whether the results  are provided only to the user  or to the user  and other users may be determined with reference to the rules or priorities set by the rules or priorities process .","In various embodiments, as mentioned above, the audio routing module  may perform the evaluation of recognized audio input  based on configurable rules or priorities. Of those configurable rules or priorities, the user-configurable rules or priorities may be accessed, modified, added, or deleted by a rules or priorities process . The rules or priorities process  may be implemented on the telecommunication device , on another remote device or devices, or partially on both. In some implementations, the rules or priorities process  may include an audio and\/or visual interface enabling users to have read and write access to the rules and priorities utilized by the audio routing module . In one implementation, the user  may be given only read access to some portion of the rules or priorities, or no access at all. The user  may add to, modify, or delete any one or more of the rules or priorities by providing audio input, text entry, and\/or by selection of one or more UI controls.","In some embodiments, the rules or priorities may include one or more of a priority for attempting to handle the recognized audio input  as a command  before handling it as a request \/, a priority for attempting to handle the recognized audio input  as a request  of a telecommunication device application  before handling it as a network search request , or a priority for attempting to handle the recognized audio input  as a network search request  before handling it as a request  of a telecommunication device application .

For example, the user may request a picture that was taken last week. In some instances, multiple matches may be retrieved, which the user may have to select from using additional voice commands. The audio recognition module  may read selections or choices to the user  and then receive a selection from the user  of the choices.","At , the telecommunication device  may determine the type of media content. For example, upon locating the media content, the telecommunication device  may identify a type based on a file extension or other attributes of the media content. The type may be a specific file type and\/or a media type (e.g., video, audio file, picture, etc.).","At , the telecommunication device  may associate the media content with an application that can play or show the media content. The application may be stored locally on the telecommunication device or remotely on another device. For instance, with a home stereo, the application may be an input mode to play the music through a wired or a wireless streaming connection.","At , the telecommunication device  may open the application or cause the application to open on another device.","At , the telecommunication device  may initiate playback or open the media content using the application. In some embodiments, the audio recognition module  may enable the user  to operate the application using voice commands. For example, when the media content is a song, the voice commands may include \u201cpause,\u201d \u201cforward,\u201d \u201creverse,\u201d \u201cskip,\u201d \u201cstop,\u201d \u201cplay,\u201d and so forth. As discussed above, the media content may be played on the telecommunication device or controlled by the telecommunication device while being played by another device.","Using the process , the user  may access the media content by only providing voice commands that, when received by the audio recognition module  at the operation , trigger the operations -. Thus, the user may access the media content using the process  while operating a vehicle using hands-free operation of the telecommunications device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0143","num":"0142"},"figref":"FIG. 12","b":"1200"},"At , the telecommunication device  may determine whether the user  desires to identify a status of one or more contact(s). For example, the user  may desire to know which contact(s) are available to communicate via an instant message, join a video call, or otherwise interact with the user.","When the telecommunication device  determines to lookup the status of one or more contact(s), then the telecommunication device may determine the status of the contact(s) at . For example, the telecommunication device  may announce a list of contacts that are available for a particular type of contact (e.g., video call, instant message, online, etc.). In some embodiments, the audio recognition module  may allow the user to filter or narrow a list and\/or inquire a status of a particular or specified contact. Following the operation , or when no status lookup is performed (following the \u201cno\u201d route from the operation ), the process  may continue at .","At , the audio recognition module  may receive a name of a contact from the user . The contact may be stored in an address book or other collection of contacts, or may be saved in a document that is stored on the telecommunication device or a remote server. For example, the contact information may be stored in an email, such as on a signature line at the end of the email.","At , the audio recognition module  may receive a command associated with the contact from the user . For example, the user  may state \u201ccall John\u201d, \u201cemail Greg\u201d, or \u201ctext message Sally\u201d among other possible commands.","At , the audio recognition module  may determine the type of operation based on the command, which may be a call or a message request. When the type is a call (following the \u201ccall\u201d route), then processing may continue at .","At , the telecommunication device  may retrieve the contact's number. For example, the telecommunication device  may retrieve the contact's mobile telephone number, another telephone number, or an address that corresponds to a calling application, such as a VoIP calling identifier or other calling identifier. In some instances, the user , via the audio recognition module , may be prompted to select from various available numbers\/identifiers associated with a contact using a voice command (e.g., \u201ccall one\u201d when three options are provided to the user).","At , the telecommunication device  may implement the command for the contact using the number or identifier. Thus, the telecommunication device  may dial the contact or otherwise initiate a connection with the contact.","When the type is a message (following the \u201cmessage\u201d route from the operation ), then processing may continue at . At , the telecommunication device  may retrieve the contact's messaging address. For example, the telecommunication device  may retrieve the contacts email address, instant messaging name, a text messaging telephone number, or other messaging address. In some instances, via the audio recognition module , the user  may be prompted to select from various available messaging addresses associated with a contact using a voice command (e.g., \u201cemail two\u201d when three options are provided to the user).","At , the telecommunication device  may implement the command for the contact using the selected messaging address. Thus, the telecommunication device  may transmit a message to the contact.
