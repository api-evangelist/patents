Commercial airlines and certain other types of operators have adapted to interface with these computer flight systems, while other types of operators are unable to participate with at least a portion of the functionality of the computer flight system(s).","Systems, methods and machine-readable storage media for interfacing with computer flight systems in accordance with the present disclosure are described herein. Some embodiments are summarized in this section.","In one embodiment, the disclosure describes a method, which may be implemented on a computer, whereby the method includes receiving an indication of a booking on a first aircraft flight, determining, via a data processing system, that the booking causes a change in a physical capacity of a second aircraft flight that shares no common physical flight leg with the first aircraft flight, and instructing, based on the change in the physical capacity, a computer flight system to update a reservation inventory of the second aircraft flight.","In another embodiment, the disclosure describes a method, which may be implemented on a computer, whereby the method includes receiving an indication of a booking on a first aircraft flight, determining, via a data processing system, that the booking causes a change in availability for an aircraft, and instructing, based on the change in availability, a computer flight system to update a reservation inventory of a second aircraft flight.","In another embodiment, the disclosure describes a method, which may be implemented on a computer, whereby the method includes receiving an indication of a booking on a first aircraft flight, calculating, via a data processing system, a cost to operate a second aircraft flight based on the booking, and instructing, based on the cost, a computer flight system to remove at least one seat from a first booking class inventory for the second aircraft flight and to add at least one seat to a second booking class inventory for the second aircraft flight.","In another embodiment, the disclosure describes a method, which may be implemented on a computer, whereby the method includes creating, via a data processing system, a flight schedule including a plurality of aircraft flights, and sending the flight schedule and a booking class inventory associated with one of the plurality of aircraft flights to a computer flight system. The method further includes, receiving, via the data processing system, information about a cost or an availability of an aircraft, and indicating to the computer flight system, in response to the information, an update to the booking class inventory.","In another embodiment, the disclosure describes a method, which may be implemented on a computer, whereby the method includes tracking, via a data processing system, an aircraft inventory comprising a plurality of aircraft including a first aircraft, maintaining, via the data processing system, a plurality of booking class inventories for a plurality of flights including a first flight, wherein the plurality of booking class inventories includes a first booking class inventory for the first flight and a second booking class inventory for the first flight, and, in response to a bid related to the first aircraft, updating the plurality of booking class inventories by assigning at least one available seat on the first flight from the first booking class inventory to the second booking class inventory.","In another embodiment, the disclosure describes a method, which may be implemented on a computer, whereby the method includes tracking, via a data processing system, an aircraft inventory comprising a plurality of aircraft including a first aircraft, maintaining, via the data processing system, a plurality of booking class inventories for a plurality of flights including a first flight, wherein the plurality of booking class inventories includes a first booking class inventory for the first flight and a second booking class inventory for the first flight, and, in response to an update to cost or availability information related to the first aircraft, updating the plurality of booking class inventories by assigning at least one available seat on the first flight from the first booking class inventory to the second booking class inventory.","In another embodiment, the disclosure describes a data processing system that includes memory for storing an aircraft inventory comprising a plurality of aircraft including a first aircraft, and further storing a plurality of booking class inventories for a plurality of flights including a first flight. The data processing system includes at least one processor coupled to access the memory, the at least one processor configured to perform a method. The method includes tracking the aircraft inventory, maintaining the plurality of booking class inventories for a plurality of flights including the first flight, wherein the plurality of booking class inventories includes a first booking class inventory for the first flight and a second booking class inventory for the first flight, and, in response to a bid related to the first aircraft, updating the plurality of booking class inventories by assigning at least one available seat on the first flight from the first booking class inventory to the second booking class inventory.","In another embodiment, the disclosure describes a method, which may be implemented on a computer, whereby the method includes sending to a computer flight system a flight schedule including a plurality of aircraft flights with a corresponding plurality of booking class inventories, wherein the plurality of aircraft flights share no common physical flight leg with each other, receiving, via a data processing system, an indication of an update to availability or cost for an aircraft related to at least one of the plurality of flights, and maintaining, via the data processing system, the plurality of booking class inventories based on the indication.","In another embodiment, the disclosure describes a method, which may be implemented on a computer, whereby the method includes maintaining, via a data processing system, a pool of provisional flights, receiving a bid or a booking, and, in response to receiving the bid or the booking, modifying at least one booking class inventory for at least one flight in the pool of provisional flights.","In another embodiment, the disclosure describes a method, which may be implemented on a computer, whereby the method includes sending to a computer flight system a flight schedule including a plurality of provisional aircraft flights, and receiving an indication of either a bid for a cost of operating an aircraft related to a first provisional aircraft flight of the plurality of provisional aircraft flights or a booking of a seat on the first provisional aircraft flight. The method further includes maintaining, via a data processing system, a booking class inventory for a second provisional aircraft flight of the plurality of provisional aircraft flights, wherein the maintaining includes sending an indication to the computer flight system to modify the booking class inventory based on the indication.","Other embodiments and features of the present disclosure will be apparent from the accompanying drawings and from the detailed description that follows.","The following description and drawings are illustrative and are not to be construed as limiting. Numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding. However, in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order to avoid obscuring the description. References to one or an embodiment in the present disclosure are not necessarily references to the same embodiment; and, such references mean at least one.","Provided herein are systems, methods and machine-readable media for interfacing with computer flight systems. For example, one embodiment is described wherein an unknown and\/or changing inventory of aircraft, potentially including aircraft owned or operated by third parties, is managed to provide flight schedules, fare structures, and reservation inventories to computer flight systems. Another embodiment is described wherein aircraft inventory is allocated dynamically and\/or adjusted in real-time in response to bookings of seats on aircraft flights in the flight schedule. Another embodiment is described wherein aircraft inventory may be changed by suppliers of aircraft, including changes to costs for using a portion of the inventory (e.g., using an aircraft for a day), and a management system may modify booking class inventories on one or more flights in the flight schedule in response. Another embodiment is described that is adapted to mitigate financial risks of operating at least a portion of the flight schedule, including through modifying reservation inventories, modifying booking class inventories, instructing certain aircraft to fly certain flights and\/or instructing certain aircraft not to fly certain flights. Another embodiment is described for managing computer flight systems for items other than aircraft flights, such as tickets for bus or train travel.","For example, methods for maintaining relationships between flights and for managing aircraft inventories with respect to those flights, as described further herein, may be used for maintaining relationships between travel on other vehicles or other modes of transport and may be used for managing other transportation vehicle inventories. Similarly, systems and machine-readable media adapted to implement some of the methods described further herein may be applied to interfacing with computer flight systems for other transportation modes, and reservations may be booked that need not necessarily relate to seats on these transportation modes. For example, reservations for rooms and\/or cargo areas for lading on a ship may be booked as described further herein. Some examples of vehicles and other transportation modes include automobiles, taxis, buses, trains, ships, ferries, and shuttle services. As described herein, booking class inventories are discussed with respect to aircraft flights, but that other types of reservation classifications may be used for other forms of transport.","Computer flight systems include flight publishing systems, computer reservations systems known as \u201cCRS\u201d, and global distribution systems known as \u201cGDS\u201d, such as Sabre. These computer flight systems may publish flight information and\/or make available bookings of seats on behalf of operators of the flights (e.g., commercial airlines). Users of a computer flight system view the details of the flights and the users may include several industry entities such as individual purchasers, potential passengers, corporate or volume purchasers, travel agents, reservation assistants, and automated systems. Each user may interact with the computer flight system to search for aircraft flights within the flight schedule matching certain criteria (e.g., origin\/destination pair, time of flight) and having available seats in one or more booking class inventories, as listed under certain booking class codes. Systems, methods and machine-readable media described herein may communicate with a computer flight system directly or indirectly, such as through communications conduits and\/or intermediate systems that, in turn, communicate with the computer flight system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","106","100","104","102","106","100","104","106","104","102","106","104","106","102"]},"In one embodiment, the computer flight system  may expect that management system  is a typical provider of data, such as a scheduled air carrier or commercial airline, and may only accept certain input data types. For example, computer flight systems  may provide certain rules about how information from providers of flights, such as commercial airlines, charter operations operators, or others must be formatted for acceptance by the computer flight system. Some standard input data include a flight schedule, a fare structure, a reservation inventory of available seats in one or more booking classes associated with flights in the flight schedule wherein those available seats are offered for booking through class codes recognized by the computer flight system. The computer flight system  may provide information about bookings made on flights to outside entities, and a management system  may receive this information from the computer flight system, such as over a network. Information received may take several forms, such as an indication of a booking, or indirect information from which a booking may be inferred.","One exemplary set of input data includes a flight schedule of future flights. A flight schedule may include aspects of future flights such as origin and destination locations (e.g., airports), dates of aircraft flights, times of aircraft flights, aircraft type, aircraft configuration, passenger terminal, in-flight service, reservation booking designators, and\/or traffic restriction codes. Flight schedules may include some of these data and may omit other data. In some embodiments, the flight schedule may be formatted in a manner similar or identical to formatting for a computer flight system . For example, the flight schedule may be formatted similarly or so as to be compatible with a computer flight system  (e.g., a CRS system). In some embodiments, a flight schedule may be transmitted to a computer flight system  and later retrieved by the management system  to confirm that the management system has a consistent copy of the flight schedule.","Another exemplary set of input data includes a fare structure including fares, booking class codes, and\/or restrictions for seats on aircraft flights and\/or itineraries. For example, a fare structure may include multiple fares relating to multiple booking classes of tickets for an aircraft flight. In one embodiment, a fare structure includes at least two classes of tickets and an associated fare for each class of ticket. As described further herein, multiple booking classes may be used to adjust the fare or the selling price for booking an available seat on an aircraft flight, such as selecting a fare based on a cost for operating the aircraft flight.","Another exemplary set of input data includes a reservation inventory for a flight represented by a number of booking classes for the flight and a number of seats available on the flight for each booking class. A booking class inventory is a set of seats that are available in a single booking class and a reservation inventory for a flight is a collection of one or more booking class inventories for that flight. For example, a reservation inventory for a flight may include five booking class inventories for that flight. Available seats on a flight may be offered for bookings through these one or more booking class inventories, with each booking class inventory indicating an availability of seats for that booking class. In some instances, one booking class on a particular flight may have no available seats, and therefore may have a booking class inventory of zero seats, whereas a different booking class on the same flight may have several available seats offered for bookings and a positive booking class inventory. As described further herein, a booking class inventory may be updated to add or remove an available seat for a flight, and the reservation inventory for that flight may be increased or reduced, respectively, by that one available seat. For example, four available seats may be added to one booking class inventory for a flight, twelve available seats may be added to a second booking class inventory for the flight, and the reservation inventory for the flight may thereby be increased by sixteen available seats. As another example, also described further herein, an available seat may be removed from one booking class inventory of a flight and may be added to another booking class inventory of the flight, thereby modifying the reservation inventory and the two booking class inventories, while leaving unchanged the total number of available seats for the flight.","In one embodiment, a flight may have available seats in only one booking class inventory of several booking class inventories, each corresponding to a fare associated with costs of serving the first booking (e.g., a first booking of one or more seats) on the flight or a subsequently-booked seat on the flight. For example, a flight may have 25 available seats, and all may be part of a single booking class inventory before a first booking is received for the flight. After the first booking is received, as described further herein, all of the remaining available seats are removed from the single booking class inventory and are allocated to another booking class inventory. In another embodiment, a flight may have available seats in more than one booking class inventory simultaneously.","A purchaser , an agent  (e.g., someone purchasing a ticket on behalf of a passenger), or other sales channels  may be offered bookings for the entire reservation inventory (e.g., all booking classes that have available seats) for the aircraft flight. For example, a reservation inventory may include available seats in only one booking class at any time, resulting in a ticket being offered for sale at only one fare at a time. Such fares may be described in an associated fare structure. In one embodiment, different booking classes will represent different levels of service as perceived by the passenger, such as, for example, a difference in seating space. In another embodiment, different booking classes may represent a non-stop routing, a single-stop routing, or a multiple-stop routing (e.g., associated with multiple different flight numbers). In another embodiment, different booking classes represent similar or the same level of service as perceived by the passenger.","The computer flight system  may maintain the reservation inventory through modifying a booking class inventory based on instructions from users of the system, such as to reserve an available seat. In one embodiment, as described further herein, one or more booking class inventories may be modified by the management system . For example, a management system  may wish to update the available seats in a booking class inventory as published by the computer flight system , such as in response to a booking of a seat, or in response to the management system determining a new cost associated with the flight, as described further herein. For example, the management system  may receive an indication that an available seat has been booked (e.g., a notice from the computer flight system ), and the management system may determine that one or more adjustments should be made to one or more booking class inventories based on that indication. As described further herein, the management system  may responsively send an instruction to the computer flight system  to modify the number of available seats within a booking class inventory that is published by the computer flight system.","The system includes suppliers  of aircraft, such as jets , , turbo-props, or helicopters . In general, suppliers  include any entity that controls or manages one or more aircraft, such as a jet . For example, a supplier  may own, lease or otherwise have control sufficient to schedule the use of the aircraft. A supplier  may be an aircraft charter operation operator and may operate through selling individual days of use of an aircraft, such as jet  from a particular origin. A supplier  may operate through leasing or selling other portions or uses of its aircraft inventory. For example, a supplier may lease or sell use of an aircraft by the hour, by the distance travelled, and\/or by the number of flights or flight-legs travelled. In one embodiment, a supplier  may use the management system  to manage the use of the supplier's own aircraft.","In one embodiment, a supplier  of aircraft may control a single inventory of aircraft, such as jets  and helicopter . For example, a supplier  may own aircraft and may not control any other aircraft. In another embodiment, a supplier  may own aircraft and transact (e.g., lease, partially own) other aircraft such that the supplier manages more than one inventory. For example, a first supplier  may have another jet , for which a day of use is transacted (e.g., sold) to a second supplier , thereby creating a combined inventory for the second supplier that also contains the jet .","Suppliers  may provide use of their aircraft to the management system  in exchange for fees. For example, a supplier  may offer the use of an aircraft for a day, starting at an originating location for a fee, a fee which may be the same as or different from a fee charged for another sale of a day's use of the aircraft (e.g., a charter sale). In one embodiment, the supplier  may enter into a contract with the management system  that allows the management system to control the use of the aircraft (e.g., jet ) for a day starting at an originating airport. The contract may be formed such that the management system  may execute and\/or enforce the contract (e.g., to commit an airplane to fly a certain aircraft flight). For example, the contract may be executed by the management system  in response to certain information received, such as a booking of a seat on a flight or a change of status of a flight, as described further herein. These and other occurrences or information may trigger a contract to form, be executed, and\/or become enforceable.","Contracts between the management system  and various suppliers  may set forth rules regarding how a supplier may offer to the management system a bid (e.g., for a cost to the management system) for using an available aircraft, such as for the day. This bid will be any indication sufficient to inform the management system  of a cost for the use of an available aircraft under certain restrictions. For example, a bid may be an indication of a price that the supplier  is willing to receive, at least at the present time, to cause an available aircraft (e.g., an airplane) to be operated under the direction of the management system . Relationships and\/or contracts between the management system  and various suppliers of aircraft  may differ from supplier to supplier.","In addition to presenting the management system  with bids for aircraft, the supplier  may provide availability parameters as part of the bid. In one embodiment, a bid from a supplier  may be for one aircraft with certain constraints on its use. In another embodiment, a bid from a supplier  may be for multiple aircraft. For example, a bid may be for a single unit or grouping of multiple aircraft. As another example, a bid may be for individual aircraft with a certain maximum number of aircraft available. As another example, a bid may be for individual aircraft, and the bid may be conditioned on a certain minimum number of aircraft used and a maximum number of aircraft available. In one embodiment, a bid may contain certain conditions. In another embodiment, a bid may have different prices based on whether a condition is met or is not met. For example, a bid may contain a price for use of an aircraft if a certain number of aircraft are used and a price for use of an aircraft if that number (e.g., or a lesser number) are used. In one embodiment, the management system  may receive from a supplier  an indication of a maximum financial risk related to the supplier's bids. For example, a supplier  may indicate a certain total value of commitments that the supplier is willing to have outstanding to the management system  at any one time. For example, a supplier  may wish to limit the total dollar value of committed aircraft to one hundred thousand dollars, such as may be reached when the management system  accepts five bids with a total value of one hundred thousand dollars. In one embodiment, the supplier  may indicate certain conditions on a total value amount, such as a maximum financial risk for bids accepted for operations during a certain timeframe. For example, a supplier  may indicate that bids accepted by the management system  that commit aircraft of the supplier to fly may not exceed two million dollars for a given time period of commitments, such as two million dollars per month. In one embodiment, an indication of maximum financial risk is a condition on the supplier's bid, as described further herein, such that the bid may only be accepted by the management system  (e.g., and the aircraft committed to fly) if doing so does not exceed the maximum financial risk indicated by the supplier .","The management system  may establish with particular rules or operating parameters as to when bids and\/or availability of aircraft may be changed by the suppliers . In one embodiment, the management system  may only accept bid updates and\/or availability updates that meet these criteria. In another embodiment, the management system  may accept a bid update and\/or an availability update within certain parameters without a fee or with a lower fee and may accept the same update outside those parameters for a fee or a larger fee.","In one embodiment, a bid may include availability information for an aircraft and may be combined with cost of using the aircraft. For example, the combination may include a contingent availability based on a certain associated cost or range of costs. A combination of availability and cost may include a temporal component, such that availability may be offered at a first price, but eventually accepted at another price. As another example, a bid may be in the form of an auction bid. In another embodiment, a bid may include a range of costs offered to the management system  or a best offer.","In some embodiments, the supplier  may be the same entity or a portion of the entity that operates the management system . For example, the management system  may have a subsidiary or related company that owns, leases or manages the aircraft. Bids for aircraft between related companies may appear in formats specific to the particular relationship between the supplier  and the entity operating the management system . For example, the management system  may register a bid from a supplier  that is independent from the operator of the management system in a format of monetary exchange, e.g., currency or credits. As another example, a management system  that is operated by an entity related to the supplier  (e.g., related company, subsidiary, business division) may rely on an internally-recognized format for accepting the bid.","A bid may be associated with any number of constraints set forth by the supplier , requested by the management system  (e.g., through a request), and\/or agreed upon by the management system and the supplier (e.g., in a contract). For example, a bid may relate to a particular date which the aircraft will be used, such as a cost to use the aircraft on that date. As another example, a bid may relate to a particular aircraft with a certain capacity or number of available seats, and with particular operating requirements (e.g., crew fatigue, work rules, operating time). As another example, a bid may relate to a location or locations that the aircraft may originate from. In one embodiment, a bid may have a range of constraint(s), such as a date range or a range of aircraft\/capacities. In another embodiment, a bid may relate only to a single aircraft, a single date, and\/or a single originating location. For example, the management system  may require that bids relate only to a specific aircraft, but may allow ranges of dates and\/or multiple possible originating locations. As other examples, constraints on a bid may include operating airport, aircraft capacity, length of crew duty day, outstanding financial balance, number of weekly operations in a city pair.","The management system  receives bids from one or more suppliers  and processes these bids, as described further herein. For example, the management system  may compare bids for aircraft with similar constraints (e.g., same date, same originating location) and\/or aircraft that can operate similar or the same flights in a flight schedule. In one embodiment, a management system  may compare the bids (e.g., costs to the management system) to use two different aircraft (e.g., from different suppliers  or from the same supplier) for similar or the same flights. For example, an aircraft may have particular constraints, which may be physical constraints or imposed by the supplier , that allows the aircraft to fly certain flights of a flight schedule but not others. The management system  may compare only those bids that relate to aircraft that share those certain flights of the flight schedule. In another embodiment, a management system  may compare dissimilar bids from a supplier  with those from another supplier, such as where some or all of the bids compared relate to aircraft able to fly flights that have little or no overlap between them. For example, the management system  may compare bids for aircraft that service different flights where such comparison is appropriate.","In one embodiment, an agreement may exist between the operator of the management system  and the supplier  and a bid submitted by the supplier to the management system incorporates one or more portions of the agreement. For example, a bid may implicitly refer to an agreement with the supplier  that submits the bid and\/or may incorporate by reference terms from that agreement. For example, a bid may contain only a price, but may be interpreted by the management system as stating that, at that price, the supplier  is offering the use of an aircraft under the terms of the agreement with the operator of the management system  given certain conditions (e.g., aircraft type, date, originating airport).","In some embodiments, the management system  may compare present bids with previous or historical bids for aircraft. For example, present bids for aircraft may be compared to historical bids for aircraft flying similar or the same flights. As another example, present bids for aircraft may be compared to historical bids for aircraft flying partially overlapping and\/or completely distinct flights. As another example, historical bids for aircraft may be selected by the management system  and used to create a representative bid (e.g., average) for a particular unit of aircraft (e.g., an average bid for a day's use from a Boston-area airport). In some embodiments, the management system  may compare a combination of different types of bids and metrics to a present bid. For example, any type of determinations made in generating fare structures, as described further herein, may be used in comparing or evaluating present bids.","As described further herein, the management system  may process, compare and\/or analyze bids with respect to each other. The management system  may use availability of aircraft reflected by and associated with the bids to create a virtual inventory of the aircraft. The virtual inventory may be virtual in several respects. In one embodiment, the virtual inventory of aircraft includes aircraft that have been offered to be available on a certain date, but not committed to fly flights on that date until a later time, if at all. In another embodiment, the virtual inventory of aircraft may be controlled by a supplier  (e.g., through an update to availability) at any time before the aircraft is committed to fly on a particular date. For example, as described further herein, a supplier  may modify the availability of an aircraft based on rules of the management system  and\/or based on a contract between the management system and the supplier. Several suppliers , with potentially overlapping availability of aircraft (e.g., availability on the same date, availability at the same originating location), may provide the management system  with a virtual inventory of aircraft.","The management system  may use a virtual inventory of aircraft to create a reservation inventory for flights in a flight schedule. As described further herein, based on availability and bid information from supplier(s) , the management system  may provide a certain reservation inventory with available seats in one or more booking classes to the computer flight system  for flights in the flight schedule. Also as described further herein, based on determinations made with respect to the virtual inventory and\/or various analyses, the management system  may adjust booking class inventories with the computer flight system  for one or more flights in order to limit risk and maximize expected and\/or known profitability. In one embodiment, the logic and\/or processors included in a management system  may be co-located or shared with the computer flight system . In another embodiment, a management system  may be located separately and may transmit information (e.g., an instruction) to the computer flight system . For example, information from the management system  may cause the computer flight system  to adjust a stored value, such as a booking class inventory, as described further herein.","In one embodiment, described further herein, a flight schedule may be created and a fare structure may be created before aircraft are known by the management system  to be available to fly flights of the flight schedule. For example, before aircraft are identified by suppliers  as available to fly flights on the flight schedule, the management system  may create the flight schedule and an associated fare structure and provide both to the computer flight system . As another example, a flight schedule may be created based on previous or anticipated demand. As another example, a fare structure may be created based on historical data, rather than any present bids. As another example, a flight schedule and\/or a fare structure may be created based on current contracts with suppliers and potential aircraft that may be available in the future.","In one embodiment, described further herein, an available seat may be allocated to a booking class inventory based on an initial bid relating to an aircraft available to fly a flight. For example, a flight schedule including the flight may be sent to a computer flight system  without available seats for some or all of the flights. The management system  may receive a bid with associated availability information for an aircraft and, based on that bid\/availability information, the management system may cause (e.g., send an update instruction to) the computer flight system  to update one or more booking class inventories for one or more of the flights. In one embodiment, the number of available seats in a reservation inventory (e.g., the total number of available seats in all booking classes) on a flight is equal to a number of available seats on a single aircraft available to fly the flight. For example, if only one aircraft is available to fly either of two flights and has 50 available seats, then the reservation inventory will be published as 50 for each flight. As another example, if a first aircraft available to fly a flight has 50 available seats and a second aircraft available to fly a flight has 75 seats, then the reservation inventory will be published as 75. In one embodiment, if a plurality of aircraft are each available to fly one or more flights, a certain aircraft is selected by the management system  as a primary option for flying the plurality of flights, and the available seats or the unused physical capacity for the primary option aircraft will be used as the total reservation inventory. For example, if a first aircraft available to fly a flight has 50 available seats and is chosen as the primary option for flying the flight, even though a second aircraft available to fly the flight has 75 seats, then the reservation inventory will be published as 50. In some embodiments, the reservation inventories for a plurality of flights may be related to the physical capacity (e.g., total seating capacity) for multiple aircraft for which bids have been received and are available to fly those flights. For example, if the total physical capacity of an aircraft inventory capable of flying a plurality of flights is equal to 200 seats, such as with two aircraft each with 100 available seats, then 200 seats may be allocated to the reservation inventories for each of the plurality of flights. As described further herein, booking class inventories may be modified by a management system in response to bookings and\/or determinations made with respect to costs for the flight.","The management system  may update certain information submitted to the computer flight system  based on rules and\/or contract(s) with the computer flight system. In one embodiment, the computer flight system  establishes the same or similar rules for each submitting entity, such as the management system , or other entities submitting flight schedules, fare structures, reservation inventories, and\/or booking classes. For example, other submitting entities may include scheduled air carriers. In another embodiment, the computer flight system  may establish distinct rules for the management system  to update information it has submitted to the computer flight system. For example, the computer flight system  may allow updates to a flight schedule of future flights only certain times during each week. As another example, the computer flight system  may allow updates to a flight schedule of future flights at regular intervals throughout a day. As another example, the computer flight system  may allow updates to a booking class inventory immediately and in real-time. As another example, the computer flight system  may allow updates to a fare structure only at certain times during the day.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","202","204","206","208"]},"The method  includes creating a flight schedule in step . A flight schedule may include more flights than could be served by an inventory of aircraft that are available and\/or have received bids for operating. For example, the number of aircraft available to originate from an airport may be physically unable to fly each of the flights on the flight schedule that originate from that airport. The number of aircraft available to originate from a particular location may include a number of aircraft resident at the location, a number of aircraft available to fly from the location on a particular date, and\/or a number of aircraft that are committed to fly to the location in sufficient time to operate another later flight leaving from the location. As described further herein, an inventory of aircraft may not be sufficient to fly each of the flights in the flight schedule, particularly if portions of the inventory are virtual or changing. For example, an aircraft inventory may be subject to some condition (e.g., on accepting a bid) and\/or aircraft may be removed from availability (e.g., based on a booking, based on a supplier's actions).","A flight schedule may be created in step  based on historical data, present market conditions, and\/or other factors. For example, passengers may commit to flights or a block of seats on a flight before a flight schedule is created in step . As another example, flights with historically popular origin\/destination pairs and flight times may be included in the flight schedule. These and other data may be used to create a flight schedule in step . However, as described further herein, aircraft inventory need not be known or guaranteed to be available before the flight schedule is created in step . As described further herein, the flight schedule may be sent to a computer flight system after it is created in step .","The method  includes determining relationships between flights in step . When a flight schedule is presented (e.g., sent) to a computer flight system, the flight schedule may be interpreted by the computer flight system to include only independent flights. Independent flights may be operated without any requirement or dependency on another of the independent flights operating or not operating. For example, a flight schedule may be populated with independent flights that each may be flown without a requirement that any other flight in the flight schedule is flown or not flown. In step , a system operating the method, such as a computer system described further herein, determines one or more relationships between flights in a flight schedule. For example, a management system may establish dependencies between flights, risk and benefit relationships between flights, or other relationships between flights. In one embodiment, a relationship is determined in step  that if a first flight is committed to be flown, then a second flight may not be flown. For example, such a relationship may be determined in step  based on a limited inventory of aircraft to fly the first and second flights. In another embodiment, a relationship is determined in step  that if a first flight is flown non-stop, a second flight must be flown with one stop. In one embodiment, determining a relationship in step  may include determining how one flight is affected by a bid for an aircraft on another flight, a booking on another flight, or a change in availability for an aircraft flying another flight. For example, a booking may affect or change an availability for an aircraft, such as through commitment of the aircraft to fly a particular flight or through making the aircraft available to fly the particular flight. That availability change may, in turn, be determined to affect the allocation of other aircraft and\/or costs associated with aircraft allocations, such as through different costs to operate different aircraft (e.g., costs from suppliers for using aircraft). As another example, a booking on one flight may affect a physical capacity of another flight, such as through commitment of an aircraft and\/or reallocation of an aircraft between flights. For example, an aircraft may be assigned to a particular flight (e.g., through commitment to fly the flight, through being selected as a primary aircraft for that flight before a booking is received) based on a booking for another flight due to one or several factors described further herein, such as cost of operating an aircraft, financial risk (e.g., for a supplier, for an entity operating a management system) involved with committing an aircraft, and\/or restrictions on an aircraft for flying the one or more flights. Other relationships between flights, how those relationships may change, and responsive steps with respect to reservation inventories for those flights are described further herein.","The method  includes receiving information about an aircraft in step . The information received in step  may be received from any source, including external sources, sources from within a management system, sources associated with third parties, and sources related to a management system, as described further herein. For example, a management system may receive information about the aircraft in step  from a portion of the management system (e.g., a memory) or another related system or entity. As another example, a management system may receive information about the aircraft in step  from a supplier or an outside source, as described further herein. The information received in step  may include information about a bid, availability information, seating capacity or other constraints on an aircraft's service, or other information that relates to an aircraft's ability to fly flights in the flight schedule or costs for the aircraft to fly those flights. For example, a supplier may send a bid for the use of an aircraft and\/or may send an update for a bid to a management system, and that bid or update may be received in step . As another example, a supplier may send availability information and\/or may update availability information previously sent to a management system, and that information may be received in step . Information may be received in step  in any of several ways, including through electronic transmission, or through another indication that is received.","Allocating an available seat to a booking class inventory may be based on information received about an aircraft in step . For example, a particular booking class inventory may be allocated one or more available seats based on information about bids and availability of aircraft. In one embodiment, bids are compared, costs are calculated, committed and\/or potential revenues are calculated, and booking class inventories are allocated seats to maximize profitability of the proposed flight. As described further herein, there may be several booking classes for a flight, and one or more booking class inventories may have zero available seats. As described further herein, fare structures may be created with a fare for each of several booking classes on a flight and available seats may be assigned to one or more booking class inventories based on a selection of a fare associated with that booking class. Also as described further herein, the fare may be selected to match or approximate a revenue target for a booking (e.g., including one or more seats) on the flight, and the revenue target may be based on a number of factors.","The method  includes updating a booking class inventory in step . A booking class inventory may be updated in step  through adding or removing one or more available seats to\/from a booking class inventory. In one embodiment, an available seat is removed from one booking class inventory and added to another booking class inventory for the same flight, thereby changing the fare at which the seat is offered. In another embodiment, all available seats from one booking class inventory may be moved from that booking class inventory and added to another booking class inventory, thereby closing sales of seats in one booking class and opening sales of seats in another booking class. As one example, only one booking class inventory for a flight may have available seats at any one time. For example, changing the available seats for a flight from one booking class inventory to another booking class inventory may change the fare at which any seat is available for a particular flight. In another embodiment, one or more available seats may be removed from the reservation inventory of a flight and available seats may be added to the reservation inventory of another flight, such as based on a bid or a booking, as described further herein. For example, all available seats may be removed from one reservation inventory for a flight and, in some cases, as described further herein, some or all of the removed available seats may be added to the reservation inventory of another flight.","Updating the booking class inventory in step  may be performed based on relationships between flights as determined in step . In one embodiment, a booking class inventory may be updated in step  if an aircraft is committed to fly a first flight that is related to a second flight. For example, an aircraft may be committed to fly a particular flight based on a booking of a seat on the first flight and the aircraft may therefore be unable to fly a second flight. The method  may responsively update one or more booking class inventories in step  so that there are zero available seats for each booking class in the reservation inventory for the second flight, for example if there is no other available aircraft to fly the second flight.","In another embodiment, one or more booking class inventories may be updated in step  based on economic factors, as described further herein, to adjust the fare(s) offered for flight in response to information received about an aircraft. For example, a bid for an aircraft may be updated by a supplier, thus changing the effective cost of flying flights associated with the aircraft. In one embodiment, in response to the updated bid, expected revenues from selling available seats on a flight may be modified through updating a booking class inventory for the flight in step  to maintain profitability levels or risk levels for operating that flight or other flights. In another embodiment, in response to a booking of a seat on a flight a management system may modify an expected profitability level and\/or a financial risk level for another flight. For example, an aircraft may be committed to fly on a day based on the booking of a seat, and due to the booking may be able to fly other flights on that day at a reduced incremental cost, thereby increasing the profitability level of those flights and\/or reducing the risk of offering available seats on those flights at a certain fare. In one embodiment, in response to information related to an aircraft, such as a bid and\/or a booking of as seat on a first flight, one or more booking class inventories are updated in step  for one or more additional flights in the flight schedule.","In one embodiment, updating a booking class inventory in step  is performed along with maintaining relationships between flights. For example, as described further herein, aircraft may be available to fly certain pools of flights that overlap, allowing a first aircraft to fly one flight of a pool of flights and another aircraft to potentially fly other flight(s) in that pool. In response to a bid for an aircraft or a booking of a seat on a flight, the relationships between flights may be managed, updated, and\/or maintained, such as through adjusting available seats between booking class inventories for a flight or through adjusting total reservation inventories between flights. For example, an aircraft may be committed to fly a flight and other aircraft may not be available to service potential bookings on other related flights In one embodiment, a booking on a first flight may affect an incremental cost of operating another flight and, in response, one or more booking class inventories of the other flight may be updated in step , as described further herein. For example, a booking on a flight leg (e.g., from location A to location B) of a one-stop flight (e.g., from location A to location C) may affect the incremental cost of operating the one-stop flight, and the booking class inventories related to the one-stop flight may be updated in step . As another example, a booking on a flight leg (e.g., from location A to location B) that is shared by a one-stop flight (e.g., from location A to location C) may affect aircraft availability, such as committing the only available aircraft to fly from location A to location B and thus a booking class inventory for another flight (e.g., a non-stop flight from location A to location C) will be updated in step  to include no available seats.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","300","302","302","302","302","302","302"]},"In one embodiment, a fare structure is created in step  before a bid or availability information is received for an aircraft capable of flying one of the flights governed by the fare structure. For example, a fare structure may be created in step  based on historical trends, anticipated costs, competitive fares for the same or similar routes, transportation options that serve as alternatives to aircraft flights, or other relevant data. In another embodiment, a fare structure is created in step  using present bid information and\/or availability information relating to an aircraft. For example, a contract with a supplier, such as an existing contract with the supplier related to aircraft that may be available at a later time, may be used to calculate fares to be used in creating a fare structure in step .","In one embodiment, a fare structure may be created in step  using fares determined to maximize profitability and minimize risk given incomplete information about aircraft availability and costs associated with using the aircraft. For example, a supplier of aircraft may bid for an aircraft and that supplier may be selected as a primary supplier. If that primary supplier later decreases availability through removing an aircraft (e.g., an aircraft not yet committed to fly a flight), a secondary supplier with an available aircraft may be selected as the primary supplier potentially to operate the affected flights. A fare offered for one of the affected flights may then change (e.g., a potential passenger will see the change in selling price for a ticket on the affected flight) from one fare in the fare structure to another fare in the fare structure. As described further herein, a management system may accomplish the fare shift through updating the number of available seats in booking class inventories for the affected flights. As another example, fares may be selected in creating the fare structure in step  before any bids are received for aircraft available to fly flights governed by the fare structure.","In one embodiment, fares selected for creating a fare structure in step  may reflect business risk factors. For example, the first booking of a ticket for a flight may not cover the full operating cost for that flight. The difference between the revenue of the first booking (e.g., of one or more available seats) and a related operating cost plus margin at least partially establishes a risk level associated with committing to operate the flight with only that first booking. The risk level may be offset by the revenue generated by future bookings on this flight or flights operated by the same aircraft. The risk level may also include the opportunity cost of not flying other flights which may produce additional revenue.","The method  includes monitoring an aircraft inventory in step . An aircraft inventory may be entirely virtual, owned\/controlled by another party (e.g., another supplier) and\/or may contain owned\/controlled aircraft or aircraft with guaranteed availability. In one embodiment, monitoring an aircraft inventory in step  may include tracking inventory as it is adjusted, such as by suppliers submitting, updating and\/or withdrawing bids for aircraft and\/or availability of aircraft.","The method  includes monitoring bids in step . As described further herein, bids may include information about an aircraft, including constraints of the aircraft and cost for operating the aircraft. Monitoring bids in step  may include receiving bids from a supplier and\/or contacting a supplier (e.g., through automated means) for updates to bids. In alternative embodiments, bookings may be monitored, such as through requesting updates on booking information, through receiving information about bookings (described further herein), through communications with a computer flight system, and\/or through indirect indications of bookings.","Monitoring aircraft inventory in step  and\/or monitoring bids in step  may be performed through machines or computers such as through monitoring a location in memory for an update or receiving a communication regarding aircraft inventory or bids. For example, information relating to bids or inventories of available aircraft may be stored in data storage elements and referenced as part of the monitoring steps, such as in either step  or step . Monitoring aircraft inventory in step  and\/or monitoring bids in step  may be performed continually, near continually (e.g., at a hardware polling rate), or periodically.","The method  includes maintaining a pool of flights in step . In one embodiment, a pool of flights includes a plurality of flights whose reservation inventories are mutually dependent on an inventory of one or more aircraft unit(s), wherein the change of the operating cost or availability of an aircraft unit or a booking on a first flight in the pool may necessitate modifying a reservation inventory of a second flight in the pool. In another embodiment, a pool of flights includes a plurality of independent flights, as described further herein, wherein the flights share no common physical flight leg. In another embodiment, a pool of flights includes the plurality of flights that may be modified due to a change in availability of a particular aircraft unit and\/or due to a booking on a first flight. For example, a pool of flights may be maintained in step  based on relationships between the flights in the pool and may be performed in response to an updated bid, such as a change in availability information, and\/or a booking (e.g., for one of the flights in the pool). As described further herein, a flight within the pool of flights may be classified as a provisional flight, a double provisional flight, and\/or a committed flight. In one example, the flight may be a double provisional. In another example, all flights in the pool are categorized as a provisional flight or as a committed flight. Maintaining a pool of flights in step  may include modifying the classification of a flight, such as from a provisional flight to a committed flight based on a booking of a seat on that flight.","In one embodiment, maintaining a pool of flights in step  includes one or more steps, including calculating a cost in step , selecting a fare in step , and\/or assigning an available seat to a booking class inventory in step . Calculating a cost in step  may be performed using a number of different types of data, including operating cost data, other cost data (e.g., depreciation), and\/or risks of costs changing. In one embodiment, calculating a cost related to a flight in step  may only use data related to that flight, such as a cost of operating an aircraft on that flight, the physical capacity of the aircraft, and\/or the aircraft's ability to fly other flights. In another embodiment, calculating a cost related to a flight in step  uses data related to other flights, as described further herein. For example, a cost for operating a flight may depend on cost data for any other flights connecting to or otherwise related to the flight (such as being potentially combinable). In another embodiment, calculating a cost related to a flight in step  may be performed through calculating an incremental cost, such as the cost of serving an additional destination. For example, an incremental cost may be calculated in consideration of the status (e.g., booked, yet to be booked) of a related flights and\/or in consideration of costs associated with the related flights. In other embodiments, a cost calculated in step  may be an operating cost, an overhead cost, a fixed cost, and\/or a variable cost. In some embodiments, calculating a cost in step  may be part of determining that a cost has changed. For example, a cost may change due to the change of data on which the cost depends, such as a bid from a supplier. Determining a cost has changed may include calculating a cost in step  and may include determining a change in the data on which the cost depends, without an explicit calculating or re-calculating of the cost.","In one embodiment, selecting a fare for a flight in step  is performed based on a cost associated with the flight. For example, a fare may be selected from a range of fares in a fare schedule that approximates an incremental cost of carrying a passenger on the flight. For the first booking received for a flight (e.g., of one or more available seats), the incremental cost of servicing that booking (e.g., flying the flight) may be equal to the entire cost of operating the flight, including the cost to operate the aircraft in addition to operating costs for operating the management system, expected return on risked assets, and\/or overhead associated with any management system. In addition, margin may be added to an incremental cost for flying a first flight. In one embodiment, a fare is selected in step  that matches or approximates the entire cost of operating the flight. In another embodiment, a fare is selected in step  that is less than the incremental cost of servicing the next booking on the flight, subjecting the entity that honors the first booking (e.g., an entity operating the management system, a supplier) to financial risk. In one embodiment, a fare is selected in step  based on a level of acceptable financial risk for booking available seats at the selected fare.","For subsequent booking(s) received for a flight (e.g., when a second booking is received) or for bookings on flights related as described further herein, the incremental cost for servicing the subsequent booking (e.g., including operating the flight with an additional passenger) may be significantly reduced. In one embodiment, a fare in the fare structure is designated as a \u201cfill fare\u201d and selecting the fare in step  is performed by selecting the \u201cfill fare\u201d for any bookings after the first booking. In another embodiment, a fare is selected in step  based on increasing profitability for additional seats booked on the flight or based on mitigating risk on a related flight. Relationships between flights that may affect selection of fares in step  are described further herein. For example, a fare selected in step  may be based on a change in incremental cost due to a potential or actual combination with another flight that is currently committed to operate. As another example, a fare may be selected in step  in order to provide additional revenue to offset the risk associated with a first booking on another flight (e.g., including an unrelated flight) that has a large incremental cost associated with committing to a first booking on the other flight. As another example, a fare for a first flight may be selected in step  based on a booking on a second flight that is combinable with the first flight.","Assigning an available seat to a booking class inventory in step  may be performed based on the fare selected in step . For example, as described further herein, a booking class inventory associated with the fare selected in step  may be assigned one or more available seats in step . As described further herein, updating a booking class inventory, such as assigning a seat to a booking class inventory in step , may be performed such that only the one booking class inventory has available seats and that booking class inventory corresponds to the fare selected in step .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0074"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","400","402","402","402"]},"The method  includes receiving information in step  that a seat has been booked on a second flight. For example, a computer flight system  may provide information about bookings made on flights to outside entities, and a management system, as described further herein, may receive this information in step  from the computer flight system, such as over a network. Information received in step  may take several forms, such as an indication of a booking, or indirect information from which a booking may be inferred. In one embodiment, the second flight may be combined with a first flight. For example, a second flight may share a common physical flight leg with the first flight. As another example, the second flight may be related to the first flight, such as a connecting flight with the first flight. In another embodiment, the second flight is different from the first flight. For example, the second flight may be unrelated to the first flight.","The method  includes transmitting an indication in step  that the first flight is to be operated at a second level of service. In one embodiment, the second level of service is superior to the first level of service. For example, the second level of service may provide an earlier arrival time or fewer number of stops between origin and destination. As described further herein, an aircraft or routing of aircraft originally intended to be flown on the first flight may be re-routed and\/or re-assigned to another flight and the replacement aircraft or routing for the first flight may be performed at the second level of service.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0077"},"figref":"FIGS. 5-10"},"As described further herein, booking class inventories may be updated (e.g., through communicating with a computer flight system) in order to modify the fare at which a ticket for a particular flight is offered to be sold. For each provisional flight, available seats for a booking class may be offered for sale at a fare selected as described further herein. Reservation inventories on provisional flights may include available seats in one or more booking class inventories, seats which may be removed after an aircraft is committed to fly another flight. For example, if either of two flights may be flown by one aircraft, but that aircraft may not fly both flights, both flights may be classified as provisional flights and may have reservation inventories with available seats. In response to a booking on one of the flights, if there is no other aircraft that can fly the second flight, the reservation inventory for the second flight may be modified to indicate zero available seats across all booking class inventories. As described further herein, bids, bookings, availability information, and\/or other information about an aircraft may cause certain booking class inventories to be modified to zero while one or more booking class inventories remain with available seats, or are modified to add an available seat. However, in situations where the booking of one flight depletes the aircraft availability such that there is not an aircraft available to fly another flight, all the booking class inventories for the other flight will be reduced to zero, thereby closing that other flight to bookings. Additional aircraft that could fly the flight may be available or become available, and additional seats may be added to the reservation inventory for the flight based on the additional aircraft, subject to the selection of fare associated with the booking class(es) and profitability\/cost analyses described further herein. For example, if an additional aircraft is already known to be available and could fly a flight, such as an aircraft that has not been selected as a primary option for flying the flight, seats may be added\/subtracted from the reservation inventory for the flight to match the capacity of the additional aircraft and available seats may be allocated from one booking class inventory to another booking class inventory based on costs of the additional aircraft, as described further herein. Additional available aircraft may thereby keep a flight open for bookings, potentially at a new fare level for the newly-available seats.","Certain relationships between provisional flights, double provisional flights, and committed flights may be based on the capabilities of aircraft inventories to fly the flights. For example, a pool of flights may include flights that may be flown by a plurality of aircraft and may include in the pool of flights provisional, double provisional and committed flights. In a pool of flights, relationships between the flights may be maintained, as described further herein, through updating one or more reservation inventories for the flights within the pools, and thereby modifying which flights have available seats and\/or which fares are offered for the available seats, such as through allocating the available seats between one booking class inventory and another booking class inventory.","Various scenarios are presented for managing a pool of flights including provisional flights in  with a simplifying assumption that only one aircraft is available to fly all of the flights. Therefore, based on a booking for a flight within the pool of flights, certain other flights in the pool may have their reservation inventories reduced to zero available seats and therefore may be closed for sale. Flights are referred to in  by their physical flight legs between locations in order to clarify the routing of the flights shown in each scenario. Flights may be referred to in a flight schedule by the individual flight legs and\/or as flights, such as one-stop flights or multiple-stop flights.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0081"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["502","504","506","502","504","506"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0082"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["602","608","610","604","606","602","604","606"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0084","num":"0083"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["702","704","702","704"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0085","num":"0084"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["802","806","804","808","802","806","802","806","808","802","802","806","808"]},"With a single presumed aircraft available to originate from location A, a management system may determine that it is undesirable, not cost-effective, or otherwise unworkable to fly the aircraft between locations B and C on flight legs  or  without a first booking of one or more seats on flight leg  or .

The computer-readable media may store the instructions that may be executed by processors.","The instructions may also be embodied in digital and analog communication links for electrical, optical, acoustical or other forms of propagated signals, such as carrier waves, infrared signals, digital signals, etc. However, propagated signals, such as carrier waves, infrared signals, digital signals, etc. are not tangible machine readable medium and are not configured to store instructions.","In general, a tangible machine readable medium includes any mechanism that provides (e.g., stores) information in a form accessible by a machine (e.g., a computer, network device, personal digital assistant, manufacturing tool, any device with a set of one or more processors, etc.).","In various embodiments, hardwired circuitry may be used in combination with software instructions to implement the techniques. Thus, the techniques are neither limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software nor to any particular source for the instructions executed by the data processing system.","Although some of the figures illustrate a number of operations in a particular order, operations which are not order dependent may be reordered and other operations may be combined or broken out. While some reordering or other groupings are specifically mentioned, others will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art and so do not present an exhaustive list of alternatives. Moreover, it should be recognized that certain operations could be implemented in hardware, firmware, software or any combination thereof.","It is clear that many modifications and variations of this embodiment can be made by one skilled in the art without departing from the spirit of the novel art of this disclosure. For example, the systems and method herein disclosed can be applied to many different reservations systems. Also, while specific reference to aircraft flight reservations may have been disclosed, other transportation reservations or other reservations may also be used. These modifications and variations do not depart from the broader spirit and scope of the present disclosure, and the examples cited here are illustrative rather than limiting."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The embodiments are illustrated by way of example and not limitation in the figures of the accompanying drawings in which like references indicate similar elements.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIGS. 5-10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 11"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
