The compounds produced in this manner are listed in Table V below including corresponding physical data. 2-(2-Chloro-4-hydroxyphenyl)ethylamine-tert-butylcarbamate was prepared as described in WO 2004026305 A1. 2-(2-Fluoro-4-methoxyphenyl)ethylamine hydrochloride was prepared from 2-fluoro-4-methoxybenzaldehyde as described in US 20110054173 A1. 2-(3-Methoxy-4-hydroxyphenyl)ethylamine-tert-butylcarbamate was prepared according to literature precedents in Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry (2011), 19(2), 783-788 and in European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry (2008), 43(6), 1160-1170. 6-Dichloro-5-pyrimidinecarboxylic acid methyl ester was prepared from 4,6-dihydroxypyrimidine as described in Journal of Medicinal Chemistry (2010), 53(13), 5012-5024.","2-(2-Fluoro-4-methoxyphenyl)ethylamine hydrochloride (270 g, 1.6 mol) was carefully added portionwise to 48% HBr (1.5 L) and stirred for 4 h at 140\u00b0 C. The reaction solution was reduced in vacuo, then acetonitrile (1 L) was added to the residue and was evaporated to dryness. The crude product was stirred in diisopropylether and recovered by filtration to afford 222 g (940 mmol, 59%) of desired phenol. The purified phenol was dissolved in dichloromethane (DCM, 1.5 L) to which was added triethylamine (275 mL), tert-butyloxycarbonyl anhydride (215 g, 990 mmol) in a solution of DCM (500 mL), and was stirred for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction solution was washed with water, dried over NaSOand then concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified by flash silica column chromatography (4:1 cyclohexane:MTBE) to afford 220 g (860 mmol, 92%) of 2-(2-Fluoro-4-hydroxyphenyl)ethylamine-tert-butyl carbamate.","To a solution of N-tert-butyloxy-carbonyl-protected tyramine (130 g, 550 mmol), potassium carbonate (76 g, 550 mmol) and catalytic amounts of potassium iodide in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP, 400 mL) that was stirred for 10 minutes at room temperature was added 4-chloro-2-trifluoromethylpyridine (100 g, 550 mmol). The reaction mixture was then heated to 160\u00b0 C. for 6 h, cooled, poured into water and extracted with methyl tert-butylether (MTBE, 3\u00d7). The combined organic layers were washed with succesivly with 3 N NaOH and water, dried over NaSO, and reduced in vacuo. The crude residue was purified by flash silica gel column chromatography to afford a 48% (102 g, 265 mmol) yield of N-tert-butyloxycarbonyl-protected 2-[4-[[2-(trifluoromethyl)-4-pyridyl]oxy]phenyl]ethanamine. To a solution of this material in dioxane (200 mL) was added 4 M HCl in dioxane (250 mL). The solution was left overnight to stir at room temperature, which resulted in precipitation of 2-[4-[[2-(trifluoromethyl)-4-pyridyl]oxy]phenyl]ethanamine. The reaction solution was evaporated and the residue was stirred with pentane and filtered to provide 100% (37 g, 104 mmol) of the desired amine hydrochloride.","To a solution of 4-hydroxyphenylethylamine hydrochloride (300 mg) in N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF, 5 mL) was added diisopropylethylamine (355 mg, 2 equiv.). The solution was stirred for 5 min before the addition of 4,6-dichloro-5-methoxypyrimidine (249 mg, 1 equiv.). The reaction mixture was then stirred for 16 h at room temperature before it was concentrated in vacuo. The residue was dissolved in DMF (10 mL) and was stirred with sodium hydride (66 mg, 2.2 equiv.) for 20 min at room temperature. Another portion of 4,6-dichloro-5-methoxypyrimidine (269 mg, 1.2 equiv.) was introduced into the reaction mixture, which was then left to stir at room temperature for 48 h. The DMF was then removed in vacuo and the product was purified by flash silica column chromatography to afford 178 mg (31% yield) of the product as a white solid.","To a solution of 2-[2-fluoro-4-[[4-(trifluoromethyl)-2-pyridyl]oxy]phenyl]ethanamine hydrochloride (378 mg, 1 mmol) in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (5 mL) was added diisopropylethylamine (0.4 mL, 2.3 mmol). The solution was stirred for 5 min at room temperature at which time 4,6-dichloro-5-methylpyrimidine (150 mg, 0.8 mmol) was added. The reaction mixture was stirred at 80\u00b0 C. overnight then allowed to cool to room temperature. Water was added and was extracted with MTBE (3\u00d7). The combined organic layers were washed with water, dried over NaSO, and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified by flash silica column chromatography to provide 330 mg (0.80 mmol, 84%) of the light yellow solid product.","The compounds listed in Table V have been prepared in an analogous manner.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0210","num":"0307"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00007","num":"00007"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"301pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE V"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Compounds V-1 to V-49 of formula I.A as defined above"},{"entry":"and wherein Rand Rin each case are hydrogen."}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"10"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"9","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"10","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["ex.",{},{},{},{},{},{},{},"HPLC","m.p."]},{"entry":["no","R","R","R","Het","R","X","(R)*","R(min)","(\u00b0 C.)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"10","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"10"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"9","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"10","colwidth":"21pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["V-1","H","Cl","Cl","H-1","H","\u2014CH\u2014","n = 0","3.999","89"]},{"entry":["V-2","H","H","Cl","H-1","H","\u2014CH\u2014","n = 0","3.568","135"]},{"entry":["V-3","H","Me","Cl","H-1","H","\u2014CH\u2014","o-F;
