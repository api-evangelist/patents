{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This non-provisional patent application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional patent application No. 62\/119,862, filed on Feb. 24, 2015 and U.S. provisional application No. 61\/977,774, filed on Apr. 10, 2014, both of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.","The present invention relates to small molecule compounds and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof that are inhibitors of \u03b2-site amyloid precursor protein (APP) Cleaving Enzyme 1 (BACE1) and inhibitors of BACE2. This invention relates to inhibiting the production of A-beta peptides that can contribute to the formation of neurological deposits of amyloid protein. The present invention also relates to the treatment of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative and\/or neurological disorders, as well as the treatment of diabetes in mammals, including humans. More particularly, this invention relates to thioamidine compounds and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof useful for the treatment of neurodegenerative and\/or neurological disorders, such as AD and Down's Syndrome, related to A-beta peptide production.","Dementia results from a wide variety of distinctive pathological processes. The most common pathological processes causing dementia are Alzheimer's disease (\u201cAD\u201d), cerebral amyloid angiopathy (\u201cCM\u201d) and prion-mediated diseases (see, e.g., Haan et al., Clin. Neurol. Neurosurg., 1990, 92(4):305-310; Glenner et al., J. Neurol. Sci., 1989, 94:1-28). AD is a progressive, neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory impairment and cognitive dysfunction. AD affects nearly half of all people past the age of 85, the most rapidly growing portion of the United States population. As such, the number of AD patients in the United States is expected to increase from about 4 million to about 14 million by 2050.","The accumulation of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2 peptides) is believed to be one of the underlying causes of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), which is the most common cause of cognitive decline in the elderly (Hardy & Allsop, Trends Pharmacol Sci., 1991; 12(10):383-8; Selkoe, Behav. Brain Res., 2008; 192(1):106-13). A\u03b2, the major protein constituent of amyloid plaques, is derived from sequential cleavage of the type I integral membrane protein, amyloid precursor protein (APP) by two proteases, \u03b2- and \u03b3-secretase. Proteolytic cleavage of APP by the \u03b2-site APP cleaving enzymes (BACE1 and BACE2) generates a soluble N-terminal ectodomain of APP (sAPP\u03b2) and the C-terminal fragment C99. Subsequent cleavage of the membrane-bound C99 fragment by the \u03b3-secretase liberates the various A\u03b2 peptide species, of which A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 are the most predominant forms (Vassar et al., J. Neurosci., 2009; 29(41):12787-94; Marks & Berg, Neurochem. Res., 2010; 35:181-210). Therefore, limiting the generation of A\u03b2 directly through inhibition of BACE1 is one of the most attractive approaches for the treatment of AD, as BACE1 inhibitors could effectively inhibit the formation of all predominant A\u03b2 peptides.","In addition, it has been determined that BACE1 knock-out mice had markedly enhanced clearance of axonal and myelin debris from degenerated fibers, accelerated axonal regeneration, and earlier reinnervation of neuromuscular junctions compared with littermate controls. These data suggest BACE1 inhibition as a therapeutic approach to accelerate regeneration and recovery after peripheral nerve damage. (See Farah et al., J. Neurosci., 2011, 31(15): 5744-5754).","Insulin resistance and impaired glucose homoeostasis are important indicators of Type 2 diabetes and are early risk factors of AD. In particular, there is a higher risk of sporadic AD in patients with Type 2 diabetes and AD patients are more prone to Type 2 diabetes (Butler, Diabetes, 53:474-481, 2004). Recently, it has also been proposed that AD should be reconsidered as Type 3 diabetes (de la Monte, J. Diabetes Sci. Technol., 2008; 2(6):1101-1113). Of special interest is the fact that AD and Type 2 diabetes share common pathogenic mechanisms and possibly treatments (Park S. A., J. Clin. Neurol., 2011; 7:10-18; Raffa, Br. J. Clin. Pharmacol 2011, 71(3):365-376). Elevated plasma levels of A\u03b2, the product of BACE activities, were recently associated with hyperglycemia and obesity in humans (see Meakin et al., Biochem J., 2012, 441(1):285-96; Martins, Journal of Alzheimer's Disease, 8 (2005) 269-282). Moreover, increased A\u03b2 production prompts the onset of glucose intolerance and insulin resistance in mice (C\u00f3zar-Castellano, Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab., 302:E1373-E1380, 2012; Delibegovic, Diabetologia (2011) 54:2143-2151). Finally, it is also suggested that circulating A\u03b2 could participate in the development of atherosclerosis in both humans and mice (De Meyer, Atherosclerosis 216 (2011) 54-58; Catapano, Atherosclerosis 210 (2010) 78-87; Roher, Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1812 (2011) 1508-1514).","Therefore, it is believed that BACE1 levels may play a critical role in glucose and lipid homoeostasis in conditions of chronic nutrient excess. Specifically, BACE1 inhibitors may be potentially useful for increasing insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle and liver as illustrated by the fact that reduction in BACE1 decreases body weight, protects against diet-induced obesity and enhances insulin sensitivity in mice (see Meakin et al., Biochem. J. 2012, 441(1):285-96). Of equal interest is the identification of LRP1 as a BACE1 substrate and the potential link to atherosclerosis (Strickland, Physiol. Rev., 88: 887-918, 2008; Hyman, J. Biol. Chem., Vol. 280, No. 18, 17777-17785, 2005).","Likewise, inhibition of BACE2 is proposed as a treatment of Type 2 diabetes with the potential to preserve and restore \u03b2-cell mass and stimulate insulin secretion in pre-diabetic and diabetic patients (WO2011\/020806). BACE2 is a \u03b2-cell enriched protease that regulates pancreatic \u03b2 cell function and mass and is a close homologue of BACE1. Pharmacological inhibition of BACE2 increases \u03b2-cell mass and function, leading to the stabilization of Tmem27. (See Esterhazy et al., Cell Metabolism 2011, 14(3): 365-377). It is suggested that BACE2 inhibitors are useful in the treatment and\/or prevention of diseases associated with the inhibition of BACE2 (e.g., Type 2 diabetes, with the potential to preserve and restore \u03b2-cell mass and stimulate insulin secretion in pre-diabetic and diabetic patients) (WO2011\/020806).","Aminodihydrothiazine or thioamidine compounds are described in US2009\/0082560, WO 2009\/091016 and WO 2010\/038686 as useful inhibitors of the \u03b2-secretase enzyme. Co-pending PCT application, PCT\/IB2012\/054198, filed by Pfizer Inc on Aug. 17, 2012, also describes aminodihydrothiazine compounds that are useful inhibitors of the \u03b2-secretase enzyme. The present invention is directed to novel thioamidine compounds and their use in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, including AD, as well as the treatment of metabolic diseases and conditions such as diabetes and obesity.","A first embodiment of a first aspect of the present invention is a compound of Formula I",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0011"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"39.71mm","wi":"55.12mm","file":"US09315520-20160419-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":["wherein\n        \n        ","phenyl optionally substituted with one to three R;","Ccycloalkyl optionally substituted with one to three R; and","a 5- to 10-membered heteroaryl, having one to four heteroatoms independently selected from N, O or S, wherein at least one of the heteroatoms is N and wherein said N is optionally substituted with R; and wherein said 5- to 10-membered heteroaryl is optionally substituted on carbon with one to three R;\n        \n        ","or a tautomer thereof or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of said compound or tautomer."]}}}},"Another embodiment of the present invention is a pharmaceutical composition comprising compounds of Formula I, or a tautomer thereof or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of said compound or tautomer, and a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle, diluent or carrier.

For example, the term \u201cpyridyl\u201d means 2-, 3- or 4-pyridyl, the term \u201cthienyl\u201d means 2- or 3-thienyl, and so forth.","If substituents are described as \u201cindependently\u201d having more than one variable, each instance of a substituent is selected independent of the other(s) from the list of variables available. Each substituent therefore may be identical to or different from the other substituent(s).","If substituents are described as being \u201cindependently selected\u201d from a group, each instance of a substituent is selected independent of the other(s). Each substituent therefore may be identical to or different from the other substituent(s).","As used herein, the term \u201cFormula I\u201d may be hereinafter referred to as a \u201ccompound(s) of the invention,\u201d \u201cthe present invention,\u201d and \u201ccompound of Formula I.\u201d Such terms are also defined to include all forms of the compound of Formula I, including hydrates, solvates, isomers, crystalline and non-crystalline forms, isomorphs, polymorphs, and metabolites thereof. For example, the compounds of the invention, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, may exist in unsolvated and solvated forms. When the solvent or water is tightly bound, the complex will have a well-defined stoichiometry independent of humidity. When, however, the solvent or water is weakly bound, as in channel solvates and hygroscopic compounds, the water\/solvent content will be dependent on humidity and drying conditions. In such cases, non-stoichiometry will be the norm.","The compounds of the invention may exist as clathrates or other complexes. Included within the scope of the invention are complexes such as clathrates, drug-host inclusion complexes wherein the drug and host are present in stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amounts. Also included are complexes of the compounds of the invention containing two or more organic and\/or inorganic components, which may be in stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amounts. The resulting complexes may be ionized, partially ionized, or non-ionized. For a review of such complexes, see J. Pharm. Sci., 64 (8), 1269-1288 by Haleblian (August 1975).","The compounds of the invention have asymmetric carbon atoms. The carbon-carbon bonds of the compounds of the invention may be depicted herein using a solid line (-), a solid wedge () or a dotted wedge (). The use of a solid line to depict bonds to asymmetric carbon atoms is meant to indicate that all possible stereoisomers (e.g., specific enantiomers, racemic mixtures, etc.) at that carbon atom are included. The use of either a solid or dotted wedge to depict bonds to asymmetric carbon atoms is meant to indicate that only the stereoisomer shown is meant to be included. It is possible that compounds of Formula I may contain more than one asymmetric carbon atom. In those compounds, the use of a solid line to depict bonds to asymmetric carbon atoms is meant to indicate that all possible stereoisomers are meant to be included. For example, unless stated otherwise, it is intended that the compounds of Formula I can exist as enantiomers and diastereomers or as racemates and mixtures thereof. The use of a solid line to depict bonds to one or more asymmetric carbon atoms in a compound of Formula I and the use of a solid or dotted wedge to depict bonds to other asymmetric carbon atoms in the same compound is meant to indicate that a mixture of diastereomers is present.","Stereoisomers of Formula I include cis and trans isomers, optical isomers such as R and S enantiomers, diastereomers, geometric isomers, rotational isomers, conformational isomers, and tautomers of the compounds of the invention, including compounds exhibiting more than one type of isomerism; and mixtures thereof (such as racemates and diastereomeric pairs). Also included are acid addition or base addition salts wherein the counterion is optically active, for example, D-lactate or L-lysine, or racemic, for example, DL-tartrate or DL-arginine.","When any racemate crystallizes, crystals of two different types are possible. The first type is the racemic compound (true racemate) referred to above wherein one homogeneous form of crystal is produced containing both enantiomers in equimolar amounts. The second type is the racemic mixture or conglomerate wherein two forms of crystal are produced in equimolar amounts each comprising a single enantiomer.","The compounds of Formula I may exhibit the phenomenon of tautomerism; such tautomers are also regarded as compounds of the invention. For example, the compounds of Formula I may exist in several tautomeric forms, including the 2-aminodihydrothiazine form, I, and the 2-imino-tetrahydrothiazine form, Ia. All such tautomeric forms, and mixtures thereof, are included within the scope of compounds of Formula I. Tautomers exist as mixtures of a tautomeric set in solution. In solid form, usually one tautomer predominates. Even though one tautomer may be described, the present invention includes all tautomers of the compounds of Formula I and salts thereof. Examples of tautomers are described by the compounds of Formula I and Ia and, collectively and generically, are referred to as compounds of Formula I.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0060"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00003","num":"00003"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00003","he":"85.68mm","wi":"55.20mm","file":"US09315520-20160419-C00003.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"The compounds of this invention may be used in the form of salts derived from inorganic or organic acids.

Thus, certain derivatives of the compound of the invention which may have little or no pharmacological activity themselves can, when administered into or onto the body, be converted into the compound of the invention having the desired activity, for example, by hydrolytic cleavage. Such derivatives are referred to as \u201cprodrugs.\u201d Further information on the use of prodrugs may be found in \u201cPro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems, Vol. 14, ACS Symposium Series (T. Higuchi and V. Stella) and \u201cBioreversible Carriers in Drug Design,\u201d Pergamon Press, 1987 (ed. E. B. Roche, American Pharmaceutical Association).

Compounds of the present invention, prodrugs thereof, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of said compounds or of said prodrugs that contain the aforementioned isotopes and\/or other isotopes of other atoms are within the scope of this invention. Certain isotopically labeled compounds of the present invention, for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as H and C are incorporated, are useful in drug and\/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated, i.e., H, and carbon-14, i.e., C, isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, i.e., H, can afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements and, hence, may be preferred in some circumstances. Isotopically labeled compounds of Formula I of this invention and prodrugs thereof can generally be prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed in the Schemes and\/or in the Examples and Preparations below, by substituting a readily available isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent.","A second embodiment of a first aspect of the present invention is a compound of Formula I:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0071"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00004","num":"00004"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00004","he":"39.71mm","wi":"55.12mm","file":"US09315520-20160419-C00004.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0005","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0005-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0006","list-style":"none"},"li":["wherein\n        \n        ","phenyl optionally substituted with one to three R;","Ccycloalkyl optionally substituted with one to three R;

H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d) \u03b4 11.30 (br s, 1H), 10.73 (s, 1H), 9.6-9.9 (v br s, 1H), 8.6-8.9 (v br s, 1H), 8.63 (d, J=2.7 Hz, 1H), 8.24 (d, J=8.6 Hz, 1H), 7.93 (dd, J=8.7, 2.8 Hz, 1H), 7.84 (s, 1H), 7.51 (t, J=72.8 Hz, 1H), 3.96 (AB quartet, J=12.2 Hz, \u0394\u03bd=62.6 Hz, 2H), 3.75-3.85 (m, 1H), 3.02-3.11 (m, 3H), 1.73-1.82 (m, 1H), 1.39-1.52 (m, 1H), 1.21 (d, J=6.2 Hz, 3H).","A sample of Example 1 (224 mg, 0.492 mmol) was dissolved in ethyl acetate (1 mL) at 60\u00b0 C. Hydrogen chloride (2 M in diethyl ether, 0.49 mL, 0.98 mmol) was added, and the slurry was allowed to cool to room temperature with stirring. Solvents were removed in vacuo, and the residue was dissolved in hot ethanol. The resulting solution was allowed to cool to room temperature and stand for 3 days; single crystals were observed, one of which was subjected to the X-ray crystal structure determination described below. This confirmed the indicated stereochemistry of the hydrochloride salt of Example 1. The ethanol was blown down to a minimum, and the solid was collected via filtration. This sample was crystalline by powder X-ray diffraction analysis. Yield: 200 mg, 0.41 mmol, 83%.","Data collection was performed on a Bruker APEX diffractometer at room temperature. Data collection consisted of omega and phi scans.","The structure was solved by direct methods using SHELX software suite in the space group P222. The structure was subsequently refined by the full-matrix least squares method. All non-hydrogen atoms were found and refined using anisotropic displacement parameters.","The asymmetric unit is comprised of one ionized molecule of the compound of Example 1 and one chloride ion.","The hydrogen atoms located on nitrogen and oxygen were found from the Fourier difference map and refined freely. The remaining hydrogen atoms were placed in calculated positions and were allowed to ride on their carrier atoms. The final refinement included isotropic displacement parameters for all hydrogen atoms.","The final R-index was 5.8%. A final difference Fourier revealed no missing or misplaced electron density.","Pertinent crystal, data collection and refinement information is summarized in Table XR4. Atomic coordinates, bond lengths, bond angles, torsion angles and displacement parameters are listed in Tables XR5-XR8.","Software and References",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0177","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0017","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0017-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0018","list-style":"none"},"li":["SHELXTL, Version 5.1, Bruker AXS, 1997.","PLATON, A.

This assay measures the inhibition of the beta-secretase enzyme as it cleaves a non-native peptide.","A synthetic APP substrate that can be cleaved by beta-secretase having N-terminal biotin and made fluorescent by the covalent attachment of Oregon Green at the Cys residue is used to assay beta-secretase activity in the presence or absence of the inhibitory compounds. The substrate is Biotin-GLTNIKTEEISEISY^EVEFR-C[Oregon Green]KK-OH. The BACE1 enzyme is affinity purified material from conditioned media of CHO-K1 cells that have been transfected with a soluble BACE construct (BACE1deltaTM96His). Compounds are incubated in a \u00bd log dose response curve from a top concentration of 100 \u03bcM with BACE1 enzyme and the biotinylated fluorescent peptide in 384-well black plates (Thermo Scientific #4318). BACE1 is at a final concentration of 0.1 nM with a final concentration of peptide substrate of 150 nM in a reaction volume of 30 \u03bcL assay buffer [100 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.5 (brought to pH with acetic acid), and 0.001% Tween-20]. Plates are covered and incubated for 3 hours at 37\u00b0 C. The reaction is stopped with the addition of 30 \u03bcL of 1.5 \u03bcM Streptavidin (Pierce, #21125). After a 10 minute incubation at room temperature, plates are read on a PerkinElmer EnVision for fluorescence polarization (Ex485 nm\/Em530 nm). The activity of the beta-secretase enzyme is detected by changes in the fluorescence polarization that occur when the substrate is cleaved by the enzyme. Incubation in the presence of compound inhibitor demonstrates specific inhibition of beta-secretase enzymatic cleavage of the synthetic APP

provided in Tables 4-6 provided hereinbelow.","BACE1 Cell-Free Assay:","Beta-secretase (BACE) is one of the enzymes involved in the generation of the amyloid beta peptide found in the amyloid plaques of Alzheimer's Disease patients. This assay measures the inhibition of the beta-secretase enzyme as it cleaves a non-native peptide.","A synthetic APP substrate that can be cleaved by beta-secretase having N-terminal biotin and made fluorescent by the covalent attachment of Oregon Green at the Cys residue is used to assay beta-secretase activity in the presence or absence of the inhibitory compounds. The substrate is Biotin-GLTNIKTEEISEISY^EVEFR-C[Oregon Green]KK-OH. The BACE1 enzyme is affinity purified material from conditioned media of CHO-K1 cells that have been transfected with a soluble BACE construct (BACE1deltaTM96His). Compounds are incubated in a \u00bd log dose response curve from a top concentration of 100 \u03bcM with BACE1 enzyme and the biotinylated fluorescent peptide in 384-well black plates (Thermo Scientific #4318). BACE1 is at a final concentration of 0.1 nM with a final concentration of peptide substrate of 150 nM in a reaction volume of 30 \u03bcL assay buffer [100 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.5 (brought to pH with acetic acid), and 0.001% Tween-20]. Plates are covered and incubated for 3 hours at 37\u00b0 C. The reaction is stopped with the addition of 30 \u03bcL of 1.5 \u03bcM Streptavidin (Pierce, #21125). After a 10 minute incubation at room temperature, plates are read on a PerkinElmer EnVision for fluorescence polarization (Ex485 nm\/Em530 nm). The activity of the beta-secretase enzyme is detected by changes in the fluorescence polarization that occur when the substrate is cleaved by the enzyme. Incubation in the presence of compound inhibitor demonstrates specific inhibition of beta-secretase enzymatic cleavage of the synthetic APP substrate.","sAPP\u03b2 Whole-Cell Assay (WCA):","sAPP\u03b2, the primary cleavage product of BACE1, was determined in H4 human neuroglioma cells over-expressing the wild-type human APP. Cells were treated for 18 h with compound in a final concentration of 1% DMSO. sAPP\u03b2 levels were measured by ELISA with a capture APP N-terminal antibody (Affinity BioReagents, OMA1-03132), wild-type sAPP\u03b2-specific reporter antibody p192 (Elan), and tertiary anti-rabbit-HRP (GE Healthcare). The colorimetric reaction was read by an EnVision (PerkinElmer) plate-reader.","BACE2\/BACE1 Binding Ratio:","The BACE1 and BACE2 binding assays measured beta-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme (BACE) binding as a decrease in the counts of radioligand bound in a scintillation proximity assay (SPA). Utilizing a radiolabeled small molecule BACE active site binding inhibitor and crude HEK cell membrane preparations over-expressing full length BACE1 or BACE2, the binding of enzyme by test compound was monitored as a reduction of specific counts bound at pH 6.0. Full length human BACE1 or BACE2 over-expressed in HEK cells was prepared by Pfizer scientists. Frozen stock cell paste was reacted in 50 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH=6.0) containing 3H-(4aR,6R,8aS)-8a-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-6-(1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-4,4a,5,6,8,8a-hexahydropyrano[3,4-d][1,3]thiazin-2-amine ligand, SPA bead and 60 \u03bcM to 600 pM of test compound in an assay volume of 27 uL. The compound plate also contained positive (BACE inhibitor) and negative (DMSO) control wells. The binding was carried out at room temperature for 30 minutes and then the plates were read on a TriLux Microbeta reader to determine the number of counts bound. The raw data was converted to percent effect compared to positive and negative control wells and the compound concentrations and % effect values for tested compounds were plotted to determine the 50% effect (IC50) with a four-parameter logistic dose response equation.","General Multi-Point Cocktail DDI ICAssay Conditions:","Standard marker activity substrates are incubated with pooled human liver microsomes (HL-MIX-102) in the presence of NADPH (1.2 mM) in 100 mM KHPO, pH 7.4 containing 3.3 mM MgClat 37\u00b0 C. The incubation volume is 0.1 mL, utilizing a 384-well plate format. The microsomal protein concentrations (0.1 mg\/mL) and P450 concentration (0.035 \u03bcM) was used for each probe substrate at the following concentrations [tacrine (1A2) 2 uM; diclofenac (2C9) 5 \u03bcM; dextromethorphan (2D6) 5 \u03bcM; midazolam (3A4) 2 \u03bcM; taxol (2C8) 5 \u03bcM; S-mephenytoin (2C19) 40 \u03bcM].

Each test compound\/prototypical inhibitors are tested at a concentration range of 0-30 \u03bcM in triplicate, in final vehicle solvent concentrations of 0.9% acetonitrile and 0.1% DMSO. Incubations are initiated with the addition of NADPH. At the end of the incubation period, termination solvent containing internal standard is added, the terminated incubation mixture is centrifuged to precipitate microsomal protein.

The cells were passaged every 3-5 days based on confluency. On the day of the experiment, 50%-80% confluent cells were harvested from a 175 cmculture flask using Detachin\u2122. After 10 minutes of exposure to Detachin\u2122 at 37\u00b0 C., the cells were centrifuged for 1 minute at 1000 RPM. The supernatant was removed and the cell pellet was reconstituted in 5-8 mL of serum free media with 2.5% of 1M HEPES, placed on the Qstirrer\u2122, and allowed to recover.

Test pulses were delivered at a frequency of 0.25 Hz. Up to 4 different concentrations were studied on each cell, each exposure lasting 5 minutes or until steady-state effects were observed. In a separate set of experiments, full concentration-response relationships were determined for the positive control, Cisapride, and an ICwas reported in this study. Using Sophion Qpatch Assay Software, the amplitude of the peak outward hERG current upon repolarizing ramp was measured. Current amplitude was determined by taking the average of the last 5 current peaks under each treatment condition. Percent inhibition was determined by taking the ratio of the current measured at steady state in the presence of test article (I) versus the control current (I), and expressed as: % inhibition=100\u2212(I\/I)*100.

Those skilled in the art will appreciate that different assay formats are available to measure the inhibition of BACE1. One skilled in the art will appreciate that acceptable potency for inhibiting BACE1 for a viable drug candidate is typically less than 100 nM in both a cell free and whole cell assays. Surprisingly, there was a significant difference between the thiazole containing compounds with respect to the regioisomeric position of the amide linker. For example, the compounds of examples 1, 2, 7, and 45 display potent BACE1 inhibition while Comparator 1 is surprisingly and unexpectedly >1000 fold less active at BACE1, clearly showing the criticality that the position of the amide substitution on the thiazole has on the BACE1 potency of the compounds.","Selectivity for BACE1 inhibitors against related aspartyl proteases is an important factor for determining the potential safety for a viable drug candidate.The related aspartyl protease BACE2 has recently been reported to impact pigmentation in cellular and in vivo models. For example, BACE2 processes pigment cell-specific melanocyte protein (PMEL) which is believed to play a role in melanogenesis.The selectivity ratio for BACE2 to BACE1 inhibition was determined using a ratio of IC50 from respective binding assays as shown in Table 4. Surprisingly, there was a significant improvement in selectivity for BACE1 over BACE2 for examples 1, 2, and 45 relative to comparator compounds 4 through 7 which are the compounds of examples 58, 64, 42, and 6 from U.S. Pat. No. 8,198,269. Those skilled in the art will appreciate the potential impact of selectivity over BACE2 with respect to skin pigmentation changes in human clinical trials.","Table 5, below, provides HLM Clint, CYP2D6 ICand observed glutathione (GSH) adduct data for the compounds of examples 1, 2, 7 and 45 and comparators 1-7, whose structures are provided below.

Those skilled in the art will appreciate the negative impact of higher clearance compounds on projected human dose and dosing regimen in human. In general, compounds with low clearance (CLint<8 mL\/min\/Kg) in human liver microsomes are more desirable than higher clearance compounds (CLint>15 mL\/min\/kg). From the data presented above it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the compounds of examples 1, 2, 7 and 45 each possess an advantageously low hepatic clearance profile with a Clint<8 mL\/min\/Kg. The low hepatic clearance values exhibited by the compounds of examples 1, 2, 7 and 45 should allow for acceptable dosages and dosing regimens for use of these compounds in humans.","The inhibition of CYP-P450s increases the risk for clinical drug-drug interactions (DDIs). For example, inhibition of CYP2D6 is of particular concern due to the potential for victim based DDIs and variable clinical exposure due to polymorphic nature of this enzyme.Those skilled in the art will appreciate the desire to eliminate the potential to inhibit CYP2D6 in a viable clinical candidate. As shown in Table 5, examples 1, 2, 7, and 45 display IC50s>30 \u03bcM for inhibiting CYP2D6 relative to comparators 2, 3, and comparators 4, 6 and 7 (the compounds of examples 58, 42, and 6 from U.S. Pat. No. 8,198,269) which display IC50s<100 nM. From the data presented above it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the compounds of examples 1, 2, 7 and 45 each possess an advantageously low CYP2D6 inhibitor profile and thus these compounds minimize the risk of DDIs which could result from inhibition of that CYP-P450 isozyme in a patient.","The potential clinical hepatotoxicity or drug induced liver injury (DILI) is one of the major reasons for the withdrawal of compounds from the market.Those skilled in the art will appreciate that bioactivation or covalent binding of compounds to proteins is a potential mechanism for hepatoxicity. A common assay for understanding the impact of covalent binding is to monitor for the formation of glutathione (GSH) adducts. For examples 1, 2, 7, and 45 in Table 5, the formation of GSH adducts was not detected following incubations. This is advantageous as it indicates that the compounds of examples 1, 2, 7 and 45 are not compounds which would lead to the potential for a glutathione-adduct induced mechanism of hepatotoxicity. However, incubation of comparator 5 (example 64 from U.S. Pat.

In addition, an important factor in reducing the targeted plasma concentration is optimizing brain penetration by reducing activity against efflux transporters located at the blood brain barrier such as P-glycoprotein (Pgp).Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the potential for CNS penetration can be assessed in vitro by determining whether a compound can be subjected to Pgp efflux and that compounds can be assessed using various known in vitro Pgp assays. One such in vitro assay is the Pgp MDR1 Er assay described above. In general, compounds with low efflux potential (Er<2.5) as measured in the MDR1 assay are highly desirable when combined with weak inhibition of the hERG channel (hERG IC50>5 \u03bcM). Examples 1, 2, 7, and 45 in Table 6, advantageously show both weak inhibition of the hERG channel (hERG IC50>5 \u03bcM) as well as low Pgp efflux potential (MDR1 Er<2.5).","Those skilled in the art will appreciate the impact of a highly basic pKon activity at the hERG channel, P-gp transporters, and inhibition of CYP2D6.Surprisingly, the thiazole group present in examples 1, 2, 7, and 45 significantly lowers the pKa of these compounds relative to comparators 2-7 as shown in Table 6. This result was unexpected based on the increase in pKa (8.7) for the pyridine containing compound comparator 2.","Those skilled in the art will also appreciate that structural alerts may be associated with idiosyncratic adverse drug reactions (IADRs). For example, compounds containing an aniline structural alert have been withdrawn from commercial use or have received a black box warning for an IADR.Those skilled in the art will appreciate that predicting IADR is challenging but a key consideration to avoiding a potential IADR is to remove structural alerts from viable clinical candidates.
