title: Display controller permitting connection of multiple displays with a single video cable
abstract: A display controller that permits more than one display to be operated by a single cable and a single display adapter. The display controller provides custom EDID information to a computer to which it is attached. The custom EDID information may include information about the single virtual display surface provided by all displays, and may include information about each of the individual monitors or displays, including the location of the individual displays in the single composite display surface. The single composite display surface may be utilized by computers that are not capable of recognizing the EDID for the multiple display system. If the computer does recognize the EDID for the multiple display system, the operating system of the computer and/or applications running on the computer may understand and utilize the heterogeneous nature of the display surface and may optimize display quality and presentation for a user.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present invention is generally directed to computers, and more specifically directed to a computer having more than one display.","The use of multiple displays by computer enthusiasts continues to grow. Using more than one display allows a user to stretch his or her desktop to show more programs than if a single display is used. In addition, a single program may be stretched over multiple displays so that more of a document, such as a spreadsheet, may be seen without scrolling. A presentation may also be opened over several pages and may be dragged across several different displays.","Because of the cost of producing large displays, purchasing two displays may provide the same amount of desktop space for less price than a large monitor. In addition to the cost of the monitor itself, however, conventional multiple monitor systems require an additional cable and display adapter, usually in the form of a video card, for each monitor. Alternatively, a special video card, often called a \u201cdualhead\u201d or multi-display card, must be purchased for the computer. Adding or changing the video cards requires opening the computer box and some knowledge of the internal structure of the computer. Moreover, the cables and video cards must be configured correctly by a user to create a single virtual display surface.","A drawback to the use of multiple monitors is that visually scanning from one monitor to another may be difficult. The wide frame that extends around the display for most monitors interrupts the eye when a user scans from one monitor to another, even when the monitors are placed as closely together as possible.","The present invention provides a display controller that permits more than one display to be driven by a single cable and a single display adapter. To this end, the display controller divides a single frame of information that is provided by a display adapter into display information for the multiple displays.","The present invention may be used with combinations of many different types of displays, including but not limited to monitors, LCD displays, and any combination thereof. In addition, the present invention may be utilized for multiple displays within a single housing. The multiple displays may be separate panels arranged in a housing to form a large contiguous display surface, for example.","The display controller provides information about the display to a computer to which it is attached (for example via a known mechanism such as custom EDID). The custom EDID information may include information about the single virtual display surface provided by all displays, such as the size, resolution and refresh rate for the combined displays. In addition, the EDID information may include information about each of the individual monitors or displays, including the location of the individual displays in the single virtual display surface, and available resolutions and refresh rates for each of the monitors. The single virtual display surface may be utilized by computers that are not capable of recognizing the EDID for the multiple display system.","If the computer does recognize the EDID for the multiple display system, the operating system of the computer and\/or applications running on the computer may understand and utilize the heterogeneous nature of the display surface and may optimize display quality and presentation for a user. To this end, an application programming interface (API) may be provided that exposes itself to applications so that the applications may be aware of the multiple displays and alter their images so that one or more particular panes are shown on a particular display or across multiple displays.","Operating systems that are aware of the EDID for the multiple display system may use a display component, such as a video driver, to expose the virtual display surfaces of each of the displays that are attached to the display controller. The applications or the operating system may then provide the image information for the virtual display surfaces.","The virtual display surfaces are combined to form a single frame in the frame buffer of the display adapter. The frame is forwarded to the display controller, which divides the image, for example using line or frame buffers, and then provides appropriate display information to the separate displays. For some implementations of the invention, the display data frame for a target display may be rotated so that it matches the scanning direction of the target display.","Other advantages will become apparent from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the drawings, in which:","Exemplary Operating Environment",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["110","110","110","110"]},"The invention is operational with numerous other general purpose or special purpose computing system environments or configurations. Examples of well known computing systems, environments, and\/or configurations that may be suitable for use with the invention include, but are not limited to, personal computers, server computers, hand-held or laptop devices, multiprocessor systems, microcontroller-based systems, set top boxes, programmable consumer electronics, network PCs, minicomputers, mainframe computers, digital television, simulator systems, distributed computing environments that include any of the above systems or devices, and the like.","The invention may be described in the general context of computer-executable instructions, such as program modules, being executed by a computer. Generally, program modules include routines, programs, objects, components, data structures, and so forth, which perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. The invention may also be practiced in distributed computing environments where tasks are performed by remote processing devices that are linked through a communications network. In a distributed computing environment, program modules may be located in both local and remote computer storage media including memory storage devices.","With reference to , an exemplary system for implementing the invention includes a general-purpose computing device in the form of a computer . Components of the computer  may include, but are not limited to, a processing unit , a system memory , and a system bus  that couples various system components including the system memory to the processing unit . The system bus  may be any of several types of bus structures including a memory bus or memory controller, a peripheral bus, and a local bus using any of a variety of bus architectures. By way of example, and not limitation, such architectures include Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) bus, Micro Channel Architecture (MCA) bus, Enhanced ISA (EISA) bus, Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) local bus, and Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) bus also known as Mezzanine bus.","Computer  typically includes a variety of computer-readable media. Computer-readable media can be any available media that can be accessed by the computer  and includes both volatile and nonvolatile media, and removable and non-removable media. By way of example, and not limitation, computer-readable media may comprise computer storage media and communication media. Computer storage media includes both volatile and nonvolatile, removable and non-removable media implemented in any method or technology for storage of information such as computer-readable instructions, data structures, program modules, or other data. Computer storage media includes, but is not limited to, RAM, ROM, EEPROM, flash memory or other memory technology, CD-ROM,CD-RW, digital versatile disks (DVD) or other optical disk storage, magnetic cassettes, magnetic tape, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium which can be used to store the desired information and which can accessed by the computer . Communication media typically embodies computer-readable instructions, data structures, program modules, or other data in a modulated data signal such as a carrier wave or other transport mechanism and includes any information delivery media. The term \u201cmodulated data signal\u201d means a signal that has one or more of its characteristics set or changed in such a manner as to encode information in the signal. By way of example, and not limitation, communication media includes wired media such as a wired network or direct-wired connection, and wireless media such as acoustic, RF, infrared and other wireless media. Combinations of the any of the above should also be included within the scope of computer-readable media.","The system memory  includes computer storage media in the form of volatile and\/or nonvolatile memory such as read only memory (ROM)  and random access memory (RAM) . A basic input\/output system  (BIOS), containing the basic routines that help to transfer information between elements within computer , such as during start-up, is typically stored in ROM . RAM  typically contains data and\/or program modules that are immediately accessible to and\/or presently being operated on by processing unit . By way of example, and not limitation,  illustrates operating system , application programs , other program modules , and program data .","The computer  may also include other removable\/non-removable, volatile\/nonvolatile computer storage media. By way of example only,  illustrates a hard disk drive  that reads from or writes to non-removable, nonvolatile magnetic media, a magnetic disk drive  that reads from or writes to a removable, nonvolatile magnetic disk , and an optical disk drive  that reads from or writes to a removable, nonvolatile optical disk  such as a CD ROM or other optical media, or writeable\/re-writeable optical media. Other removable\/non-removable, volatile\/nonvolatile computer storage media that can be used in the exemplary operating environment include, but are not limited to, magnetic tape cassettes, flash memory cards, digital versatile disks, digital video tape, solid state RAM, solid state ROM, and the like. The hard disk drive  is typically connected to the system bus  through a non-removable memory interface such as interface , and magnetic disk drive  and optical disk drive  are typically connected to the system bus  by a removable memory interface, such as interface .","The drives and their associated computer storage media, discussed above and illustrated in , provide storage of computer-readable instructions, data structures, program modules, and other data for the computer . In , for example, hard disk drive  is illustrated as storing operating system , application programs , other program modules , and program data . Note that these components can either be the same as or different from operating system , application programs , other program modules , and program data . Operating system , application programs , other program modules , and program data  are given different numbers herein to illustrate that, at a minimum, they are different copies. A user may enter commands and information into the computer  through input devices such as a keyboard  and pointing device , commonly referred to as a mouse, trackball, or touch pad. Other input devices (not shown) may include a microphone, joystick, game pad, satellite dish, scanner, a touch-sensitive screen of a handheld PC or other writing tablet, or the like. These and other input devices are often connected to the processing unit  through a user input interface  that is coupled to the system bus, but may be connected by other interface and bus structures, such as a parellel port, game port or a universal serial bus (USB). A monitor  or other type of display device is also connected to the system bus  via an interface, such as a display adapter interface . In addition to the monitor, computers may also include other peripheral output devices such as speakers  and printer , which may be connected through an output peripheral interface .","The computer  may operate in a networked environment using logical connections to one or more remote computers, such as a remote computer . The remote computer  may be a personal computer, a server, a router, a network PC, a peer device or other common network node, and typically includes many or all of the elements described above relative to the computer , although only a memory storage device  has been illustrated in . The logical connections depicted in  include a local area network (LAN)  and a wide area network (WAN) (not shown, but known), but may also include other networks. Such networking environments are commonplace in offices, enterprise-wide computer networks, intranets and the Internet.","When used in a LAN networking environment, the computer  is connected to the LAN  through a network interface or adapter . In a networked environment, program modules depicted relative to the computer , or portions thereof, may be stored in the remote memory storage device. By way of example, and not limitation,  illustrates remote application programs  as residing on memory device . It will be appreciated that the network connections shown are exemplary and other means of establishing a communications link between the computers may be used.","Connecting Multiple Displays to a Computer with a Single Graphics Card",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","110","202","202","202","202","204","204","204","204","206","206","200","202"],"sub":["1","2 ","N","1","2 ","N"]},"Although shown as separate components in , the display controller  and the panel controllers  may be combined in a single circuit board, or their functions may be distributed over a number of different components, or two or more of the controllers may be combined to form a single component, or the functions of two or more of the components may be spread over multiple elements on the same circuit board, multiple circuit boards, or may otherwise be provided. Similarly, unless otherwise stated herein, the components and elements used to describe the present invention are described as separate components for ease of description, and the functions of the components may be provided by several different devices or modules, and\/or one or more of the components may be combined with another to form a single device or module.","In any event, a monitor signal interface  is attached to the display controller . A cable  extends between the monitor signal interface  and a host signal interface  connected to or otherwise associated with a display adapter  located in the computer .","A DAC, a digital transmitter sending a digital signal, such as TMDS (DVI) or LVDS, may be part of the host signal interface of this invention. Likewise, the monitor signal interface may alternatively be a digital receiver (e.g., configured to receive TMDS or LVDS).","The display adapter  may be a video graphics card, may be an adapter that is integrated, or may be another suitable component that enables a computer to provide display information to the displays . The display adapter  is connected to the operating system  for the computer  and may be utilized with one or more applications .","The displays  may each be a separate monitor having its own housing, or two or more displays sharing the same housing. One or more of the displays may be a cathode ray tube (CRT's), liquid crystal display (LCD), plasma, or another device that is capable of displaying graphics and\/or text.","In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, the displays  may be provided by a monitor having separate panels that are aligned adjacent to one another so as to provide a single, contiguous display surface. An example of such a monitor  is shown in . The monitor  includes two panels , , that together provide a single, large display surface within a single monitor housing . In such an embodiment, each display , as used herein would be one of the physical panels . This implementation of a multiple panel monitor is significantly less expensive than providing a single panel monitor of the same size, especially if the panels are of the LCD variety. In particular, multiple smaller LCD panels can be less expensive than a single large panel LCD because smaller LCD panels may be produced with better production yields than a larger panel of the same composite size.","If the displays  are separate monitors or otherwise require or include their own external cable, then the display controller  may be provided, for example, in a box having a single input connection for the cable  and multiple output connections for the cables for the separate monitors. Other arrangements may be provided, such as where the display controller  is provided on or in one primary monitor, the primary monitor is directly connected to the cable , and the other monitors are connected to the primary monitor.","In accordance with one aspect of the invention, the display controller  provides custom Extended Display Identification Data (\u201cEDID \u201d, ) information to the computer  regarding the displays . As is known, EDID is a Video Electronics Standards Association (\u201cVESA\u201d) standard data format that contains basic information about a monitor and its capabilities, including vendor information, maximum image size, color characteristics, factory preset timings, frequency range limits, and character strings for the monitor name and serial number. Typically, the EDID information is stored in the monitor and is provided to a computer when the monitor is connected to the computer. Computers can use the EDID information for video configuration purposes, so the monitor and system can work better together.","In the present invention, the display controller  provides the EDID , which includes custom information regarding the displays . In accordance with the present invention, as shown diagrammatically in , the EDID  includes single display information  and multiple display information . The single display information  includes information regarding the total combined display surface provided by the displays . This information may include the possible resolutions of the combined display surface, as well as refresh rates and other information regarding use of the combined display surface. As an example, the combined surface may include two XGA displays having a resolution of 768\u00d71024, with the combined display surface resolution being 1536\u00d71024. As another example, two XGA landscape displays, each having a resolution of 1024\u00d7768 may be combined to form a combined display surface resolution of 2048\u00d7768. In addition, a landscape display and a portrait display may be combined, such as an SXGA landscape display having a resolution of 1280\u00d71024 and an XGA portrait display having a resolution of 768\u00d71024. These combined displays would have a resolution of 2048\u00d71024.","The combined display surface should be rectangular to make most efficient use of bandwidth and buffers. However, as can be seen from these above examples, many different combinations may be utilized to provide a rectangular, combined display surface.","In addition to the single display information , the EDID  includes multiple display information . Multiple display information  includes characteristics of the physical layout of the displays , as well as resolution, refresh rate and other information regarding the particular displays.","The single display information  and the multiple display information  permit the displays  to work on legacy or unaware operating systems, as well as operating systems which can recognize the multiple display information . By \u201cunaware,\u201d we mean that the operating system is not familiar with the multiple display information, and is not configured to modify its behavior (e.g., configure a driver for the display adapter) in response to receiving the multiple display information. Likewise, an \u201caware\u201d operating system is a operating system that is familiar with the multiple display information, and is configured so that it may modify its behavior in response to receiving the multiple display information. As shown in , legacy and unaware operating systems  utilize the single display information  to configure a display component  (e.g., a video driver) of the operating system  to treat the combined displays as a virtual single display image . The single display image  is provided to the display adapter . The display adapter , in turn, creates a frame , for example in a frame buffer (e.g., the frame buffer ), which is sent through the cable  to the display controller . The display controller  splits the frame  into separate images , . . . , each image representing the region of the particular display  on the single, combined display surface.","Because the legacy or unaware operating system  is not aware of the actual boundaries between the displays , applications  and the operating system  do not take advantage of the layout or capabilities of the multiple displays, and individual panels, applications or popup windows may be shown over any one of the displays . However, by providing the single display information , the displays  are still operational with legacy and unaware operating systems.","Turning now to , for an operating system  that is aware of the present invention, a display component  (also shown in ) of the operating system  may utilize the multiple display information  to partition panes of an image into separate virtual images that represent the location and size of the displays . These virtual images , . . . are combined to form a single frame  within the frame buffer  associated with the display adapter .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["222","134","135","202","700","208","134"]},"At step , if the operating system  is not familiar with the multiple display information , the process branches to step , where the single display information  is utilized by the computer . That is, the computer  configures the video driver or the available display component  for the operating system  to expose a single monitor of the resolution defined in the single display information .","If the operating system  does include the display component , then step  branches to step , where the multiple display information  is retrieved. At step , the display component  is configured to expose the number of displays  at the resolutions defined by the multiple display information . In this manner, the layout of the image may be appropriately optimized for separate physical panes. Applications, such as the applications , may utilize this feature. To this end, the display component  may, for example, expose an application programming interface  () that the applications  may call upon to be provided the mapping of the images  so that the applications may optimize display quality and presentation by directing separate physical panes or windows to be rendered in a particular display .","One of the advantages of the present invention is that the display controller  and the display component  permit a single cable  and a conventional display adapter  having only one cable plug to be used with multiple displays . To this end,  is a flow diagram generally representing steps for targeting display information at the display component for particular displays  utilizing the single cable . Beginning at step , one of the applications  and\/or the operating system  creates individual images  targeted to one or more of the displays . At step , the images  are combined in the display adapter  to form the frame  in the frame buffer . Conventional display adapters are capable of handing such frames, and thus no modifications have to be made to a conventional display adapter for it to work with the present invention. The process of combining the images is further described with , below.","The frame  is transmitted over the cable  at step . Again, this operation is normal for a VGA or DVI cable, and thus no modifications are needed to the cable  for the transmission to occur.","At step , the display controller maps regions of the frame  to physical displays . Because the frame  was formed from the images  as instructed by the display controller  (i.e., via the EDID ), the regions exactly align with the displays . In this manner, the operating system  and\/or the applications  may optimize display quality and presentation on the displays . The mapping process is further discussed with , below.","As can be understood with reference to , the operating system  and the applications  create video display information for multiple displays even though the display adapter  is capable of sending only a single image or frame, and the cable  is capable of transmitting only a single image or frame under the existing VESA standards. The display controller  is aware of how the frame  is arranged, because it has instructed the operating system, via the EDID , on how to provide image data to the display adapter . Thus, knowing that the image data is in the appropriate location within the frame , the display controller  may appropriately map the combined image to the displays .","The splitting of the frame  by the display controller  may be done in a number of different ways. As an example, the display component  may physically separate the frame  or  in virtual memory, and expose the physically-separated sections of memory for applications or the operating system to write images to the respective displays . The separated sections are then combined to provide information to the display adapter  so that it may form the frame . Although such an implementation may work, this particular example is processor and memory intensive, and another solution may utilize interleaving of information for different displays . Such an example is described with reference to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["900","900","902","904","900","220","206","902","904","900","902","904","900","902","904","902","904","900","202"]},"Each of the virtual images ,  includes pointers ,  and a corresponding delta (not shown, but known in the art of frame buffers and bitmaps). As is known, one conventional manner of storing a Device Independent Bitmap (DIB) is to store a pointer for a starting location in memory for the bitmap, as well as a delta value which represents the beginning of the next scan line for the bitmap. Very often, the delta is larger than the width of the bitmap and there may be extraneous data beyond the end of the width of the bitmap.","The present invention takes advantage of this feature by defining the first delta as being large enough to encompass the data for the second frame  in its extraneous data. Likewise, the second delta is large enough so that the information for the first frame  is included in the extraneous data for the second frame . For the virtual image , the pointer  begins at the same location that data begins for the single virtual image . The delta for the virtual image  is greater than the width of the first frame  and the second frame . Similarly, for the second frame , the pointer  is located at the beginning of the second frame, and the delta for that frame is greater than the width of the first and second frames , .","As an example, the first pointer  may point at the position \u201c1,\u201d the first virtual image  may have a width of 100 pixels and a delta of . The second pointer  may point at the position \u201c101,\u201d and the second virtual image  may have a width of 110 pixels, and a delta of . In this example, the first 100 pixels of data for the single virtual image  would be within the first virtual image, and the remaining 120 bits of information, which includes the first 110 pixels of data for the second virtual image , would be considered extraneous data for the first virtual image. Similarly, the first virtual image's data would be considered extraneous data for the second virtual image . This pattern continues for each corresponding line of data in the single virtual image.","Ultimately, a two-dimensional representation of the data in memory may look like the representation  shown in , wherein a first line of data LA is the pixel information for the first frame  (in the example above, bits  to  of information), and a second line of data LA is pixel information for the first line of the second frame  (in the example above, bits  to  of information), a third line of data LB is pixel information for the second line of the first frame  (bits  to ), a fourth line of data LB is pixel information for the second line of the second frame  (bits  to ), and so forth. The extra data that is not a part of either frame  or  (e.g., bits  to  and  to ) may be presented at the end of the lines for the second frame .","The interlacing scheme just described permits an application  or the operating system  to write to one of the, virtual images ,  by using the corresponding pointer  or  and its delta. The data may then be provided to the display adapter  as shown in , permitting the display adapter to efficiently write the virtual image . This feature thus exposes two separate \u201cdisplays,\u201d even though the displays are in reality portions of the single virtual image .","In this manner, applications may be led to believe that there is an actual frame that is available for each of the individual displays . Thus, all the operating system  or the display component  has to store is the pointer (e.g.,  or ) for each virtual image, the width of the virtual image, and the delta information for each of the displays . The data written by the applications  or the operating system  is written in a representation as is shown in , which may directly be provided to the display adapter  so that it may build the single frame  within the frame buffer .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIG. 11","b":["206","606","508","202","1102","206","606","508","206","606","1104"]},"As an example, if the displays  include two or more portrait-aligned panels attached along the edges, the display controller may insert line buffers at locations where a first panel ends and a second panel begins. That is, the line buffers are inserted between adjacent horizontal rows of pixels for each of the panels. Using the example previously described with , a first line buffer may be the first 100 bits of image data, and a second line buffer may be the next 110 bits of image data. These lines may be sent to the respective first and second displays, and the process may continue, for example by sending lines  to  to first display, lines  to  to the next display, and so forth. () At step , a determination is made whether the display scans in the same direction as the frame . If so, then step  branches to step , where the image (a \u201csubframe\u201d of the frame) for the display  is displayed. If not, then step  branches to step , where the subframe for the image of that display is rotated. That is, the linear information regarding the pixels is changed so that it reads in scanning order. For example, if the pixels in the frame  were stored in a linear horizontal fashion, the pixel information is stored representing horizontal rows of the frame, with a lower row following a higher row. If the display  corresponding to a frame scans in a vertical direction, the pixel information would need to be reordered so that it is stored representing vertical columns of the frame. This reordering of the pixels would result in a \u201crotation\u201d of the frame. Rotating the frame is one way of permitting a portrait-aligned display to be mounted adjacent to a landscape-aligned display, such as the two panels  shown in .","After the frame has been rotated, step  branches to step , where the frame is displayed in the appropriate display . The process then ends for that frame.","The present invention provides a unique solution for delivering image information for multiple displays through a single cable  and a single display adapter  having only one plug for a cable. The EDID  is used to communicate to the operating system  the layout and resolution of the displays . The operating system  and\/or the applications  may then structure their image data so that the image data may be directed to the appropriate display or displays . Because the image data structure has been communicated by the display controller  (i.e., via the EDID), the display controller  may appropriately map the frame  from the display adapter  to the appropriate displays .","The use of a single display adapter  saves the cost of additional display adapters. In addition, multiple panels may be provided in a single monitor as a system to optimize alignment and minimize the seams between the displays, enabling a default panorama effect that contributes to an immersive visual experience for users.","Other variations are within the spirit of the present invention.
