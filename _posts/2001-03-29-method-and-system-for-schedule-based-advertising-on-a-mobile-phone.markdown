title: Method and system for schedule based advertising on a mobile phone
abstract: A system for implementing a method for communicating an advertisement employs a primary call center, a mobile station, a base station, and an advertiser call center. When the mobile station is registered with the base station, the primary call center controls a transmission of one or more advertisements to the mobile station in accordance with a schedule preferred by the mobile station user with each advertisement matching a profile of the mobile station user. The mobile station user can either store the advertisement for future reference or respond to the advertisement. The response can be an acknowledgement of the advertisement or a desire to establish a communication link between the mobile station and the advertiser call center to thereby attempt a purchase of a good or a service. In response to an advertisement, the mobile station user is provided with a reward as an incentive to regularly receive advertisements.

Field of the Invention","The present invention generally relates to the advertising of goods and services. The present invention specifically relates to advertisements being communicated to mobile phone users.","2. Description of the Related Art","The mobile phone industry experienced tremendous growth during the 1990's. This growth facilitated an expansion in features available on a mobile phone. For example, mobile phones are now being sold with an Internet browser feature, an e-mail feature, and a Personal Data Assistant feature. It is inevitable that advertisers will \u201cpush\u201d advertisements to mobile phone users, and as a result, mobile phones will need to be equipped with an advertising messaging feature. Any type of advertising messaging feature should balance an economic benefit for advertisers with a shopping advantage for mobile phone users. Additionally, a convenient communication mode with the mobile phone users must be established, while any risk of economically burdening mobile phone users should be minimized, if not eliminated. What is therefore needed is a system for implementing a method that intelligently communicates advertisements of goods and services to mobile phone users in a manner that is acceptable to both mobile phone users and advertisers. In particular, what is needed is a communication mode based on a schedule and preferences of a mobile phone user with an incentive for the mobile phone user to regularly accept and respond to advertisements.","The present invention is a method and system for schedule and user preference based advertisements on a mobile phone that can provide an incentive for mobile phone users to regularly accept and respond to advertisements. Various aspects of the invention are novel, non-obvious, and provide various advantages. While the actual nature of the present invention covered herein can only be determined with reference to the claims appended hereto, certain features, which are characteristic of the embodiments disclosed herein, are described briefly as follows.","One form of the present invention is a first method for communicating an advertisement to a mobile station (e.g., a mobile phone). A registration of the mobile station with a base station (e.g., a tower) is detected. A user preferred schedule for transmitting advertisements to the mobile station is initiated subsequent to a detection of the registration. And, an advertisement is transmitted to the mobile station in accordance with the user preferred schedule.","A second form of the present invention is a second method for communicating an advertisement to a mobile station. An advertisement is transmitted to the mobile station subsequent to a registration of the mobile station with a base station. And, a reception of the advertisement by the mobile station is verified in response to a reception of a responsive command from the mobile station.","A third form of the present invention is a system comprising a mobile station and a computer (e.g., a computer telephony server). The mobile station is operable to register with a base station. In a first aspect of the system, the computer is operable to detect a registration of the mobile station with the base station. The computer further include means for initiating a user preferred schedule for transmitting advertisements to the mobile station subsequent to the registration detection, and means for controlling a transmission of an advertisement in accordance with the schedule.","\u201cIn a second aspect of the system, the computer is operable to control a transmission of an advertisement to the mobile station. The computer also includes means for verifying a reception of the advertisement by the mobile station in response to a reception of a responsive command from the mobile station.\u201d","A fourth form of the present invention is a computer program product in a computer readable medium for communicating an advertisement to a mobile station. In a first aspect, the computer program product comprises computer readable code for detecting a registration of the mobile station with a base station, computer readable code for initiating a user preferred schedule for transmitting advertisements to the mobile station subsequent to the registration detection, and computer readable code for controlling a transmission of an advertisement in accordance with the schedule.","In a second aspect, the computer program product comprises computer readable code for controlling a transmission of an advertisement to the mobile station, and computer readable code for verifying a reception of the advertisement by the mobile station in response to a reception of a responsive command from the mobile station.","The foregoing forms and other features and advantages of the invention will become further apparent from the following detailed description of the presently preferred embodiments, read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.
