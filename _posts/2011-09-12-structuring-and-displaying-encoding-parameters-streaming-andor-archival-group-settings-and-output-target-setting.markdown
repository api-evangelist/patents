{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/438,319, filed Feb. 1, 2011 and is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","The present invention relates to digital video and audio generally and, more particularly, to a method and\/or architecture for structuring and displaying encoding parameters, streaming and\/or archival group settings, and output target setting.","In conventional systems, output target settings and stream settings are encapsulated together as a single entity, which requires repetitively filling out video and audio settings if multiple output targets share the same stream settings. Explicitly specifying individual stream settings for each output target requires duplication of information in the case that output targets within different streaming groups share the same stream settings. The duplication of information requires more space to store the object model, as well as inconveniences the user with additional input steps. The duplication of information also leaves open the possibility of typographical errors.","Another option is to have a more complicated multipage or tabbed setup, where various components are individually defined and then connected together later. The ability to access all of the data on a single page is not available. Spreading settings fields out among multiple distinct user interface (UI) pages prevents users from easily visualizing the overall structure of the final settings, and requires additional input steps from the user. This structure is also less intuitive to the user.","The present invention concerns an apparatus including a first module and a second module. The first module may be configured to receive video and audio content and process the video and audio content for distribution with video and audio encoding to various media platforms based upon a plurality of predefined settings. The second module may be configured to generate a single-page user interface through which a user may set the predefined settings.","The objects, features and advantages of the present invention include providing a method and\/or architecture for structuring and displaying encoding parameters, streaming and\/or archival group settings, and output target setting that may (i) reduce data duplication, (ii) minimize setup of video and audio settings by allowing multiple output targets to share the same stream settings, (iii) enhance user interaction by providing a single page user interface, (iv) structure a layout of the user interface to logically follow an underlying object model, and\/or (v) allow overall structure of the created object to be seen at a glance.","Referring to , a high-level diagram of an object model  is shown in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. In one embodiment, the present invention may provide a process (or method) of structuring and displaying encoding parameters, streaming and\/or archival group settings, and output target setting(s) that may be implemented to meet a few basic goals including but not limited to (i) reducing data duplication, (ii) minimizing setup of video and audio settings by allowing multiple output targets to share the same stream settings, (iii) enhancing user interaction by providing a single page user interface, (iv) structuring a layout of the user interface to logically follow an underlying object model, and\/or (v) allowing overall structure of the created object to be seen at a glance. The present invention provides an object model and physical conceptualization that takes into account the above goals. The object model  generally reduces data duplication and minimizes setup of video and audio settings by allowing multiple output targets to share the same stream settings. The object model  generally provides implicit settings for Output Groups, Outputs, Video, and Audio models. In an embodiment of the present invention, a single page user interface (UI) may be constructed that logically follows the object model , allows multiple output targets to share the same stream settings, and allows an overall structure of the created object to be seen at a glance.","In one example, the object model  may comprise a block , one or more blocks , one or more blocks , one or more blocks , one or more blocks , and zero or more blocks . The block  may be configured to specify a base object. The one or more blocks  may be configured to specify output groups. The one or more blocks  may be configured to specify streams. The one or more blocks  may be configured to specify outputs. The one or more blocks  may be configured to specify video parameters. The zero or more blocks  may be configured to specify audio parameters. The block  may be linked to the one or more blocks  and the one or more blocks . Each of the one or more blocks  may be linked to a single block  and zero or more blocks . Each of the one or more blocks  may be linked to one block  and one block .","Referring to , a diagram of a grid formation  is shown illustrating a grid concept in accordance with an example embodiment of the present invention. A physical conceptualization may be realized using the object model  and a few criteria. In one example, the criteria may include that at least one output should be present and that no output should share the same group (G) and stream (S) with another output. Based on these criteria, the maximum number of outputs is one for each group\/stream pair, or (G\u00d7S), where Grepresents the number of groups and Srepresents the number of streams.","In one example, the groups, streams and outputs may be laid out as illustrated by the grid formation . The grid formation  generally allows all objects to be seen at once and makes the connections between the objects clear. All possible outputs available for a set of streams and groups are generally visible at the same time. An output may then have a binary state indicating whether the output exists or not. Visualizing the object model  as a grid generally provides a layout that allows users to easily see the high-level structure being created, which the conventional multipage form cannot provide.","Referring to , a diagram of a page  is shown illustrating a single page user interface (UI) in accordance with an example embodiment of the present invention. Creating a single-page user interface from the physical conceptualization (described above in connection with ) is generally difficult due to the large number of settings fields needed to create the groups, outputs, and, most importantly, video and audio settings. Displaying all of the input fields generally takes a great deal of physical space. The great deal of physical space needed may prevent the user interface from easily displaying the entire structure to the user. In order to overcome this issue, the user interface may employ toggles (e.g., illustrated as solid triangles) to expand and collapse certain areas containing settings. Collapsing all the setting areas allows the user to see the top-level structure. Setting areas may be expanded out to display more detail as needed.","In one example, the single-page user interface  may comprise elements including a plurality of areas (or fields) -, an area (or field) , and a plurality of areas (or fields) -. The user interface elements may be used in a device (or product) implementing an embodiment of the present invention when creating or editing objects (e.g., live event objects, profile objects, etc.). Structuring the data and user interface presentation layer in this way generally reduces data storage, improves user interaction, and more explicitly encapsulates the concept of multiple output targets across multiple groups sharing a single set of stream settings. While the conceptual object model  lends itself to the grid formation , the actual user interface need not follow the grid structure rigidly.","The implementation of the single-page user interface  may pull away from the grid concept in a few ways, but does not alter the basic underlying concept. There are also other configuration choices that may be been made while still falling within the general concept presented herein. In order to allow physical space in the user interface for the output group settings fields, the output groups may, in one example, be pulled away from the grid structure illustrated in  and placed towards the top of the user interface page . The space for group settings may be overlapped. For example, the areas -may be implemented as buttons that may be used to select which group settings appear in the area . Alternatively, the area  may be implemented with tabs along the top to navigate between group settings.","In order to provide physical space in the user interface page  for settings associated with the streams, the areas -may be arranged vertically to allow each stream field to use the entire horizontal width of the user interface page . The areas -are illustrated as being vertically separated for clarity. The areas -may be implemented abutting one another to save further space. In one example, a vertical scroll bar (not shown) may be implemented along the vertical edge of the user interface page  to facilitate visualization of a greater number of areas -than may fit within the entire vertical height of a screen displaying the user interface page . Within each area -an area (or field)  may be implemented for setting and displaying group output settings. In order to provide physical space in the user interface page  for the output settings as well as taking into account the horizontal space limitation of the user interface page , the grid of outputs within a single stream may be rotated 90 degrees (e.g., presented vertically instead of horizontally as in the grid formation  of ). In another example, a similar user interface page without the rotation may also be implemented. The rotation is advantageous because as the number of output groups grows, eventually the user interface would run out of horizontal space and need horizontal scrolling. Horizontal scrolling is not as easily managed as vertical scrolling.","Within each area -another area (or field)  may be implemented for setting and displaying video and audio settings of a particular stream. The physical space used for video and audio settings of a particular stream may be significant. An expanding and collapsing area taking up the entire width of the user interface page  may be used to store the video and audio settings of a particular stream. When collapsed, the user interface page  has little deviation from the grid formation  and an overall view of how the groups, streams and outputs interconnect may be seen. When the area  is expanded, an overall view of the video and audio settings of a single stream may be seen.","In order to save physical space, the settings of a particular output may be shown only when the particular output has been marked for creation (e.g., indicated by an \u2018X\u2019 in a selection box). In one example, when the area  is expanded an area (or field)  may be presented showing the settings of the particular output. The area  may be further configured to allow the user to input the settings for the particular output.","Referring to , a block diagram of a system  is shown illustrating a context in which embodiments in accordance with the present invention may be implemented. In one example, the system  may comprise one or more processing units . The processing units  may be configured to receive one or more IP streams  and\/or live content (e.g., camera output, HD-SDI, MPEG-TS, etc.)  from the customer location. The processing units  may be setup and controlled via a user interface (UI) . The processing units  may be configured (e.g., through software, firmware, program modules, hard coding, etc.) to generate the user interface . The user interface  may be implemented as a single-page user interface as described above in connection with . In one example, the user interface  may be implemented as an HTML interface accessible, for example, via a web browser. In another example, the user interface  may be implemented as a REST XML interface. The user interface  generally structures data based upon the object model  (described above in connection with ). However, other single-page interfaces may be implemented accordingly to meet the design criteria of a particular implementation.","The system  may further comprise a network , and end user devices -. The one or more processing units  may be implemented, in one example, as a massively parallel video processing system configured to provide content distribution with video and audio encoding for live streaming to various media platforms. The processing units  may support, for example, adaptive bit-rate protocols, HTML5, and multiple HD streams. In one example, the processing units  may comprise one or more modules, that may include, but are not limited to a processor, a central processing unit (CPU), a digital signal processor (DSP), a graphics processing unit (GPU), random access memory (RAM), read only memory (ROM), a storage medium or media, video encoders or codecs, audio encoders or codecs, device interfaces, network interfaces, etc. In one example, the processing units  may be implemented using one or more Elemental\u2122 Live appliances from Elemental Technologies Inc., Portland, Oreg. The processing units  (e.g., single or clustered) may be located on the premises of the user (e.g., tier  customers) or content provider. In one example, the processing units  may present streams (e.g., HD, SD, etc. to the network . In another example, the processing units  may also present streams to an archive (e.g., stored on one or more storage media).","In one example, the network  may be implemented as one or more content distribution networks (CDNs). In another example, the network  may be implemented as one or more streaming servers. In still another example, the network  may be implemented as a mobile carrier network. However, other networks and\/or combinations of networks may be implemented accordingly to meet the design criteria of a particular implementation. The end user devices -may be implemented using any of a number of device types. For example, the end user devices -may include, but are not limited to, laptops, tablets, desktop computers, smart phones, PDAs, set-top-boxes (STBs), televisions, etc.","In one example, the system  may be configured to communicate the IP stream(s)  and\/or live content  from the customer location to one or more of the end user devices -based upon settings provided to the processing units  via the user interface . For example, the processing units  may be configured to provide a variety of device-optimized streams. The processed content may be communicated from the processing units  to the network  for distribution to the end user devices -. However, other configurations may be implemented accordingly to meet the design criteria of a particular distribution system.","Referring to , diagrams are shown illustrating a more detailed example of a user interface (UI) layout  in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The user interface (UI) layout  illustrates an example structure similar to the user interface page  of . The user interface layout is a single-page layout, but is spread over the three figures for clarity. For example, the single-page user interface layout  illustrates an interface with three streams in varying toggle states. Five output groups are illustrated for example, however, other numbers and types may be implemented accordingly to meet the design criteria of a particular implementation.","In one example, the interface may present output groups as a number of tabs (e.g., Archive, Apple Live, MS Smooth, RTMP, UDP, etc.). Selecting the tab for a particular output group displays the settings for that output group. For example, selection of the Archive tab causes the archive settings to be displayed below the tabs. Selection of the output group to be displayed may also be done using a pull-down list. A button (or tab) may also be presented for adding and\/or deleting output groups on the interface page.","By expanding an output portion of a particular stream region, details about the outputs associated with the particular stream are shown. For example, an example of the output detail for Stream  is illustrated in . Similarly, an example advanced portion for the Stream  is illustrated in . For example,  illustrate a view of the Stream  details with the outputs portion contracted and the advanced portion expanded to show video details () and audio details ().  also illustrates an example of the Stream  portion with both output and advanced portions contracted. Each of the regions of the user interface layout  may include fields for a user to select and\/or enter the various parameters associated with configuration of the processor units . The fields and parameters illustrated in  are for example and not meant to define required parameters or limit the interface to the particular parameters illustrated.","In one embodiment of the present invention, an audio\/video communication system may be implemented that uses a grid concept in accordance with the present invention to layout the user interface (UI). For example, the system may be implemented with a single-page user interface (UI) for object creation. Another embodiment may provide an object creation method (or process) that reduces unnecessary data duplication (which relies on an underlying object model) within the single-page user interface.","The functions performed by the diagrams of  may be implemented using one or more of a conventional general purpose processor, digital computer, microprocessor, microcontroller, RISC (reduced instruction set computer) processor, CISC (complex instruction set computer) processor, SIMD (single instruction multiple data) processor, signal processor, central processing unit (CPU), arithmetic logic unit (ALU), video digital signal processor (VDSP) and\/or similar computational machines, programmed according to the teachings of the present specification, as will be apparent to those skilled in the relevant art(s).
