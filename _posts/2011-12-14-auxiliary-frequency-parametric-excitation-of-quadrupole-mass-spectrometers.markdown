{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCES TO RELATED APPLICATION","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE","SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/422,929 entitled \u201cAuxiliary Frequency Parametric Excitation of Quadrupole Mass Spectrophotometers\u201d filed on Dec. 14, 2010, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.","This invention was made with government support under NNX08AO05G and NNX09AL50H awarded by the National Space and Aeronautics Administration (NASA). The government has certain rights in the invention.","This disclosure relates generally to mass spectrometry and, more particularly, to a system for creating practical parametric excitation of quadrupole mass spectrometers (QMS) at auxiliary frequencies for enhanced resolution.","A mass spectrometer is an instrument used to measure the mass, or more specifically the mass to charge ratio, of ionized atoms or electrically charged particles. Mass spectrometers help determine the composition of an unknown sample by isolating ionized atoms based on their mass-to-charge ratio, measured in Atomic Mass Units per charge (AMU\/q). Mass spectrometers find widespread application in the basic sciences, medicine, and space-based research. Two common space-related applications of mass spectrometry are the study of the composition of planetary atmospheres and the monitoring of air quality on manned space missions. Although mass spectrometry has been used in space-related applications for many years, usage in space presents unique design challenges, both in terms of detection sensitivity and logistical considerations such as weight and power requirements.","In early mass spectrometers, atoms or molecules were ionized by a hot filament and accelerated through the instrument under the influence of voltage gradients. The ions followed a semi-circular trajectory through the instrument, which utilized a strong magnetic field to selectively direct ions of a specific mass towards a detector. By controlling the strength of the magnetic field and the accelerating voltage, ions of different mass\/charge ratios could be selectively guided towards the detector. These early mass spectrometers suffered from numerous deficiencies and drawbacks, most significantly the difficulty in achieving and maintaining a stable magnetic field.","Quadrupole mass spectrometers (QMS) eliminated the need for magnetic fields. Similar to its predecessor, a QMS employs a hot filament to ionize the atoms or molecules. Ionization results from the conversion of normally neutral atoms or molecules to electrically charged particles. The ions are accelerated through a mass filter having four parallel metal rods, referred to as the quadrupole. DC and RF (frequency \u03a9) voltages are applied to opposing pairs of these rods with opposite polarities to create an electric field inside the rod assembly. For a given DC and RF voltage, only ions of a certain mass-to-charge ratio will pass through the quadrupole filter, while all other ions are thrown out of their original path. The stability region is defined by ion trajectories that are periodic and bounded. A detector placed at the end of the rod assembly opposite the ionizer measures those ions that pass through the quadrupole filter. A mass spectrum is obtained at the detector by measuring the ions passing through the quadrupole filter as the voltages on the quadrupole rods are varied. The mass resolution of the QMS is the maximum atomic mass that can be distinguished. The maximum attainable resolution is determined by both the fidelity of the electronics and the overall tolerances of the instrument design. Generally, the voltages employed in QMS systems are of the order of a few thousand volts to obtain a mass resolution of a few hundred Daltons.","The quadrupole rods can be a circular or hyperbolic. Circular rods are easier to manufacture and consequently cheaper. However, the quadrupole electric field produced with circular rods is slightly distorted, which can reduce the maximum attainable mass resolution of the instrument. Consequently, in applications requiring high mass resolution, the more difficult and expensive to manufacture hyperbolic rods are employed as quadrupole rods.","To improve resolution, the electric field generated by the quadrupole rods can be perturbed by introducing an excitation RF signal at an auxiliary frequency (\u03c9) different from the fundamental frequency (\u03a9). This perturbation causes the original stability region to break into smaller regions termed islands, including an \u2018upper stability island.\u2019 The result of this auxiliary frequency is the creation of bands of instability in the previously stable regions of the electric field. Charged particles having a mass within a certain range that previously passed through a stable region of the electric field may now be thrown off trajectory as they coincide with these islands of instability. In this way, the use of an auxiliary frequency to drive the quadrupole rods allows a QMS to operate with improved resolution. A QMS driven under an auxiliary frequency excitation is able to better differentiate between charged particles having close, yet different masses, or mass-to-charge ratios. The size and shape of the upper stability island is determined by the auxiliary frequency used and the amplitude of the excitation RF signal. To create an island of appropriate size, for example, the auxiliary frequency (\u03c9) inserted into the QMS system needs to be near an integer multiple of the fundamental RF frequency (i.e., \u03c9=0-0.1\u03a9, 0.9-1.1\u03a9, 1.9-2.1\u03a9, etc.). Employing an excitation RF signal in one of these auxiliary frequency ranges in conjunction with the DC voltage U and the RF voltage V allows for improved resolution and discrimination between ions with small differences in their mass-to-charge ratio. In general, the auxiliary signal amplitude required for appropriate island formation increases with auxiliary signal frequency.","Unfortunately, this use of auxiliary frequency excitation presents problems in constrained applications, such as space-based applications, where it is advantageous for the QMS to have increased sensitivity and enhanced resolution to better detect and differentiate between complex molecules with higher masses. Having to excite the quadrupoles with an excitation RF signal at an auxiliary frequency in order to create islands of stability\/instability requires higher power and increased complexity of the voltage control system. Additionally, the excitation RF signal must be driven at an amplitude that corresponds to a few hundred volts (\u02dc10% of the fundamental RF signal amplitude), to create islands of the appropriate size. However, in space-based applications, power and size is at a premium.","Other factors that affect the resolution and accuracy of the measurement made by the QMS are imperfections in the rods and limitations of the electronics. Furthermore, electronic component values drift with temperature and time, which can have the material effect of shifting the operating point of the quadrupole sufficiently to degrade the detected mass spectrum.","Thus there exists a need to enable a QMS to resolve species of heavy, complex molecules in a power efficient manner, but also to improve the tolerance of the instrument to variations in electronic component values.","One aspect of the disclosure exploits the characteristic resonant properties of the QMS to increase the dynamic range of the excitation voltage amplitudes used for stability island formation by operating at high (\u03c9=1.9\u03a9-2.1\u03a9) auxiliary frequencies. Another aspect of the disclosure is the insertion of an additional resonance at a desired auxiliary frequency (\u03c9) into the QMS by the introduction of a resistive-inductive-capacitive (RLC) tank circuit, to allow for the creation of appropriately sized islands of stability using less power than other conventional techniques. The additional resonance enables power-efficient excitation of the QMS at the auxiliary frequency (\u03c9). Another aspect of the disclosure employs combinations of RLC networks within the resonant tank circuit of the QMS to selectively create different resonance at any number of desired auxiliary frequencies (\u03c9). With the present techniques, these ratios of \u03c9\/\u03a9 may be maintained at higher frequencies, e.g., 2, 3, 4, and 5\u03a9, while still achieving an improvement in the power efficiency in comparison to conventional notions. Yet another aspect of the disclosure is to implement a feedback circuit to dynamically control amplitudes of all frequency components.","In an embodiment, a method of isolating a sample characterized by a characteristic atomic mass unit value using a quadrupole assembly, the method includes: injecting the sample into the quadrupole assembly, where the quadrupole assembly is formed of two pairs of opposing quadrupole rods; and adjusting the impedance characteristic of the quadrupole rods to set a first resonant point and a second resonant point for the quadrupole assembly, such that the first resonant point substantially corresponds to a first resonant frequency of the quadrupole assembly and such that the second resonant point substantially corresponds to a second resonant frequency of the quadrupole assembly, wherein the second resonant frequency is different than first resonant frequency.","In another embodiment, an apparatus to control a Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer (QMS), the apparatus includes: an impedance network to receive a drive excitation signal to provide power to the QMS and to produce a frequency-dependent power usage level feedback signal; and a controller configured to transmit the drive excitation to the impedance network, wherein the controller is coupled to receive the frequency-dependent power usage level feedback signal and wherein the controller controls the amplitude component of the drive excitation signal.","In yet another embodiment, a method for energizing a multi-resonant tank circuit with a composite signal, the multi-resonant tank circuit comprising a plurality of components wherein the plurality of components include a multiplicity of capacitive elements and a plurality of inductive elements, the method includes: generating a first signal having a first frequency, wherein the first frequency corresponds to a first resonant frequency of the multi-resonant tank circuit, and wherein the first signal is generated from a clock source; generating a second signal having a second frequency, wherein the second frequency corresponds to a second resonant frequency of the multi-resonant tank circuit, and wherein the second signal is generated from the clock source; synthesizing a composite signal by utilizing the first signal and the second signal; and coupling the composite signal to the multi-resonant tank circuit thereby causing the multi-resonant tank circuit to be energized at, at least the first resonant frequency and the second resonant frequency.","An example implementation includes a feedback control system to enable a QMS to efficiently achieve increased range, accuracy, and resolution at desired \u03c9\/\u03a9 ratios. The system achieves this by tuning the frequency dependent characteristics of the QMS at the desired fundamental frequency \u03a9 and at the auxiliary frequency \u03c9. A closed-loop tuning improves the stability of the measurement by adjusting for temporal drifts in the operating characteristics of the QMS and variations in operating temperature.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","10","13","12","13","14","14","11","10"],"sub":["o ","qp","qp ","in "]},"The representative capacitive element  and the secondary coil  each have frequency dependent and frequency independent impedance components. The tank circuit  operates power efficiently when the frequency dependant impedance of the inductor  and the capacitive element  are close to each other or equal. At a characteristic frequency of the tank circuit , the frequency dependent capacitive and inductive impedances cancel each other. The frequency at which this occurs is the resonant frequency, f, of the tank circuit . Driving an electrical signal through the tank circuit  or energizing the tank circuit  with an electrical signal at the resonant frequency fis generally considered most efficient, from a power utilization perspective. Thus, by selecting the fundamental frequency \u03a9 of an RF signal used to energize the QMS to be as close to the characteristic resonant frequency fof the tank circuit  (comprising the intra-quadrupole rod capacitance Cand the inductor  of inductance L), the efficient generation of appropriate voltages across the quadrupole rods  is assured. Preferably, the fundamental frequency \u03a9 substantially corresponds to the characteristic resonant frequency fof the circuit by being within a frequency range such that the impedance of the tank circuit is within its \u22123 dB value of the peak impedance value at f. This corresponds to a frequency range of 0.9 to 1.1 times f.","However, improving QMS instrument resolution, by creating islands of stability involves, in addition to energizing the QMS with the RF signal of frequency \u03a9, energizing the QMS with an RF signal at an auxiliary frequency \u03c9 that is preferably near, and not necessarily exactly at some integer multiple of the fundamental frequency \u03a9. However, when driving the tank circuit  with the RF signal at the auxiliary frequency \u03c9 the frequency dependent impedance of the inductor  and capacitive element  comprising intra-quadrupole rod capacitance Cdo not cancel each other. Consequently, the tank circuit  presents a substantial impedance to the RF signal at the auxiliary frequency \u03c9, thus expending higher levels of power to produce the desired auxiliary excitation. In space-related applications providing this higher power is prohibitively expensive and impractical. Even selecting the auxiliary frequency \u03c9 to be close to the fundamental RF frequency \u03a9 and the resonant frequency fof the circuit can require significant power levels.","In an example implementation, to ameliorate the previously described shortcomings of the current QMS technology, a series LC circuit  comprising inductive elements - and - having inductances Land Lrespectively and capacitive element  having capacitance Cis electrically connected in parallel with the representative capacitive element  having capacitance C, which is representative of the intra-quadrupole rod capacitance contributed by the quadrupole rods of the QMS, as depicted in . The inductive values Land Land the capacitance Care determined using circuit synthesis techniques, for example Foster's reactance theorem of the 2kind. The circuit synthesis technique is appropriately configured or constrained in a manner such that the determined inductive values Land Land the capacitance Cwill result in a tank circuit  that has one resonant frequency at f, which is equal or close to the RF signal of fundamental frequency \u03a9, and a secondary resonant frequency at f, which is equal or close to the RF signal of the auxiliary frequency \u03c9. The tank circuit  may be referred to as a \u201cmulti-resonant\u201d tank circuit, in part, because tank circuit  has a first resonant frequency at fand a second resonant at f.","In this example, energizing the tank circuit  with a composite signal comprising a RF signal at fundamental frequency \u03a9 and excitation RF signal at auxiliary frequency \u03c9 will produce appropriate voltage drops at reduced power across the quadrupole rods because c=fand \u03c9=f. In the example, L, Land Care selected such that \u03c9\u22482*\u03a9 to generate islands of stability which can improve the sensitivity of the instrument.

This allows the power-efficient excitation of the QMS at the fundamental frequency \u03a9 and RF signals at auxiliary frequency \u03c9 which range from 0\u03a9-0.1\u03a9, 0.9\u03a9-1.1\u03a9, 1.9\u03a9-2.1\u03a9, etc. In another example a combination of capacitance and inductance can be selected in the impedance network to generate more than two resonant points in the circuit.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","401","401","403","404"]},"Simultaneously, the controller  selects inductance and capacitance values for the tunable electrical elements (not shown) in the impedance network  and engages the tunable electrical elements in the impedance network  so as to introduce the selected inductance and capacitance values into the tank circuit . The tank circuit , in this example, comprises the secondary coil  of the transformer , the inductive and capacitive elements selected in the impedance network  and the representative capacitive element  having capacitance C, which is representative of the intra-quadrupole rod capacitance contributed by the quadrupole rods  of the QMS. As described with respect to , values of the inductive and capacitive elements selected in the impedance network  of the tank circuit  produce a tank circuit  that has a first resonant frequency at fand a second resonant at f. By selecting appropriate inductance and capacitance values for impedance network , the controller  can ensure that the fundamental frequency \u03a9 and auxiliary frequency \u03c9 of the generated RF signals are close or equal to the first resonant frequency at fand a second resonant at fof the tank circuit .","In this example, the controller  is implemented in a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) device . Programmable logic primitives in the FPGA  synthesize the fundamental RF signal of frequency \u03a9 in the main Direct Digital Synthesis (DDS) block  and the excitation RF signal of frequency \u03c9 in the auxiliary DDS block .","The FPGA  combines the two RF signals to generate a composite RF signal wherein the RF signal of auxiliary frequency \u03c9 \u201cmodulates\u201d the RF signal of fundamental frequency \u03a9. The resulting composite RF signal drives the input of a linear amplifier . The linear amplifier  amplifies the signal level and increases the current drive. In another example the output impedance of the linear amplifier  is used to match input impedance presented by the primary coil  of the transformer . The FPGA separately introduces the DC voltage into the tank circuit , composed of the secondary coil  of the transformer , the impedance network  and the representative capacitance element  having capacitance C, which is representative of the intra-quadrupole rod capacitance contributed by the quadrupole rods  of the QMS. In this example, the DC voltage is amplified by a second linear amplifier . In another example, a DC-DC converter (not shown) may be used to increase the voltage and current drive of the DC signal before introducing it into the tank circuit . Thus the FPGA may control power-efficient excitation of the QMS at the fundamental frequency \u03a9 and RF signals at auxiliary frequency \u03c9 which range from 0-0.1\u03a9, 0.9-1.1\u03a9, 1.9-2.1\u03a9, etc.","The FPGA  reads a QMS mass selector input . The FPGA uses the settings on the QMS mass selector input  to determine the appropriate amplitudes for the RF signals generated at fundamental frequency \u03a9 and auxiliary frequency \u03c9. As previously explained, based on the amplitudes of the RF signals only ions having a mass corresponding to the mass selected by the QMS mass selector input  will pass through the islands of stability created in the electric field generated by the two pairs of quadrupoles rods . One will recognize that the FPGA  will energize (drive) both the pairs of quadrupole rods simultaneously; the only difference being that the second pair of quadrupoles will be driven with the opposite polarity.","In part, by utilizing the feedback signal , the FPGA  detects the voltage drop generated across the impedance network  at the fundamental frequency \u03a9 and the auxiliary frequency \u03c9, in response to energizing the tank circuit  with the composite RF signal and the DC signal. The FPGA may adjust the fundamental frequency \u03a9 and auxiliary frequencies \u03c9 of the generated RF signals and amplitudes of the RF signals to maximize the voltage drop across the impedance network. Separately, the FPGA  may adjust the values for the inductive and capacitive elements in the impedance network .","In one of the examples, a separate computing device (not shown) generates the digital data required to synthesize the RF signals at fundamental frequency \u03a9, and the auxiliary frequency \u03c9, using a signal processing software application such as MATLAB. The computing device provides this digital data to the FPGA . The FPGA uses this digital data to synthesize the RF signals at fundamental frequency \u03a9 and the auxiliary frequency \u03c9.","In one of the examples, the FPGA includes a control logic block  that communicates with the separate computing device executing the signal processing software application such as MATLAB via a PCI interface . In another embodiment, the control logic block  comprises logic to communicate with the computing device via a compact PCI interface or a USB interface or a Bluetooth interface or an ethernet interface or any other serial or parallel, wired or wireless interface architecture.","In one of the examples, the FPGA  includes DDS blocks. The main DDS logic block  generates the RF signal at the fundamental frequency \u03a9. The auxiliary DDS logic block  generates the RF excitation at the auxiliary frequency \u03c9. An adder element  in the FPGA  combines the digital data generated by the main and auxiliary DDS logic blocks   of the FPGA. The combined digital data generated by the adder  drives the input of a digital-to-analog convertor (DAC) .","In some examples, the digital data driving the DAC  can be in a serial or parallel format and can be encoded in one's compliment, two's compliment or any other format that the DAC can accept. The analog output of the DAC  which is a composite RF signal constitutes the driving waveform that drives the linear amplifier .","In some examples the QMS mass selector input  is an analog signal that drives the input of the analog-to-digital convertor (ADC) . The level of the analog signal relates to the mass of the ions that are of interest. The control logic  utilizes the digital output of the ADC  to control the main and auxiliary DDS blocks  and  to generate the RF signals at the fundamental frequency \u03a9 and auxiliary frequency \u03c9 corresponding to the QMS mass select.","One will recognize that the QMS mass selector input  can be automatically swept by an external device. In one of the examples, sweeping the QMS mass selector input causes the control logic  to vary the DC and RF voltages to produce a mass spectrum measurement. The control logic also generates the digital signals necessary to provide appropriate driving amplitudes of the RF signals at frequency \u03a9 and auxiliary frequency \u03c9.","The digital signals are converted by the DAC  to generate an analog signal that is used to drive the tank circuit  with the composite RF signal of frequency \u03a9 and auxiliary frequency \u03c9. In another example, a second analog signal from the DAC  adjusts the inductance or the capacitance or a combination of the inductance and the capacitance of the impedance network . In yet another example, the second analog signal will adjust a varactor diode to change the capacitance of the impedance network .

In yet other examples , the linear amplifier is selected so that its output impedance is matched to the input impedance of the primary of the step-up transformer. One skilled in the art will recognize that other impedance matching techniques can be employed to reduce distortion.","Although in the example of , a linear amplifier  is utilize to amplify the driving waveform produced by the DAC , in other examples a non-linear amplifier may be utilized. Examples of such non-linear amplifiers include amplifiers configured to operate as class C amplifiers. Although an amplifier configured to operate as a class C amplifier may \u201cclip\u201d the driving waveform (the composite RF signal) thereby causing distortion, however when the amplifier is coupled to a resonant circuit such as tank circuit , distortion contributed by harmonics of the fundamental frequency and the auxiliary frequency are suppressed or filtered resulting in power efficient operation at the fundamental at frequency \u03a9 and auxiliary frequency \u03c9.","In some examples, the feedback line  is electrically connected from the impedance network  to the analog-to-digital convertor (ADC) . The signal on the feedback line  (feedback signal) is an electrical representation of the voltage drops across the quadrupole rods . For example, the feedback signal may indicate a frequency-dependent power usage level of the quadrupole assembly and thus provide a signal from which the control logic  may determine which particular amplitude on the auxiliary frequency value is optimum for most efficient power operation. In other examples, the feedback signal  may be determined in such a way that the apparatus may additionally, or separately, determine which auxiliary frequency, with a range of frequencies (e.g., 0.9-2.1\u03a9), is preferred for optimum operation.","The impedance network  is adapted with a tunable element to enable the control logic  to select a band of frequencies that are transmitted back on the feedback signal . The ADC  converts the feedback signal  to its digital representation. The output of the ADC  is connected to a peak and phase detector . In one example, the peak detector  determines the signal amplitudes of all frequency components as observed by the quadrupole rods. In another example, the control logic  ensures that maximum voltage drops occur at RF fundamental frequency \u03a9 and RF excitation auxiliary frequency \u03c9, by adjusting elements in the impedance network , as previously discussed.","In another example, the phase detector of the peak and phase detector block  detects the phase mismatch between the fundamental frequency \u03a9 and RF excitation auxiliary frequency \u03c9.

Of course, the frequencies of the synthesized signals would be closely aligned to the first and second resonant frequencies of the RC circuit .","At block , the DAC  may be appropriately configured to generate the desired DC voltage (U). Also, the method implemented at block  may configure the DAC  to appropriately configure the amplitudes of the RF fundamental and auxiliary signals that are synthesized by the DDS block . The gain of the RF amplifier  and the DC amplifier  are adjusted to generate the desired DC voltage (U) and a composite signal comprising the RF fundamental and auxiliary signals having the desired RF voltage (V). In some scenarios, the method implemented at block  may perform closed-loop monitoring of the RF amplifier  and the DC amplifier  in part to stabilize the voltage levels. The signals generated at the output of the RF amplifier  and the DC amplifier  are used to drive the RC circuit , thereby causing excitation of the QMS rods  with i) the RF fundamental and auxiliary signals having frequencies of \u03a9 and \u03c9 and ii) RF voltage level (V) and the DC voltage (U).","At block , the method may transmit to a master control (not shown) an indication that the QMS is configured. Of course, the method  may continue to perform closed-loop monitoring of the voltage control system .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 4"],"b":["720","720","720","720","420","416","418","720","402","400","720","420","720","720","404","720"],"sub":"qp "},"At block , the resonant characteristics of the multi-resonant circuit may be determined. This step may be performed, for example, by initiating a \u201cread back\u201d of the RF feedback . The method may initiate a read back by causing the ADC  to digitize the signal received via the RF feedback . By selecting an appropriate sampling rate, the ADC  may be utilized to digitize a band of frequencies, which include the signals having the frequencies \u03a9 and \u03c9. Suitable IFFT algorithms may be implemented at block  to analyze the amplitudes of the digitized signal across a range of frequencies. The result of the analysis may include the amplitudes of the digitized signal at several frequencies including the frequencies \u03a9 and \u03c9.","At block , the amplitudes of the digitized signal may be analyzed to identify if the first and second resonant frequencies of the RC circuit  have drifted. The result of the analysis may include the generation of an indication corresponding to the error between the desired first and second resonant frequencies of the RC circuit  (frequencies \u03a9 and \u03c9) and the actual first and second resonant frequencies of the RC circuit . The drift may also cause a change in the relative phase difference between the RF signals. The peak and phase detector  of  may detect this change in phase.","The resulting error may be converted into an error signal at block . The error signal may be utilized to adjust component settings (a tunable capacitor or inductor, for example) of the tank circuit , to align the first and second resonant frequency of the RC circuit  with the frequency \u03a9 and \u03c9, respectively. The method implemented at block  may iteratively adjust component settings based on repeated digitization of the RF feedback  by the ADC , to minimize the error. Any phase difference detected by peak and phase detector  may be adjusted for as well.","While the present invention has been described with reference to specific examples, which are intended to be illustrative only and not to be limiting of the invention, it will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that changes, additions, and\/or deletions may be made to the disclosed embodiments without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.","The foregoing description is given for clearness of understanding only, and no unnecessary limitations should be understood therefrom, as modifications within the scope of the invention may be apparent to those having ordinary skill in the art."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 7"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
