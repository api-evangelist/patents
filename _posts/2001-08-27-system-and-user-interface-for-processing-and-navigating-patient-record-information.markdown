No. 09\/939,965 filed 27 Aug. 2001.","This is a non-provisional application of U.S. provisional applications Ser. No. 60\/287,274 by K. O'Rourke filed Apr. 27, 2001 and Ser. No. 60\/287,644 by K. O'Rourke filed Apr. 30, 2001.","This invention concerns a system and user interface for use by a portable processing device or other device for secure access, navigation and processing of the medical record information of a patient.","The use of the traditional patient chart document by physicians in periodic hospital rounds and for other functions is hampered by many limitations. The chart needs to be located, reviewed and commandeered by a physician preventing others from using it and the chart is readily subject to being misplaced or mistreated. Other limitations include the absence of an efficient patient chart indexing mechanism and the associated difficulty of locating particular information (especially where the chart is bulky and covers lengthy, periodic, or complex treatment regimes). In addition, the fact that there is a single copy of the chart means it typically is kept near the patient limiting chart access for review and analysis by a physician at a later time and a different location. Similarly, a single copy of the chart also makes it difficult to keep the chart up-to-date with details of the latest treatment orders and test results.","The advent of computerized patient records enabling access to current information from many locations has addressed some of these issues. However, electronic patient record processing systems are also constrained by limitations. Specifically, computer access terminals are often not at the point of care. This requires a physician to print a report or carry the original paper chart in order to obtain a portable record. In contrast, a portable patient record processing device permits a physician to access and search current patient record information at the point of care using tools provided by the computerized patient record system. Ideally, the portable device, such as a palmtop computer, has a display large enough to easily view a patient record yet small enough to facilitate portability. However, available portable systems for processing patient record information are limited in their capabilities for securely accessing, transferring and updating patient record information and in their capabilities for creating and navigating image menus supporting the location and access of desired patient record data by a user. A system according to invention principles addresses these problems and derivative problems","A system facilitates the processing and navigation of image menus and data in support of the location and access of desired patient record data by a user. A system provides a user interface for use by a portable processing device for accessing and navigating patient record information. The system receives user identification information for use in authorizing user operation of the portable processing device and initiates display of an image including a plurality of links to a corresponding plurality of individual patients. The system also initiates display of a patient record content index image including a plurality of links to a corresponding plurality of items of patient record information in response to user selection of a link to one of the plurality of individual patients. The system further initiates display of an image including information comprising a portion of a patient record in response to user selection of a link to one of the plurality of items of patient record information.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"Patient medical record and other information from a patient record repository is downloaded to a portable processing device for storage by the device. The downloaded information is specially formatted for the portable device display and is viewed using a browser optimized for navigating healthcare information on the display. The downloaded patient record information is accessible by a user of the portable processing device without requiring a persistent connection to the patient record repository. Further, a user is able to advantageously initiate another application on the device whilst concurrently viewing a patient record. For this purpose patient information is transparently passed to the initiated application and upon completion of the initiated application control returns to the original application managing the displayed patient record.","The network architecture of  is exemplary only. The portable processing devices may operate in a variety of network environments involving one or more hierarchically arranged LANs or WANs including Ethernet-compatible LANs (used to connect different hospital departments, for example) and multiple Medical Interface Buses (MIBs) for corresponding multiple patients. In addition, a portable processing device is able to access the Internet via a firewall and other intranets (not shown) using a dial-up telephone connection, ADSL, cable modem or other types of connection. Individual portable processing devices are Internet Protocol (IP) compatible but may also employ other protocols supporting communication connectivity among the networked devices.","The network system of  supports the transfer of patient medical record information between portable devices  and  as well as the secure access and update of medical record information in the record repository of information system . Portable devices  and  each comprise a controller  for processing data and commands received via communication interface  as well as via data entry from attached data entry devices including a keyboard and mouse or other cursor controls (not shown to preserve drawing clarity). Controller  initiates display of menus and acquired information on display  and bi-directionally communicates with medical information system  and other portable processing devices and Internet and other Intra-net connections via communication interface . Portable processing devices  and , using controllers  and interfaces , directly bi-directionally communicate with each other via an infra-red serial port connection  and also communicate with each other and information system  and the Internet and other intra-net systems, for example, using other communication links. Such other communication links include a serial connection  to PC  and from PC  via Ethernet connection  to LAN  and system  (or the Internet and other external connections via a firewall, for example). Alternatively device  may directly communicate via Ethernet connection  with LAN  and system . Similarly, portable device  may directly communicate via Ethernet connection  with LAN  and system .

The sequence of menus supports user navigation and enables user selection of information elements to be transferred to portable processing device  in step . User selected information elements to be transferred may include, for example, medical information associated with a group of patients, and medical information associated with a specific patient. Other user selected information elements to be transferred may include, laboratory test results for a specific patient, a medical report associated with a group of patients and medical information associated with a specific healthcare provider and an associated group of patients. In step , controller  validates that the user of processing device  is authorized to access the information selected for transfer (e.g., via password verification) and inhibits communication of those selected information elements for which the user is denied access. Processing device  (in conjunction with controller ) inhibits acquisition and storing by device  of selected information elements for which the user is denied access in order to prevent their communication to processing device .","In step , controller  of processing device  validates that the user of processing device , the intended recipient of the information, is authorized to access the information selected for transfer. Controller  does this based on pre-stored authorization information (e.g. a password) or on information communicated to processing device  from device  identifying the device  user as an authorized recipient of the selected information elements. Upon unsuccessful validation, controller  inhibits transfer of the selected information. Upon successful validation, controller  in step  establishes communication with portable processing device  via interface  using the communication settings previously selected in step . Controller  in step  communicates the selected information elements together with the associated patient identification information elements (previously identified in step  to accompany a data transfer) on the established communication link. If an Infra-Red communication link is established, step  involves a user pointing an IR port of device  at the receiving device . Thereby, patient information selected on portable processing device  is transferred to a user of portable processing device .","A user may transfer an entire list of patients, details of an individual patient, or a set of results for a patient, for transfer in the previously described manner.

Alternatively, a current page of information may be selected for transfer. For this purpose a user may select \u201cBeam Current Page\u201d item  of  and controller  initiates transfer of the current patient details or information set that is currently being displayed. A similar technique is used to copy information to an internal clipboard of device . In this case, a user selects a \u201cCopy\u201d function, e.g., item  instead.

This is facilitated by the dynamic generation by controller  in step  of a patient record content index. It is a hyperlinked content index to each of the major sections of a patient chart such as Chemistry, Hematology, Vital Signs etc. as exemplified in elements - of . The patient record content index is created dynamically by a remote application running on a server as the patient record information is generated and communicated to processing device . As the server application collates individual sections of a patient record for communication to processing device , it also creates individual URL links to corresponding record sections for use in a patient record content index. Specifically, as a new section of patient record data is retrieved from a record repository, a name of that section (e.g. Chemistry) is identified and stored in a memory buffer as an HTML hyperlink tag pointing to the report section it references","The server application derives content index information from collated patient record information by parsing the patient record information or by parsing ancillary data associated with the patient record information. This is done in order to identify distinct patient record information sections for listing in a content index page as URL links to patient record sections. The ancillary data comprises, for example, header data of the patient record information, descriptive data in a data field of acquired patient record information, identification data in a data field of acquired patient record information, and text data derived by parsing content of acquired patient record information. Upon completion of collation of patient record for an individual patient for communication to processing device , the server application creates an additional record section for incorporation in the patient record comprising the patient record content index incorporating the created links for the corresponding patient record sections. In another embodiment, the patient record content index is created within processing device  in response to receiving a patient medical record by parsing received patient medical record data to identify section headings for listing in a contents index page.","In step  controller  initiates display of a patient record index for a patient (Valerie Bloom) as shown in  in response to user selection of link  (). Further, in step  controller  initiates display of a desired section (e.g., a Hemo-Common\u2014hematology section detailing common blood test results) of the patient record for the patient (Valerie Bloom) in response to user selection of Hemo-Common link  (as shown in ). In this manner a user is able to advantageously navigate directly to desired patient record sections by selecting a hyperlinked index item associated with the desired patient record section (e.g., items - of ). The desired Hemo-Common patient record section comprising patient laboratory test results selected in step  is shown in . The displayed results include labels, e.g., item  wbc (white blood count) identifying the test together with test values obtained on different measurement days. In addition, patient record text section names occurring in a patient record, such as CT Scans (ITEM ), Nuclear Medicine (item ) and Special procedures (item ) of  may also link to portions of a patient record. Selecting CT Scans  results in display of text section  of , for example.","Another exemplary section listed on a patient record index is a link to a Heme-survey menu which may also be selected and displayed in step , for example, in response to user selection of a Heme-survey link in a patient record index. The Heme-survey menu of  similarly shows labels, e.g., wbc (white blood count) identifying a test together with test values (e.g., items  and ). In step , in response to user selection of a displayed label (e.g., wbc) in the Heme-survey menu (or the menu of ) a reference range for the wbc test is displayed in  (item ) indicating the range of normal values for a given type of result together with the associated unit of measure. For example, hemoglobin (hgb) show a normal (or reference) range of 11.8 to 15.4 grams per deciliter. The use of a separate menu to indicate a reference range and unit of measure for a parameter or test result, in response to selection of a parameter label hyperlink, advantageously preserves limited display space on a portable processing device display screen.","In a further navigation feature illustrated in , row and column leading items such as items  and  are automatically locked as a user scrolls. For this purpose controller  in step  maintains item  stationary whilst a user horizontally scrolls the screen image, thereby advantageously enabling a user to associate a result value with a parameter (e.g. wbc ) as the user horizontally scrolls through values of the parameter. Similarly, controller  in step  maintains item  stationary whilst a user vertically scrolls the screen image, thereby advantageously enabling a user to associate parameter values with a test date  as a user vertically scrolls through different parameters and associated values.

Specifically, the data fields include information about the user and information identifying a specific content portion of a particular patient medical record to be acquired. In step , the generated URL is communicated to an application at the repository address used by system  in accessing its patient record repository. For this purpose, portable processing device , establishes communication with the system  application via a PC or server serial ports using a serial cradle or infra-red transceiver connection or via an Ethernet connection to PC or server Ethernet ports using an Ethernet cradle or infra-red transceiver connection or other WAN (Wide Area Network), LAN (Local Area Network) or wireless connection.","In step , the system  application searches the record repository to locate and identify the requested medical record portion in response to the URL query data and creates HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) pages from the located patient medical record information.

Further, in step , controller  generates a URL including an address of the system  record repository and data fields in query format including the identified patient record updates not previously communicated to the repository. Using the generated URL, controller  in step  communicates the identified time stamped patient record updates to the system  repository at the repository address in response to user initiation of communication via a displayed menu icon. In step , at the system  patient record repository, the patient record and record content portion to be updated are identified using the identification information derived from the received URL data fields. If an error was detected by system  in receiving the updated information then the information is retransmitted from the portable processing device in response to an error notification from system . The time stamped patient record updates and amendments are stored in the identified record content portion in step  and the process of  terminates at step .","The updated patient record information collected via one or more data collection pages may be sent to update a record repository as in  or may be Emailed to another remote location or may be printed. For this purpose controller  initiates display of a menu including selectable icons allowing user selection of Print, Email or record repository update options. If the print option is selected a portable processing device uses an infrared port to send the updated data collection information in printer compatible format to an infrared capable printer in response to a user command. Specifically the portable processing device sends to the printer those pages that have not been previously printed. Alternatively, another communication link, e.g., a serial port link, may be used to do this. The stored information in the portable processing device is time stamped to indicate the time of printing. If a problem in printing is detected the data collection pages are resent to the printer.","If the Email option is selected a portable processing device Emails the updated data collection pages, time stamped to indicate they were sent, to an Email address or a fax destination as required, in response to user command. For this purpose a user enters an email destination address via the displayed menu options. In similar fashion to the record update and print functions, various communication mechanisms may be used for the Email function including, Ethernet, serial link, and wireless mechanisms as previously described.
