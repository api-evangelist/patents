title: Systems and methods for secure voice communications
abstract: A secure voice solution for a PDA-type device is provided. Voice data is received from the user using the device microphone and built- in media player software in the device. This data is encrypted and sent as an IP packet. The device then receives, as IP packets, encrypted voice communication from the other party in the encrypted call, which in turn are decrypted in the device and played back on a second media player running on the device. The present invention takes advantage of the device's ability to run two media players simultaneously to in effect, simulate a cellular telephone call. As a result, an encrypted call can be made with PDA-type devices such as the BlackberryÂ® and also such calls can be made using different data paths (cellular, WiFi, Bluetooth) as the calls are made by sending and receiving data over the Internet, not as traditional cellular data signals.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The present application claims priority from Provisional U.S. patent application Ser. No. 61\/312,279 filed on Mar. 10, 2010, and incorporated herein by reference.","The present invention relates to cellular telephones and personal digital assistants. In particular, the present invention is directed toward a voice encryption system for the Blackberry\u00ae PDA cell phone device.","Fascenda, Published U.S. Patent Application Nos. US 2009169013, US 2009172412, US2009268902, assigned to KOOLSPAN, INC. (Hereinafter referred to as the KOOLSPAN patent applications) and incorporated herein by reference, disclose a system for and method of providing end-to-end encrypted real-time phone calls using a commodity mobile phone and without requiring service provider cooperation. The system and method improve upon prior art techniques by omitting any requirement for mobile phones that are specially manufactured to include end-to-end encryption functionality.","The KOOLSPAN patent applications generally relate to a system for and method of secure telephony. More particularly, they relate to a system for and method of receiving and making encrypted phone calls to and from, respectively, a mobile phone. In the KOOLSPAN Applications, key tables may be stored in one or both of the commodity mobile phone and the integrated circuit with which the commodity mobile phone is provisioned. The key tables may be delivered to or generated by the mobile phone, or may be present on the integrated circuit when the integrated circuit is acquired. For delivered key tables, managed providers or enterprises may monitor and track the delivery of the key tables.","The initial authentication step, includes the commodity mobile phone transmitting to the destination phone a list of IDs for key tables that the commodity mobile phone has access to. Upon receiving the list of key table IDs, the destination phone selects from the list an ID of a key table to which the destination phone also has access. At this point, the commodity mobile phone and the destination phone both have possession of at least one session key as a result of the authentication process. The phones then use the session key(s), either directly or as a basis for other keys, to encrypt and decrypt voice communications sent and received over the selected communications channel (e.g., CSD, voice, etc.). The actual encryption and decryption operations may be performed by a dedicated cryptographic processor present in the integrated circuit that the commodity mobile phone is provisioned with, by software executing on the phone, or by using other techniques. For GSM phones and in certain embodiments, all data existing between the respective phones' Adaptive Multi-Rate (\u201cAMR\u201d) codecs may be encrypted using the session key(s), thereby providing for end-to-end encrypted phone calls.","The technique disclosed in the KOOLSPAN patents encrypts data in a regular GSM type cellular telephone call. While this may work for some types of cellular telephones, it may not be workable for other devices, including cellular devices that are combined with Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) and\/or other communications type devices (text messaging, internet access, or the like).","It's estimated that more than 12 million BlackBerry devices are currently in use in government and commercial environments. While these tools greatly enhance productivity and convenience, they can also expose organizations to serious risks if not properly secured. Though secure phone solutions exist, they have traditionally been expensive, difficult to acquire and cumbersome to maintain and operate. Many are also easily distinguishable as secure phones, which compromises operational security and exposes their users.","However, to date, an effective technique for applying the technology of the KOOLSPAN patent applications to the Blackberry mobile device has not been implemented. Thus, it remains a requirement in the art to provide a technique for providing voice encryption for use with a Blackberry type PDA\/cellular device.","VoIP solutions are known in the art for use with computer systems, including laptops and PCs and the like. Vonage, Skype and other systems allow users to send and receive phone calls using personal computers such as laptops or desktop PCs. Skype has implemented VoIP type communications for cell phones, but does not provide voice encryption for such applications.","The present invention provides a secure voice solution for the BlackBerry 9000 (BlackBerry Bold\u2122) and other PDA type devices, that is discreet, easy-to-use and cost-effective. Currently supported\/tested devices include BlackBerry 8900, 9000, and 9700 models, including GSM-based BlackBerry models with a 4.6 operating system and above. One Vault Voice\u2122 is a combination of hardware and software that work together to create a fully hardened, self-contained secure communication environment. By integrating a proprietary communication application with a hardened encryption module\u2014TrustChip\u00ae\u2014One Vault Voice offers a differentiating cyber security solution that enables users to have seamless voice protection whenever and wherever they need to place a sensitive call.","Rather than making encrypted voice calls through traditional GSM cellular phone calls, the present invention instead receives voice data from the user using the device microphone (built-in microphone, headset microphone, or even a Bluetooth wireless headset) and built-in media player software in the device. This data is then encrypted and then sent as an UDP\/IP packet. The device then receives, as IP packets, encrypted voice communication from the other party in the encrypted call, which in turn are decrypted in the device and then played back via a second media player running on the device. The present invention takes advantage of the device's ability to run two media players simultaneously to in effect, simulate a cellular telephone call. As a result, an encrypted call can be made with PDA-type devices such as the Blackberry\u00ae and also such calls can be made using different data paths (cellular, WiFi, Bluetooth, or the like) as the calls are made by sending and receiving data over the Internet, not as traditional cellular data signals. Alternately, an extension to the application may allow a user to run secure calls in a \u2018sandboxed\u2019 network. An isolated network, not connected to the internet, could be used as a transport. For example, a Wifi network aboard a sailing vessel could be used to transmit secure calls between users.","The present invention may utilize the encryption technology employed by KOOLSPAN as used in their Trust Chips and as discussed previously. However the KOOLSPAN technology is employed only as an \u201coff the shelf\u201d (OTS) solution for the encryption portion of the invention, and other types of encryption may be used within the spirit and scope of the invention. In an alternative embodiment, a software-only encryption method may be used as an alternative to hardware encryption, as an option where or when hardware encryption is not available. The disclosure of the KoolSpan technology in the present application is provided to comply with the \u201cbest mode\u201d requirement, illustrating the best mode contemplated at the time of filing of the present application.","As a result, the present invention can be deployed and managed quickly and seamlessly without the need for advanced training, additional handsets or new service plans. One Vault Voice also costs less than other options and it can be easily removed and reinstalled into another Blackberry, as needed, making it extremely portable and convenient.","As stated, the present invention uses multiple media players to simulate a duplex voice call. Current BlackBerry Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) do not provide a mechanism for reducing audio playback buffering. The built-in buffering, likely built for internet media streaming, would introduce excessive conversational latency. The present invention uses multiple operating system dependent methods to reduce playback lag to limit delay.","Cellular data protocols can introduce variable data latency, which can negatively impact voice communications. The adaptive audio buffer controls both the sending and receiving portion of the application. In this way the application can proactively modify the buffering and data packet sizes to provide the best overall voice experience for current network conditions. Mechanisms are employed to reduce gaps in conversation and balance that against introducing latency.","The One Vault Voice system has a number of advantages over the Prior Art. It is discreet and highly portable and costs less than traditional secure voice solutions. It is easy to use, and it is also easily scalable and rapidly deployable. In addition, the One Vault Voice system provides enhanced security over the Prior Art by combining its unique implementation and buffering with the use of the KOOLSPAN encryption hardware and technology. It provides simplified security for both users and IT and is highly scalable.","Once One Vault Voice is installed, all a user needs to do to place a secure call is select the contact (i.e. the person he\/she wants to call) via the BlackBerry address book, and select the \u201cPlace Secure Call\u201d. One Vault Voice does the rest. The One Vault Voice system of the present invention initiates the call by sending an SMS or PIN message to the Blackberry device of the call recipient. In an alternative embodiment, \u2018automatic\u2019 call forwarding is enabled, where the phone is programmed not to accept voice calls while a secure call is in progress. After the secure call ends, the call forwarding is deactivated. Depending upon data path (cell, WiFi, or the like) and the available contact information (Phone Number, BlackBerry PIN), a SMS or PIN message is selected. Unlike Prior Art systems, which use cellular connections only and SMS messages to initiate calls, initial communication in the present invention between devices may take place using SMS, PIN or other types of messages to initiate the call.","Securing voice communications through One Vault Voice helps prevent costly and irreversible disclosure of sensitive information through eavesdropping on a non-secure commercial network. With One Vault Voice, end-to-end security for transmitted data is not only maintained between the wireless handset and the nearest cellular tower, but it is also secured while the data traverses the carrier's network. One Vault Voice, in conjunction with the KoolSpan API, also provides the capability of conclusively authenticating all parties, prior to establishing the call, without relying on a carrier-based caller ID. The KoolSpan API provides a security authentication string which may be read by participants to verify that the call has not been intercepted.","One Vault Voice can be installed in most client environments in one day. In a typical scenario, deployment consists of installation and configuration of a configurable One Vault Voice Relay Server, over the air client code installation, and optional installation and configuration of the TrustChip management platform, the TrustCenter. The One Vault Voice Relay Server is responsible for connecting handsets across various networks by providing a single IP location for all data transmissions. TrustCenter provides the user with complete control, including easy-to-configure access control and enhanced security capabilities for the TrustChip portion of the One Vault Voice solution. The system provides organizations with a secure operational capability while minimizing cost and risk. Client application installation can be done via the TrustChip, over the air by the user, or remotely by a BlackBerry Enterprise Server Administrator.","In the preferred embodiment, the present invention utilizes the TrustChip manufactured by KoolSpan as an off-the-shelf (OTS) solution for providing encryption of data transmitted through the system. However, the present invention utilizes the TrustChip in a manner different from that presently employed by KoolSpan. Other types of encryption chips or solutions may be applied within the spirit and scope of the present invention, including but not limited to, those provided by CellCrypt, SecurDigital, and GoldLock or the like.","In a process known as Smart Data Thinning, when data accumulates in a buffer above a threshold, the entire buffer is thinned, dropping intermittent small portions of the audio data. The remaining audio data remains comprehensible when presented to the user. Multiple thresholds are defined and thinning becomes more aggressive as needed. Aggressively thinned audio may become incomprehensible but when presented to the user, it lets them know there is still a connection.","In addition, the present invention employs a technique known as Performance Dependant Variable Packet Size. Under optimal conditions, small package size and correlating small optimization buffers should result in lowest call latency. However, processing many smaller packets increases the load on the mobile device and can negatively affect the frequency of which audio data from the hardware is delivered to the transport system. Processing many smaller packets is also more demanding of the network components. To avoid these problems, data is analyzed from performance metrics (delivery frequency and buffer accumulation) and data package sizes are adjusted accordingly\u2014i.e., lower performance result in large package sizes.","The present invention solves the problems of the Prior Art and allows secure encrypted voice signals to be sent as audio data packets over an Internet connection in a Blackberry type device through the use of dual media players and optimized buffering.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":"100"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 8","FIG. 9","FIGS. 1 and 8"],"b":["100","100","170","130","100","120","110","150","140","150","160","170"]},"Referring to , keys  may be stored in secure key storage . Keys  may comprise a collection of random 256-bit keys and may be common to members of a TrustGroup as will be discussed in more detail below. Keys  are used for authentication purposes but are not used for encryption of audio data. Keys  may be used in a hardware computation to generate a unique session key, as is known in the art. Dozens of such keys  may be loaded into a trust chip . Keys  are not exposed to the end user and are protected by tamper-proof hardware.","Handsets , are illustrated in  as being provided with TrustChips , respectively. TrustChips  is described above and as shown in . The operation of handsets , is illustrated in detail . In a traditional cell phone call, voice is input through the handset microphone  and sent to another cell phone through traditional telephony channels. Received voice signals from another handset are played back through a handset speaker . In the present invention, voice input into the device through handset microphone  (or headset microphone, Bluetooth microphone, or the like) is routed  to an audio player (Mobile Media API)  which converts the voice signals to a media player data format which is then transmitted to the receiving phone in a similar manner to an MP3 tune, video, or other media file. Received data from another device may be converted back to audio signals in a second Mobile Media API Audio Player , which in turn may be routed  to handset speaker  (or headset speaker or Bluetooth speaker or the like). Thus, instead of sending the voice signals as traditional cell phone calls, in the present invention, two media players may be run simultaneously to emulate a cell phone call by sending and receiving the voice communications as media player data.","Output data may be sent through an optimization buffer  and received data received through a similar buffer . With traditional media files (e.g., MP3 music files, video files, or the like) a relatively large amount of buffering may actually be desired, so that playback is not interrupted by delays in the network connections and the like. However, when trying to use media pathways in a telephony application, such buffering can create delays, which are unacceptable for normal conversations. The present invention includes a technique for managing the buffers and network packets to reduce the amount of data in the buffer and optimize the quality of the conversation by balancing latency and smooth audio playback.","When using the media player to send and receive voice data, the application should prevent the media player from buffering too much data, which would introduce audio delays in the calls. To achieve this effect, the present invention employs two techniques to prevent audio delays. First, as previously discussed, are the techniques used running a custom media player Data Source to limit initial playback delay to acceptable levels. Second is a packet and audio buffer optimization that keeps the audio as \u2018smooth\u2019 as possible when dealing with network and device resource inconsistencies. The optimization buffer(s) , balance the various audio quality aspects to provide the best overall user experience under inconsistent network and host device performance conditions for an encrypted mobile VoIP system.","Mobile network data stream inconsistencies and device performance constraints, such as Dropped\/lost data, Out of order data, Inconsistent frequencies of data delivery due to variable delivery times (network latency), Mobile Device Performance Limitations and the like may create variable timing delays. The rate at which audio data is made available and consumed by mobile device can vary as the overall load on the devices changes resulting in inconsistent frequency of data delivery and consumption.","The present invention solves this problem by implementing specialized jitter buffers located in the send and receive handlers  to balance smart data thinning against latency and implement performance dependant variable packet size to adjust package size to available resources.","In a process known as Smart Data Thinning, when data accumulates in a buffer , above a threshold, the entire buffer , is thinned, dropping intermittent small portions of the audio data. The remaining audio data remains comprehensible when presented to the user. Multiple thresholds are defined and thinning becomes more aggressive as needed. Aggressively thinned audio may become incomprehensible but when presented to the user, it lets them know there is still a connection.","In addition, the present invention employs a technique known as Performance Dependant Variable Packet Size. Under optimal conditions, small package size and correlating small optimization buffers would result in the best overall quality. However, processing many smaller packets increases the load on the mobile device and can negatively affect the frequency of which audio data from the hardware is delivered to the transport system. Processing many smaller packets is also more demanding of the network components. To avoid these problems, data is analyzed from performance metrics (delivery frequency and buffer acclamation) and data package sizes are adjusted accordingly\u2014i.e., lower performance result in large package sizes.","Data sent to and from the handset , is then sent through encryption data pump , which in turn interfaces with the TrustChip  as discussed above. The TrustChip encrypts and decrypts the voice data packets, which are then sent (or received from) the network through network interface .","A device persistent secure data store  may be provided to store secure data, such as data keys and the like, in a secure manner. Relay server credentials are one important component stored in the persistent store. These credentials are protected by operating system access controls. Message listener\/handler  may handle messages used to initiate a call. As illustrated in block , a call may be initiated when a first caller on device  logs into a relay server  (discussed below) and sends an SMS message to a second caller on device . The second caller receives the SMS message, is prompted to answer the call, and if they choose to answer, the application then logs into the relay server . After both parties have authenticated with the relay server, the encryption negotiation begins. Once encryption negotiation is complete, the call is connected and encrypted voice data is sent and received as media packets as previously discussed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIGS. 1 and 8","FIG. 2"],"b":["190","180","180","190","180","190","100","1","190","2","190","3","100"]},"In step , the encrypted audio data is then sent over the network through one or more channels. The Blackberry device may communicate through the Internet via WiFi, BlueTooth, or via cellular modem, broadband, or the like, in a manner transparent to the user. The audio data, however, is transmitted as Internet data, not as a traditional telephone call. The receiving device  then receives this encrypted audio data and decrypts it in step , using the same type of KoolSpan chip . In step , a media player in the receiving device  decodes the AMR audio into analog voice signals, which are then played through the earpiece (or speakerphone speaker) of the receiving device . The listener hears the voice as they would through an ordinary cellular phone call, but in fact is not making a cell phone call, but hearing an audio file playback through their device as they would an MP3 music file or the like.","The method illustrated in  shows the process from a transmitting device  (where a user is talking) to a receiving device  (where a user is listening). The process, of course, is bi-directional. In order to enable bi-directional communication, each device , may be running two media players (e.g., AMR Audio Codecs) simultaneously. The present invention takes advantage of the Blackberry's capability to run two such audio codecs simultaneously in order to process voice calls as audio data. Other devices could be similarly adapted, provided they are capable of (or were made capable of) running multiple audio codecs simultaneously. Thus, while the present invention is illustrated as being used with a Blackberry 9000 in the preferred embodiment, other devices may be used within the spirit and scope of the present invention, provided they are capable of running dual codecs, or a single bi-directional codec.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 3"],"b":["400","190","180","400","400","190","440"]},"The receiving party will then see a message \u201cIncoming Secure Call\u201d on their device . If the receiving party accepts the call, both parties will see a series of phrases indicating the status of the connection (\u201cOutgoing\/Answering\u201d, \u201cAuthenticating\u201d, \u201cConnected\u201d) on their devices , . As illustrated in block , a signal is first sent from handset  requesting that a secure call be initiated. This message may be sent by SMS, a Blackberry PIN message, or other mechanism. The mobile handsets , then establish a connection through the relay server . The mobile handsets then negotiate encryption and automatically establish a FIPS 140-2 AES-256 encrypted session, using the KoolSpan encryption devices  or equivalent. The One Voice Vault software then establishes a two-way, full-duplex audio connection as discussed previously.","Referring back to , when using relay server , secure voice relay  may determine whether devices , are authorized to make secure calls, by requiring two-way authentication (handset to relay server and relay server to handset) from each device. Authentication information may be stored in a relay user database . Relay user database  may be updated through user management agent  which may interface to KOOLSPAN TrustCenter  as will be discussed below in more detail.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIGS. 1 and 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["190","400","300","300","180","190","190","400","190","190","180","400","180","400","300"]},"In the preferred embodiment, device  logs into the relay server, obtains a unique session ID.

Examples of TrustGroups will be described in more detail below. Transaction service  may be used to send SMS messages to an individual phone , notifying the user of available updates and the like. The TrustChip connector on the users phone , may then contact the TrustChip gateway  and download TrustChip updates as necessary. Updates may then be applied to a TrustChip  and the TrustChip gateway  notified. In this manner, TrustChip software may be upgraded and updated.","In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, using KoolSpan TrustChip encryption technology, Trust Groups may be employed as part of the authentication process. One Vault Voice verifies that both the calling and receiving devices are members of the same KoolSpan \u201cTrustGroup.\u201d A TrustGroup is a security association that implies trust amongst its members. All TrustGroups to which a mobile device user belongs are on the TrustChip inserted into the user's handset. By default, all TrustChips include a \u201cUniversal\u201d TrustGroup allowing for secure peer-to-peer communication amongst One Vault Voice users. Universal TrustGroup exists on all activated TrustChips. It is one example of a TrustGroup, but it may not specifically allow for secure peer to peer. In peer-to-peer One Vault Voice-enabled device communities, TrustGroups do not require any administration. However, an organization may have elected to centrally manage TrustGroup security associations and TrustChip processors using the KoolSpan TrustCenter\u2122 security management framework. TrustChip and TrustGroups and TrustCenter are provided as part of the KoolSpan TrustChip encryption technology and do not form part of this invention except as employed as an Off-The-Shelf (OTS) encryption technique.

By default, all TrustChips include a \u201cUniversal\u201d TrustGroup allowing for secure peer-to-peer communication amongst One Vault Voice users, even those outside your organization. This Universal TrustGroup may be disabled, depending on your organization's security policy. In the peer-to-peer implementation, all the necessary authentication keys are pre-loaded onto the KoolSpan TrustChip.","When the TrustChip is inserted into a mobile device and the One Vault Voice software is installed, the device can connect securely to other TrustChip-enabled devices. From that point on, mobile devices authenticate sessions and set up secure end-to-end tunnels automatically. In peer-to-peer One Vault Voice-enabled device communities, TrustGroups do not require any administration. However, an organization may have elected to centrally manage TrustGroup security associations and TrustChip processors by implementing the KoolSpan TrustCenter security management solution.","With TrustCenter, administrators are given the ability to dynamically create TrustGroups and permit\/deny security associations for the enterprise users and their mobile devices. The TrustChip Connector is the component that allows for the remote management of TrustChips. The TrustCenter used herein may comprise the KoolSpan TrustCenter used to manage TrustChips, TrustGroups, users and their associated devices.","The TrustChip Connector is an application that allows for the remote management of TrustChips via the KoolSpan TrustCenter security management software. The TrustCenter Connector is installed on the mobile device and acts as a secure conduit between the TrustCenter administrative services and the remote TrustChips. It is important to note that if TrustChips are not managed by a TrustCenter, then the TrustChip Connector may not appear on the mobile device.","As illustrated in  discussed above, One Vault\u2122 Voice provides a secure mobile voice solution that ensures end-to-end voice traffic confidentiality and integrity. The One Vault Voice software is installed on every mobile device that will be initiating or receiving secure calls. Each device also contains a KoolSpan\u00ae TrustChip\u00ae security processor. TrustChips are the physical cryptographic devices housed within a microSD memory card that provide the means to authenticate and secure communication between two entities. When a One Vault Voice-enabled phone calls another such phone, the devices transparently authenticate and connect. All voice communication is then encrypted and sent over a secure data channel. The entire process is seamless to the mobile device users. One Vault Voice currently functions on the RIM BlackBerry platform.","The system of the present invention may be installed on a Blackberry type cellphone\/PDA (e.g., Blackberry 9000). Prior to installing the One Vault Voice system, the user should verify they have a KoolSpan TrustChip security processor v1.1 or higher (this is a special microSD memory card). Accompanying the TrustChip, the user is provided with a One Vault Voice for BlackBerry installation file. However, in some instances the installation file may be sent to the user electronically. If so, the user need only verify that they have received the latest release, prior to installation. The application may also be installed to the device directly through the device browser. The One Vault Voice for BlackBerry software may also be installed to a phone over the Internet.","The user then confirms that they have a supported phone\/device (including firmware requirements). The phone being used should have a SIM card with an active unlimited Blackberry data plan (allowing full email, web browsing, and other data access). In addition, the phone should be capable of SMS\/text messages (it is recommended that an unlimited SMS plan is also acquired)\u2014this is generally a \u2018contract\u2019 and not \u2018pre-paid\u2019 (SIM) account.","While disclosed herein as applied to the Blackberry\u2122 type of smartphone, the present invention may be applied to other types smartphone platforms including but not limited to iPhone or iPad iOS, Android, Windows 7 Mobile, or the like, as well as other types of communications devices.

However, the disclosure of the best mode should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention in any way.","Similarly, in the preferred embodiment and best mode contemplated at the time of filing, a removable Trustchip is provided to provide encryption keys. However, the use of the Trustchip is by way of example only, and other types or removable devices may also be used, including but not limited to, a CAC card, Military ID card smart chip, DoD encryption certificates, or the like. Alternately, the keys and encryption technology may be embedded in software of the device itself, or provided in firmware, hardware, or the like.","An alternative embodiment of the present invention, known as One Vault Messenger, delivers SMS Encryption for safe and secure text messaging via BlackBerry and other types of smartphones. Short Message Service (SMS) communication is an effective method to quickly relay critical or sensitive information in a brief, succinct text message. This invaluable form of communication can positively impact the daily operations of all market segments (commercial, military and public safety). The challenge is that while SMS security is adequate for most open communications, it does not provide secure transmission for Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) level messages. SMS security is limited to the cellular networks that it travels across: Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) or Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA). Both offer limited security protection to adequately prevent information from being exposed. As the mobile workforce expands at an unprecedented rate, so too does their reliance on smartphones to stay connected and productive. To ensure the safety of their SMS communications, enterprises must make mobile security requirements a top priority.","In an alternative embodiment of the One Vault mobile security solutions, a system for protecting text messaging, One Vault Messenger (OVM) is provided, in a preferred embodiment, for BlackBerry smartphones. OVM encrypts and decrypts SMS text messages across GSM and CDMA networks. OVM combines an easy-to-use BlackBerry application with a tamper-resistant microSD encryption card that can be remotely managed.
