Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a passivation composition and a method of forming a conductive pattern by using the passivation composition. Specifically, the present invention relates to a passivation composition comprising an oxidizing agent and an inorganic base and a method of forming a conductive pattern by using the passivation composition.","2. Descriptions of the Related Art","Recently, with vigorous development of flat displays such as liquid crystal displays, plasma display panels, and touch screens, the development of the transparent electrode material for these devices has gained increasing attention. Generally, the material of transparent electrodes could be roughly divided into two categories, i.e., conductive metal oxides and conductive polymers. The examples of conductive metal oxides include indium tin oxide (ITO), aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO), gallium-doped zinc oxide (GZO), etc. Even these metal oxides have superior conductivities, but their applications are still limited due to their poor flexibility (i.e., poor elasticity and crisp character), high price (especially ITO) and high production costs. Especially, they are not suitable for flexible displays. The examples of conductive polymer include polythiophene, polyaniline, polyacetylene, polypyrrole, etc. The conductive polymer has gained increasing prominence due to their low-price and superior flexibilities.","Conventional methods for forming an electrode pattern of a display device using a conductive polymer may be roughly divided into etching and passivating methods. The etching method comprises the steps of forming a conductive polymer layer on a (transparent) substrate, covering a predetermined circuit area (i.e. a conductive area) with a mask, and then removing the conductive polymer at the non-circuit area (i.e. a non-conductive area) by using an etching agent to provide a patterned circuit. However, the product prepared by an etching method usually encounters problems such as height drop and dark lines resulting from different optical contrast because the conductive polymer only remains on a part of the substrate (only on the conductive area but not on the non-conductive area). In view of this, passivating methods are developed.","A conventional passivating method comprises passivating the conductive polymer material of non-circuit area to significantly reduce the conductivity of the non-circuit area to provide a desired patterned circuit by using an oxidizing agent. Although the conventional passivating method could solve the problems of height drop and optical contrast difference, it still has some deficiencies, such as insufficient passivating effect and poor durability of the product.","For example, TW 552591 discloses a method of manufacturing conductive pattern, which prints a solution with an oxidizing agent (as a passivating agent) onto the conductive polymer layer on the substrate to passivate the printed conductive polymer material to form a non-conductive area. However, the above described process has the following defects. First, the oxidizing agent is provided with flowability. The circuit area is not protected or isolated. The oxidizing agent may also etch the conductive material of the circuit area and as a result, distort the conductive pattern. The conductive pattern may be further etched during the subsequent washing and removal process of the oxidizing agent. Second, the viscosity of the oxidizing agent is usually increased to reduce its flowability to lower the influence of the oxidizing agent to the conductive pattern. However, this will inevitably slow down the spread of the oxidizing agent. There is, therefore, a contradiction between the passivating time and the passivating effect. In addition, in the conventional passivating method, the oxidizing agent only passivates the superficial part of a conductive polymer layer, the passivated part tends to be worn out to thereby expose the un-passivated part of the conductive polymer layer after a long-term use, and this will cause a short circuit. JP 2011-054617A discloses another one method of forming a conductive pattern, comprising providing a pattern film containing a passivating agent, and then forming conductive pattern by contacting the pattern film with a conductive polymer layer to passivate the contacted conductive polymer material. However, the method still can only passivate the superficial part of the conductive polymer layer. The problem of durability still exists, and moreover, the passivating effect is not sufficient because the level of the difference of the conductivities between the passivated area and the un-passivated area are merely about 10to 10times high.","The present invention provides a passivation composition for forming a conductive pattern and a method of using the passivation composition to form a conductive pattern. The passivating speed of the passivation composition of the present invention is fast. The passivating time therefore could be shortened, while the passivating effect provided by the passivation composition of the present invention is excellent because the variation of the conductivities before and after the passivating process reaches at least about 10times high. The passivation composition of the present invention could especially passivate the deep material of a conductive polymer layer and thereby, could improve the durability problem encountered due to the wear of the passivated material.","An objective of the present invention is to provide a passivation composition, comprising an oxidizing agent, an inorganic base with a general formula M(OH), and a solvent, wherein M is a metal ion and n is the valence number of the metal ion.","Another objective of the present invention is to provide a method of forming a conductive pattern on a substrate, comprising the following steps: (a) forming a polymer conductive layer on a substrate, wherein the polymer conductive layer is consisting of a first area and a second area, while the first area is corresponding to a conductive area to be formed; and (b) passivating the second area by using the passivation composition of the present invention to reduce the conductivity of the second area and form the conductive pattern on the substrate.","To render the above objectives, technical features and advantages of the present invention more apparent, the present invention will be described in detail with reference to some embodiments hereinafter.","Hereinafter, some embodiments in accordance with the present invention will be described in detail. However, without departing from the spirit of the present invention, the present invention may be embodied in various embodiments and should not be limited to the embodiments described in the specification. Furthermore, unless it is additionally explained, the expressions \u201ca\u201d, \u201cthe\u201d, or the like recited in the specification of the present invention (especially in the claims) should comprise both the singular and the plural forms. The expression \u201cabout\u201d implies acceptable errors of specific values determined by persons with ordinary skill in the art. Acceptable errors depend on the method of measurement.","The passivation composition of the present invention is obtained through the combination use of an oxidizing agent with passivating ability and an inorganic base. Without being restricted by theories, it is believed that the inorganic base added in the passivation composition of the present invention could act as an etching agent to etch a part of conductive polymer material of the conductive polymer layer on the substrate to form several etch pits on the surface of the conductive polymer layer. As a result, the surface area of the conductive polymer layer that comes into contact with the passivation agent is increased and therefore, the passivating speed is increased, the required passivating time is reduced, and the deep conductive polymer material could be passivated. Therefore, the present invention can resolve the problem of short circuiting due to a superficial passivation and thus, improve the durability of a device. Furthermore, the variation of the conductivity of the conductive polymer material before and after being passivated by the passivation composition of the present invention could reach at least about 10times high.","Particularly, the passivation composition of the present invention comprises an oxidizing agent, an inorganic base having a general formula M(OH), and a solvent, wherein M is a metal ion and n is the valence number of the metal ion.","The oxidizing agent of the passivation composition of the present invention is not particularly limited and could be any conventional oxidizing agents. For example, the oxidizing agent may be selected from the group consisting of SO, ClO, MnO, BrO, CrO, HO, and combinations thereof. The oxidizing agent is preferably SO, ClO or a combination thereof. The oxidizing agent may be provided as a compound, e.g., an acid or a salt. For example, SO may be provided by sodium persulfate (NaSO) and ClO may be provided by hypochlorous acid (HClO). The amount of the oxidizing agent is not particularly limited. However, to ensure a sufficient passivating effect, the amount of the oxidizing agent generally ranges from about 0.4 wt % to about 40 wt % and preferably about 5 wt % to about 20 wt %, based on the weight of the passivation composition. If the amount of the oxidizing agent is less than 0.4 wt %, a desired passivating effect may be insufficient. If the amount of the oxidizing agent is more than 40 wt %, there may be precipitation residue derived from the oxidizing agent which is hard to be removed. It should be noted that in the case where the oxidizing agent is provided as a compound, e.g., an acid or a salt, the ratio of the oxidizing agent in the passivation composition of the present invention is based on the oxidizing group of the compound. For example, if sodium persulfate (NaSO) is used, the amount of the oxidizing agent is evaluated according to the amount of \u201cSO\u201d. In some embodiments of the present invention, sodium persulfate and hypochlorous acid (HClO) are used to provide the desired oxidizing agent.","In the passivation composition of the present invention, the inorganic base provides not only an etching effect but also a basic environment suitable for the oxidizing agent, such that the passivation composition of the present invention could conduct a fast and excellent passivation. Consequently, the required processing time for the passivation is quite short (about tenths of seconds to about several minutes, such as about 30 seconds to about 240 seconds). The inorganic base will therefore just etch a portion of the surface of the conductive polymer layer to form dents (such as nicks and etch pits) on the surface, rather than etching the whole surface of the conductive polymer layer to thereby generate a variance in thickness. Therefore, there is no macroscopic height drop that exists in the passivated polymer layer to generate a dark line problem due to different optical contrast. The optical properties of the passivated polymer material, such as transparency and haze, will not be affected. The inorganic base itself is non-volatile and therefore is stable under a long-term operation and will not volatilize to adversely pollute the environment.","The inorganic base that is useful in the passivation composition of the present invention has a general formula M(OH), wherein M is a metal ion and n is the valence number of the metal ion. The examples of the inorganic base may be one or more of the metal oxides of group IA or IIA, including but not limited to those selected from the group consisting of KOH, NaOH, Ca(OH), RbOH, Sr(OH), CsOH, Ba(OH), and combinations thereof. There is preference given to KOH, NaOH or a combination thereof. Generally, the amount of the inorganic base ranges from about 0.2 wt % to about 20 wt %, and preferably from about 3 wt % to about 15 wt %, based on the total weight of the passivation composition. If the amount of the inorganic base is less than about 0.2 wt %, the desired etching effect may not be achieved. If the amount of the inorganic base is more than about 20 wt %, the inorganic base may excessively etch the material of the conductive polymer layer and thereby cause a height drop or a deterioration of optical properties (such as transparency). In some embodiments of the passivation composition of the present invention, NaOH is used as the inorganic base and the amount thereof is about 0.4 wt % to about 4 wt % based on the total weight of the passivation composition.","The solvent of the passivation composition of the present invention is not particularly limited and can be any inert solvent that could dissolve but not react with the inorganic base and the oxidizing agent. The examples of the solvent include but not limited to that selected from the group consisting of deionized water, methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, and the combinations thereof, where the preference is given to deionized water. In some embodiment of the present invention, deionized water is adopted.","The present invention further provides a method of forming a conductive pattern, comprising the following steps: (a) forming a polymer conductive layer on a substrate, wherein the polymer conductive layer is consisting of a first area and a second area and the first area is corresponding to a conductive pattern to be formed; and (b) passivating the second area by using the passivation composition of the present invention to reduce the conductivity of the second area and form the conductive pattern on the substrate.","The step of forming a polymer conductive layer on the substrate (step (a)) may be conducted by any method known for persons with ordinary skill in the art and is not particularly limited. Examples of the method include but are not limited to spin coating, dip coating, die coating, spray coating, blade coating, roll coating, screen printing, and inkjet printing, etc. The types of the substrate that are useful in the present invention are not particularly limited and may be selected by users depending on needs. For example, the material of the substrate may be but not limited to glass, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyethylene naphthalate (PEN), polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), polycarbonate (PC), or a combination thereof. The material of the polymer conductive layer could be any conventional conductive polymers. The examples of the conventional conductive polymers may be but are not limited to polythiophene-based material, polyaniline-based material, polypyrrole-based material, or a mixture thereof, where the preference is given to polythiophene-based material. The examples of the polythiophene-based material are selected from the group consisting of poly(3-hexylthiophene), poly(3,4-ethlenedioxytiophene) (PEDOT), poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(vinylsulfonic acid) (PEDOT:PVS), and combinations thereof, but are not limited thereto. In some embodiments of the present invention, PET substrate and PEDOT:PSS conductive polymer material are adopted.","The passivation process of step (b) may be performed by a method selected from the group consisting of a soaking method, a gravure printing method, a relief printing method, an ink-jet-printing method, a pen printing method, and a screen printing method, but is not limited thereto.","The fast passivating ability of the passivation composition of the present invention especially contributes to that the passivation process of step (b) could be accomplished by a simple soaking method without the needs of complicated printing steps. The detailed operating steps of a soaking method and the preparation of the anti-passivation film used in the soaking method are irrelevant to the technical features of the present invention and can be selected by persons with ordinary skill in the art depending on their needs after reviewing the disclosure of the specification. For example, the passivating process of step (b) may be carried out by but is not limited to following steps: (b-1) applying an anti-passivation film on the first area to cover the first area, protecting the first area corresponding to the predetermined conductive area from passivation; (b-2) soaking the conductive substrate into the passivation composition of the present invention to perform the passivation process to reduce the conductivity of the second area; and (b-3) washing the passivated conductive substrate with inert solvent such as deionized water and methanol, and then removing the anti-passivation film from the conductive substrate to obtain the conductive substrate with the desired conductive pattern. The anti-passivation film is consisted of a material that will not be passivated by the passivation composition; it may be an alkali-resistant oxidizing agent-resistant peelable adhesive or dry film, or any other known materials that could provide the function of anti-passivating.","The passivation composition of the present invention could provide a significant passivating effect in an extremely short time, and therefore, the duration of the passivating process of step (b) only requires tens of seconds to several minutes long. An over long duration of the passivating process may lead to the excessive etching of the substrate to thereby cause problems such as height difference and side etching and thus, is not suitable. In some embodiments of the present invention, the passivation process of the step (b) is performed by means of a soaking method. The duration of the passivating process is about 30 seconds to about 240 seconds.","The present invention will be further illustrated by the embodiments hereinafter; however, those illustrated embodiments are only for illustration and the scope of the present invention should not be limited thereto.","The measuring methods of the variation of transparency, resistance, and haze are shown in Table 1.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"133pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},"TABLE 1"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Measuring methods and instruments"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"133pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Resistance (\u03a9\/square)","Four-pin type LORESTA-GP MCP-T600,"]},{"entry":[{},"MITSUBISHI CHEMICAL"]},{"entry":["Transparency (%)","Measuring method: JIS K7361"]},{"entry":[{},"NDH5000W, Nippon Denshoku"]},{"entry":["Haze (%)","Measuring method: JIS K7361"]},{"entry":[{},"NDH5000W, Nippon Denshoku"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"[Preparation of Conductive Substrate]","A PET substrate was coated with a dispersion solution of PEDOT:PSS by roll coating and then dried at a temperature of 120 to form a polymer conductive layer on the PET substrate to provide a conductive substrate.","[Soaking Test]","The prepared substrates were respectively soaked with deionized water, 10 wt % of NaSO(oxidizing agent) solution, 9.8 wt % of HSO(acid) solution, and 4 wt % of NaOH (base) solution for 30 seconds to 240 seconds (30 seconds per interval).

shown in Table 3-1, , and , after the passivating process, the transparency of the conductive substrate almost remains the same. As shown in Table 3-3,  and , as the soaking time increases, the transparency of the conductive substrate only slightly changes. These results manifest that the passivation composition of the present invention would not deteriorate the optical properties of the conductive substrate and is therefore suitable for electronic products with strict requirements on optical properties. Moreover, as shown in Table 3-2 and , in the low NaOH content situation (pH value=13), a high oxidizing agent concentration is required for obtaining the desired passivating effect (passivation composition 1-4). In comparison, in the high NaOH content situation (pH value=14), a fast passivating effect could be provided (passivation compositions 1-5, 1-6, 1-7, and 1-8) and the resistance variation of the conductive substrate before and after the passivation reaches at least about 10times, and especially, in the case of passivation composition 1-6, only 60 seconds are required to achieve the significant passivating effect (see ).","The preparation methods of passivation composition 1-6 were repeated to prepare passivation composition 2, except that the oxidizing agent NaSOwas replaced by NaClO. A conductive substrate was soaked with the passivation composition 2 for 30 seconds to 240 seconds (30 seconds per interval). The variations of the transparency, resistance, and haze of the conductive substrate were measured, and the results are shown in .","As shown in , even changing the type of the oxidizing agent to NaClO, the passivation composition of the present invention still could provide an excellent passivating effect without adversely affecting the optical properties of the conductive substrate.","Comparative passivation composition 1 was prepared by replacing the etching agent NaOH with sulfuric acid, wherein the amount of NaSOwas 9.62 wt %, the amount of deionized water was 85.61 wt %, and the amount of sulfuric acid was 4.76 wt %. A conductive substrate was soaked with the comparative passivation composition 1 for 30 seconds to 240 seconds (every 30 seconds as an interval). The variations of the transparency, resistance, and haze of the conductive substrate were measured, and the results are shown in .","As shown in , the comparative passivation composition 1 could not provide the desire passivating effect, and the variation of haze is much more significant, which shows that the influence on the optical properties of the conductive substrate was relatively apparent. This result shows that an acidic condition could not provide a suitable passivation condition for an oxidizing agent.","The preparation method of Comparative example 1 was repeated to prepare comparative passivating composition 2, except NaSOwas replaced by a reducing agent HCO. A conductive substrate was soaked with the comparative passivation composition 2 for 30 seconds to 240 seconds (30 seconds per interval). The variation of the transparency, resistance, and haze of the conductive substrate were measured, and the results are shown in .","As shown in , haze is changed but almost no variation in resistance is observed. It shows that the reducing agent could not provide any passivating effect.","The examples described above are only for exemplarily explaining the principle and effects of the present invention, and illustrating the technical features of the present invention, but not for limiting the scope of the present invention.
