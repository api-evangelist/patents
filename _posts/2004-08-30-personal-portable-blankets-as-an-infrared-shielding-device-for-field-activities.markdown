abstract: A system shields IR emissions from remote sensors and has a flexible outer metallic layer extending to cover objects emitting IR energy on the covered ground. The outer layer is conductive of heat energy and faces upward. A flexible inner metallic layer coextensively extends adjacent to the outer metallic layer. The inner layer is conductive of heat energy and faces downward. Spaced-apart thermo electric chips are between and in contact with the outer and inner layers. The chips transfer heat energy between the outer and inner layers. A sensor of IR radiation on ambient ground provides signals representative of the thermal signature of the ambient ground. A controller couples signals to the chips in response to the representative ambient ground thermal signals for controlling the heat energy radiated from the outer layer to match the radiated IR signature from the outer layer to the IR signature of the ambient ground.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","This invention relates to systems for reducing detectability of personnel and equipment. More particularly, this invention relates to a blanket-like IR shielding system providing concealment of personnel and equipment in the field from infrared (IR) sensors.","Concealment of personnel and equipment from hostile observation often is essential during special warfare and reconnaissance activities and\/or before making an effective coordinated strike. The task of concealment can be even more difficult with IR imaging equipment being more available in the field. IR imaging equipment can indirectly measure the thermal profile of objects by the emission of the infrared signature in their field of view. Every material has a set of properties consisting of absorbtivity, reflectivity, and emissivity of IR radiation. An object's display in an IR imaging device is dependent on the actual temperature of the object multiplied by the fourth power of the absolute temperature of the object.","Because of the nature of ground combat, combatants, along with their equipment, are readily observable by IR imaging equipment during night and day. This is due to the temperature discrepancies between the human body and its environment and the large thermal masses of metallic materials (guns, tanks, etc.) which change temperature very slowly relative to their environment.","Thus, in accordance with this inventive concept, a need has been recognized in the state of the art for an inexpensive, transportable system that can be used to shield downed pilots and\/or troops and equipment in the field to prevent identification by IR sensors and to retain the elements of concealment and surprise.","An object of the invention is to provide a man-portable infrared shielding system for personnel and equipment.","Another object of the invention is to provide a man-portable infrared shielding system for combatants, special warfare teams and reconnaissance members requiring long periods of hidden activity.","Another object of the invention is to provide a man-portable infrared shielding system for personnel and equipment large enough to mask one or more individuals or provide an overhead shield for a group of entrenched individuals and their equipment.","Another object of the invention is to provide a man-portable infrared shielding system having a layered blanket having thermal cooling, insulation, and conductivity for personnel and equipment.","Another object of the invention is to provide a man-portable infrared shielding system having a layered blanket having a small exhaust fan attached to the inner layer to remove internal heat.","Another object of the invention is to provide a man-portable infrared shielding system having a layered blanket including an IR measuring device coupled to a battery operated programmable controller to determine the thermal signature of the ground by combining its emissivity and temperature.","Another object of the invention is to provide a man-portable infrared shielding system having a layered blanket using a series of essentially solid-state refrigeration devices known as thermo electric chips (TECs) for temperature regulation.","Another object of the invention is to provide a man-portable infrared shielding system having a layered blanket provided with thermal-grounding stakes driven into the ground and TECs pumping heat energy into the surrounding ground.","These and other objects of the invention will become more readily apparent from the ensuing specification when taken in conjunction with the appended claims.","Accordingly, the present invention is a system that shields IR emissions from remote sensors and has a flexible outer metallic layer extending to cover objects emitting IR energy on the covered ground. The outer layer is conductive of heat energy and faces upward. A flexible inner metallic layer coextensively extends adjacent to the outer metallic layer, and the inner layer is conductive of heat energy and faces downward. An insulating layer holds the outer and inner metalized layers in a virtually uniform spaced-apart relationship with respect to each other and a matrix pattern of transversely extending equal-distantly separated cavities extend through the insulation layer. Spaced-apart thermo electric chips are between and in contact with the outer and inner layers, and each of the cavities has a separate one of the thermo electric chips contained therein. The chips transfer heat energy between the outer and inner layers. A sensor of IR radiation on ambient ground provides signals representative of the thermal signature of the ambient ground. A controller couples signals to the chips in response to the representative ambient ground thermal signals for controlling the heat energy radiated from the outer layer to match the radiated IR signature from the outer layer to the IR signature of the ambient ground.","Referring to , a system  for shielding infrared (IR) emissions from objects from remote IR detection\/imaging devices  is shown covering and providing IR shielding for IR emitting objects like a combatant  and equipment  on the ground . Shielding of IR emissions from such objects is essential for successful operations particularly in the field. IR detection devices  currently are capable of detecting personnel and equipment in the field both during the day and especially at night and develop images based on the IR emissivity and thermal gradients given off by these objects. These detection devices  are becoming cheaper to produce and are more powerful. Consequently, greater use of these IR technology devices is foreseen by potential adversaries to identify targets and conduct effective attacks, especially at night.","IR shielding system  of the invention counters the effectiveness of IR imaging equipment  that operates by sensing\/using IR signatures. An IR signature consists of wavelengths of light that are not visible to the human eye but are produced by the IR emissivity of an object, multiplied by its absolute temperature to the fourth power. Objects, such as humans having a near constant body temperature that is usually different from their surrounding environment, and large objects such as tanks, transports, and other equipment which change temperature slowly compared to their environment, are readily visible in the IR spectrum. This is because of the contrast they have with respect to their background environments. This contrast holds true even while the objects are nearly invisible in the visible light spectrum by camouflage or a lack of light during dawn\/dusk and nighttime.","IR shielding system  of the invention as described herein can be made compact enough to be portable by an individual combatant in the field and is readily deployed to provide concealment from IR detection. Shielding system  could weigh less than ten pounds and would be able to shield one or two individuals.","Infrared shielding system  can be fabricated as a multi-layered flexible blanket-like structure  that can be sized to be portable by an individual and carried into the field in a back pack . When an IR detection threat is perceived, multi-layered flexible blanket-like structure  of infrared shielding system  is taken from back pack , unfolded, and spread out to cover combatant  and supporting equipment  until the threat is no longer of concern. Infrared shielding system  can be refolded and returned to back pack  for reuse again later during the same mission or returned to a supply depot for reissue.","Referring also to , multi-layered flexible blanket-like structure  of infrared shielding system  has an outer flexible and highly conductive, thin metallic cover  transmissive of heat energy and facing upward toward the surrounding sky when deployed. Metallic cover  can be metal foil that is thick enough to transmit the required heat between chips. Metallic cover  can have an exposed printed, painted or otherwise textured coating  having a camouflaged pattern. Coating  might also be used in conjunction with a loose overlay  including selected strands, fabric and pieces that along with coating  attempts to conform to the anticipated ambient ground cover. Loose overlay  provides more complete optical deception with camouflaged pattern coating  as the outer and most visible layer of IR shielding system . Overlay  can clip-onto blanket  or other hidden area and can be changed as needed to maintain optical camouflage under changing conditions or to match different ambient conditions and environments.","An insulation layer  adjacent and attached to inside of outer metallic cover  has a matrix pattern of transversely extending cavities  extending through it. Cavities  can be equal-distantly separated from each another. Insulation layer  can be a flexible, thin, thermally-insulating plastic foam-like material bonded to outer metallic cover  and to an inner metallic layer  that coextends with outer metallic cover . Inner metallic layer  can be metal foil or a metalized sheet of lightweight, flexible, and tough plastic-like material transmissive of heat energy that faces downward toward ground  when deployed. Insulating layer  holds outer and inner metalized layers ,  in a virtually uniform spaced-apart insulated relationship with respect to each other to prevent or isolate thermal contact between them. Inner metallic layer  is thicker than outer metallic layer , about 0.040 inches thickness for inner layer  as compared to about 0.020 inches for outer layer  for example, to account for an increased heat energy transfer by inner layer . The surface area of inner layer  can be increased to aid in the rejection of heat by such methods as corrugating it or otherwise folding it to increase its surface area.","Referring also to , each cavity  of the matrix pattern in insulation layer  contains a thermo electric chip (TEC) . Thermo electric chips of the type used for TECs  are essentially solid-state refrigeration devices or Peltier elements well known in the art that rely on utilization of the Peltier Effect to create a cooling or heat transfer effect. The concentric square-shaped lines on an upper surface of each TEC  schematically represent control temperature gradients when each TEC  is changing temperature. These gradients will blend when a steady-state temperature for each TEC  is reached. This heating or cooling effect is created when a current (shown as arrow  in ) of the proper magnitude and polarity is coupled to TECs  via leads  from a computer based controller . A battery pack  provides not only this current  for TECs , but additionally provides power to operate controller  and an emissivity (IR) sensor  connected to controller . The object of this feature of the design of infrared shielding system  is to make battery pack  run on only several D-cells for about twelve hours of autonomous protection for a combatant  and equipment . Battery pack  can have a multipurpose plug A that may include a converter for interconnection to an electrical power source that might be available at a deployment site to take advantage of this source of power.","Controller , battery pack  and sensor  can be made as an integrated compact unit in accordance with known integrated circuit fabrication procedures. A small enough package can be made for mounting adjacent to inner metallic layer  and not interfering with rolled\/folded storage of system  or its later use as IR shielding.","Current  coupled to TECs  can create a cool junction at an outer plate section  of each TEC  and a hot junction at an inner plate section  at the opposite end of each TEC . The cool junction of outer plate section  of each TEC  is cooler with respect to each hot junction of each inner plate section  of each TEC . A further advantage of using TECs  is that they can optionally heat or cool metallic layers ,  simply by reversing their current flow so that outer layer  (and inner layer ) can either be heated or cooled as needed to accommodate different tactical scenarios. In other words, the direction of the transfer of heat between inner and outer plate sections ,  in each TEC  can be reversed or be bidirectionally changed by reversing the polarity of a predetermined amount of current  from controller . The inner layer is larger to dissipate or conduct heat from the outside in, corresponding to cooling the outer layer  to environmental conditions and heating the user. A typical thermo electric chip that could be used for each of the TECs  of multi-layered flexible blanket-like structure  of infrared shielding system  is the model UT4-12-30-f2 of the UltraTEC\u2122 series commercially available by Melcor Inc., 1040 Spruce St., Trenton, N.J., 08648. Other models could be used as well depending on operational parameters.","Multi-layered flexible blanket-like structure  of infrared shielding system  has cavities  of insulating layer  positioning a cool junction of an outer plate section  of each contained TEC  adjacent to and in contact with an associated heat conductive area  of outer metallic cover  to selectively, bidirectionally transfer heat to or from outer metallic cover . Each cavity  also positions a hot junction of an inner hot plate section  of each TEC  adjacent and in contact with an associated heat conductive area  of inner metallic layer  to selectively, bidirectionally transfer heat to or from each TEC  to inner metallic layer . The TECs  are attached to outer and inner layers ,  so that inner metallic layer  can conduct the heat from TECs  to a volume of air  under multi-layered flexible blanket-like structure . The size of conductive areas  and  and the TECs  selected are such as to minimize control time, energy and IR signature differences by TECs  across metallic outer layer  and inner metallic layer .","Multi-layered flexible blanket-like structure  of infrared shielding system  can have a small exhaust fan  attached via a flexible duct  to inner metallic layer . The IR shielded individual  under multi-layered flexible blanket-like structure  inside of air volume  can activate fan  to remove internal heat that may have built up. Duct  can be arranged to dissipate exhausted built-up heat from interior volume  under branches or other debris that may be piled around infrared shielding system  to reduce the possibility of creating an unwanted IR signature. The vented out heated air can be replaced by cool ambient air drawn in around the periphery  of blanket structure  into air volume , or the air flow of fan  can be reversed to draw in cool ambient air through duct , and the heated air inside of air volume  could be evenly dissipated from under the layered blanket structure  around its periphery .","Thermal grounding stakes  (only a few of which are shown) could be driven into ground  and placed in contact with inner plate sections  of at least some of TECs . Stakes, or heat pipes , could help dissipate some unwanted infrared-signature energy into ground  under blanket  and help absorb spikes of heat by system .","Computer-based controller  is connected via an optional internal power converter to battery pack  to give infrared shielding system  the capability for independent IR shielding in the field for prolonged periods of time. At least one ambient IR measuring sensing device  is laid on adjacent ambient ground  to determine the ambient ground thermal signature of ground  by combining data representative of the ground's IR emissivity and temperature. Representative signals (shown by arrow ) of the ambient ground thermal signature are fed via lead  to controller  that is preprogrammed to determine the appropriate temperature for metallic outside layer  of blanket structure  that will match the IR signature of the surrounding ground . Reduced cost might result in placing an IR imaging item, such as an imager A, away from but pointed at blanket  to help control the signature, see . Wire leads or small RF communication devices for RF signal transmission B can be used to hide this extra part of IR imager A along with optical camouflage.","Control of TECs  of system  is done by appropriately preprogramming controller  and its interconnected battery pack . Controller  appropriately adjusts the magnitude (and polarity) of current  (voltages) connected to TECs  to create appropriate levels of cooling or heating power by TECs  that are coupled to outer metallic layer . These levels of cooling or heating power appropriately adjust the IR signature of infrared shielding system  to match that of surrounding or ambient ground . Temperature sensors  such as thermisters, only two of which are schematically shown in , can be placed at predetermined locations between layers  and  in blanket  between TEC chips  to provide feedback over leads, not shown, to controller . With associated sensors such as thermisters  and IR sensor A for example, system  can react to have fully operable TECs  around inoperable TECs  compensate for failure of the inoperable chips. Since outside metallic layer  has a low thermal mass, its temperature can be rapidly adjusted to match temperature changes due to weather and time change and accordingly match as nearly as possible the IR signature of surrounding ground . Even if the IR signature of the surroundings is not matched perfectly, a possible target's IR profile can be at least broken up to make detection more difficult. Very little energy is required to achieve these changes, and several D-cells in battery pack  can do the job for hours.","Having the teachings of this invention in mind, modifications and alternate embodiments of infrared shielding system  may be adapted without departing from the scope of the invention. Its uncomplicated, compact design that incorporates structures long proven to operate successfully lends itself to numerous modifications to permit its reliable use under the hostile and demanding conditions routinely encountered during combat in the field. Infrared shielding system  can be fabricated in different physical arrangements from a wide variety of materials that have sufficient strengths and conductivities to provide long term reliable IR shielding under a multitude of different operational conditions. Infrared shielding system  of the invention can be modified within the scope of this inventive concept to provide an overhead shield for a group of individuals that are entrenched for example, and could be formed as larger infrared shields for critical field structures, such as ammunition and refueling dumps, and armored or support vehicles. In addition, controller  could be preprogrammed to cause blanket  to radiate signatures having the form of features naturally found in nature, such as rocks, stumps, fallen trees, etc. to further make detection difficult.","The disclosed components and their arrangements as disclosed herein, all contribute to the novel features of this invention. Infrared shielding system  provides a reliable and capable means of assuring IR concealment from hostile IR sensors to safeguard personnel and equipment from possible adverse consequences that could follow from otherwise being discovered. Therefore, infrared shielding system , as disclosed herein is not to be construed as limiting, but rather, is intended to be demonstrative of this inventive concept.","It should be readily understood that many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible within the purview of the claimed invention. It is to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"],"b":["4","4"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
