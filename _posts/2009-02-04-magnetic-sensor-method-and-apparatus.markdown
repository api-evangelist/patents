{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured, used, and licensed by or for the United States Government.","The present invention relates generally to magnetic transducers, and more particularly, to magnetic sensors used with a flux concentrator that modulates the magnetic flux going to the magnetic sensor.","This invention relates to magnetic field sensors, and the detection and location of the approximate position of ferromagnetic objects, such as, for example, in the path of a vehicle or of drilling equipment before the vehicle or drill reaches the object, or for measuring cardiac signals.","Interest is increasing in the development of magnetic sensors for sensing low-frequency magnetic fields in terrestrial, extraterrestrial, industrial, biomedical, oceanographic, and environmental applications. The trend in magnetic sensor design and development is constantly toward lower size, lower power consumption, and lower cost for similar or improved performance.","There are several types of magnetometers (magnetic sensors with external instrumentation) currently used. The least expensive and least sensitive devices have resolution of about 1CT1 Oersted (Oe)\/Hz\u00bd and typically are Hall effect devices. These devices work by sensing a voltage change across a conductor or semiconductor placed in a magnetic field. Such devices are insensitive and do not lend themselves to applications requiring greater sensitivity, such as that required in brain scan devices and magnetic anomaly detection devices. Magnetoresistive-type magnetic sensors are suited for low-cost, medium-sensitivity applications and have a detectivity of about 0.1-1 nT\/Hzat 1 Hz. Using spin-dependent tunneling magnetoresistive sensors, one can observe more than 100% changes in the resistivity in fields of a few Oe.----.","More sensitive magnetometers exist, but they are typically limited to applications that can tolerate relatively high power size, weight and cost. The most common of these devices are flux gate magnetometers that have a resolution of approximately 0.05-0.1 nT Oe\/Hzat 1 Hz and SQUID (superconducting quantum interference device) magnetometers that have a resolution of about 3-50 fT Oe\/Hzat 1 Hz. Flux gate magnetometers use a magnetic core surrounded by an electromagnetic coil, and are difficult to micro fabricate and have less sensitivity when made very small because the magnetic flux change is smaller. Additionally, flux gate magnetometers require relatively large amount of power and accordingly do no lend themselves to low-cost, compact, portable design. Though SQUID magnetometers are sensitive magnetometers, the apparatus must include a means for cooling to cryogenic temperatures. This makes SQUID magnetometers extremely bulky and expensive to operate. Their size limits their utility because the active superconducting element cannot be placed directly adjacent to the source of the magnetic field, for example the brain. Accordingly, there is need for inexpensive, low power magnetometers that have sufficient sensitivity to be useful for a variety of magnetometer applications at relevant frequencies.","Magnetic sensors used to detect objects that move slowly typically exhibit considerable low-frequency 1\/f-type noise (where f is frequency of operation of the magnetic sensor), an unwanted condition. In general, there is a tendency for such devices that have higher sensitivity to also exhibit higher 1\/f-type noise. This generally occurs when using magnetoresistive-type magnetic sensors, see van de veer-donk et al. J. Appl. Phys 82, 6152 (1997).","A well-known way of increasing the sensed magnetic field by a magnetic sensor is by use of a flux concentrator, which can enhance a sensed magnetic field by as much as a factor of 50, see N. Smith et al., IEEE Trans. Magn. 33, p. 3358 (1997). An example of such a device is taught in U.S. Pat. No. 5,942,895, entitled \u201cMagnetic field sensor and current and\/or energy sensor,\u201d that uses Hall sensors with flux concentrator components. The magnetization of flux concentrators increases in the direction of the field to be measured. This in turn increases the magnetic field flux at the position of the sensor and, thus, increases the output signal from the magnetic sensor.","The magnetization of the flux concentrator can change by domain wall motion or domain rotation. The latter is the preferred mode because it generates less 1\/f noise. There are many different ways and materials that can be used for the magnetic material. The overall objective is the largest possible increase in the magnetic field at the position of the sensor.","A magnetic sensor (magnetometer) that addresses 1\/f-type noise is taught in U.S. Pat. No. 4,864,237. This disclosure teaches of an apparatus for measuring magnetic fields, which change only at extremely low frequency. This apparatus uses a SQUID magnetometer that includes a superconducting flux transformer that inductively couples a detected signal into a d-c SQUID sensor. This magnetometer can optionally include a device for modulating the detected signal in a frequency range characteristic of low-noise operation of the SQUID. The modulation frequencies are generally above 1 Hz and optionally even above 1-kHz. Limitations of this device include need for cryogenic operation, which inherently do not lend themselves to relatively low cost, low power use.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,501,268, hereby incorporated by reference, by Edelstein entitled \u201cMagnetic Sensor With Modulating Flux Concentrator for 1\/f Noise Reduction,\u201d discloses a magnetic sensing device that senses low frequency magnetic fields by using movable flux concentrators that modulate the observed low frequency signal. The concentrator oscillates at a modulation frequency much greater than the observed magnetic field being sensed by the device. The modulation shifts this observed signal to higher frequencies and thus minimizes the effect of the 1\/f-type noise, due to the oscillatory motion of a microelectromechanical (MEMS)-type magnetic flux concentrator operated with a magnetic sensor. Modulating of the incoming signal shifts the operating frequency of the sensor. Depending upon the sensor, shifting the operating frequency may reduce the 1\/f noise by one to three orders of magnitude at one Hz. At least one modulating flux concentrator is used with the magnetic sensor. Because of its size, this device is especially useful for applications where the space available for the sensor is extremely limited.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,670,809, hereby incorporated by reference, to Edelstein entitled \u201cMagnetic Sensor With Modulating Flux Concentrator Having Minimized Air Resistance for 1\/f Noise Reduction,\u201d discloses a magnetic sensing transducer device that senses low frequency magnetic fields by using flux concentrators that modulate the observed low frequency signal, thereby shifting this observed signal to higher frequencies and minimizing 1\/f-type noise. This is accomplished by the oscillatory motion of a microelectromechanical (MEMS)-type magnetic flux concentrator operated with a magnetic sensor. At least one MEMS-type fabricated flux concentrator is used with the magnetic sensor. The concentrator oscillates at a modulation frequency much greater than the observed magnetic field being sensed by the device. The device includes a vacuum container for containing the base structure, the magnetic sensor the flux concentrators and the pair of complementary electrodes in a vacuum environment. The device uses flux concentrators that modulate an observed a low frequency magnetic field, thereby shifting this observed field to higher frequencies where the noise of the sensor is smaller to minimize 1\/f-type noise. This is accomplished by using a flux concentrator on a microelectromechanical system(MEMS) structure. When the MEMS structure is energized, the oscillatory motion of the flux concentrators modulates the enhancement of the field at the position of the magnetic sensor. The dimensions of the flux concentrators typically encompass gross dimensions of 100 by 75 microns.","U.S. Pat. No. 7,195,945, hereby incorporated by reference, to Edelstein, et al., entitled \u201cMinimizing the Effect of 1\/f Noise with a MEMS Flux Concentrator,\u201d discloses a method of method of fabricating a MEMS device that includes forming a magnetic sensor over a SOI wafer which may include an epoxy layer; forming a pair of MEMS flux concentrators sandwiching the magnetic sensor; connecting an electrostatic comb drive to each of the flux concentrators; connecting a spring to the flux concentrators and the comb drive; performing a plurality of DRIE processes on the SOI wafer; and releasing the flux concentrators, the comb drive, and the spring from the SOI wafer. Another embodiment includes forming adhesive bumps and a magnetic sensor on a first wafer; forming a second wafer; forming a pair of MEMS flux concentrators, a pair of electrostatic comb drives, and at least one spring on the second wafer; bonding the second wafer to the adhesive bumps; and compressing the adhesive bumps using non-thermal means such as pressure only.","In the publication Guedes et al. \u201cLow Cost, Low Power, High Sensitivity Magnetometer,\u201d J. Appl. Phys. 103. 07E924 (2008), there is disclosed a technique for removing environmental noise while using a MEMS flux concentrator. The environmental noise is removed by taking the difference between the reading of the sensor and a reference sensor that is separated from the sensor by a distance of 20 feet to one km. According to the publication, magnetic anomaly signals smaller than 1 pT have been detected by this technique upon removing the effect of environmental noise. In the Guedes et al. publication, two flux concentrators were used.","Although attempts have been made minimize the effect of 1\/f noise, to completely optimize the magnetic sensors, one must also decrease the magnetic white noise. The white noise is proportional to the inverse of the volume of the ferromagnetic free layer of the sensor. Thus, one would like to use free layers with a large volume. It is difficult to use the MEMS approach to modulate the field in a large volume. Accordingly, there is a need for a magnetic sensor for applications which exceed the capacity of a MEMS structure and which will decrease the magnetic white noise.","A preferred embodiment of the present invention is useful for modulating a magnetic field in a large environment or volume. In this preferred embodiment, an array of sensors are positioned underneath a rotating disk. The disk contains at least one flux concentrator. The disk may be supported by a rotating shaft which is connected to a motor assembly, which causes it to rotate at a high number of revolutions per second, such as, for example, 3000 rpm. The sensors, located underneath the rotating disk, are stationary (preferably vector-type) sensors. Each sensor detects a field perpendicular to its longest axis. Each operates to detect a component of the magnetic field; with the exception of one or two sensors which will detect nothing when the magnetic field is parallel to the longitudinal axis of the sensor(s). The output of each sensor is split into x and y components. This division is based upon the orientation of each sensor relative to the x and y axis. Then the individual measured x and y components of all the sensors are then added to determine the x and y components of the magnetic field. As the disk rotates, each time a flux concentrator passes over a sensor the flux concentrator largely shields that sensor because the magnetic field is effectively diverted from the sensor into the flux concentrator. Each time the sensors are between the gaps as shown in , the sensors experience an enhanced magnetic field due to the effect of the flux concentrators. When the flux concentrators are positioned substantially over the sensors, the soft ferromagnetic material of the flux concentrators shields the sensors from the magnetic field. As the disk with the flux concentrators rotates, the flux concentrators in effect modulate the field at the position of the sensors. Note because of the geometry all the sensor are shielded at the same time and all of them sense the enhanced field at the same time.","These and other aspects of the embodiments of the invention will be better appreciated and understood when considered in conjunction with the following description and the accompanying drawings. It should be understood, however, that the following descriptions, while indicating preferred embodiments of the invention and numerous specific details thereof, are given by way of illustration and not of limitation. Many changes and modifications may be made within the scope of the embodiments of the invention without departing from the spirit thereof, and the embodiments of the invention include all such modifications.","A more complete appreciation of the invention will be readily obtained by reference to the following Description of the Preferred Embodiments and the accompanying drawings in which like numerals in different figures represent the same structures or elements. The representations in each of the figures are diagrammatic and no attempt is made to indicate actual scales or precise ratios. Proportional relationships are shown as approximates.","The embodiments of the invention and the various features and advantageous details thereof are explained more fully with reference to the non-limiting embodiments that are illustrated in the accompanying drawings and detailed in the following description. It should be noted that the features illustrated in the drawings are not necessarily drawn to scale. Descriptions of well-known components and processing techniques are omitted so as to not unnecessarily obscure the embodiments of the invention. The examples used herein are intended merely to facilitate an understanding of ways in which the embodiments of the invention may be practiced and to further enable those of skilled in the art to practice the embodiments of the invention. Accordingly, the examples should not be construed as limiting the scope of the embodiments of the invention.","The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to limit the full scope of the invention. As used herein, the singular forms \u201ca\u201d, \u201can\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will be further understood that the terms \u201ccomprises\u201d and\/or \u201ccomprising,\u201d when used in this specification, specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements, and\/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, and\/or groups thereof.","It will be understood that when an element such as an object, layer, region or substrate is referred to as being \u201con\u201d or extending \u201conto\u201d another element, it can be directly on or extend directly onto the other element or intervening elements may also be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being \u201cdirectly on\u201d or extending \u201cdirectly onto\u201d another element, there are no intervening elements present. It will also be understood that when an element is referred to as being \u201cconnected\u201d or \u201ccoupled\u201d to another element, it can be directly connected or coupled to the other element or intervening elements may be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being \u201cdirectly connected\u201d or \u201cdirectly coupled\u201d to another element, there are no intervening elements present.","It will be understood that, although the terms first, second, etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, components, regions, layers and\/or sections, these elements, components, regions, layers and\/or sections should not be limited by these terms. For example, when referring first and second photons in a photon pair, these terms are only used to distinguish one element, component, region, layer or section from another region, layer or section. Thus, a first element, component, region, layer or section discussed below could be termed a second element, component, region, layer or section without departing from the teachings of the present invention.","Furthermore, relative terms, such as \u201clower\u201d or \u201cbottom\u201d and \u201cupper\u201d or \u201ctop,\u201d may be used herein to describe one element's relationship to other elements as illustrated in the Figures. It will be understood that relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in addition to the orientation depicted in the Figures. For example, if the device in the Figures is turned over, elements described as being on the \u201clower\u201d side of other elements would then be oriented on \u201cupper\u201d sides of the other elements. The exemplary term \u201clower\u201d, can therefore, encompass both an orientation of \u201clower\u201d and \u201cupper,\u201d depending of the particular orientation of the figure. Similarly, if the device in one of the figures is turned over, elements described as \u201cbelow\u201d or \u201cbeneath\u201d other elements would then be oriented \u201cabove\u201d the other elements. The exemplary terms \u201cbelow\u201d or \u201cbeneath\u201d can, therefore, encompass both an orientation of above and below. Furthermore, the term \u201couter\u201d may be used to refer to a surface and\/or layer that is farthest away from a substrate.","Embodiments of the present invention are described herein with reference to cross-section illustrations that are schematic illustrations of idealized embodiments of the present invention. As such, variations from the shapes of the illustrations as a result, for example, of manufacturing techniques and\/or tolerances, are to be expected. Thus, embodiments of the present invention should not be construed as limited to the particular shapes of regions illustrated herein but are to include deviations in shapes that result, for example, from manufacturing. For example, a region or object illustrated as a rectangular will, typically, have tapered, rounded or curved features. Thus, the regions illustrated in the figures are schematic in nature and their shapes are not intended to illustrate the precise shape of a region of a device and are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention.","Unless otherwise defined, all terms (including technical and scientific terms) used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. It will be further understood that terms, such as those defined in commonly used dictionaries, should be interpreted as having a meaning that is consistent with their meaning in the context of the relevant art and will not be interpreted in an idealized or overly formal sense unless expressly so defined herein.","It will also be appreciated by those of skill in the art that references to a structure or feature that is disposed \u201cadjacent\u201d another feature may have portions that overlap or underlie the adjacent feature.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["10","1","4","3","5","1","1","6","6","1"]},"As seen in , an array of sensors A to O are positioned underneath the rotating disk , in spaced apart fashion on a stationary disk . The sensors are interconnected by circuitry (not shown) such that their outputs are processed by a processor .

The magnetic sensors  may comprise one of a Hall effect type sensor, a magnetoresistive sensor, a MEMS sensor, a magneto-diode, a magneto-transistor, a MAGFET, a fluxgate, a miniature fluxgate magnetometer, a SQUID and\/or a magneto-optical sensor.","By way of background, according to Wikipedia, a magnetometer is device used to measure the intensity and direction of a magnetic field. Magnetometers may be classified as either scalar or vector instruments. A scalar magnetometer measures the strength of the total magnetic field, whereas a vector magnetometer measures one or more vector components of the magnetic field. Sensors  are of the vector type. Three modern devices in regular use are the nuclear magnetometer, fluxgate magnetometer, and SQUID magnetometer.","Moreover, although this preferred embodiment utilizes a rotating disk  and stationary disk , disk  could rotated while disk one remains stationary without departing from the principles of the present invention. As exemplified in the embodiment shown in , the disk  is rotated by motor assembly  at a high number of revolutions per second, such as, for example, 3000 rpm. The stationary sensors A through O, located underneath the rotating disk, each detect a field perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the respective sensor. Each sensor A-O operates to detect a component of the magnetic field. As seen in , flux concentrators A through O are positioned along the circumference of disk  at equally spaced intervals. It can be readily appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that the number of sensors A through O and flux concentrators may be varied without departing from the scope of the present invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1","FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 3","FIG. 4"],"b":["10","6","6","7","7","2","6","7","1","7","1","6","1","6","7","7","6","7","6","6","7","7","8","6"]},"Accordingly, the magnetic field detected at the processor  is modulated from a minimum magnetic field as the rotating member rotates from a first position shown in  when each of the sensors A-O is in alignment with each of the flux concentrators A-O on the rotating member  to a maximum magnetic field at a second position, as shown in  when each of the sensors A-O is not in alignment with each of the flux concentrators A-O on the rotating member .","Accordingly, the number of flux concentrators and the speed of rotation (RPMs) determine the frequency of the modulation. As shown in , the output of the sensors  to the processor  is sinusoidal-like.","The device  will determine two vector components of the magnetic field. The two vector components of the magnetic field are determined from\n\n=\u03a3 SSin (\u03b8)\n\n=\u03a3 SCos (\u03b8)\n\nWhere \u03b8is the angle between the long dimension of the sensor and the x-axis and the sum is over all the sensor signals Sfrom the sensors A-O.\n","Alternatively, one can make the system into a two vector component gradiometer by replacing the quantities Sin Eq. 1 with the differences of the signals from pairs of sensors that are opposite from one another on the disk, i.e., if one sensor has \u03b8=\u03b8, then the other sensor has \u03b8=\u03b8+\u03c0.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIGS. 7 through 9","b":["19","100","17","11","17","17","17"]},"In this embodiment, a vector sensor  is fixedly positioned central to a rotating disk  and is operatively connected to a processor , the circuitry of which is not shown. The magnetic sensor  may comprise one of a Hall effect type sensor, a magnetoresistive sensor, a MEMS sensor, a magneto-diode, a magneto-transistor, a MAGFET, a fluxgate, a miniature fluxgate magnetometer, a SQUID and\/or a magneto-optical sensor. Disk  may be supported by a frame member  onto a rotating shaft  which is operatively connected to a rotational power source such as a motor or the like. Although the disk  is supported below the disk , one of ordinary skill in the art could readily appreciate that the support structure and shaft  could be positioned above or along the side of the disk without departing from the scope of the invention. Similarly, the disk  could be replaced by a rotating object of another configuration. As shown in , flux concentrators  are equally spaced in spoke-like fashion on disk . The longitudinal axis of the each flux concentrator is positioned in a radial direction vis a vis the disk . The flux concentrators  may comprise a film formed of soft ferromagnetic material, for example. A suitable film which is cost effective is formed of permalloy an alloy of eighty atomic percent nickel and twenty atomic percent iron. As an exemplary fabrication technique, the flux concentrators may be formed by depositing a permalloy on the disk . Device  further comprises fixed flux concentrators , positioned adjacent to the rotating disk  so as to transfer the magnetic field, as represented by an arrow in , to the flux concentrator A to H positioned on the disk . As shown in , flux concentrators  may be cylindrical with a solid or hollow interior. Flux concentrators may include converging tips T, as shown in . One of ordinary skill in the art could readily appreciate that the flux concentrators  and  could be a variety of configurations without departing from the scope of the present invention and that the configurations shown are merely exemplary. Flux concentrators  either effectively guide or focus the field at the position of the sensor when they are in the position shown in  or do it less efficiently as when they are at the position shown in . Thus, this device  also will modulate the field when the disk rotates thereby can be used to minimize the effect of 1\/f noise. Using Nowak's estimate the of the magnetic 1\/f noise as a function of the volume of magnetic element, assuming B=100 Oe (which is the case for materials such as Metglas) the volume required to reach 10Tesla\/Hzwould be reduced to approximately 10cm., which is still significantly larger than desired. By using flux concentrators, a gain approaching 100 may be attained, which may in turn reduce the volume to 1 cm.In general, moving flux concentrators are beneficial to magnetic sensors by (1) increasing the field at the position of the sensor and (2) by modulating the field to mitigate the effect of 1\/f noise. The enhancement of the field has been demonstrated by several groups ((Bondarenko, S. I., Rev. Sci. Inst. 2006, 77, 094701, P.M. Drljaca, 2002, 97-98 10). It is theoretically possible to get enhancements of the field by more than a factor of 100 with flux concentrators.","As shown in , the vector-type magnetic sensor output is modulated as the rotating member  rotates from a first position shown in , when the at least one fixed flux concentrator is nearest and in alignment with the at least one flux concentrator on the rotating member to a second position shown in  where the at least one fixed flux concentrator is not in alignment with the at least one flux concentrator on the rotating member; the magnetic flux detected by the at least one vector-type magnetic sensor being at a maximum in the first position () and at a minimum in the second position ().","The advantages of this invention include: (1) One can use larger sensors that have less white noise;. (2) it is convenient to have more than one sensor which again increases the S\/N ratio; and (3) the modulation of the field at the positions of the sensors is synchronized. An alternative embodiment of the invention is to have the flux concentrators stationary and the sensors rotating.","It can be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the problem that the invention is designed to solve is the difficulty of modulating the field detected by large sensors. The reason one wants to be able to modulate the field at the position of large sensors is twofold. First, modulating the field shifts the operating frequency of the sensor to where 1\/f noise is less significant. Second, using large sensors decreases white noise. Without using the capacity of a larger sensor, it is difficult to make nonoptically pumped sensors with a detectivity better that 1 pT\/root Hz at 1 Hz.","Using the principles of the present invention result in improved performance of magnetic sensors. Magnetic sensors have many DOD and civilian applications including vehicle, arms and electrical equipment detection, mineral exploration, and rotational position determination. They also can be used to measure the magnetic signals from the heart.","It should be emphasized that the above-described embodiments are merely possible examples of implementations.
