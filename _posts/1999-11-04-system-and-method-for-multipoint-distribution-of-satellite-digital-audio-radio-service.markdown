Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to communications systems. More specifically, the present invention relates to satellite digital audio service (SDARS) receiver architectures.","While the present invention is described herein with reference to illustrative embodiments for particular applications, it should be understood that the invention is not limited thereto. Those having ordinary skill in the art and access to the teachings provided herein will recognize additional modifications, applications, and embodiments within the scope thereof and additional fields in which the present invention would be of significant utility.","2. Description of the Related Art","Satellite radio operators will soon provides digital quality radio broadcast services covering the entire continental Unites States. These services intend to offer approximately 100 channels, on which nearly 50 channels will provide music with the remaining stations offering news, sports, talk and data channels. According to C. E. Unterberg, Towbin, satellite radio has the capability to revolutionize the radio industry, in the same manner that cable and satellite television revolutionized the television industry.","Satellite radio has the ability to improve terrestrial radio's potential by offering a better audio quality, greater coverage and fewer commercials. Accordingly, in October of 1997, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) granted two national satellite radio broadcast licenses. The FCC allocated 25 megahertz (MHz) of the electro-magnetic spectrum for satellite digital broadcasting, 12.5 MHz of which are owned by CD Radio and 12.5 MHz of which are owned by the assignee of the present application \u201cXM Satellite Radio Inc.\u201d The FCC further mandated the development of interoperable receivers for satellite radio reception, i.e. receivers capable of processing signals from either CD Radio or XM Radio broadcasts. The system plan for each licensee presently includes transmission of substantially the same program content from two or more geosynchronous or geostationary satellites to both mobile and fixed receivers on the ground. In urban canyons and other high population density areas with limited line-of-sight (LOS) satellite coverage, terrestrial repeaters will broadcast the same program content in order to improve coverage reliability. Some mobile receivers will be capable of simultaneously receiving signals from two satellites and one terrestrial repeater for combined spatial, frequency and time diversity, which provides significant mitigation against multipath and blockage of the satellite signals.","In accordance with XM Radio's unique scheme, the 12.5 MHz band will be split into 6 slots. Four slots will be used for satellite transmission. The remaining two slots will be used for terrestrial re-enforcement. Each of two geostationary Hughes 702 satellites will transmit identical or at least similar program content. The signals transmitted with QPSK modulation from each satellite (hereinafter satellite and satellite) will be time interleaved to lower the short-term time correlation and to maximize the robustness of the signal. For reliable reception, the LOS signals transmitted from satellite are received, reformatted to Multi-Carrier Modulation (MCM) and rebroadcast by non-line-of-sight (NLOS) terrestrial repeaters. The assigned 12.5 MHz bandwidth (hereinafter the \u201cXM\u201d band) is partitioned into two equal ensembles or program groups A and B. The use of two ensembles allows 4096 Mbits\/s of total user data to be distributed across the available bandwidth. Each ensemble with be transmitted by each satellite on a separate radio frequency (RF) carrier. Each RF carrier supports up to 50 channels of music or data in Time Division Multiplex (TDM) format. With terrestrial repeaters transmitting an A and a B signal, six total are provided, each slot being centered at a different RF carrier frequency. The use of two ensembles also allows for the implementation of a novel frequency plan which affords improved isolation between the satellite signals and the terrestrial signal when the receiver is located near the terrestrial repeater.","Although satellite digital audio radio service was originally conceived for reception via a plurality of independently mobile receivers, the need has been recognized in the art for a system and method for distributing satellite digital audio radio service to a plurality of receivers that are not independently mobile relative to each other. One such application, by way of example, might involve the distribution of the SDARS content throughout a passenger airliner. Another application might involve the distribution of SDARS content throughout an office or apartment building.","The need in the art is addressed by the satellite digital audio radio service multipoint distribution system and method of the present invention. Generally, the inventive system comprises a first arrangement for receiving the satellite digital audio radio signal and distributing a converted signal in response thereto. The distributed signal is received by plural receivers each of which provide a respective output signal in response thereto.","In the illustrative embodiment, the first arrangement includes a satellite antenna and a radio frequency (RF) satellite receiver. In the best mode, the RF satellite receiver is a terrestrial repeater. The repeater decodes a stream of data received from the satellite and recodes the stream using a satellite radio terrestrial broadcast. In the best mode, the signal is an intermediate frequency signal in the XM radio, multi-carrier modulation (MCM) format.","The recorded signal is rebroadcast by the repeater via a distribution network and received by a plurality of intermediate frequency (IF) receivers. The distribution system may be wireless, cable, or fiber optic. In the illustrative embodiment, the IF receivers are modified conventional satellite digital audio radio service receivers. A user interface is provided for each IF receiver to allow for channel selection and audio processing.","As an alternative to the repeater, satellite radio signals may be stored in a medium such as a digital video disc and rebroadcast therefrom as disclosed and claimed in copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/423,862, filed Nov. 4, 1999 by C. Wadin and P. Marko and entitled Composite Waveform Storage and Playback (Atty. Docket #39253) the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference.","Illustrative embodiments and exemplary applications will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings to disclose the advantageous teachings of the present invention.","Conventional implementation of a satellite digital audio service (SDARS) system architecture is depicted in . The system  includes first and second geostationary satellites  and  which transmit line-of-sight (LOS) signals to SDARS receivers located on the surface of the earth. The satellites provide frequency and spatial diversity. The system  further includes plural terrestrial repeaters  which receive and retransmit the satellite signals to facilitate reliable reception in geographic areas where LOS reception from the satellites is obscured by tall buildings, hills, tunnels and other obstructions. The signals transmitted by the satellites  and  and the repeaters  are received by SDARS receivers . As depicted in , the receivers  may be located in automobiles, handheld or stationary units for home or office use. The SDARS receivers  are conventionally designed to receive one or both of the satellite signals and the signals from the terrestrial repeaters and combine or select one of the signals as the receiver output as discussed more fully below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["10","22","24","26","28","12","14","30"]},"The satellites  and  act as bent pipes and retransmit the uplinked signal to terrestrial repeaters  and receivers . As illustrated in , the terrestrial repeater  includes a receiver demodulator , a de-interleaver and reformatter , a terrestrial waveform modulator  and a frequency translator and amplifier . The receiver and demodulator  down-converts the downlinked signal to a TDM bitstream. The de-interleaver and reformatter  re-orders the TDM bitstream for the terrestrial waveform. The digital baseband signal is then applied to a terrestrial waveform modulator  (e.g., MCM or multiple carrier modulator) and then frequency translated to a carrier frequency prior to transmission via a terrestrial antenna .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["10","32","12","32"]},"In the best mode, the RF signal received by the antenna  is provided to a terrestrial repeater  which decodes the received satellite data stream and recodes it using an XM radio terrestrial broadcast multi-carrier (MCM) format. MCM is a preferred modulation scheme. The provision of a guard interval with MCM mitigates ISI (inter-symbol interference). With MCM, relatively few carriers will be affected by fading. Accordingly, MCM secures transmission in mobile reception scenarios and is therefore ideally suited for the task of terrestrial re-broadcasting. Nonetheless, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the invention is not limited to the coding and decoding scheme disclosed herein. Other coding schemes may be used without departing from the scope of the present teachings.","The terrestrial repeater  is implemented as shown in . The output of the repeater  is an intermediate frequency (IF) signal in the defined XM radio terrestrial broadcast MCM format. This MCM reformatted signal is transported at the terrestrial IF frequency via a network  to multiple points within a desired service area. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the distribution network  may be wireless, cable, fiber-optic, etc.","At each reception point, a receiver \u2032 is provided. As discussed more fully below, each receiver \u2032 is a modified SDARS receiver which provides a separate user interface to allow for channel selection and audio processing. Consequently, each receiver may be tuned to a separate channel to provide audio and\/or visual output.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["20","20"]},"As illustrated in , and in accordance with the present teachings, the antenna modulate and RF tuner module are eliminated. Accordingly, each receiver \u2032 includes a channel decoder , a source decoder , a system controller , and IC bus , an audio output circuit (not shown), a keypad , and a display . An external memory  serves the channel decoder  and external non-volatile random access memory  serves the source decoder .","The channel decoder  is shown as having first and second demodulators for satellite A and satellite B,  and , respectively. However, in accordance with the present teachings, these elements would not be utilized in the receiver \u2032. The demodulator's  and  are shown to illustrate that a receiver \u2032 of otherwise conventional design may be utilized in the multipoint distribution system \u2032 of the present invention.","The IF signal received from the terrestrial repeater  is demodulated by a terrestrial demodulator . As discussed more fully below, the terrestrial demodulator  performs multi-carrier (MCM) demodulation and synchronization on the received signal before providing it to a time division demultiplexer \u2032 for transport layer decoding management.","As shown in , the time-division demultiplexed signal is depunctured and applied to a toward error correcting circuit . As is well known in the art, depuncturing involves a selective removal of bits associated with a Viterbi encoded word. The output of the depuncturing circuit  is input to a Viterbi decoder  in the forward error correcting circuit . Thereafter, the received signal is Viterbi decoded, deinterleaved (), and Reed-Solomon decoded (). Multi-carrier modulation, time-division demultiplexing, depuncturing, Viterbi decoding, de-interleaving and Reed-Solomon decoding are well known in the art.","The output of the Reed-Solomon decoder  is provided via a terrestrial\/satellite combiner  to the source decoder  for service layer decoding. In accordance with present teachings, the satellite A and B signals are not present, accordingly, the terrestrial\/satellite combiner  is not required and is provided merely to show that a satellite digital audio radio receiver of conventional design may be utilized to practice the teachings of the present invention.","The output of a combiner  is also provided to a TSCC memory . The memory  provides time-division demultiplexing configuration data to a channel decoder control unit . The channel decoder control unit  consists of a number of control and status registers and operates under control of the system controller .","Returning to , a user interface is provided via a keypad  and a display . The user inputs are utilized by the system controller  to provide control signals to the channel decoder control unit  and the source decoder control unit  via an IC bus : IC buses are well known in the art. IC transmitter and receiver hardware and software may be acquired from the Phillips Cord. for example.","By loading an appropriate control word in a control register in the control unit  of the channel decoder , the system controller effectively configures the channel decoder so that is processes only the terrestrial input received through the demodulator .","The source decoder  receives a BC (Broadcast Channel) bitstream and control signals from the channel decoder  and performs service layer decoding in an SL decoder  and decryption in a decrypting circuit  in the manner disclosed in the above-referenced patents filed by P. Marko et al., the teachings of which have been incorporated herein by reference. (As is known in the art, the \u2018Broadcast Channel\u2019 is a dedicated TDM stream consisting of a logical grouping of TDM multiplex prime rate channel packets. The Broadcast Channel carries all the information required to demultiplex the TDM stream.) Service layer decoding is facilitated through use of information carried in the Broadcast Information Channel by a control word is stored in a transport layer control register  by the system controller to determine which broadcast channels are demultiplexed. Decryption is facilitated by an encryption key provided by a broadcast authorization channel decoder . The decryption is required inasmuch as the satellite signals are transmitted in an encrypted form to limit authorized access.","The decrypted signals are provided to an audio source decoder  and a data port . The audio source decoder  is configured to provide an analog or digital output signal depending upon the application as will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art. The data port  is configured to provide digital output data such as may be appropriate for a visual display or any external data device, e.g., laptop.","Those skilled in the art will appreciate that one benefit of using the MCM level, in accordance with present teachings, is that the terrestrial carrier is not deeply interleaved. This lowers the memory requirements for the system.","Thus, the present invention has been described herein with reference to a particular embodiment for a particular application. Those having ordinary skill in the art and access to the present teachings will recognize additional modifications, applications and embodiments within the scope thereof. For example, as an alternative to the repeater, satellite radio signals may be stored in a medium such as a digital video disc and rebroadcast therefrom as disclosed and claimed in copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/463,862 filed Nov. 4, 1999 by C. Wadin and P. Marko and entitled Composite Waveform Storage and Playback (Atty Docket #39253) the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference.","It is therefore intended by the appended claims to cover any and all such applications, modifications and embodiments within the scope of the present invention.","Accordingly,"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
