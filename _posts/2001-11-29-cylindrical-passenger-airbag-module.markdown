{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED U.S. APPLICATION","BACKGROUND","BRIEF SUMMARY AND OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application is a continuation-in-part of application Ser. No. 09\/829,688 filed Apr. 11, 2001 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,702,318 and entitled VEHICLE OCCUPANT RESTRAINT MODULE WITH DISK INFLATOR, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.","1. The Field of the Invention","The present invention is related to a passenger airbag module. More particularly, the present invention is related to a novel passenger airbag module with a disc-shaped inflator and novel cylindrical housing, suitable for use on the passenger side of a vehicle.","2. Technical Background","Inflatable vehicle occupant safety restraint systems, or \u201cairbag restraints,\u201d are mandatory on most new vehicles. Airbag restraints commonly contain a collision sensor, an inflator, and an airbag cushion. The airbag cushion is typically housed in an uninflated and folded condition in the steering wheel on the driver's side of a vehicle and in the dashboard on the passenger side of a vehicle. For ease of manufacture, assembly, and installation, many airbag restraint systems come pre-packaged in module form.","In the event of an accident, the collision sensor measures abnormal deceleration and triggers the inflator by means of an electronic signal. Upon receipt of the signal from the collision sensor, the inflator rapidly produces a quantity of inflation fluid which inflates the cushion and protects the passenger from harmful impact with the interior of the car.","Airbag modules were first used on the driver's side of a vehicle to protect the driver from impact with the steering wheel or steering wheel column area. When driver's side airbag modules were applied to the passenger's side of the vehicle however, these known air bag modules suffered many disadvantages.","The existence of a steering wheel and column on the driver's side of a vehicle minimized the space that an inflated airbag needed to fill in order to protect the driver. The space between a passenger and the front panel of a vehicle interior on the passenger side, however, is significantly larger, and a larger airbag is needed. To overcome the problem of inflating larger airbags, larger inflators were used to produce the greater amounts of inflation fluid needed to fill an airbag that would occupy the larger space. The problem with these inflators, however, is that on the passenger side of the vehicle the dashboard or instrument panel provides less space to insert the airbag module and less structure to which the inflator can be attached. Airbag modules with larger elongated inflators do not fit efficiently into the instrument panel on the passenger side of the vehicle.","Another problem with the elongated nature of known inflators is that these inflators extend well beyond the point of attachment of the inflator to the instrument panel. This additional weight on the back side of the instrument panel causes additional torque or pivot forces on the instrument panel which is usually made of plastic. The instrument panel can twist or become detached from the inflator which can negatively effect the trajectory of airbag deployment or create cracks or deformations in the instrument panel.","Most known airbag modules made for front deployment are somewhat bulky and heavy. This may not pose a problem when installing these airbag modules in the steering wheel column because the existing structure of the steering wheel column could support the heavier and bulkier inflators. This support structure, however, is not found on the passenger side of the vehicle. Accordingly, most known airbag modules require additional, and often complex bracketing to support the module within the instrument panel on the passenger side of the vehicle. This additional bracketing results in increased cost in materials and assembly. Further, the additional bracketry takes up space.","Other known passenger side airbag modules include housing members that are susceptible to deformation during inflation. This problem is exacerbated on the passenger side of the vehicle because of the increased combustion forces needed to fill the larger space. This can also negatively affect the trajectory of the airbag's inflation which may cause it to deploy out of position or inefficiently. Yet another problem with known passenger side housings is that they are square or rectangular with the corresponding airbag cushion having corners at transition points that are more susceptible to stress and consequent damage.","Another problem with many known inflators is that the source of inflation fluid is pressurized gas, which requires the inflator to serve as a pressure vessel. This in turn requires these known inflators to use the thicker material needed to safely contain the pressurized inflation fluid. Thicker material increases costs and weight which decreases installation efficiencies.","Accordingly, a need exists for an airbag module with a simplified, smaller, and lighter weight design that can also fully inflate an airbag cushion on the passenger side of the vehicle. A further need exists for an airbag module with a smaller or shallower profile that can efficiently fit into the instrument or front panel of the passenger side of the vehicle. Further a need exists for such an airbag module that does not extend well beyond its point of attachment into the instrument or front panel of the vehicle. Still further, a need exists for such an airbag module that does not need to serve as a pressure vessel, yet that can produce enough inflation fluid volume to sufficiently inflate an airbag on the passenger side of the vehicle. Additionally, a need exists for an airbag restraint module that has a lightweight, sufficiently strong housing to resist deformation upon inflation. Such a novel airbag module is disclosed and claimed herein.","The present invention is directed to a novel airbag restraint module suitable for use on the passenger side of the vehicle which overcomes the above-described problems and disadvantages. The airbag restraint module includes an inflatable cushion defining a circular mouth for receiving inflation fluid. The inflatable cushion is positioned within a substantially cylindrical housing in a folded state. The cylindrical configuration of the housing provides hoop strength sufficient to withstand deformation forces inflicted upon the housing during inflation. The cylindrical configuration is efficient use of space and provides strength without the need for additional material.","An inflation fluid source or \u201cinflator\u201d may be attached to the housing and is in communication with the inflatable cushion. The inflator includes a cylindrical portion with a plurality of openings circumferentially spaced about an outer surface of the inflation fluid source through which inflation fluid passes. The inflator also includes an attachment flange which extends orthogonally outward from an outer surface of the inflation fluid source at a point near a proximal end of the inflation fluid source. In a preferred embodiment, the inflator is disk-shaped and is positioned substantially within the housing. Thus, the bulk of the inflator extends outward into the housing from its attachment point and not into the interior of the dashboard panel. In this embodiment the airbag module is more compact and more efficiently uses the limited space within the instrument panel. Further, there is not a significant amount of material behind the point of inflator attachment to the panel which could create unwanted torque or pivoting forces. Additionally, the smaller size requires minimal, if any additional bracketing.","The inflation fluid source includes a pyrotechnic generant that produces inflation fluid upon ignition. Accordingly, the inflator need not contain thicker material which makes the airbag module heavier to contain pressurize gas over a long period. The inflation fluid source in one embodiment produces at least about 80 liters of inflation fluid volume. In a preferred embodiment, the inflation fluid source produces at least about 120 liters of inflation fluid volume. Thus, the inflator of the present invention is lighter and simpler in design, yet can fill the larger airbag required on the passenger side of vehicle.","A retaining collar defining an opening is positioned about the inflation fluid source to retain the inflatable cushion in communication with the inflation fluid source. The retaining collar includes an annular flange flaring outwardly away from the opening for directing the inflation fluid from the inflation fluid source into the cushion.","Thus, it is an advantage of the airbag module of the present invention to provide a simplified smaller and lighter weight design that can fully include an airbag cushion on the passenger side of the vehicle. It is a further advantage to provide such an airbag module as a smaller and shallower profile that can efficiently fit into the instrument panel of the passenger side of the vehicle. It is yet another advantage to provide such an airbag module that does not extend deep within the instrument panel on the passenger side of the vehicle. Another advantage of the airbag module of the present invention is that it does not need to serve as a pressure vessel, and can produce enough inflation fluid to sufficiently inflate the airbag on the passenger side of the vehicle. A further advantage is that the cylindrical housing can efficiently package the cushion and inflation fluid source.","These and other advantages of the present invention will become more fully apparent by examination of the following description of the preferred embodiments and the accompanying drawings.","Reference is now made to the Figures wherein like parts are referred to by like numerals throughout. With particular reference to , an airbag module according to the present invention is generally designated at . The module  includes an inflatable cushion  having an inner surface  and an outer surface . The cushion  is capable of receiving inflation fluid  (see ) from a inflation fluid source , or inflator . The cushion may define a circular mouth , configured to fit about the inflator , to facilitate receiving the inflation fluid . A retaining collar  which defines an opening , is positioned adjacent the mouth  at the inner surface  of the cushion . The retaining collar  may be secured about the inflator  within a housing  to retain the inflatable cushion  in communication with the inflator  and within the housing in a folded state.","The inflator  includes an attachment flange  extending orthogonally outward from the outer surface  of the inflation fluid source. The attachment flange  may include a clamping surface  to facilitate capturing the cushion  between the retaining collar  and the attachment flange . The attachment flange  also includes orifices  configured to received a plurality of posts  attached to, or configured to engage, the retaining collar . The posts  of the retaining collar  may be integral with the retaining collar  or may be separate pieces attached to the retaining collar  by means known in the art, including welding, swaging, press fitting, bonding with suitable materials, and the like. The posts  may be positioned in any number of configurations to secure the curtain  to the inflation fluid source . In a presently preferred embodiment, four posts  are equally spaced adjacent a circular retaining collar opening  which corresponds to the configuration of the mouth . The posts  correspond to, and fit within, post openings  within the cushion  and the housing  to secure the component parts of the module  together. The retaining collar  is positioned adjacent the inner surface  of the cushion  at the mouth  and about the outer surface  of the inflation fluid source . It will be appreciated that the circularly shaped mouth  is configured to closely approximate the outer surface  of the cylindrical inflator . As will be discussed in greater detail below in reference to , the posts  and orifices  facilitate the clamping function of the retaining collar , which keeps the cushion , and other parts of the module  in their proper configuration with the mouth  of the cushion  about the inflator . Attachment means known in the art may be secured to the posts . In a preferred embodiment, the four posts  are threaded to receive corresponding nuts .","The airbag module  may also include a mounting base member  to which the cushion  is attached. In a presently preferred embodiment, the mounting base member  is part of the housing  for retaining the inflatable cushion  in a folded state. The housing  may define an opening  configured to substantially match the shape of the outer surface  of the inflator , which, as noted above, is preferably cylindrical. The housing  is clamped, along with the mouth  of the cushion , between the retaining collar  and the flange member  of the inflator . The housing  is also cylindrical. It will be appreciated by those of skill in the art that this cylindrical configuration gives the housing  hoop strength which protects against deformation of the housing  upon inflation. The cylindrical configuration is also devoid of creases and corners, and the symmetrical nature of cylinders facilitates the smooth and even inflation of the cushion . Accordingly, the housing  does not require thicker material or additional bracketing for added strength, which saves on costs and utilizes less space.","Referring now to , the module  of the present invention is shown in a pre- and post-inflated state. The inflation fluid source or inflator  includes a plurality of openings  circumferentially spaced about an outer surface  of the inflation fluid source  through which the inflation fluid  is directed out of the inflator . In one embodiment, the openings  are spaced about a cylindrical portion  of the inflator . The inflator  is preferably a pyrotechnic assembly in which a measured quantity of generant , or pyrotechnic material, is stored. In a presently preferred embodiment, the generant  comprises solid fuel pellets known in the art. It will be appreciated that through trial and testing, a known quantity of generant  will produce a known range of inflation fluid  (FIG. ). The inflator  includes means for activating the generant , which in a preferred embodiment are a pair of connector leads (not shown). An initiator (not shown) such as an accelerometer detects improper deceleration which sends an electric signal through the connector leads into the inflator . This signal triggers a reaction within the inflator  where the generant  is ignited and the inflation fluid  () is produced for inflating the cushion .","The orifices  in the attachment flange  align with the post openings  in the cushion  and housing  to receive the posts  and clamp the curtain  to a position axially below the openings  of the inflator . In this configuration, the openings  direct air into an interior  () of the cushion . The retaining collar  may include a annular flange  which flares outwardly away from the opening . The flared flange  provides for even radial and rapid inflation of the cushion . Thus, there is no need for complex channeling of the inflation fluid  into the cushion . An outer edge  of the flange  extends axially beyond a top portion  of the fluid source openings . Accordingly, inflation fluid  exiting laterally outward from the cylindrical outer surface  of the inflator  will be forced into contact with the flange  of the retaining collar  which will redirect the flow of inflation fluid  upward into the cushion . Thus, the flange  prevents hot inflation fluid  from directly blasting the interior  of the cushion  as it exits the inflation fluid source . The flange  also helps direct the inflation fluid  axially outward rather than laterally outward which increases the speed and performance of inflation.","The inflator  is preferably disc-shaped weighing between about one half kilogram and about three and one half kilograms. In a presently preferred embodiment, it weighs about one kilogram. The inflator  is capable of delivering at least 80 liters of inflation fluid, or put another way, of inflating at least an 80 liter cushion . In a preferred embodiment, the inflator  is capable of providing at least 120 liters of inflation fluid  into the cushion  in a very short amount of time. Those of skill in the art will appreciate that this amount of fluid  can fill larger size airbag cushions  which are necessary on the passenger side of the vehicle because there is more volume to fill, owing to the lack of a steering wheel column on the passenger side.","The inflation fluid source includes a proximal end and a distal end. The attachment flange  is positioned adjacent a proximate end of the inflation fluid source . Thus, a majority of inflation fluid source  is positioned substantially within the housing . As can be seen in the illustrations, a majority portion  of the disc which defines the inflation fluid source , (between the distal end  and the attachment flange ) extends into the cylindrical housing  from the flange . A lesser portion  of the disc-shaped inflation fluid source  (between the proximal end  and the attachment flange ) extends outward from the flange , away from the interior of the housing  and into the dashboard. In one preferred embodiment, between about one third and about one seventh of the height of the inflation fluid source  extends outward from the attachment flange  away from the housing  and to the dashboard. In a presently preferred embodiment, about one fifth of the height of the inflation fluid source  extends outward from the attachment flange  into the dashboard interior . Accordingly, there is little material extending beyond the point of attachment of the inflation fluid source  to the instrument panel  into the interior of the vehicle. Thus, the airbag module uses space efficiently and minimizes any weight behind the point of attachment. Because the flange  is the point of attachment of the inflation fluid source , and consequently the module  itself, to the interior of the vehicle, there is little weight behind to the point of attachment to create unwanted forces upon the instrument panel . Additionally, the module  has a smaller or shorter profile and more easily fits within the instrument panel . Accordingly, the present invention does not require additionally bracketry to support the module  within the passenger side of the vehicle.","The cylindrical housing , in conjunction with the cylindrical portion  of the inflator  and the circular mouth  of the cushion  allow the module  to be efficiently packaged. The circular mouth  is without corners which strengthens the connection of the cushion  to the inflator . The cushion  is less likely to tear or weaken under the jolt of initial deployment.","Referring now to , the retaining collar  of the preferred invention  is illustrated. In one embodiment, the flange  is annular and flares outwardly away from opening . The outer edge  of the flange  is positioned within the mouth  of the cushion . The retaining collar  may include positioning extensions  configured to engage corresponding openings  within the cushion  and the housing . The openings  in the cushion  are adjacent to, and spaced about, the mouth  and when the retaining collar  is secured to the inflator , with the extensions  seated within the openings , the cushion  is prevented from movement relative to the retaining collar  and the inflator . In embodiments where the positioning extensions  are positioned within the housing , the cushion  is also prevented from movement relative to the housing . The spaced apart extensions  and openings  also allow for more uniform retention by the retaining collar . In this configuration, there are less possible gaps for the inflation fluid to escape to the outside surface  of the cushion , rather than directly into the cushion .","In one presently preferred embodiment, the positioning extensions  are punched out of, and integral with, the material of the retaining collar . In other embodiments, the positioning extensions  may be separate members attached to the retaining collar . The extensions may also be dimples or other types of indentions that impinge upon the fabric of the cushion . In these alternative embodiments, positioning extensions  need not be broken away from, or punched through the retaining collar , thus obviating the need for openings  to receive the extensions .","It should be appreciated that the apparatus of the present invention is capable of being incorporated in the form of a variety of embodiments, only a few of which have been illustrated and described above. The invention may be embodied in other forms without departing from its spirit or essential characteristics. The described embodiments are to be considered in all respects only as illustrative and not restrictive and the scope of the invention is, therefore, indicated by the appended claims rather than by the foregoing description.
