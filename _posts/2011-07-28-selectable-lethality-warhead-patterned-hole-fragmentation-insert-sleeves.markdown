title: Selectable lethality warhead patterned hole fragmentation insert sleeves
abstract: The dynamically configurable controlled fragmentation insert mechanism of this invention includes an assembly of three or more sleeves with differing through hole patterns thereon, that fit inside the shell casing. The individual sleeves can move independently of one another and a simple pinning mechanism holds the parts in place for a selected configuration. The warfighter can realign the insert sleeves by to create different geometric patterns of holes, each designed to engage a different target set with optimally sized fragments. The aligned patterns of holes creates individual geometric shapes that focus high-velocity jets to cut into the steel shell casing to correlate to the through-holes in the aligned patterned sleeves. Realigning the insert sleeves changes the through-hole pattern to produce different fragment sizes and mass distributions. To defeat light armored vehicles for instance, a warfighter can deploy a sleeve hole pattern to produce larger fragments with greater penetrating power, while to engage enemy troops for instance, a warfighter can “dial in” another hole pattern through the fuze assembly to otherwise produce a much larger number of smaller, lighter fragments.

S. Government for U. S. Government purposes.","To destroy a specific target of a defined armor protection and size, a given fragmentation warhead must deliver a large number of optimally sized fragments within an effective lethal area. To combat multiple threat scenarios, the U.S. military must maintain supplies of several different fragmentation warheads, each type adapted for use against a particular target set. This obligatory approach creates a burden on logistics and supply. Additionally, existing artillery and mortars produce limited lethality depending upon the grade of steel used in their shells. Making more lethal, multi-purpose munitions available to the military would result in significant inventory reductions and cost savings.","The U.S. military employs fragmentation warheads against a wide variety of targets ranging from personnel, radar systems, trucks, parked aircraft, and rocket launchers to armored personnel carriers .and self-propelled artillery. One significant obstacle to mission success is that a fragmentation warhead designed to defeat personnel is not generally effective against materiel targets including trucks and light armored vehicles, where fragments of relatively greater size and mass are required. As mentioned, military units must maintain supplies of several different fragmentation warheads, each type adapted for use against a particular type of target. This results in a burden on logistics and supply.","Existing artillery and mortars produce limited lethality depending upon the grade of steel used in their shells. Warhead designers have tried several techniques to enhance fragmentation including: using harder High Fragmentation (HF) steel in the shell body, scoring the shell body, adding preformed fragments, and applying multiple detonator initiation schemes. While these techniques can improve lethality, each traditional approach presents its own problems. Manufacturing HF steel involves a time consuming and costly heat treatment process. Scoring the casing weakens the shell's structural rigidity presenting potential problems related to survivability. Specifically, the scored grooves act as stress concentration points during the set back stage of gun launch. Adding preformed fragments helps to assure that the warhead delivers a few optimally sized fragments but fails to enhance the fragmentation of the existing shell casing. Multiple detonator initiation schemes are very complicated and the additional detonators reduce the amount of space available for high explosive material.","To effectively engage multiple target types, the U.S. military requires an easily producible, multi-mode warhead alternative at a reasonable cost. Described here to meet this challenge is a high performance variable lethality, multi-purpose warhead using a novel adaptive fragmentation mechanism. The invention enables the modern warfighter to instantaneously modify a fragmentation warhead in the field, generating a desired fragment size to neutralize a broad range of targets, from personnel targets to light armored vehicles. Additionally, adaptive fragmentation can minimize collateral damage by focusing the warhead's lethal effects upon the intended targets.","This invention can increase lethality by fitting conventional fragmentation warheads with inexpensive, dynamically configurable patterned insert sleeve mechanisms, to control the fragment mass distribution.","The dynamically configurable controlled fragmentation insert mechanism of this invention includes an assembly of three or more sleeves that fit inside the shell casing. The innermost sleeve contains the explosive material and eliminates voids that could adversely affect performance or even initiate premature detonation during launch. The explosive material comprises, for example, LX-14, OCTOL, hand packed C-4, or any other solid explosive that might be machined, cast, or hand-packed to fit snugly within the inside of the innermost sleeve. The dynamically selectable hole pattern is made up of two or more additional sleeves, each perforated with a unique pattern of holes. Each sleeve is designed to fit inside the next. The individual sleeves can move independently of one another and a simple pinning mechanism holds the parts in place for a selected configuration. The warfighter can realign the insert sleeves by manipulating the fuze assembly to create different geometric patterns of holes, each designed to engage a different target set with optimally sized fragments. The insert pattern of holes creates individual geometric shapes that focus the explosive energy released upon detonation to generate multiple high-velocity jets. The jets cut into the steel shell casing in the predefined areas that correlate to the through-holes in the aligned patterned sleeves. This solution makes efficient use of the high velocity radial expansion of the shell initiated upon detonation. The selectable pattern of insert sleeve holes focuses the explosive energy and forces the shell body to break up in a predictable fashion. Realigning the insert sleeves changes the through-hole pattern to produce different fragment sizes and mass distributions. The aligned through-holes focus the explosive energy at specific points on the inside of the shell casing and the blocked holes limit the expansion, allowing warhead designers to precisely control the fragment geometry. To defeat light armored vehicles or other materiel targets, the warfighter can deploy the warhead without changing the default mechanical offset of the insert sleeve hole pattern to produce larger fragments with greater penetrating power, or to engage enemy troops, the warfighter can easily \u201cdial in\u201d the hole pattern through the fuze assembly to otherwise configure a much larger number of smaller, lighter fragments. Now, the warfighter can instantaneously configure one warhead in the field to engage multiple target types. The invention functions by focusing the explosive energy released upon detonation into a series of high velocity jets, much like the action of shaped charges. The jets cut into the shell body breaking it into smaller pieces. The alignment of the patterned sleeves, the number of sleeves, the pattern\/frequency and size of the holes, and the geometry of the holes can be modified to produce different combinations of large and small sized fragments. The sleeve can be made out of a variety of low-cost, easily machined materials including metals and plastics. This new patterned hole insert sleeve assembly addresses the downfalls of the existing fragmentation enhancement methods in the following ways:","1. The insert sleeve assembly requires no modifications to the existing projectile body and this novel solution easily conforms to both cylindrical and non-cylindrical shell casings including tapered mortar bodies and round grenades.","2. Manufacturers can mass produce the simple patterned hole insert sleeves for low cost using casting, stamping, or rolling methods and inexpensive materials including metals and plastics. The basic patterned hole fragmentation design calls for fabricators to manufacture just three simple insert sleeves with easily mass produced tolerances compared to other fragmentation insert designs that require a multitude of intricate machined parts with high tolerance specifications. To produce the patterned hole fragmentation inserts, makers can simply punch holes in sheet metal and then roll the sheets up into sleeves.","3. This unique mechanism enhances the fragmentation of the entire existing shell body. Unlike traditional fragmentation approaches that fail to utilize all of the shell body material, this optimal new design can also form engineered fragments out of the warhead detonator cap and the end cap, ultimately increasing lethality.","4. This innovative control fragmentation mechanism can dynamically tailor the fragment masses, shapes, and distribution for the best possible performance. This device ensures optimal lethality against both materiel and personnel.","5. The warfighter can quickly configure the fragmentation mode in the field easily and reliably by simply rotating the sleeves through the fuze assembly. This single step operation is straightforward and easy compared to moving multiple parts in other fragmentation insert devices.","6. Warhead designers can easily apply this new scalable concept to enhance the lethality of munitions ranging in size from grenades through mortar and artillery rounds up to tactical missiles.","This adaptive fragmentation will benefit the modern warfighter because warhead engineers can retrofit existing projectiles using this multi-mode controlled fragmentation assembly without modifying the shells. This simple new technology will also serve the U.S. military far into the future as engineers apply this scalable concept to new munition designs ranging in size from grenades through mortar and artillery rounds up to tactical missiles. Additionally, future warhead designs could easily incorporate a mechanism to alter the fragmentation insert pattern in flight to adapt to rapidly changing battlefield conditions. For example, the warfighter could deploy a warhead configured to neutralize enemy personnel using smaller fragments and then remotely change the warhead's insert pattern in flight to defeat vehicles with larger fragments as the enemy combatants seek cover.","It will be appreciated that this variable lethality warhead enhances the U.S. military's capabilities by: optimizing lethality; minimizing collateral damage; engaging expanded target sets with more efficient munitions; enabling multi-mission capability using a single warhead; reducing the costly burden on supply and logistics; facilitating new warhead development using lower cost, commonly available steels and simple, inexpensive manufacturing techniques.","Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a fragmentation warhead for a projectile in which fragment size can be field pre-selected by the warhead user.","Another object of the present invention is to provide a fragmentation warhead for a projectile which includes a preselection hand twistable fuze to change desired warhead fragmentation from large to small fragment size.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide a preselectable fragment size fragmentation warhead which can be used for grenades, for mortars, as well as for artillery projectiles.","It is a yet another object of the present invention to provide a preselectable fragment size fragmentation warhead which can be changed during flight by telemetry, to select fragment size desired upon detonation.","These and other objects, features and advantages of the invention will become more apparent in view of the within detailed descriptions of the invention, the claims, and in light of the following drawings wherein reference numerals may be reused where appropriate to indicate a correspondence between the referenced items.

Round  has a fore section , an aft section , and a propulsion means . Behind the fore section is a warhead  section, which warhead includes this invention. Warhead  is shown in enlarged partial cutaway views in . A pair of circular shaped base elements  serve as bookends, in between which are mounted several cylindrically shaped elements. These begin innermost with a more or less solid cylindrically shaped (explosive billet), main charge . Next surrounding the main charge  is a more or less hollow cylindrical sheet metal shield (an explosive containment sleeve). Next surrounding the metal shield  is a more or less hollow cylindrical sheet metal inner sleeve . Inner sleeve has a first pattern of relatively small holes  punched there through (which holes may be of equal size to one another, or not), and a second pattern of relatively larger holes  punched there through (which may be of equal size to one another, or not). Next surrounding the inner sleeve  is a (rotatable relative to inner sleeve ) more or less hollow cylindrical sheet metal outer sleeve , which has a third pattern of holes  punched there through, the holes  usually all about the same diameter with respect to one another and usually of diameter at least as large as the bigger holes  of inner sleeve . The third pattern of holes  on outer sleeve  are such that outer sleeve  may be rotated around inner sleeve  to line up holes  with either the smaller holes  of the inner sleeve , or with the larger holes  of the inner sleeve , but not usually with both sized holes at the same time.
