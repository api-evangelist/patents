{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This Application is a Continuation-in-Part of and claims priority under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7120 to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/198,780, filed Aug. 26, 2008, entitled \u201cMETHOD AND SYSTEM FOR DATA CONTEXT SERVICE,\u201d which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety and claims priority under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119(e) to Provisional Patent Application No. 60\/968,304 filed Aug. 27, 2007.","Oilfield operations, such as surveying, drilling, wireline testing, completions, production, planning and oilfield analysis, are typically performed to locate and gather valuable downhole fluids. During the oilfield operations, data is typically collected for analysis and\/or monitoring of the oilfield operations. Such data may include, for example, subterranean formation, equipment, historical and\/or other data. Data concerning the subterranean formation is collected using a variety of sources. Such formation data may be static or dynamic. Static data relates to, for example, formation structure, and geological stratigraphy that define the geological structures of the subterranean formation. Dynamic data relates to, for example, fluids flowing through the geologic structures of the subterranean formation over time. Such static and\/or dynamic data may be collected to learn more about the formations and the valuable assets contained therein.","The data may be used to predict downhole conditions, and make decisions concerning oilfield operations. Such decisions may involve well planning, well targeting, well completions, operating levels, production rates and other operations and\/or operating parameters. Often this information is used to determine when to drill new wells, re-complete existing wells, or alter wellbore production. Oilfield conditions, such as geological, geophysical and reservoir engineering characteristics may have an impact on oilfield operations, such as risk analysis, economic valuation, and mechanical considerations for the production of subsurface reservoirs.","Data from one or more wellbores may be analyzed to plan or predict various outcomes at a given wellbore. In some cases, the data from neighboring wellbores or wellbores with similar conditions or equipment may be used to predict how a well may perform. Usually, a large number of variables and large quantities of data may be used in an oilfield project to consider in analyzing oilfield operations. It is, therefore, often useful to model the behavior of the oilfield operation using an oilfield software application to perform a workflow to determine the desired course of action. During the ongoing operations, the operating parameters may be adjusted as oilfield conditions change and new information is received.","Workers seeking knowledge in the energy industry typically have access to a domain of structured information (data in databases or spreadsheets) and very limited access to unstructured data (reports, presentations, maps, emails, web content, etc. described above). Various studies indicate approximately twenty percent of data used in most businesses are structured data with the remaining eighty percent being unstructured data commonly appearing in memos, notes, news, user groups, chats, reports, letters, surveys, white papers, marketing material, research, presentations and Web pages. In energy (e.g., oil and gas, renewable energies, etc.) industry, more than sixty percent of unstructured data are not managed or used. If the worker uses common search tools for unstructured data such as web content search engines or Electronic Document Management Systems (EDMS) for searching documents and reports, the search results are often unusable because the taxonomy of the search is not relevant to the domain and workflow of the energy industry.","In general, in one aspect, the invention relates to a method for providing a data context service. The method comprises extracting context information from a host application associated with an oilfield project, the context information comprising a current state of a user in the host application, sorting the context information into a plurality of dimensions of relevance, generating a search profile for each of the plurality of dimensions of relevance, requesting a first plurality of searches using at least the search profile, receiving a plurality of oilfield data items resulting from the first plurality of searches, obtaining a quality measure of an oilfield data item of the plurality of oilfield data items based on a pre-determined quality criterion, sending the oilfield data item as a search result to the host application after determining the quality measure exceeds a pre-determined threshold, and generating an output using the host application based on the search result, the output being used to perform an oilfield operation.","Other aspects of the quality measure for data context service will be apparent from the following description and the appended claims.","Embodiments of the data context service are shown in the above-identified figures and described in detail below. In describing the embodiments, like or identical reference numerals are used to identify common or similar elements. The figures are not necessarily to scale and certain features and certain views of the figures may be shown exaggerated in scale or in schematic in the interest of clarity and conciseness.","In general, embodiments of the data context service provide capabilities of performing searches of the oilfield data having both structured and unstructured formats from within an oilfield software application, and to return search results that are more relevant to the context of the oilfield project, the application used by the project, the workflow performed using the application, the user using the application, etc. In addition, embodiments of the data context service include capabilities for identifying the quality of the search results, promoting search results with good quality, and cleaning up poor quality results.

As described, the oilfield operation may be performed in a workflow of a project using a host application. Initially, the context information associated with the project is extracted from the host application (Element ).

Then, search profiles are generated from the multiple dimensions of relevance (Element ). A separate search profile may be generated from each of the dimensions of relevance. A search profile may provide some portion of the search criteria based on which a search for oilfield data items may be performed. The effects of the multiple search profiles may be combined according to a weighted average scheme where the weighting of individual search profiles may be determined based on user input. Optionally, application usage information from multiple users of the host application may be obtained so that an optional suggested search phrase may be generated by correlating the context information to the application usage information.","In Element , multiple searches are requested based on at least the search profile. The searches may be further limited by an optional search phrase. Optionally, the searches may be based on a third party search index. In Element , one or more oilfield data items (of structured and\/or unstructured formats) are received as results from the multiple searches. Optionally, the results may be sent to a third party application.","Upon receipt of the results, a quality measure of an oilfield data item included in the results may be obtained based on pre-determined quality criteria (Element ). Optionally, one or more phrases may be identified from the oilfield data item, each phrase associated with a corresponding usage measure based on a record of frequently used phrases. For example, the usage measure may be generated from searches performed by multiple users of the host application. A phrase may then be selected, for example, by the user as a search keyword from the one or more phrases based on the corresponding usage measure. Accordingly, additional searches may be requested to refine the result by limiting the searches with the search keyword in addition to using the search profile. If the quality measure exceeds a pre-determined threshold (Element ), then the oilfield data item is sent to the host application as a search result (Element ). Otherwise, if the quality measure does not exceed the pre-determined threshold (Element ), then the process may end or continue until the quality measure exceeds the pre-determined threshold. In Element , an output may be generated using the host application based on the search result, and the oilfield operation (e.g., a survey operation, a drilling operation, a simulator operation, and a processing operation, etc.) is adjusted based on the output. In one or more embodiments, the output is stored (e.g., in a repository or other readable storage medium) and the oilfield operation (e.g., a survey operation, a drilling operation, a simulator operation, and a processing operation, etc.) is adjusted based on the output stored in the repository.","The elements of portions or all of the process may be repeated as desired. Repeated elements may be selectively performed until satisfactory results are achieved. For example, elements may be repeated after adjustments are performed.

The location of interest may be the project location, the object location, or other location of interest within the oilfield operation project. Each of the search results ()-() is obtained based on the current context due to at least one associated geographical location falling into the geographical region centered on the location of interest.
