{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This application is a continuation of copending International Application No. PCT\/EP2012\/050365, filed Jan. 11, 2012, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, and additionally claims priority from European Application No. 11153211.5, filed Feb. 3, 2011, which is also incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The field of the present invention is related to an audio mixer for mixing of multi-track signals according to user specifications. It is related to audio signal processing, in particular to the task of mixing a multi-track recording according to a set of user-defined criteria. The field of the invention is further related to a method for mixing a plurality of audio tracks to a mixture signal. The field of the invention is also related to a computer program for instructing a computer to perform the method for mixing a plurality of audio tracks.","The ever-growing availability of multimedia content yields new ways for the user to enjoy music and to interact with music. These possibilities are accompanied by the challenge to develop the tools for assisting the user in such activities.","From the perspective of information retrieval, this challenge has been taken more than a decade ago, leading to the vibrant research area of music information retrieval and numerous commercial applications.","A different aspect which has not been addressed to this extent is the interaction with content which is available in a multi-track format. A multi-track format can consist of separate and time-aligned signals (also known as single tracks (ST)) for each sound object (SO) or groups of objects (stems). According to one definition, stems are the individual components of a mix, separately saved (usually to disc or tape) for the purpose of use in a remix.","In the traditional process of music production, multiple single tracks are combined in a sophisticated manner into a mixture signal (MS) which is then delivered to the end user. The ongoing evolution of digital audio technologies, e.g. the development of new audio formats for parametric object-based audio, enables the interaction with music to a much larger extent. The user has access to multi-track recordings and can actively control the mixing process. Some artists have begun releasing the stems for some of their songs, the intention being that listeners can freely remix and reuse the music in any way desired.","A musical or audio work released in multi-track format can be used in numerous ways. The user may control the mixing parameters for the different tracks, thus emphasising selected tracks while attenuating other tracks. One or more tracks may be muted, for example for the purposes of karaoke or play-along. Sound effects, such as echo, reverberation, distortion, chorus etc., may be applied to selected tracks without affecting the other tracks. One or more tracks may be excerpted from the multi-track format and can be used in another musical work or another form of audio work, such as an audio book, a lecture, a podcast, etc. In the following description, an application of the teachings disclosed herein discusses, in an exemplary manner, the mastering of a recorded musical work. It should be understood, however, that the processing of any recorded sound involving mixing a plurality of single audio tracks is intended to be equally addressed and covered by the teachings disclosed herein.","Automatic mixing has been, and still is, the focus of a number of research projects. In 2009, Perez-Gonzalez et al. described a method for automatic equalization of multi-track signals (E. Perez-Gonzalez and J. Reiss, \u201cAutomatic Equalization of Multi-Channel Audio Using Cross-Adaptive Methods\u201d, Proc. of the AES 127Conv., 2009). The authors present a method for automatically setting the attenuation for each signal of a multi-track signal. The gains are determined such that the loudness of each signal equals the average loudness of all signals. Another article by the same authors addressed \u201cAutomatic Gain and Fader Control for Live Mixing\u201d and was published in Proc. of WASPAA, 2009.","Semantic HiFi is the name of the European Project IST-507913 (H. Vinet et al., \u201cSemantic HiFi Final Report\u201d, Final Report of IST-507913, 2006). It is mainly related to the retrieval, browsing, and sharing of multimedia content. This comprises browsing and navigating in databases, playlist generation, intra-track navigation (using structural analysis like verse-chorus identification), and meta-data sharing. It also addresses the interaction\/authoring\/editing: generating mixes including synchronization (that is \u201cconcatenating\u201d audio signals, not mixing multi-track signals), voice transformation, rhythm transformation, voice controlled instruments, and effects.","Another project is known under the designation \u201cStructured Audio\u201d or MPEG 4. Structured Audio enables the transmission of audio signals at low bit-rates and perceptually based manipulation and access of sonic data using symbolic and semantic description of the signals (cf. B. L. Vercoe and W. G. Gardner and E. D. Scheirer, \u201cStructured Audio: Creation, Transmission, and Rendering of Parametric Sound Representations\u201d, Proc. of IEEE, vol. 86, pp. 922-940, 1998). It features a description of parametric sound post-production for mixing multiple streams and adding audio effects. The parametric descriptions determine how the sounds are synthesized. Structured audio is related to synthesizing audio signals.","In the international patent application published under international publication number WO 2010\/111373 A1, a context aware, speech-controlled interface and system is disclosed. The speech-directed user interface system includes at least one speaker for delivering an audio signal to a user and at least one microphone for capturing speech utterances of a user. An interface device interfaces with the speaker and the microphone and provides a plurality of audio signals to the speaker to be heard by the user. A control circuit is operably coupled with the interface device and is configured for selecting at least one of the plurality of audio signals as a foreground audio signal for delivery to the user through the speaker. The control circuit is operable for recognizing speech utterances of a user and using the recognized speech utterances to control the selection of the foreground audio signal.","United States Patent Application Publication No. US 2002\/0087310 A1 discloses a computer-implemented method and system for handling a speech dialogue with a user. Speech input from a user contains words directed to a plurality of concepts. The user speech input contains a request for a service to be performed. Speech recognition of the user speech input is used to generate recognized words. A dialogue template is applied to the recognized words. The dialogue template has nodes that are associated with predetermined concepts. The nodes include different request processing information. Conceptual regions are identified within the dialogue template based upon which nodes are associated with concepts that approximately match the concepts of the recognized words. The user's request is processed by using the request processing information of the nodes contained within the identified conceptual regions.","The article \u201cTransient Detection of Audio Signals Based on an Adaptive Comb Filter in the Frequency Domain\u201d, M. Kwong and R. Lefebvre presents a transient detection algorithm suitable for rhythm detection in music signals. In many audio signals, low energy transients are masked by high energy stationary sounds. These masked transients, as well as higher energy and more visible transients, convey important information on the rhythm and time segmentation of the music signal. The proposed segmentation algorithm uses a sinusoidal model combined with adaptive comb filtering in the frequency domain to remove the stationary component of a sound signal. After filtering, the time envelope of the residual signal is analyzed to locate the transient components. Results show that the proposed algorithm can accurately detect most low energy transients.","The mixing of a multi-track recording typically is an authoring task which is usually done by an expert, the mixing engineer. Current developments in multimedia like interactive audio formats lead to applications where multi-track recordings need to be mixed in an automated way or in a semi-automated way guided by a non-expert. It is desired that the automatically derived mixture signal has comparable subjective sound quality to a mixture signal generated by a human expert.","The teachings disclosed herein address this general goal. The teachings are related to audio signal processing, in particular the task of mixing a multi-track according to a set of user-defined recording criteria for the (eventual) purpose of listening. An audio mixer and a method for mixing a plurality of audio tracks to a mixture signal according to the teachings disclosed herein establish a connection between a substantially aesthetic idea of a non-expert and the resulting mixture signal.","According to an embodiment, an audio mixer for mixing a plurality of audio tracks to a mixture signal may have: a semantic command interpreter for receiving a semantic mixing command and for deriving a plurality of mixing parameters for the plurality of audio tracks from the semantic mixing command, wherein the plurality of mixing parameters are a function of spectral and temporal characteristics of the plurality of audio tracks; an audio track processor for processing the plurality of audio tracks in accordance with the plurality of mixing parameters; and an audio track combiner for combining the plurality of audio tracks processed by the audio track processor into the mixture signal.","According to another embodiment, a method for mixing a plurality of audio tracks to a mixture signal may have the steps of: receiving a semantic mixing command; deriving a plurality of mixing parameters for the plurality of audio tracks from the semantic mixing command, wherein the plurality of mixing parameters are also a function of spectral and temporal characteristics of the plurality of audio tracks; processing the plurality of audio tracks in accordance with the plurality of mixing parameters; and combining the plurality of audio tracks resulting from the processing of the plurality of audio tracks to form the mixture signal.","According to another embodiment, an audio mixer for mixing a plurality of audio tracks to a mixture signal may have: a semantic command interpreter for receiving a semantic mixing command and for deriving a plurality of mixing parameters for the plurality of audio tracks from the semantic mixing command; an audio track processor for processing the plurality of audio tracks in accordance with the plurality of mixing parameters; and an audio track combiner for combining the plurality of audio tracks processed by the audio track processor into the mixture signal; and an audio track identifier for identifying a target audio track among the plurality of audio tracks, the target audio track being indicated within the semantic mixing command by an audio track identification expression, the audio track identifier being configured to retrieve a data record that corresponds to the audio track identification expression from an audio track template database, the data record having information about a corresponding musical instrument in the form of at least one of a measurement value and a sound sample, to analyze the audio tracks, and to compare audio signals of the audio tracks with the data record, in order to determine one audio track or several audio tracks that appear to match the target audio track.","According to another embodiment, a method for mixing a plurality of audio tracks to a mixture signal may have the steps of: receiving a semantic mixing command; deriving a plurality of mixing parameters for the plurality of audio tracks from the semantic mixing command, the plurality of mixing parameters having a mixing parameter for a target audio track; identifying a target audio track being indicated within the semantic mixing command by an audio track identification expression; retrieving, from an audio track template database, a data record that corresponds to the audio track identification expression, the data record having information about a corresponding musical instrument in the form of at least one of a measurement value and a sound sample; identifying the target audio track among the plurality of audio tracks by analyzing audio signals of the audio tracks and comparing them with the data record, to determine one audio track or several audio tracks that appear to match the target audio track; processing the plurality of audio tracks in accordance with the plurality of mixing parameters; and combining the plurality of audio tracks resulting from the processing of the plurality of audio tracks to form the mixture signal.","Another embodiment may have a computer program for instructing a computer to perform the above methods for mixing a plurality of audio tracks to a mixture signal.","According to the teachings disclosed herein, an audio mixer for mixing a plurality of audio tracks to a mixture signal comprises a semantic command interpreter, an audio track processor, and an audio track combiner. The semantic command interpreter is configured for receiving a semantic mixing command and for deriving a plurality of mixing parameters for the plurality of audio tracks from the semantic mixing command. The audio track processor is configured for processing the plurality of audio tracks in accordance with the plurality of mixing parameters. The audio track combiner is configured for combining the plurality of audio tracks processed by the audio track processor into the mixture signal.","The method for mixing a plurality of audio tracks to a mixture signal according to the disclosed teachings comprises: receiving a semantic mixing command; deriving a plurality of mixing parameters for the plurality of audio tracks from the semantic mixing command; processing the plurality of audio tracks in accordance with the plurality of mixing parameters; and combining the plurality of audio tracks resulting from the processing of the plurality of audio tracks to form the mixture signal.","The computer program comprises or represents instructions for enabling a computer or a processor to perform the method for mixing a plurality of audio tracks. The computer program may be embodied on a computer readable medium having stored thereon said computer program for performing, when running on a computer, the above methods.","The semantic mixing command may be based on user-defined criteria which provide a semantic description of the desired resulting mixture signal. According to the teachings disclosed herein, semantic audio analysis, psychoacoustics, and audio signal processing may be incorporated with each other in order to derive a mixture signal automatically on the basis of the semantic descriptions. This process may be termed \u201cSemantic Mixing\u201d.","Semantic Mixing may be regarded as a method which enables a computer to mix a multi-track recording according to a specification given by a user. The specification is typically given in the form of a semantic description. Given this semantic description, the mixing parameters may be determined by taking into account the characteristics of the single track(s) and the human hearing.","The audio mixer according to the teachings disclosed herein thus typically comprises a computer or processor, or it interacts with a computer\/processor. The audio track processor and the audio track combiner may be combined as a single unit.","The deriving of the plurality of mixing parameters from the semantic mixing command may involve analyzing a meaning of the semantic mixing command, or of parts thereof. A part of the semantic mixing command may be a semantic expression, such as a word or a group of words. The semantic expression(s) may then be translated to a set of specific mixing parameters for the plurality of audio tracks. Thus, the semantic mixing command is implemented by means of the specific mixing parameters that correspond to the meaning of the semantic mixing command. The action of translating the semantic mixing command and\/or of its constituting semantic expressions may comprise evaluating a translation function or querying a lookup table, for example. Parameters of the translation function or data records in the lookup table are typically pre-defined and represent a collection of expert knowledge of e.g. experienced mixing engineers. The expert knowledge may be gathered over time e.g. by logging the oral instructions given by an artist or a music producer to his\/her mixing engineer, as well as the settings performed by the mixing engineer. Thus, the translation function and\/or the lookup table may be trained by an expert mixing engineer.","According to an aspect of the teachings disclosed herein, the semantic command interpreter may comprise a vocabulary database for identifying semantic expressions within the semantic mixing command. By means of the vocabulary database, the semantic command interpreter may identify for example synonyms. It may further be possible to map a word or a group of words contained in the semantic mixing command to a specific value. For example, a word for identifying an instrument (\u201cguitar\u201d) may be mapped to a particular channel number or identifier, on which the instrument has been recorded. The vocabulary database may further comprise entries identifying a certain part of a musical part, such as the beginning (e.g. \u201cIntro\u201d), the chorus (\u201cChorus\u201d), or the end (e.g. \u201cCoda\u201d or \u201cOutro\u201d). Yet another possible use of the vocabulary database is for recognizing and assigning semantically expressed mixing parameters or styles, such as \u201cloud\u201d, \u201csoft\u201d, \u201cclear\u201d, \u201cmuffled\u201d, \u201cdistant\u201d, \u201cclose\u201d etc.","In an embodiment of the teachings disclosed herein, the audio mixer may further comprise an audio track identifier for identifying a target audio track among the plurality of audio tracks. The target audio track may be indicated within the semantic mixing command by an audio track identification expression. The audio track identifier may be useful if the plurality of audio tracks are not clearly marked or identified as to which part or stem they contain. For example, the audio tracks may be simply numbered as \u201ctrack \u201d, \u201ctrack \u201d, . . . \u201ctrack N\u201d. The audio track identifier may then analyze each one of the plurality of audio tracks to determine either none, one, or several audio tracks that appear to match an audio track identified by the track identification expression.","The audio track identifier may be configured to retrieve a data record that corresponds to the audio track identification expression from an audio track template database, to perform an analysis of at least one of a track name, a track identifier, a timbre, a rhythmic structure, a frequency range, a sound sample, and a harmonic density of at least one audio track among the plurality of audio tracks, to compare a result of the analysis with the data record resulting in at least one matching score, and to determine the target audio track on the basis of the at least one matching score between the at least one audio track and the data record. The task to be performed by the audio track identifier is to identify the target audio track among the plurality of audio tracks. The target audio track corresponds to the audio track identification expression, that is, if the audio track identification expression is \u201cguitar\u201d, then, subsequent to successful identification by the audio track identifier, the target audio track should typically contain the guitar part of a musical work. The audio track template database may comprise a data record corresponding to the instrument \u201cguitar\u201d, the data record itself comprising values and\/or information that are characteristic for a guitar. For example, the data record may comprise a frequency model of the typical guitar sound and\/or an attack-decay model of the typical guitar sound. The data record could also contain a sound sample of a guitar, which may be used for a similarity analysis by the audio track identifier.","According to an aspect of the teachings disclosed herein, the audio mixer may further comprise a time section identifier for identifying a target time section within the plurality of audio tracks, the target time section being indicated within the semantic mixing command by a time section identification expression. In case the user wishes to mix a first section of an audio signal (e.g. a musical work) differently from a second section of the same audio signal, the audio mixer typically needs to know, where the various sections of the audio signal begin and end in order to apply specific mixing parameters to these sections of the audio signal.","The time section identifier may be configured to structure the plurality of audio tracks into a plurality of time sections. Especially musical works often have a certain structure influenced by musical conventions, e.g. the song form with its alternating verse and chorus sections. This knowledge may be exploited by the time section identifier by first determining whether the audio signal represented by the plurality of audio tracks follows a certain musical structure and then to assign the time sections of the audio signal to the time sections of the musical structure. To this end, the time section identifier may comprise a pattern recognizer to recognize recurring and\/or similar patterns within the audio signal. Pattern recognition may be based on melody analysis, harmonic analysis, and rhythmic analysis, to name a few.","The time section identifier may be configured to perform an analysis of the plurality of audio tracks for determining at least one time instant at which a change of a characteristic property of an audio signal represented by the plurality of audio tracks occurs, and for using the at least one determined time instant as at least one boundary between two adjacent time sections.","The audio mixer may further comprise a meta-data interface for receiving meta-data relative to the plurality of audio tracks, the meta-data being indicative of at least one of a track name, a track identifier, a time structure information, an intensity information, spatial attributes of an audio track or a part thereof, timbre characteristics, and rhythmic characteristics. The meta-data may have been generated by the producer of the plurality of audio tracks and provide useful information for the audio mixer or the method for mixing the plurality of audio tracks. The availability of meta-data saves the audio mixer or the method from having to perform an extensive analysis of the audio signal in order to identify the various audio tracks and\/or time sections. The meta-data interface may also be used for storing the results (instruments, time structure, . . . ) of an analysis for future reuse. Thus, a potentially lengthy analysis of the plurality of audio tracks needs to be performed only once. Furthermore, any manual corrections to the automatically determined analysis results may also be stored so that the user does not have to correct the same issues over and over again. Having the stored analysis results at hand, the user may produce different mix versions from the same plurality of audio tracks using the same meta-data.","According to an aspect of the teachings disclosed herein, the audio mixer may further comprise a command interface for receiving the semantic mixing command in a linguistic format. The linguistic format allows the user to express his\/her desires regarding the result of the mixing performed by the audio mixer substantially by means of normal language. The semantic mixing command in the linguistic format may be input to the audio mixer as spoken language using a microphone or written language using e.g. a keyboard.","According to another aspect of the teachings disclosed herein, the audio mixer may further comprise an example interface for receiving an exemplary mixture signal, and a mixture signal analyzer for analyzing the exemplary mixture signal and for generating the semantic mixing command based on the analyzing of the exemplary mixture signal. Using the exemplary mixture signal provided via the example interface, the mixture signal analyzer may determine which features characterize the exemplary mixture signal. For example, the mixture signal analyzer may recognize an emphasis on the (strongly repetitive) drum part and the bass part, while the melody is less accentuated. These detected features suggest a so called Dance-Mix, i.e. a certain style of mixing. This information may be provided from the mixture signal analyzer to the semantic command interpreter. Based on this information, the semantic command interpreter may, for example increase the volume of the drum part and the bass part relative to the other parts. The semantic command interpreter might even replace the drum part with, for example, a synthesized drum part typically used for the desired Dance-Mix style.","The example interface may be further configured to receive a plurality of example audio tracks from which the exemplary mixture signal was obtained. The mixture signal analyzer may be configured to compare the example audio tracks with the exemplary mixture signal in order to determine the mixing parameters that were used to obtain the resulting exemplary mixture signal. The semantic mixing command produced by the mixture signal analyzer could then comprise a description of how the example audio tracks were modified before they were mixed together to form the exemplary mixture signal. For example, the semantic mixing command may comprise an expression such as \u201cdrums significantly louder; vocals moderately softer, more distant, filtered with high pass filter\u201d. The semantic command interpreter may then derive the plurality of mixing parameters from this semantic mixing command.","According to another aspect of the teachings disclosed herein, the semantic command interpreter may comprise a perceptual processor for transforming the semantic mixing command into the plurality of mixing parameters according to a perceptual model of hearing-related properties of the mixture signal. The perceptual model typically implements psychoacoustic rules that describe how certain mixing parameters should be chosen in order to achieve a desired effect for the listener. For example, for conveying an impression of distance, several sound processing actions may be involved, such as reverberation, frequency filtering, and attenuation. The perceptual model which is typically based on psychoacoustic findings facilitates the determination of suitable mixing parameters for the realization of a desired effect.","According to another aspect of the teachings disclosed herein, the semantic command interpreter comprises a fuzzy logic processor for receiving at least one fuzzy rule derived from the semantic mixing command by the semantic command interpreter, and for generating the plurality of mixing parameters on the basis of the at least one fuzzy rule. The fuzzy logic processor is well suited for processing the semantic mixing command in the form of the at least one fuzzy rule. The at least one fuzzy rule maps an input quantity of the fuzzy logic processor to an output quantity of the fuzzy logic processor in a substantially semantic domain, i.e. a mapping from a quantity of a first semantic format to a quantity of a second semantic format.","The fuzzy logic processor may be configured to receive at least two concurring fuzzy rules prepared by the semantic command interpreter, and wherein the audio mixer further comprises a random selector for selecting one concurring fuzzy rule among the at least two concurring fuzzy rules. By randomizing the selection of the fuzzy rule from two or more concurring fuzzy rules, an illusion of artistic freedom can be created so that the mixture signals produced by the audio mixer do not tend to sound substantially alike, as far as the mixing style is concerned, which could otherwise be the case when the audio mixer follows a more rigid scheme with respect to the fuzzy rules.","In terms of the method for mixing the plurality of audio tracks, a vocabulary database for identifying semantic expressions within the semantic mixing command may be queried.","The method may further or alternatively comprise an identification of a target audio track among the plurality of audio tracks, the target audio track being indicated within the semantic mixing command by an audio track identification expression. To this end, a data record that corresponds to the audio track identification expression from an audio track template database may be retrieved. Then, an analysis of at least one of a track name, a track identifier, a timbre, a rhythmic structure, a frequency range, a sound sample, and a harmonic density of at least one audio track among the plurality of audio tracks may be performed. A result of the analysis may be compared with the data record resulting in at least one matching score. Then, the target audio track may be determined on the basis of the at least one matching score between the at least one audio track and the data record.","The method may also comprise an action for identifying a target time section within the plurality of audio tracks, the target time section being indicated within the semantic mixing command by a time section identification expression. The action for identifying the target time section may be configured to structure the plurality of audio tracks into a plurality of time sections. The time section identification may comprise performing an analysis of the plurality of audio tracks for determining at least one time instant at which a change of a characteristic property of an audio signal represented by the plurality of audio tracks occurs, and using the at least one determined time instant as at least one boundary between two adjacent time sections.","According to another aspect of the teachings disclosed herein, the method may further comprise receiving meta-data relative to the plurality of audio tracks at a meta-data interface. The meta-data may be indicative of at least one of a track name, a track identifier, a time structure information, an intensity information, spatial attributes of an audio track or a part thereof, timbre characteristics, and rhythmic characteristics.","The method may further comprise receiving the semantic mixing command in a linguistic format at a command interface of a corresponding audio mixer.","According to another aspect of the teachings disclosed herein, the method may further comprise: receiving an exemplary mixture signal at an example interface, analyzing the exemplary mixture signal by means of a mixture signal analyzer, and generating the semantic mixing command based on the analyzing of the exemplary mixture signal.","The action of deriving the plurality of mixing parameters from the semantic mixing command may comprise: transforming the semantic mixing command into the plurality of mixing parameters according to a perceptual model of hearing-related properties of the mixture signal.","According to an aspect of the teachings disclosed herein, the action of deriving the plurality of mixing parameters may comprise: receiving at least one fuzzy rule derived from the semantic mixing command by a semantic command interpreter, and generating the plurality of mixing parameters on the basis of the at least one fuzzy rule. The reception of the at least one fuzzy rule and the generation of the plurality of mixing parameters on the basis of the at least one fuzzy rule may be performed by a fuzzy logic processor.","The method may further comprise: receiving at least two concurring fuzzy rules, and randomly selecting one concurring fuzzy rule among the at least two concurring fuzzy rules.","The teachings disclosed herein are different from the above mentioned known technology in the following points:\n\n","To briefly summarize some of the core aspects of the teachings disclosed herein, the mixing of a multi-track recording is an authoring task. Semantic Mixing aims at developing solutions for mixing a multi-track recording guided by semantic descriptions. It combines techniques of semantic audio analysis, psychoacoustics and audio signal processing.

In particular, the multi-track audio material typically is not a predefined format following a certain convention. In other words, the audio mixer cannot rely on that a specific audio track (e.g. \u201ctrack \u201d) contains a certain instrument (e.g. \u201cguitar\u201d). The meta-data produced by the semantic audio analysis, however, may provide substantially standardized information about the organization and the content of the multi-track signal that assist other modules of the audio mixer to accomplish their respective tasks. The standardization done by the semantic audio analysis is useful, because it allows the mixing command provided by the command interpreter  to be related to the encountered situation of the multi-track audio signal. Thus, the command interpreter  and the semantic audio analysis  \u201cspeak the same language\u201d.","The target descriptor assignment unit DAU  processes the meta-data provided by the semantic audio analysis  and the mixing rules from the command interpreter  in order to assign mixing operation descriptors to the plurality of audio tracks ST or to segments of the audio tracks ST. These descriptors state how each sound object SO which are dominant in the respective segment of the audio track ST are perceived in the target mixture signal MS.","It is assumed that in each audio track ST only one sound object is dominant at a time. Given this assumption, the attributes derived from the semantic audio analysis  (which are computed for each audio track ST) are processed as attributes for the sound object SO. Alternatively, the semantic audio analysis can output more than one attribute structure for each audio track ST if the audio track ST contains multiple sound objects, especially if the several sound objects SO temporally succeed each other within the audio track ST, which means that the several sound objects SO may be relatively easily separated. Another possibility is that a first sound object SO is present mainly in the left channel of a stereo signal, while a second sound object SO is present mainly in the right channel. Yet another possibility would be that the several sound objects can be separated in the frequency domain by means of low pass, high pass, and\/or bandpass filters.","Fuzzy Logic can be applied if the input variables are crisp values, but the rule set is formulated using fuzzy attributes (e.g. \u201clow\u201d or \u201chigh\u201d). For example, the degree of variation in the playing of an instrument can be expressed as a scalar value in the range between 0 and 1. Furthermore, the semantic audio analysis  can output the meta-data together with confidence values (e.g. probabilities) describing the degree of confidence with which the estimated meta-data has been computed.","Fuzzy Logic allows for modelling complex tasks, often incorporating expert knowledge. It makes use of Fuzzy Sets, which provide a straight-forward mechanism for converting precise values into fuzzy descriptions back and forth.","An overview of the processing if implemented as a Fuzzy Logic System is shown in the block diagram in  (Mendel, 1995). The Fuzzy Logic System comprises a fuzzification module , an inference module , a rule set , and a defuzzification module . The fuzzification module  receives a set of crisp inputs, for example from the semantic audio analysis . On the basis of the crisp input, the fuzzification  produces a fuzzy input set which is fed to the inference module . The inference module  evaluates the fuzzy input set by means of a rule set  that is equally fed to the inference module . The rule set  may be provided by the command interpreter . The inference module  produces a fuzzy output set and feeds it to the defuzzification module . In the defuzzification module  the fuzzy output set is translated to crisp outputs which may then be as the mixing parameters or as intermediate quantities.","Turning now to the fuzzification in more detail, the assignment of mixing operation descriptors MOD to the single audio tracks ST is done on the basis of the criteria described in the IF-part of the rule set determined by the command interpreter . If the respective meta-data form the semantic audio analysis  are given as real numbers or as strings together with a confidence value (e.g. as the result of the instrument classification), the real numbers are translated into linguistic variables using Fuzzification. Fuzzy Sets are sets whose elements have a degree of membership. This degree of membership can be any real number in the interval [0, 1] (in contrast to classical set theory where the degree of membership is either 0 or 1).","The Fuzzification is performed using the membership functions for the Fuzzy Set as exemplarily shown in .
