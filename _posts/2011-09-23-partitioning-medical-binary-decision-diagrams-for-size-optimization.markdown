{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This disclosure generally relates to sensors and binary decision diagrams, and in particular for monitoring and analyzing a person's health.","A sensor network may include distributed autonomous sensors. Uses of sensor networks include but are not limited to military applications, industrial process monitoring and control, machine health monitoring, environment and habitat monitoring, utility usage, healthcare and medical applications, home automation, and traffic control. A sensor in a sensor network is typically equipped with a communications interface, a controller, and an energy source (such as a battery).","A sensor typically measures a physical quantity and converts it into a signal that an observer or an instrument can read. For example, a mercury-in-glass thermometer converts a measured temperature into expansion and contraction of a liquid that can be read on a calibrated glass tube. A thermocouple converts temperature to an output voltage that a voltmeter can read. For accuracy, sensors are generally calibrated against known standards.","A binary decision diagram (BDD) is a data structure that may be used to represent a Boolean function. A reduced ordered binary decision diagram (ROBDD) is an optimized BDD that has no redundant nodes and isomorphic sub-graphs and that the variables appear in the same order along each path from root to a terminal node.","Sensor Networks",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","110","180","190","100","112","110","100","100","100"]},"A sensor array  comprises one or more sensors . A sensor  receives a stimulus and converts it into a data stream. The sensors  in sensor array  may be of the same type (e.g., multiple thermometers) or various types (e.g., a thermometer, a barometer, and an altimeter). A sensor array  may transmit one or more data streams based on the one or more stimuli to one or more analysis systems  over any suitable network. In particular embodiments, a sensor 's embedded processors may perform certain computational activities (e.g., image and signal processing) that could also be performed by other components of sensor network , such as, for example, analysis system  or display system .","As used herein, a sensor  in a sensor array  is described with respect to a subject. Therefore, a sensor  may be personal or remote with respect to the subject. Personal sensors receive stimuli that are from or related to the subject. Personal sensors may include, for example, sensors that are affixed to or carried by the subject (e.g., a heart-rate monitor, an input by the subject into a smart phone), sensors that are proximate to the subject (e.g., a thermometer in the room where the subject is located), or sensors that are otherwise related to the subject (e.g., GPS position of the subject, a medical report by the subject's doctor, a subject's email inbox). Remote sensors receive stimulus that is external to or not directly related to the subject. Remote sensors may include, for example, environmental sensors (e.g., weather balloons, stock market ticker), network data feeds (e.g., news feeds), or sensors that are otherwise related to external information. A sensor  may be both personal and remote depending on the circumstances. As an example and not by way of limitation, if the subject is a particular person, a thermometer in a subject's home may be considered personal while the subject is at home, but remote when the subject is away from home. As another example and not by way of limitation, if the subject is a particular home, a thermometer in the home may be considered personal to the home regardless of whether a person is in the home or away.","Analysis system  may monitor, store, and analyze one or more data streams from sensor array .

Therefore, a component may be local or remote with respect to the sensor . Local components (i.e., local analysis system , local display system ) may include components that are built into or proximate to the sensor . As an example and not by way of limitation, a sensor  could include an integrated computing system and LCD monitor that function as local analysis system  and local display system . Remote components (i.e., remote analysis system , remote display system ) may include components that are external to or independent of the sensor . As another example and not by way of limitation, a sensor  could transmit a data stream over a network to a remote server at a medical facility, wherein dedicated computing systems and monitors function as remote analysis system  and remote display system . In particular embodiments, each sensor  in sensor array  may utilize either local or remote display and analysis components, or both. In particular embodiments, a user may selectively access, analyze, and display the data streams from one or more sensors  in sensor array . This may be done, for example, as part of running a specific application or data analysis algorithm. The user could access data from specific types of sensors  (e.g., all thermocouple data), from sensors  that measure specific types of data (e.g., all environmental sensors), or based on other criteria.","Although  illustrates a particular arrangement of sensor array , sensors , analysis system , local analysis system , remote analysis system , display system , local display system , remote display system , and network , this disclosure contemplates any suitable arrangement of sensor array , sensors , analysis system , local analysis system , remote analysis system , display system , local display system , remote display system , and network .

As an example and not by way of limitation, a subject may be a person (or group of persons or entity), place (such as, for example, a geographical location), or thing (such as, for example, a building, road, airplane, or automobile). Although this disclosure describes particular types of subjects, this disclosure contemplates any suitable types of subjects.

As such, the terms \u201csubject\u201d and \u201cuser\u201d may refer to the same person, unless context suggests otherwise.","A sensor  responds to a stimulus by generating a data stream corresponding to the stimulus. A data stream may be a digital or analog signal that can be transmitted over any suitable transmission medium and further used in electronic devices. As used herein, the term \u201csensor\u201d is used broadly to describe any device that receives a stimulus and converts it into a data stream. The present disclosure assumes that the data stream output from a sensor  is transmitted to an analysis system, unless otherwise specified.","In particular embodiments, one or more sensors  each include a stimulus receiving element (i.e., sensing element), a communication element, and any associate circuitry. Sensors  generally are small, battery powered, portable, and equipped with a microprocessor, internal memory for data storage, and a transducer or other component for receiving stimulus. However, a sensor  may also be an assay, test, or measurement. A sensor  may interface with a personal computer and utilize software to activate the sensor  and to view and analyze the collected data. A sensor  may also have a local interface device (e.g., keypad, LCD) allowing it to be used as a stand-alone device. In particular embodiments, a sensor  may include one or more communication elements that may receive or transmit information (such as data streams) over a communication channel, for example to one or more other components in a sensor network.","In particular embodiments, one or more sensors  may measure a variety of things, including physiological, psychological, behavioral, and environmental stimulus. Physiological stimulus may include, for example, physical aspects of a person (e.g., stretch, motion of the person, and position of appendages); metabolic aspects of a person (e.g., glucose level, oxygen level, osmolality), biochemical aspects of a person (e.g., enzymes, hormones, neurotransmitters, cytokines), and other aspects of a person related to physical health, disease, and homeostasis. Psychological stimulus may include, for example, emotion, mood, feeling, anxiety, stress, depression, and other psychological or mental states of a person. Behavioral stimulus may include, for example, behavior related a person (e.g., working, socializing, arguing, drinking, resting, driving), behavior related to a group (e.g., marches, protests, mob behavior), and other aspects related to behavior.

Although this disclosure describes particular types of sensors, this disclosure contemplates any suitable types of sensors.","A biosensor is a type of sensor  that receives a biological stimulus and converts it into a data stream. As used herein, the term \u201cbiosensor\u201d is used broadly.","In particular embodiments, a biosensor may be a device for the detection of an analyte. An analyte is a substance or chemical constituent that is determined in an analytical procedure. For instance, in an immunoassay, the analyte may be the ligand or the binder, while in blood glucose testing, the analyte is glucose. In medicine, analyte typically refers to the type of test being run on a patient, as the test is usually determining the existence and\/or concentration of a chemical substance in the human body.","A common example of a commercial biosensor is a blood glucose monitor, which uses the enzyme glucose oxidase to break blood glucose down. In doing so, it first oxidizes glucose and uses two electrons to reduce the FAD (flavin adenine dinucleotide, a component of the enzyme) to FADH(1,5-dihydro-FAD). This in turn is oxidized by the electrode (accepting two electrons from the electrode) in a number of steps. The resulting current is a measure of the concentration of glucose. In this case, the electrode is the transducer and the enzyme is the biologically active component.","In particular embodiments, a biosensor combines a biological component with a physicochemical detector component. A typical biosensor comprises: a sensitive biological element (e.g., biological material (tissue, microorganisms, organelles, cell receptors, enzymes, antibodies, nucleic acids, etc.), biologically derived material, biomimic); a physicochemical transducer\/detector element (e.g. optical, piezoelectric, electrochemical) that transforms the signal (i.e. input stimulus) resulting from the interaction of the analyte with the biological element into another signal (i.e. transducers) that may be measured and quantified; and associated electronics or signal processors generating and transmitting a data stream corresponding to the input stimulus. The encapsulation of the biological component in a biosensor may be done by means of a semi-permeable barrier (e.g., a dialysis membrane or hydrogel), a 3D polymer matrix (e.g., by physically or chemically constraining the sensing macromolecule), or by other means.","In particular embodiments, a sensor  may sample input stimulus at discrete times. The sampling rate, sample rate, or sampling frequency defines the number of samples per second (or per other unit) taken from a continuous or semi-continuous stimulus to make a discrete data signal. For time-domain signals, the unit for sampling rate may be 1\/s (Hertz). The inverse of the sampling frequency is the sampling period or sampling interval, which is the time between samples. The sampling rate of a sensor  may be controlled locally, remotely, or both.","In particular embodiments, one or more sensors  in the sensor array  may have a dynamic sampling rate. Dynamic sampling is performed when a decision to change the sampling rate is taken if the current outcome of a process is within or different from some specified value or range of values. As an example and not by way of limitation, if the stimulus is different from the outcome predicted by some model or falls outside some threshold range, the sensor  may increase or decrease its sampling rate in response. Dynamic sampling may be used to optimize the operation of the sensors  or influence the operation of actuators to change the environment.","In particular embodiments, the sampling rate of a sensor  may be based on receipt of a particular stimulus. As an example and not by way of limitation, an accelerometer may have a default sample rate of 1\/s, but may increase its sampling rate to 60\/s whenever it measures a non-zero value, and then may return to a 1\/s sampling rate after getting  consecutive samples equal to zero. As another example and not by way of limitation, if the stimulus measured over a particular range of time does vary significantly, the sensor  may reduce its sampling rate.","In particular embodiments, the sampling rate of a sensor  may be based on input from one or more components of sensor network . As an example and not by way of limitation, a heart rate monitor may have a default sampling rate of 1\/min, but may increase the its sampling rate in response to a signal or instruction from analysis system .","In particular embodiments, one or more sensors  in the sensor array  may increase or decrease the precision at which the sensors  sample input. As an example and not by way of limitation, a glucose monitor may use four bits to record a user's blood glucose level by default. However, if the user's blood glucose level begins varying quickly, the glucose monitor may increase its precision to eight-bit measurements.","In particular embodiments, the stimulus received by a sensor  may be input from a subject (i.e., the user of the sensor). A subject may provide input in a variety of ways. User-input may include, for example, inputting a quantity or value into the sensor, speaking or providing other audio input to the sensor, and touching or providing other stimulus to the sensor. Any client system with a suitable I\/O device may serve as a user-input sensor. Suitable I\/O devices include alphanumeric keyboards, numeric keypads, touch pads, touch screens, input keys, buttons, switches, microphones, pointing devices, navigation buttons, stylus, scroll dial, another suitable I\/O device, or a combination of two or more of these.","In particular embodiments, a sensor  may query the subject to input information into the sensor . In one embodiment, the sensor  may query the subject at static intervals (e.g., every hour). In another embodiment, the sensor  may query the subject at a dynamic rate. The dynamic rate may be based on a variety of factors, including prior input into the sensor , data from other sensors  in sensor array , output from analysis system , etc. As an example and not by way of limitation, if a heart-rate monitor in sensor array  indicates an increase in the subject's heart-rate, a user-input sensor may immediately query the subject to input his current activity.","In particular embodiments, a sensor  may be a data feed. A data feed may be a computing system that receives and aggregates physiological, psychological, behavioral, or environmental data from one or more sources and transmits one or more data streams based on the aggregated data. Alternatively, a data feed may be the one or more data streams based on the aggregated data. As an example and not by way of limitation, data feeds may be stock-market tickers, weather reports, news feeds, traffic-condition updates, public-health notices, electronic calendars, data from one or more other users (such as, for example, physiological, psychological, or behavioral data from another user), or any other suitable data feeds. A data feed may contain both personal and remote data, as discussed previously. A data feed may be any suitable computing device (such as, for example, computer system ).","The example data feeds illustrated and described herein are provided for illustration purposes only and are not meant to be limiting. This disclosure contemplates the use of any suitable data feed.","Data Streams","In particular embodiments, a data stream comprises one or more data transmitted from one or more sensors  in sensor array . A data stream may be a digital or analog signal that may be transmitted over any suitable transmission medium and further used in electronic devices. Sensor array  may transmit one or more data streams based on one or more stimuli to one or more analysis systems  over any suitable network.","A data stream may include signals from a variety of types of sensors , including physiological, psychological, behavioral, and environmental sensors. A sensor  generates a data stream corresponding to the stimulus it receives. As an example and not by way of limitation, a physiological sensor (e.g., an accelerometer) generates a physiological data stream (e.g., an accelerometer data stream, which includes, for example, data on the acceleration of a subject over time).","Sensor data may include any suitable information. In particular embodiments, sensor data includes measurements taken by one or more sensors . Sensor data may include samples that may have any suitable format. In particular embodiments, the format of the samples may be a tuple (or ordered set) that has one or more data parameters, and a particular sample may be a tuple of one or more values for the one or more data parameters. As an example and not by way of limitation, a tuple format (t, p) may have data parameters time t and pressure p, and a particular sample (t, p) may have values pressure p measured at time t. The tuple format may include any suitable data parameters, such as one or more sensor parameters and\/or one or more test parameters. A sensor parameter may correspond to one or more sensors , and a sensor value may record one or more measurements taken by one or more sensors . As an example and not by way of limitation, a sensor value may record a measurement taken by a sensor . A test parameter may correspond to a factor that describes a temporal, spatial, and\/or environmental feature of a measurement process, and a test value may record the value of the feature when the measurements are taken. As an example and not by way of limitation, the parameter may be time and the parameter value may record a particular time at which measurements are taken.","In particular embodiments, a sensor  may transmit one or more data at discrete times. The transmitting rate, transmission rate, or transmitting frequency defines the number of transmissions per second (or per other unit) sent by a sensor to make a discrete data signal. For time-domain signals, the unit for transmitting rate may be 1\/s (Hertz). The inverse of the transmitting frequency is the transmitting period or transmitting interval, which is the time between transmissions. The datum may be transmitted continuously, periodically, randomly, or with any other suitable frequency or period. This may or may not correlate with the sampling rate of the sensor.","Reference to sensor data may encompass a sensor data stream, and vice versa, where appropriate. Sensor data may relate to a sensor subject, wherein the sensor  receives stimulus from or related to the subject. Sensor data or a data stream may relate to a sensor subject in any suitable way. As an example and not by way of limitation, sensor data may relate to a sensor subject because one or more sensors  generated the sensor data from one or more stimuli produced by the sensor subject. As another example and not by way of limitation, sensor data may relate to a sensor subject because the sensor data may provide insight or further understanding of the sensor subject. As yet another example and not by way of limitation, sensor data may relate to a sensor subject because it may help detect or predict the occurrence of one or more problems or events concerning the sensor subject. As yet another example and not by way of limitation, sensor data may relate to a sensor subject because it may facilitate monitoring of the sensor subject.","In particular embodiments, the components of sensor network  may utilize some type of data acquisition system to further process the data stream signal for use by analysis system . As an example and not by way of limitation, a data acquisition system may convert an analog waveforms signal into a digital value. As another example and not by way of limitation, the data acquisition system may convert decimal values into binary values. The data acquisition system may be local, for example, integrated into a sensor  in sensor array  or into local analysis system . The data acquisition system may also be remote, for example, integrated into remote analysis system  or an independent system.","In particular embodiments, the data acquisition system may perform one or more signal conditioning processes (for example, if a signal from a sensor  is not suitable for the type of analysis system  being used). As an example and not by way of limitation, the data acquisition system may amplify, filter, or demodulate the signal. Various other examples of signal conditioning might be bridge completion, providing current or voltage excitation to the sensor, isolation, time-base correction, and linearization. In particular embodiments, single-ended analog signals may be converted to differential signals. In particular embodiments, digital signals may be encoded to reduce and correct transmission errors or downsampled to reduce transmission power requirements.","In particular embodiments, the components of sensor network  may utilize some type of data logging system to record, categorize, store, and file data from one or more data streams over time. The data logging system may be local, for example, integrated into a sensor  in sensor array  or into local analysis system . The data logging system may also be remote, for example, integrated into remote analysis system  or an independent system. The data logging system may also use distributed resources to record data. The data logging system may store data on any suitable data store, such as, for example, data store .","The data logging system may record data streams as one or more data sets. A data set comprises one or more data from a data stream. Data sets may be categorized and formed based on a variety of criteria. As an example and not by way of limitation, a data stream could be recorded as one or more data sets based on the specific subject, sensor, time period, event, or other criteria.","In particular embodiments, one or more data sets from a data stream may be used to construct a binary decision diagram (BDD) representing the data sets.","Binary Decision Diagrams","A binary decision diagram is a data structure that may be used to represent a Boolean function. A BDD may be graphically represented as a rooted, directed, and acyclic graph having one or more internal decision nodes and two terminal nodes. Each decision node represents a different variable of the Boolean function, and is typically denoted as a circle in the graph. The two terminal nodes, a 0 terminal node and a 1 terminal node, are typically denoted as a square each in the graph. Each decision node has two edges, a 0 edge, typically denoted as a dash line or a dotted line in the graph, and a 1 edge, typically denoted as a solid line in the graph. Each edge may be connected to another decision node or to one of the terminal nodes.","Each path in the graph may by formed by one or more decision nodes and their associated edges, and eventually leads to either the 0 terminal node or the 1 terminal node. The decision nodes that form a particular path each represent a different variable of the Boolean function. That is, along a single path, no two decision nodes represent the same variable. A path that leads to the 0 terminal node indicates that the Boolean function evaluates to FALSE for the values assigned to the variables represented by the decision nodes on the path, and a path that leads to the 1 terminal node indicates that the Boolean function evaluates to TRUE for the values assigned to the variables represented by the decision nodes on the path.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0069"},"figref":["FIG. 3A","FIG. 3A"],"b":["300","300","300","1","2","3","300","1","300","2","300","3","300","100"],"sub":["1","2","3","1 ","2 ","3 "]},"A minterm is a logical expression of n variables that employs only the complement operator and the conjunction operator. For a Boolean function of n variables, a minterm is a product term in which each of the n variables appears once, either in a complemented or uncomplemented form. In particular embodiments, each datum from a data set may be represented as a minterm to yield a set of minterms. A characteristic function may be generated from the minterms, the characteristic function indicating whether a given minterm is a member of the set of minterms.","In particular embodiments, a characteristic function \u0192({right arrow over (x)})=1 of a data set S indicates whether a given element (represented by a minterm) is a member of the data set S. As an example and not by way of limitation, a data set from a data stream may be characterized by the Boolean function \u0192({right arrow over (x)}) of a data set S\u2282N , such that \u0192({right arrow over (x)})=1 if and only if {right arrow over (x)} is the binary representation of an element of data set S. For example, for S={1,3}, \u0192(0,0)=\u0192(1,0)=0 and \u0192(0,1)=\u0192(1,1)=1. Similarly, a plurality of data streams from a plurality of sensors may also be characterized by a Boolean function. The data set may comprise a set of tuples of the form S={(t, s, . . . , s)}, where sis the input from sensor j at time instance i. The corresponding Boolean function would be \u0192({right arrow over (t)};{right arrow over (s)}; . . . ; {right arrow over (s)}). As an example and not by way of limitation, sensor array  may comprise sensor A and sensor B. The data streams from sensors A and B may be characterized by the Boolean functions \u0192(t, t, x, x, x) and \u0192(t, t, x, x, x), respectively, where:","(t, t) is a time associated with a sensor measurement,","(x, x, x) is a measurement by sensor A at a given time, and","(x, x, x) is a measurement by sensor B at a given time.","The Boolean functions \u0192and \u0192may be represented by two BDDs, such as BDDand BDD, respectively. Alternatively, the data streams from sensors A and B may be characterized by a single Boolean function \u0192(t, t, x, x, x, x, x, x), which may be represented by a single BDD, such as BDD.","BDD  is not the most optimized representation of the Boolean function as some of the nodes in BDD  are redundant and portions of BDD  are isomorphic. For example, consider paths  and , both of which end at the 0 terminal node. By examining the decision nodes on paths  and , it may be determined that as long as decision node , which represents variable x, branches along its 0 edge, the Boolean function evaluates to FALSE, regardless of along which branch decision node , which represents variable x, proceeds. Thus, decision node  may be replaced by the 0 terminal node. Similarly, paths  and  end at the 1 terminal node. By examining the decision nodes on these two paths, it may be determined that as long as decision node , which represents variable x, branches along its 1 edge, the Boolean function evaluates to TRUE, regardless of along which branches decision node , which represents variable x, proceeds. Thus, decision node  may be replaced by the 1 terminal node. As another example, consider decision nodes  and , which both represent variable x. Decision nodes  and  both have their 0 edge leading to the 0 terminal node and their 1 edge leading to the 1 terminal node. Therefore, they are duplicates or isomorphic to each other. Thus, one of them may be removed from BDD .  illustrates an example BDD  representing the same Boolean function as repressed by BDD , but is more optimized than BDD  because it uses fewer nodes to represent the same Boolean function as a result of removing the redundant decision nodes and the isomorphic portions of BDD .","A BDD whose redundant decision nodes and isomorphic sub-graphs have been removed and whose decision nodes appear in the same order from the root to the terminal nodes along all the paths in the BDD is referred to as a reduced ordered binary decision diagram (ROBDD). The advantage of a ROBDD is that it is canonical for a particular function and variable order, which makes it useful in various types of practical applications, such as in functional equivalence checking and functional technology mapping.","A ROBDD has two important properties. First, the ROBDD is ordered. That is, there is a fixed order \u03c0{1, . . . , n}\u2192{x, . . . , x} such that for any non-terminal node v, index(low(v))=\u03c0(k) with k>\u03c0(index(v)) and index(high(v))=\u03c0(q) with q>\u03c0(index(v)) hold if low(v) and high(v) are also non-terminal nodes, where index(v) denotes the index of the variable associated with node v, low(v) corresponds to the case where the variable associated with node v is assigned 0, and high(v) corresponds to the case where the variable associated with node v is assigned 1. Second, the ROBDD is reduced. That is, there exists no non-terminal node v\u03b5V with low(v)=high(v) and there are no two non-terminal nodes v and v\u2032 such that the sub-BDDs rooted by v and v\u2032 are isomorphic. Note that a non-terminal node is a decision node. For example, in , BDD  has three layers as it represents a Boolean function having three variables. Since BDD  is ordered, each layer contains the decision nodes that correspond to a particular variable. For example, layer  contains the decision nodes corresponding to variable xonly, and does not contain any decision node corresponding to another variable (e.g., xor x).","In additional to BDDs and ROBDDs, other examples of BDDs include partitioned ordered binary decision diagrams (POBDDs), zero-suppressed decision diagrams (ZDDs), nano binary decision diagrams (nanoDDs), zero-suppressed nano binary decision diagrams (nanoZDDs), or other suitable binary decision diagrams. Although this disclosure discusses using particular BDDs in particular, this disclosure contemplates using any suitable type of BDD in any suitable applications.","BDDs have many practical applications, and the various algorithms disclosed in the present disclosure may be used with BDDs of any applications. As an example and not by way of limitation, in the field integrated circuit (IC) design, an IC may be used to implement a function, which may be represented by a BDD. Sometimes, a property that an IC design needs to satisfy may be represented by a BDD, which may then be used with in connection with formally verifying the design of the circuit. In the field of healthcare, BDDs may be used to represent data collected by medical sensors. A BDD, or more specifically, the data that forms the BDD, may be stored in a computer-readable non-transitory storage medium. When the variables of the BDD are processed using any of the algorithms described in this disclosure, the data is transformed as embodied by the computer-readable non-transitory storage medium.","In particular embodiments, any set of integers may be represented as a Boolean function, and the Boolean function may be represented by a BDD. Given a set of integers, particular embodiments may determine the minimum number of bits required to represent the largest integer in the set. This number of bits is the number of variables of the Boolean function. Then, for each integer in the set the Boolean function evaluates to TRUE, and for any integer not in the set the Boolean function evaluates to FALSE.","In particular embodiments, a BDD may be used to represent one or more data sets from one or more data streams. Each path in the BDD that leads to the 1 terminal node indicates that the value (i.e., the data point) represented by all the decision nodes along that path belongs to the data set. Similarly, each path in the BDD that leads to the 0 terminal node indicates that the value represented by all the decision nodes along that path is not included in the data set.","To represent a data set using a BDD, the minimum number of variables needed for the BDD equals the minimum number of bits needed to represent the largest value (i.e., data point) in the data set. As an example and not by way of limitation, consider a data set comprising a set of integers, {, , , }. The largest integer in the set is 7, which requires 3 bits. Thus, the Boolean function used to represent this set of integers requires three variables x, x, and x. The following table illustrates the values of the three variables and the Boolean function as they are used to represent {3, 5, 6, 7}:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0085","num":"0084"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"91pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"84pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},"Binary Value",{}]},{"entry":["Decimal Value","x, x, x","f(x, x, x)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["0","0 0 0","0"]},{"entry":["1","0 0 1","0"]},{"entry":["2","0 1 0","0"]},{"entry":["3","0 1 1","1"]},{"entry":["4","1 0 0","0"]},{"entry":["5","1 0 1","1"]},{"entry":["6","1 1 0","1"]},{"entry":["7","1 1 1","1"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"The function \u0192(x, x, x) may be represented by BDD  illustrated in  or BDD  illustrated in .","In particular embodiments, one or more components of sensor network  may store one or more BDDs in a BDD library. The BDD library may include any suitable information about a BDD, such as, for example, node structure, each binary variable, indices to the nodes that correspond to the two possible evaluations of the variables, complementation of the indices, or other suitable information about the BDD. In particular embodiments, the BDD library may store the information compactly. As an example and not by way of limitation, a BDD library may maintain the indices and variable identifiers as a function of the size of the BDD. The BDD may have at most k nodes throughout some or all manipulations performed by BDD library. Each node of the BDD may be labeled with one of at most v variable identifiers. The indices to nodes therefore require at most \u250c log(v)\u2510 bits to index any variable. The node therefore requires only 2\u00b7\u250c log(k)\u2510+\u250c log(v)\u2510 bits. In addition, two bits may be reserved, one bit used to identify complemented edges (allowing the representation of a function as well as its negation by a single node) and another bit used as a general mark bit used during garbage collection. Values for v and k may be determined in any suitable manner. For example, a user may specify v and a default k value may be used initially. When the address space allowed by the default k value is exhausted, the k value may be increased and the node table may be rebuilt. In another example, maximum values for v and k may be assumed.","In particular embodiments, one or more components of sensor network  may store sensor data as one or more BDDs. One or more sensors  in sensor array  may take a plurality of samples (i.e., receive a plurality of stimuli) and produce a data set S based on the samples. In particular embodiments, each sample comprises a tuple of one or more sensor values. Each sensor value records one or more stimuli received by one or more sensors. Data set S may be generated in any suitable manner. In particular embodiments, time may be quantized according to the sampling frequency of the sensor  or for desired accuracy. For each time t, set S of sensor values is obtained to yield S={(t, q, . . . , q)}, where qis the quantized input from sensor j at time instance i. Each sample is represented as a minterm. In particular embodiments, one or more variables may be allocated to each data value of a sample. As an example and not by way of limitation, Nt variables may be allocated for time, Ns1 variables may be allocated for a first sensor, and Ns2 variables may be allocated for a second sensor. Therefore, a sample would correspond to a minterm of the form t. . . t\u00b7s. . . s\u00b7s. . . s. For example, if Nt=16, Ns1=8, and Ns2=8, then a sample would correspond to a minterm of the form t. . . t\u00b7s. . . s\u00b7s. . . s. Each sensor sample may be expressed as a binary number using the allocated variables. In the example, a subset of S may be {(1,70,3), (2,70,3), (3,70,4)}. The related minterms are:","0000000000000001\u00b701000110\u00b700000011,","0000000000000010\u00b701000110\u00b700000011,","0000000000000011\u00b701000110\u00b700000100.","In particular embodiments, a characteristic function \u0192may be generated from a set of minterms. The characteristic function \u0192may be generated in any suitable manner. As an example and not by way of limitation, a logical operation may be applied to the minterms to generate characteristic function \u0192. This disclosure contemplates any generating characteristic functions using suitable logical operations. As an example and not by way of limitation, a logical operation may include AND, OR, XOR, NOT, or a combination of two or more of these. Applying a logical OR operation to a number of operands yields the logical OR of the operands. The corresponding characteristic function \u0192({right arrow over (t)};{right arrow over (s)};{right arrow over (s)}) is the logical OR of all minterms. A characteristic function \u0192may be updated to include additional data sets in any suitable manner. As an example and not by way of limitation, a new data set may be represented as a new set of minterms, and a logical OR operation may be applied to the characteristic function \u0192and the new set of minterms to yield an updated characteristic function \u0192.","A characteristic function \u0192may be reported in any suitable manner. As an example and not by way of limitation, display system  may facilitate display of characteristic function \u0192at a suitable I\/O device.","Analysis","Analysis system  may monitor, store, and analyze one or more data streams from one or more sensors  in sensor array . A data stream from a sensor  may be transmitted to analysis system  over any suitable medium. Analysis system  may transmit one or more analysis outputs based on the one or more data streams to one or more other components of sensor network , such as, for example, sensors , other analysis systems , or display systems . Analysis system  may be any suitable computing device, such as, for example, computer system .","In particular embodiments, analysis system  may comprise one or more local analysis systems  or one or more remote analysis systems . Where analysis system  comprises multiple subsystems (e.g., local analysis system  and remote analysis system ), processing and analysis of the data streams may occur in series or in parallel. As an example and not by way of limitation, analysis system  may receive identical data streams from a sensor  at both local analysis system  and remote analysis system . As another example and not by way of limitation, analysis system  may receive a data stream at local analysis system , which may process the data stream and then transmit a modified data stream\/analysis output to remote analysis system .","In particular embodiments, analysis system  may access and analyze one or more data sets from a data stream. Analysis system  may analyze a data stream in real-time as it is received from sensor array , or it may store the data stream after it is received from sensor array  for subsequently processing the data stream. Analysis system  may use any suitable process, calculation, or technique to analyze a data stream. As an example and not by way of limitation, analysis system  may perform a variety of processes and calculations, including ranging, inspecting, cleaning, filtering, transforming, modeling, normalizing, averaging, annotating, correlating, or contextualizing data. As another example and not by way of limitation, analysis system  may use a variety of data analysis techniques, including data mining, data fusion, distributed database processing, or artificial intelligence. These techniques may be applied to analyze various data streams and to generate correlations and conclusions based on the data. Analysis system  may analyze a plurality of data streams to determine if the data streams are related. A relationship between data streams may include, for example, correlations, causal relationships, dependent relationships, reciprocal relationships, data equivalence, another suitable relationship, or two or more such relationship. In particular embodiments, analysis system  may access or generate one or more BDDs representing one or more data streams and perform a variety of processes and calculations on the BDDs. Although this disclosure describes analysis system  performing particular analytical processes using particular techniques, this disclosure contemplates analysis system  performing any suitable analytical processes using any suitable techniques.","In particular embodiments, analysis system  may generate models based on one or more data streams. A model is a means for describing a system or object. As an example and not by way of limitation, a model may be a data set, function, algorithm, differential equation, chart, table, decision tree, binary decision diagram, simulation, another suitable model, or two or more such models. A model may describe a variety of systems or objects, including one or more aspects of one or more persons' physiology, psychology, behavior, or environment. Although this disclosure describes particular components generating particular models, this disclosure contemplates any suitable components generating any suitable models. Moreover, although this disclosure describes generating particular models using particular techniques, this disclosure contemplates generating any suitable models using any suitable techniques.","Analysis system  may generate models that are empirical, theoretical, linear, nonlinear, deterministic, probabilistic, static, dynamic, heterogeneous, or homogenous. Analysis system  may generate models that fit one or more data points using a variety of techniques, including, for example, curve fitting, model training, interpolation, extrapolation, statistical modeling, nonparametric statistics, differential equations, etc.","Analysis system  may generate models of various types, including baseline models, statistical models, predictive models, etc. A baseline model is a model that serves as a basis for comparison, and is typically generated using controlled data (i.e., baseline data) over a specified period (i.e., a control period). The control period may be any suitable period. As an example and not by way of limitation, a baseline model of a subject's blood pressure may simply be the subject's average blood pressure calculated from a series of blood-pressure measurements taken over the course of a week by a blood-pressure monitor. A predictive model is a mathematical function (or set of functions) that describe the behavior of a system or object in terms of one or more independent variables. As an example and not by way of limitation, a predictive model that may be used to calculate a physiological state based on one or more actual sensor measurements. A type of predictive model is a statistical model, which is a mathematical function (or set of functions) that describe the behavior of an object of study in terms of random variables and their associated probability distributions. One of the most basic statistical models is the simple linear regression model, which assumes a linear relationship between two measured variables. As an example and not by way of limitation, analysis system  may compare data from a pulse oximeter and a barometer and identify a linear correlation between a subject's blood-oxygen level and the barometric pressure at the subject's location. In particular embodiments, a predictive model may be used as a baseline model, wherein the predictive model was generated using controlled data over a specified period.","In particular embodiments, analysis system  may generate a model by normalizing or averaging one or more data streams. As an example and not by way of limitation, a model of a data stream from a single sensor  could simply be the average sensor measurement made by the sensor  over some initialization period. As another example and not by way of limitation, a model could be a single sensor measurement made during a control period.","In particular embodiments, analysis system  may generate a model by fitting one or more data sets to a mathematical function. As an example and not by way of limitation, a model could be an algorithm based on sensor measurements made by one or more sensors over some control period. The model may include a variety of variables, including data from one or more data streams and one or more fixed variables. The following is an example algorithm that analysis system  could generate to model a system or object:\n\n\u0192=\u0192()\n","where:\n\n","In particular embodiments, the model may be used to predict hypothetical sensor measurements in theoretical or experimental systems. In particular embodiments, the model may be used to determine or categorize a subject's physiological or psychological state. As an example and not by way of limitation, the model may determine a subject's risk for a certain disease state with an abstract or statistical result. The model could simply identify the subject as being at \u201chigh risk\u201d of developing a disease, or identify the subject as being 80% likely to develop the disease. As another example and not by way of limitation, the model may determine a subject's severity or grade of a disease state.","In particular embodiments, one or more sensors  in sensor array  may continuously transmit data regarding a subject's health to analysis system , which may monitor and automatically detect changes in the subject's health state. As used herein, \u201chealth state\u201d refers to a person's physiological and psychological state, including the person's state with respect to pathologies and diseases. By using an integrated sensor array  to monitor physiological, psychological, behavioral, and environmental data, analysis system  may identify pathologies, disease states, sensitivities, and other health-related states with greater accuracy than is possible with any individual sensor .","In particular embodiments, one or more sensors  in sensor array  may measure one or more biomarkers. A biomarker is a characteristic that can be measured and evaluated as an indicator of biological processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic responses. As an example and not by way of limitation, in a pharmacogenomic context, a biomarker would be a specific genetic variation that correlates with drug response. As another example and not by way of limitation, in a neurochemical context, a biomarker would be a person's subjective stress level that correlates with the person's plasma glucocorticoid level. As yet another example and not by way of limitation, in a neuropsychological context, a biomarker would be a person's serotonin uptake rate that correlates with the person's depression level. As yet another example and not by way of limitation, in a biochemical context, a biomarker would be a person's LDL cholesterol level that correlates with the person's risk of heart disease, such as heart attack. A biomarker is effectively a surrogate for measuring another physiological or psychological characteristic. A biomarker may include any type of stimulus, including physiological, psychological, behavioral, or environmental stimulus.","In particular embodiments, analysis system  may identify pathologies, disease states, and other health states of a subject. Certain physiological, psychological, behavioral, or environmental data may correlate with certain pathologies, disease states, and other health states. As an example and not by way of limitation, analysis system  could determine whether a subject has hypertension by monitoring a blood pressure data stream for a three week period and identifying substantial periods where the subject's blood pressure is at least 140\/90 mmHg, wherein these substantial periods of elevated blood pressure constitute hypertension. The accuracy of identification may generally be increased as the number of data streams is increased. Analysis system  may contextualize and correlate data from multiple data streams to eliminate confounders from its data analysis and reduce the likelihood of generating false-positive and false-negative disease-state diagnoses. As an example and not by way of limitation, the hypertension diagnosis system described above may generate a false-positive diagnosis of hypertension if the subject engages in lengthy periods of physical activity, which naturally raise the subject's blood pressure. Therefore, if analysis system  also monitored a heart-rate data stream of the subject, it could eliminate blood pressure data sets that correlate with time periods of high heart-rate, thereby reducing the likelihood of generating an incorrect hypertension diagnosis.","In particular embodiments, analysis system  may analyze physiological, psychological, behavioral and environmental data steams to identify correlations between certain data sets and a subject's health state. As an example and not by way of limitation, analysis system  may be able to correlate a behavioral data set indicating the subject had a fight with a physiological data set indicating the subject had an elevated heart-rate to identify the fight as the cause of the elevated heart-rate. As another example and not by way of limitation, analysis system  may be able to correlate a physiological data set indicating the subject had an elevated skin temperature with a behavioral data set indicating the subject was engaged in physical activity to identify the physical activity as the cause of the elevated skin temperature. As yet another example and not by way of limitation, analysis system  may be able to correlate a psychological data set indicating the subject is depressed with an environmental data set indicating that the subject's stock portfolio substantially declined just prior to the onset of the subject's depression to identify the stock decline as the cause of the subject's depression. Analysis system  may use a variety of methods to identify correlations and generate causality hypotheses.","In particular embodiments, analysis system  may generate a model of a subject's health state. As an example and not by way of limitation, analysis system  may generate a baseline model of the subject's physiological or psychological state by analyzing one or more data streams during a control period. Once the baseline model is established, analysis system  could then continuously monitor the subject and identify deviations, variability, or changes in the data streams as compared to the baseline model. As another example and not by way of limitation, analysis system  may generate a predictive model of the subject's physiological or psychological state by analyzing one or more data streams and generating one or more algorithms that fit the sensor measurements. Once the predictive model is established, analysis system  could then be used to predict future health states, anticipated or hypothetical sensor readings, and other aspects of a subject's physiology or psychology. Analysis system  may also update and refine the predictive model based on new data generated by sensor array .","In particular embodiments, analysis system  may monitor disease-state progression and other health state changes over time. As an example and not by way of limitation, analysis system  could continuously monitor a subject's blood pressure over time to determine whether the subject's hypertension is improving. Such monitoring may be used to identify trends and to generate alerts or predictions regarding possible health states. Similarly, analysis system  may also monitor data streams containing treatment or therapy information to determine whether the treatment or therapy is efficacious. As an example and not by way of limitation, analysis system  could monitor a subject's blood pressure over time to determine whether an ACE inhibitor treatment is affecting the subject's hypertension.","In particular embodiments, analysis system  may monitor and analyze various data streams from a group of people to identify novel pre-disease states or risk states. As an example and not by way of limitation, one or more sensor arrays  could monitor a plurality of subjects. As multiple subjects develop certain diseases, analysis system  could analyze data sets from these subjects prior their development of the disease. The analysis of these data sets could allow analysis system  to identify certain health states that correlate with some level of risk for developing the disease.","Combining\/Partitioning Medical Binary Decision Diagrams for Analysis Optimization","In particular embodiments, sensor network  may construct one or more BDDs for analysis optimization from one or more other BDDs. Analysis optimization refers to increasing the speed or efficiency of an analytical process. As an example and not by way of limitation, sensor network  may partition a BDD into a plurality of sub-BDDs based on ease-of analysis. As another example and not by way of limitation, sensor network  may combine one or more portions of a plurality of BDDs into a new BDD based on ease-of-analysis. Although this disclosure describes particular components performing particular processes to construct one or more BDDs for analysis optimization from one or more other BDDs, this disclosure contemplates using any suitable components to construct one or more BDDs for analysis optimization from one or more other BDDs.","In particular embodiments, analysis system  may access one or more BDDs representing one or more data streams from a plurality of sensors . Each data stream may comprise a plurality of components.  illustrates an example data stream with a plurality of components. As an example and not by way of limitation, analysis system  may access a BDD representing the data stream illustrated in , which is a schematic of a single interval of a typical electrocardiograph (ECG) wave measuring the microvoltages in a heart muscle over time. Although  illustrates a single ECG wave in a data stream, this disclosure contemplates any suitable number of ECG waves in the data stream. The components of an ECG wave may include a PR interval, a QT interval, a PR segment, a QRS complex, and a ST segment. A component of a data stream may overlap in whole or in part with another component of the data stream. As an example and not by way of limitation, the ST segment overlaps in whole with the QT interval. Although this disclosure describes and  illustrates a particular data stream with particular components, this disclosure contemplates any suitable data stream with any suitable components. A BDD representing a data stream may comprise a plurality of portions, wherein each portion represents one component of the data stream. A portion of a BDD may include a path or set of paths in the BDD. As an example and not by way of limitation, the ECG wave illustrated in  may be represented by a BDD, such as BDD, and each component of the ECG wave may be represented by a portion of BDD. Each portion of a BDD may be represented by a sub-BDD that represents the component of the data stream represented by the portion. As an example and not by way of limitation, the PR interval, QT interval, PR segment, QRS complex, and ST segment may be represented by BDDs BDD, BDD, BDD, BDD, and BDD, respectively, which are sub-BDDs of BDD. Although this disclosure describes accessing particular BDDs representing particular data streams, this disclosure contemplates accessing any suitable BDDs representing any suitable data streams. Moreover, although this disclosure describes particular components accessing BDDs, this disclosure contemplates any suitable components accessing BDDs.","In particular embodiments, analysis system  may identify the components in a data stream. The components of a data stream may be identified in any suitable manner. In particular embodiments, analysis system  may identify components in a data stream based on the structural characteristics of the data stream. A structural characteristic of a data stream may be a structural characteristics of a waveform of a signal outputted by a sensor , a periodicity of a waveform of a signal outputted by a sensor , an identifier embedded in the data stream defining a component, another suitable structural characteristics, or two or more such structural characteristics. As an example and not by way of limitation, a component of an ECG wave may be identified based on structural characteristics of the waveform outputted by an electrocardiograph. Referring to , the PR segment may be identified as the component of the heart wave between the P wave and the QRS complex. The structure of P wave and the QRS complex can be defined by the shape of the components (i.e., the microvoltage versus time curve). As another example and not by way of limitation, a component of an ECG wave may be identified based on the periodicity of the waveform outputted by an electrocardiograph. Referring to , the periodicity of the waveform can be defined by the interval between an R wave and the next R wave (the RR interval), which is the inverse of the heart rate and occurs regularly. As yet another example and not by way of limitation, a component of an ECG wave may be identified based on an identifier embedded in the data stream defining the component. Referring to , an electrocardiograph may embed an identifier in the waveform, such as, for example, a peak after the T wave, to identify the end of the heart wave. In particular embodiments, analysis system  may identify components in a data stream based on the functional characteristics of the data stream. A functional characteristic of a data stream may be a rate of change of a waveform of a signal outputted by a sensor , minimum and\/or maximum values of a waveform of a signal outputted by a sensor , another suitable functional characteristic, or two or more such functional characteristics. In particular embodiments, analysis system  may identify components in a data stream based on predefined component definitions provided by a user or another suitable source. As an example and not by way of limitation, a component of an ECG wave may be specified by a user. Referring to , a user may define a \u201cPT interval\u201d that consists of the PR segment, the QRS complex, and the ST segment. Although this disclosure describes identifying particular components in particular data streams, this disclosure contemplates identifying any suitable components in any suitable data streams. Moreover, although this disclosure describes particular processes for identifying components in a data stream, this disclosure contemplates any suitable processes for identifying components in a data stream.","In particular embodiments, analysis system  may select one or more portions from a plurality of portions in one or more BDDs based on ease-of-analysis. Ease-of-analysis refers to modifying one or more data sets to increase the speed or efficiency of an analytical process that references the data sets. Data sets may be modified for ease-of-analysis by combining, partitioning, compressing, restructuring, consolidating, adjusting, reorganizing, rewriting, annotating, or otherwise suitably modifying the data sets. As an example and not by way of limitation, an ease-of-analysis decomposition may refer to decomposing a BDD representing the ECG wave of  into BDDs representing the major components of the ECG signal, such as the PR interval, the QRS complex, and the QT interval. In particular embodiments, ease-of-analysis may be with respect to a particular analytic process. Analysis system  may receive information describing a particular analytical process and then identify one or more components from one or more data streams needed for the particular analytical process. Analysis system  may then select the portions of a BDD that represent the identified components. As an example and not by way of limitation, analysis system  may receive information describing an analytical process to determine the heart rate of a person. Referring to , the interval between an R wave and the next R wave (the RR interval) is the inverse of the heart rate. Analysis system  may identify the QRS complexes as the component of data stream needed to determine the heart rate of the person, and additional components of the data stream are not needed. Analysis system  may then select the portions of the BDD that represent the QRS complexes.","In particular embodiments, ease-of-analysis may be with respect to the compression rate achieved by constructing a sub-BDD from the selected component. A higher compression rate may lead to faster manipulation of a dataset and therefore easier analysis, however such a correlation is not always present or necessary. As an example and not by way of limitation, analysis system  may be able to achieve a higher compression rate by constructing sub-BDDs from various components of an ECG wave compared to storing the ECG wave as a single BDD.

A data set Smay be represented as a BDD, such as BDD. Analysis system  may then apply a logical OR operation to the empty BDD and BDDto generate a BDD representing the data set. As analysis system  receives additional data sets S, it may iteratively add the data sets to the BDD in any suitable matter. As an example and not by way of limitation, an additional data set Smay be represented as another BDD, such as BDD, and a logical OR operation may be applied to the BDD and BDDto yield an updated BDD. Although this disclosure describes constructing a BDD using particular components and particular processes, this disclosure contemplates constructing BDDs using any suitable components and any suitable processes. Furthermore, although this disclosure describes iteratively adding data from one or more data sets to a BDD using particular components and particular processes, this disclosure contemplates iteratively adding data from one or more data sets to a BDD using any suitable components and any suitable processes.","In particular embodiments, analysis system  may analyze a BDD to determine the compression rate of the BDD. The compression rate may be defined as the ratio of the space required to store a data set as tuples in consecutive, binary form over the space required to store a BDD representing the data set. Analysis system  may analyze the BDD at any suitable time and with any suitable frequency. As an example and not by way of limitation, analysis system  may analyze the BDD after each iterative addition of data, at specified time intervals, or at another suitable time. In particular embodiments, analysis system  may optimize the size of the BDD before determining its compression rate. As an example and not by way of limitation, analysis system  may optimize the size of the BDD using variable reordering. Although this disclosure describes determining the compression rate of a BDD using particular components and particular processes, this disclosure contemplates determining the compression rate of a BDD using any suitable components and any suitable processes.","In particular embodiments, once the compression rate of a BDD drops below a threshold compression rate, analysis system  may use additional bits to encode each of the one or more nodes of the BDD. The threshold compression rate for a BDD is the point where the addition of new data sets to the BDD would cause the compression rate of the BDD to substantially decrease. As an example and not by way of limitation, for a BDD with k bits representing the 0 edges and k bits representing the 1 edges of the BDD, the threshold compression rate is when the number of nodes in the BDD is less than or equal to 2\u22121. As analysis system  adds additional data sets to a BDD, the compression rate of the BDD may continue to increase until a certain number of samples have been added to the BDD. Once a certain amount of data has been added to the BDD, all the address space allowed by the current structure of the BDD will be exhausted. In order to continue adding additional data sets to the BDD, analysis system  would need to add additional nodes to the BDD, which may cause the compression rate to substantially decrease. As an example and not by way of limitation, a BDD may comprise one or more nodes, and each of the one or more nodes may be encoded using n bits. If the compression rate of the BDD drops below the threshold compression rate, then analysis system  may encode each of the one or more nodes of the BDD using n+d bits. This process may be repeated to encode the nodes of the BDD using an additional d bits each time the threshold compression rate of the BDD drops below the threshold compression rate. Although this disclosure describes particular threshold compression rates for particular BDDs, this disclosure contemplates any suitable threshold compression rate for any suitable BDD. Moreover, although this disclosure describes encoding the nodes of a BDD in a particular manner, this disclosure contemplates encoding the nodes of a BDD in any suitable manner.","In particular embodiments, once a (first) BDD reaches a threshold compression rate, analysis system  may generate a new (second) BDD to store additional data sets. As an example and not by way of limitation, analysis system  may iteratively add data from one or more data sets to the first BDD until the compression rate of the first BDD reaches the threshold compression rate. Analysis system  may then stop iteratively adding data to the first BDD and construct a second BDD to store additional data sets. The second BDD may be constructed in any suitable manner. As an example and not by way of limitation, analysis system  may generate an empty BDD with k bits representing the 0 edges and k bits representing the 1 edges of the BDD. A data set Smay be represented as a BDD, such as BDD. Analysis system  may then apply a logical OR operation to the empty BDD and BDDto generate the second BDD. As analysis system  receives additional data sets S, it may iteratively add the data sets to the second BDD in any suitable matter. As an example and not by way of limitation, an additional data set Smay be represented as another BDD, such as BDD, and a logical OR operation may be applied to the second BDD and BDDto yield an updated second BDD. In some embodiments, the first BDD and the second BDD may both have k bits representing the 0 edges and k bits representing the 1 edges of the BDD. Although this disclosure describes generating a second BDD once a first BDD reaches a threshold compression rate using particular components and particular processes, this disclosure contemplates generating a second BDD once a first BDD reaches a threshold compression rate using any suitable components and any suitable processes.

Although this disclosure describes particular components performing particular processes to analyze and monitor the compression rate of a BDD representing a data stream from a sensor to determine if the sensor is malfunctioning, this disclosure contemplates using any suitable components and any suitable processes to analyze and monitor the compression rate of a BDD representing a data stream from a sensor to determine if the sensor is malfunctioning.","In particular embodiments, analysis system  may receive one or more data sets for storage as a BDD, construct a BDD representing the data sets, and iteratively add data sets to the BDD as they are received. The BDD may be constructed and data may be iteratively added to the BDD in any suitable manner, including using the components and processes described previously. In one embodiment, one or more of the data sets may be from one or more data streams from one or more sensors  in sensor array .","In particular embodiments, analysis system  may analyze a BDD to determine the compression rate of the BDD. The compression rate may be determined in any suitable manner, including using the components and processes described previously. Analysis system  may analyze the BDD at any suitable time and with any suitable frequency. As an example and not by way of limitation, analysis system  may analyze the BDD after each iterative addition of data, at specified time intervals, or at another suitable time. Analysis system  may also optimize the size of the BDD before determining its compression rate. Optimizing the size of a BDD may be performed using any suitable process, including using the processes described previously.","In particular embodiments, a BDD representing a data stream from a sensor  may have a specified compression-rate range, wherein the specified compression-rate range represents the range of BDD compression rates that indicate a sensor  is operating as specified (such as, for example, operating normally, as expected, within specifications, etc.). The specified compression-rate range may be based on a variety of factors, such as, for example, the sensor type, the sensor subject, the sensor sample rate, the BDD structure or type, the number of samples stored by the BDD, other suitable factors, or two or more such factors. A compression-rate range has a lower and upper bound. The lower bound is the minimum compression rate in the range, while the upper bound is the maximum compression rate in the range. As an example and not by way of limitation, as BDD may have a specified compression-rate range with a lower bound of 2\u00d7 and an upper bound of 100\u00d7. This range may represent the lower and upper bound of the normal compression rate for a BDD representing a particular data stream from a particular sensor .","In particularly embodiments, the specified compression-rate range has a lower bound equal to approximately the compression rate achieved when constructing a BDD representing random noise. The compression rate for random noise (such as, for example, a series of random numbers or white noise) is approximately 2\u00d7. As an example and not by way of limitation, the specified compression rate may have a lower bound equal to 2\u00d7, \u00d7, \u00d7, \u00d7, \u00d7, \u00d7, \u00d7, \u00d7, \u00d7, \u00d7, \u00d7, \u00d7, \u00d7, \u00d7, \u00d7, \u00d7, \u00d7, or another suitable compression rate. If a sensor  is malfunctioning, it may begin transmitting incorrect or random values, which may cause the compression rate of the BDD to decline.","In particular embodiments, the specified compression-rate range has an upper bound equal to approximately the compression rate achieved when constructing a BDD representing a single continuously repeating number. The compression rate for a single repeating number depends on the number of samples received, will continuously increase with no upper bound. As an example and not by way of limitation, the specified compression rate may have an upper bound equal to 5\u00d7, \u00d7, \u00d7, \u00d7, \u00d7, \u00d7, \u00d7, \u00d7, \u00d7, \u00d7, \u00d7, \u00d7, \u00d7, \u00d7, \u00d7, \u00d7, \u00d7, \u00d7, \u00d7, \u00d7, \u00d7, \u00d7, \u00d7, or another suitable compression rate. If a sensor  is malfunctioning, it may begin transmitting the same value regularly, repetitively, or continuously for unusually long periods of time. A BDD storing this data may have an abnormally large compression rate that is significantly higher than the compression rate found for a typical data stream from the sensor , which may indicate that the data is invalid or faulty. As an example and not by way of limitation, if heart-rate monitor outputs a heart-rate of 60 bpm for 16 hours, analysis system  may generate a single node BDD with a high compression rate that exceeds the upper bound of the specified compression-rate range for the heart-rate monitor.","In particular embodiments, analysis system  may indicate a sensor malfunction in a sensor  if the compression rate of a BDD representing a data stream from the sensor  deviates from a specified compression-rate range. A sensor malfunction may be indicated if the compression rate of the BDD either drops below the lower bound or rises above the upper bound of the specified compression-rate range. A sensor malfunction may be caused by a variety of factors. As an example and not by way of limitation, sensor malfunctions may include: transmission of invalid data sets from the sensor  (for example, if the data is corrupted during transmission); receipt of invalid stimulus by the sensor  (for example, if the sensor  become detached from the subject); a software error in a component of sensor network ; a hardware malfunction in the sensor ; another suitable malfunction; or two or more such malfunctions. Analysis system  may determine the type of the sensor malfunction using any suitable process.","In particular embodiments, analysis system  may differentiate between BDD compression rate changes caused by a sensor malfunctions and changes caused by a subject's activity. As an example and not by way of limitation, if a subject starts exercising, an EKG sensor worn by the subject may begin outputting a heart wave with a shortened periodicity. However, the shape of the heart wave will generally be the same and should stabilize at some point. The specified compression-rate range for a BDD may be set to account for these normal or expected deviations in BDD compression rate cause by a subject's activity.","In particular embodiments, after indicating a sensor malfunction in a first sensor  in sensor array , analysis system  may analyze a BDD representing a data stream from a second sensor  in sensor array  to verify that the first sensor  is truly malfunctioning. If the compression rate of the BDD representing the data stream from the first sensor  deviates from the specified compression-rate range, it may indicate that the data stream is abnormal and the first sensor  is malfunctioning, but it may be desirable to corroborate or verify that first sensor  is malfunctioning before sounding an alarm or transmitting the indication to display system . As an example and not by way of limitation, analysis system  may access a (second) BDD representing a data stream from a second sensor  in sensor array  and analyze the second BDD to determine the compression rate of the BDD. The second BDD may have a specified compression-rate range representing the range of BDD compression rates that indicate the second sensor  is operating as specified. If the compression rate of the second BDD is within the specified compression-rate range, analysis system  may verify the indication of a sensor malfunction with respect to the first sensor . However, if the compression rate of the second BDD is not within the specified compression-rate range, analysis system  may negate the indication of a sensor malfunction with respect to the first sensor . In the latter case, where both the first and second BDDs deviate from their specified compression-rate ranges, analysis system  may not be able to determine if there is an actual sensor malfunction. For example, both the first and second sensors  may be malfunctioning. Alternatively, analysis system  could be malfunctioning. Analysis of other BDDs representing other data streams from other sensors  in sensor array  may be performed to verify the sensor malfunctions.","In particular embodiments, analysis system  may analyze a BDD to determine the rate of change of the compression rate of the BDD. The rate of change of the compression rate may be determined in any suitable manner, including using components and processes described previously. Analysis system  may then indicate a sensor malfunction in a sensor  if the compression rate of a BDD representing a data stream from the sensor  deviates from a specified rate of change of compression-rate range. A sensor malfunction may be indicated if the rate of change of the compression rate of the BDD either drops below the lower bound or rises above the upper bound of the specified rate of change of compression-rate range. As an example and not by way of limitation, a BDD with a compression rate that is changing rapidly may be indicative of a sensor malfunction.","Indications of a sensor malfunction may be reported in any suitable manner.

Although this disclosure describes detecting data corruption in BDDs using particular components, this disclosure contemplates detecting data corruption in BDDs using any suitable components. Furthermore, although this disclosure describes particular hashing techniques, this disclosure contemplates using any suitable hashing techniques.","In particular embodiments, a first component of sensor network  may access a first instance of a BDD and transform the first instance of the BDD to a first arithmetic function by performing an arithmetic transformation on the first instance of the BDD. In one embodiment, the first instance of the BDD may represent one or more data sets from one or more data streams from one or more sensors  in sensor array . A BDD may be transformed in any suitable manner. As an example and not by way of limitation, the arithmetic transformation may be performed according to one or more of the following rules:\n\nAND \n\nOR \n\nNOT()\u21921\n\nAND (idempotence)\u2192\n","A \u201c\u2192\u201d represents \u201cis transformed to\u201d, AND represents a logical AND, OR represents a logical OR, NOT represents a logical negation, X AND X represents idempotence, \u00d7 represents multiplication, + represents addition, and a superscript represents an exponent.

In particular embodiments, if the finite integer field has a size p, the arithmetic is performed modulo p. Although this disclosure describes transforming a BDD to an arithmetic function using particular processes, this disclosure contemplates transforming a BDD to an arithmetic function using any suitable processes.","In particular embodiments, a first hash code may be generated by a first component of sensor network  by calculating the first hash code from the first arithmetic function and an input. Any suitable input may be used. In particular embodiments, the input may be randomly generated integers. As an example and not by way of limitation, if input X=5 and Y=7 is provided to arithmetic function A[\u0192]=X+Y\u2212X\u00d7Y, then the hash code is A[\u0192]=5+7\u22125\u00d77=\u221223. In particular embodiments, a hash code H may be determined for a logical combination of Boolean functions \u0192and \u0192. Hash code H may be determined from an arithmetic combination of hash codes Hand H, where His the hash code of Boolean function \u0192and His the hash code of Boolean function \u0192. In particular embodiments, the theorem of orthogonality may be applied. If Boolean functions \u0192and \u0192do not overlap in time, then hash code H for \u0192\u0192=H+H=H. Although this disclosure describes generating hash codes using particular processes, this disclosure contemplates generating hash codes using any suitable processes.","In particular embodiments, the first component of sensor network  may then transmit the first instance of the BDD, the first hash code, and the input to a second component of sensor network . Because the first instance of the BDD may be corrupted during transmission, the second component of sensor network  cannot assume that the data is received is identical to the first instance of the BDD transmitted by the first component of sensor network . Therefore, for purposes of illustration and not by way of limitation, the data representing the first instance of the BDD received by the second component of sensor network  will be referred to as the second instance of the BDD. The second component of sensor network  may then access the second instance of the BDD and transform the second instance of the BDD to a second arithmetic function by performing an arithmetic transformation on the second instance of the BDD. The second instance of the BDD may be transformed in any suitable manner. The input may then be provided to the second arithmetic function to generate a second hash code. The second hash code may be generated in any suitable manner.","In particular embodiments, the second component of sensor network  may then compare the first hash code and the second hash code. Hash codes of equivalent functions are the same, and hash codes of different functions are probably different. Thus, the equivalence of two functions may be verified with a very low probability of error. If arithmetic expressions are evaluated in a finite integer field under randomization, then any distinct pair of 2Boolean functions almost always maps to distinct hash codes, where n is the number of inputs. The probability of error q is n\/(size-of-integer-field), where integer field Z, ={0, 1, . . . , p\u22121} and where p is a prime. As prime p increases, the probability of error q decreases and may approach 0. Accordingly, a larger prime p may be selected to yield more accurate hash codes, and a smaller prime p may be selected to yield less accurate hash codes. In particular embodiments, hash codes may be repeatedly generated to improve accuracy. If hash codes are generated for k runs, then the probability of error is q\u2266(n\/p). Therefore, the probability of error decreases exponentially after each run.","In particular embodiments, if the first hash code equals the second hash code, then the second component of sensor network  may indicate that second instance of the BDD contains uncorrupted data (i.e., the first instance of the BDD and the second instance of the BDD are equivalent). However, if the first hash code does not equal the second hash code, then the second component of sensor network  may indicate that the second instance of the BDD contains corrupted data (i.e., the first instance of the BDD and the second instance of the BDD are not equivalent). In particular embodiments, if the second component of sensor network  indicates that the second instance of the BDD contains corrupted data, it may indicate that the BDD was corrupted during transmission from the first component of sensor network . The comparison results of the hash codes may be reported in any suitable manner. As an example and not by way of limitation, the comparison results may be displayed on display system . In particular embodiments, analysis system  may store the second instance of the BDD if it determines it contains uncorrupted data, and may deleted the second instance of the BDD if it determines it contains corrupted data.","In particular embodiments, if the first hash code does not equal the second hash code, then the second component of sensor network  may transmit a request to the first component of sensor network  to resend the first instance of the BDD and the first hash code. The first component of sensor network  may then retransmit the first instance of the BDD, the first hash code, and the input. For purposes of illustration and not by way of limitation, the data representing the first instance of the BDD re-received by the second component of sensor network  will be referred to as the third instance of the BDD. The second component of sensor network  may then transform the third instance of the BDD to a third arithmetic function by performing an arithmetic transformation on the third instance of the BDD. The second component of sensor network  may then calculate a third hash code from the third arithmetic function and the input. The second component of sensor network  may then compare the first and third hash codes. If the first hash code equals the third hash code, then the second component of sensor network  may indicate that third instance of the BDD contains uncorrupted data. However, if the first hash code does not equal the third hash code, then the second component of sensor network  may indicate that the third instance of the BDD contains corrupted data. If the second component of sensor network  has twice indicated that the BDD is corrupted data, it may indicate that BDD was corrupted prior to transmission rather than during transmission. For example, the BDD stored on the first component of sensor network  may be corrupt. In particular embodiments, if the first hash code does not equal the third hash code, then the second component of sensor network  may indicate that the BDD was corrupted prior to transmission.","In particular embodiments, hash codes may be used to verify communication of Boolean functions or BDDs over one or more communication links (such as, for example, one or more connections ). As an example and not by way of limitation, sensor array  may transmit a BDD and one or more hash codes generated from the BDD over a connection  to analysis system . In one embodiment, the hash codes are encrypted. Multiple hash codes may be sent or the same hash code may be sent multiple times. Analysis system  may calculate a hash code for the received BDD and compare the calculated hash code with the hash code received with the BDD. If the hash codes are the same, analysis system  may determine that the received BDD is valid (i.e., has been properly received). Otherwise, analysis system  may determine that the received BDD is not valid (i.e., has not been properly received and may have been corrupted). Although this disclosure describes verifying communication of Boolean functions or BDDs with hash codes using particular components and particular processes, this disclosure contemplates verifying communication of Boolean functions or BDDs with hash codes using any suitable components and any suitable processes.","In particular embodiments, hash codes may be used to mark and later validate data stored as Boolean functions or BDDs in a component of sensor network . As an example and not by way of limitation, analysis system  may calculate a first hash code from a first instance of the BDD and an input, and then may store the first instance of the BDD and the first hash code separately. At a later time, analysis system  may validate the stored BDD using the stored hash function. Because the first instance of the BDD may be corrupted during storage, the analysis system  cannot assume that the stored data accessed at a later time is identical to the first instance of the BDD when it was originally stored by analysis system . Therefore, for purposes of illustration and not by way of limitation, the data representing the first instance of the BDD stored by analysis system  will be referred to as the second instance of the BDD. Analysis system  may access the second instance of the BDD and calculate a second hash code from the second instance of the BDD and the input. The second hash code may then be compared with the stored first hash code. If the first and second hash codes are the same, the second instance of the BDD may be regarded as valid or uncorrupted data. Otherwise, the second instance of the BDD may be regarded as invalid or corrupted data. More accurate hash codes may be used to mark more important data, and less accurate hash codes may be used to mark less important data. As an example and not by way of limitation, less accurate hash codes may be used if processing power is limited, such as for storage in mobile phones.
