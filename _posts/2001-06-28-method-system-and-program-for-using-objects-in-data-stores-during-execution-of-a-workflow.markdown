Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a method, system, and program for using objects in data stores during execution of a workflow.","2. Description of the Related Art","A workflow program allows businesses and other organizations to define their business operations as a computer model known as a workflow. A workflow defines a series of processes to be performed by users at a client computer. The user activities at the client computers may involve updating an electronic form, reviewing information, etc. After one user in the workflow performs a specified action, the work item or other information is then routed to one or more further nodes where further action may be taken. For instance, an on-line purchase of a product may involve numerous steps, such as receiving the customer order, routing the customer order to the credit department to process the bill and then routing the order to the shipment department to prepare the shipment. Once the shipment is prepared, the product may be shipped and information on the purchase is then transferred to the customer service department to take any further action. Each of these processes may be defined as nodes in a workflow. A workflow program would then route the customer order to the business agents designated to handle the job. For instance, the initial order would be received by the order department and then routed to a person in shipping and billing. Once the bill and package are prepared, a further invoice may be forwarded to shipping. After shipping sends the package, the shipping agent may then enter information into the invoice and forward the electronic invoice to customer service for any follow up action.","A workflow is designed using workflow software, such as the International Business Machines (IBM) MQSERIES** Workflow software product. A process modeler is a person that analyzes the business operations, determines how the information related to the operations is routed electronically to client computers, and then defines a workflow model of the operations. The workflow model may be coded in the FlowMark Definition Language (FDL). The workflow model is then imported into a Runtime program that verifies and translates the workflow model into a process template. An instance of the process template can then be invoked to automates the sequence of events defined by the model.","There is a continued need in the art to provide improved techniques for building and utilizing workflow models.","Provided is a method, system, and program for implementing a workflow comprised of nodes. A workflow packet is generated that is accessed by users at the nodes in the workflow. A request is received to add one target object in one of the data stores to the packet, wherein each data store includes multiple objects. A determination is made of a first object identifier of the target object that is used to identify the target object in one data store. A second object identifier is generated indicating the data store including the target object and the first object identifier. The generated second object identifier is inserted into the workflow packet, where nodes accessing objects in the workflow packet use the second object identifier to access the target object for use at the node.","In further implementations, the data stores are capable of being different types of data stores and from different vendors","Further provided is a method, system, and program for performing an Input\/Output (I\/O) operation on an object during execution of a workflow comprised of nodes. A plurality of objects are stored in one of multiple data stores, wherein each object is identified within the data store with a first object identifier. A workflow packet references at least one object with a second object identifier, wherein the second object identifier indicates one of the data stores and the first object identifier of the referenced object in the data store. An I\/O request for one target object referenced by one second object identifier in the workflow packet is received from one node. A determination is made from the second object identifier of the data store for the target object and the first object identifier of the target object. The I\/O request is performed on the target object at the determined first object identifier in the determined data store.","In further implementations, one workflow packet is associated with a plurality of the nodes in the workflow, wherein the nodes submit I\/O requests for one or more objects referenced by the second object identifiers in the workflow packet.","In still further implementations, the I\/O request comprises a workflow I\/O request and each data store is accessed using data store interfaces. Provided is a mapping of workflow I\/O requests to the data store interfaces for each of the data stores, wherein each workflow I\/O request maps to one or more data store interfaces for each data store. Each data store interfaces for each data that are capable of implementing the workflow I\/O request in the data store. A determination is made from the mapping the at least one data store interface for the determined data store that implements the workflow I\/O request in the determined data store. The workflow I\/O request is performed using the determined at least one data store interface.","Still further, the data stores are capable of comprising different types of data stores from different vendors that utilize different sets of data store interfaces to enable access to objects in the data store. In such case, the mapping enables the workflow I\/O requests to be executed across heterogeneous data stores.","The described implementations provide a technique for implementing references to objects dispersed across multiple data stores to allow nodes in a workflow to access the objects in any of the data stores. The described techniques are capable of allowing nodes access to the objects in the different data stores even when the data stores comprise heterogeneous data stores of different types and from different vendors.","In the following description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof and which illustrate several embodiments of the present invention. It is understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural and operational changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["2","4","6","6","10","8","4","4","4","4"]},"The workflow server  coordinates and manages the execution of processes for a defined process template . The workflow server  executes any programs associated with a process defined for the workflow, interprets the process definitions, creates process instances and manages their execution, manages processes and states, logs events, communicates with users as part of the workflow, etc. The workflow server  may include a database client program (not shown) to access and update records related to the workflow being processed maintained in the runtime database . The workflow server  processing may be distributed across multiple computers to achieve workload balancing.","The workflow clients represent the client computers that execute workflow application program interfaces (APIs) to perform workflow related actions and activities and return messages to the workflow server . The workflow clients thus comprise instances of the workflow code on the client computers that allow users to interface with the executing workflow and the workflow server . The workflow server  would execute activity programs as part of executing the workflow and transmit messages and data to the workflow client  to request user action to proceed with the workflow. The actions associated with the nodes and executed by the workflow server  may comprise Java servlets. The workflow client  may comprise a Web browser capable of executing Java scripts transferred from the Java servlet executing on the workflow server . Further, details on implementations and interactions of the workflow server  and client  are described in the IBM publication \u201cIBM MQSeries Workflow: Concepts and Architecture, Version 3.3\u201d, IBM document no. GH12-6285-03 (March, 2001), which publication is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","A workflow builder  comprises a system including a buildtime program  that implements a plurality of graphical user interface (GUI) panels in which a user may define the components of a workflow model . A workflow translator  converts the workflow model , with the defined workflow components, into a workflow definition language (WDL) file  that implements the workflow model . The workflow definition language (WDL) may comprise the FlowMark Definition Language (FDL), Workflow Process Definition Language (WPDL) or any other workflow definition language known in the art that is used to define workflows. The workflow translator  would transfer the WDL file  to the workflow server  to transform into a process template  in the runtime database  in a manner known in the art.","The workflow engine , and each of the program components therein, such as the runtime database  and workflow server , may be implemented in one or more computing machines. The workflow clients  which provide the workflow interface to users may be implemented on one or more client machines. The workflow builder , including the buildtime program  and workflow translator  programs, may be implemented on one or more computing machines. Any portion of the workflow engine , workflow builder , and\/or workflow client , and program components therein, may be implemented on the same computing machines or separate machines. The computing machines used to implement the workflow engine , workflow clients , and workflow builder  may comprise any computing device known in the art, such as a server, workstation, mainframe, personal computer, laptop computer, hand held computer, telephony device, etc.","As discussed, the buildtime program  generates a series of graphical user interface (GUI) panels through which the user may define a workflow. Before utilizing the buildtime program , the process modeler would plan the workflow and analyze the work the business performs, how it is performed, and by whom. The process modeler may then develop a workflow to generate a final product, which may comprise the result of the effort of a single business unit or the cumulative efforts of multiple users and units within an organization. To produce the final product, a workflow packet comprised of one or more documents would transfer through various user work stations in the company defined as nodes in the workflow to require the user associated with such node to handle and process and forward to another user to handle. A document is comprised of a multimedia item that has digital content.","For instance, an insurance company may have to process numerous documents related to an insurance claim, such as photographs, appraisals, expert reports, etc. Employees may spend a substantial amount of time sorting through documents and associating the documents with particular claims. In the workflow model, all the documents related to a single claim would be part of a work packet that may move through various user stations to review and process. The workflow would comprise the flow of work and actions that are performed on the documents or workflow packet by multiple users in the system.","The workflow defines the sequence and boundaries of how the work is performed with respect to the documents in the workflow packet, and any restrictions on the order in which documents in the workflow packet must be processed. For instance, before the claim can proceed to a further step, a claims adjuster might be required to ensure that certain documents are included in the workflow packet for the claim before the workflow packet can proceed to further nodes in the workflow, e.g., determining the amount of compensation.","In workflow terminology, a worklist is a queue of work items. Each work item comprises a unit of work for a node in the workflow that is performed by the users associated with that node. Each work item may be associated with one work packet, which comprises documents or objects that are processed during the work defined for that work item. When a user at one node accesses the work item to perform the work defined therein, that workitem is locked, thereby preventing others at that node from accessing the work item.","A worklist, which is a queue of work for the users of the organization to perform with respect to the workflow packet. The work items within the worklist can be handled by any of the employees\/users assigned to the worklist. An action list defines the actions that a user can perform on the work packet objects associated with the work item, such as selections or data that may be entered in the work packet. For example, an adjuster in the claim process workflow can select an option to continue consideration of the claim if it appears valid or select an option to reject the claim. The workflow further consists of the paths defined as the connections between nodes which indicate the order of execution of nodes in the workflow.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["50","22","52","50","52","54","56","54","56","52","24","54","56","58","60","62","52","58","60","62","64"]},"As mentioned, the start  and end  icons may be automatically added to the workflow  when the user starts a blank workflow model . The user may move the start  and end  icons to any location on the drawing surface. The user may select the control icons  and  to add work and user exit nodes, respectively, to the workflow. Control icon  is used to define a path between two nodes defining the sequence in which the nodes are processed, and the order in which the work items are processed. The path lines, which are shown as the arrows between the start , end , work and user exit icons , , , and  illustrate the operation flow from one node to another.","Once the process modeler has defined the general layout of a workflow using the control icons , , , and , as shown in the workflow  in , the process modeler may then use additional GUI panels shown in  of the buildtime program  to associate particular users, actions and work items with the nodes.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","50","102","104","6","106","108","110"]},"After defining the properties for the new workflow and placing icons in the drawing area and path arrows to define the workflow, the user would then use the GUI panels shown in  to associate actions and a user with each node, where the associated user performs the associated action when the workflow server  processes the node according to the workflow.  illustrates a start node panel  in which the process modeler defines the action and user associated with the start node  in the workflow, i.e., the first user that will perform the action with respect to the item at the beginning of the workflow. The process modeler would select an action from the action list in the action field  and specify the user to perform the action at the start node in the user field . The enable notification of deadline checkbox  may be selected to notify the user associated with the start node that a deadline has passed during which the user designated action for that node was not completed. Anyone, such as an administrator, user associated with node, or other user on the access list may receive the notification of the missed deadline for the start node .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 2"],"b":["150","58","60","62"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIGS. 6 and 7"},"Using all the above described panels shown in , the process modeler can design a workflow model specifying work nodes and the actions associated with the work nodes, as well as the paths between the work nodes. If two paths lead into a node, such as the case with work node  in , then the workflow will only proceed to the action specified for that next node once the actions associated with the two preceding nodes has completed. Before the user may use the buildtime program , the user must define the access control lists, users, user groups, actions, action lists and worklist in a manner known in the art using application programming interfaces (APIs). The worklist would provide those work items assigned to users, indicating the work items a user may access when performing actions at a node.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 2"],"b":["20","2","4","200","22","22","202","24","204","26","24","10","6","6","8","4","22"]},"In certain implementations, the workflow model  defined using the buildtime program  is document centric in that the actions performed at the node concern the processing of work packages that may comprise any content or object that is processed and routed through the workflow.  illustrates the logic performed by the workflow server  to execute the workflow logic generated using the buildtime program  GUI panel  shown in . When a user invokes a workflow stored in the runtime database , the workflow server  accesses (at block ) the start node of the invoked workflow by interacting with the runtime database  in a manner known in the art. From the properties defined for that node, the workflow server  determines (at block ) the actions and user associated with the node. The workflow server  further processes (at block ) the access list defined for the workflow to determine the work item for the accessed node. If (at block ) the determined work item currently accessed in the workflow is locked by another user at that node, then the workflow server  waits (at block ) for the lock on the work item(s) to be released. If the work item is not locked or after the lock is released, control proceeds to block  where the workflow server  places a lock on the determined work item. The workflow server  then executes (at block ) the action associated with the node and communicates data to the workflow client  of the determined user requesting user action.","If (at block ) notification is enabled for the current node and the deadline has passed (at block ) without receiving a response from the user, then the workflow server  notifies the user specified with the enable notification that the deadline has passed. Upon receiving (at block ) a response from the user, which may comprise entering information, modifying a work item, adding a work item to the work package, selecting an option, etc., the workflow server  unlocks (at block ) the work item(s) previously locked for the user. If (at block ) the current node is the stop node, then control ends; otherwise, if there are further nodes to process in the workflow, then the workflow server  determines (at block ) from the path from the current node the next node in the workflow and accesses (at block ) the next node. Control then proceeds back to block  to process the next node.","The workflow logic of  provides a document centric workflow in that the state of processing work items associated with the node controls the workflow because control cannot proceed to other subsequent nodes that process the locked work item until the node holding the lock completes execution and releases the lock on the work item. Thus, access to work items controls the flow through the workflow. The workflow builder  provides a GUI tool to allow the user to create a document centric workflow model and translate that workflow model , including the defined worklists, access lists, action lists, etc., into a workflow definition language (WDL) file  that can be maintained and utilized in a robust workflow engine software product known in the art.","With the described implementations, the workflow builder  generates a WDL file  that may be compatible with workflow engines from different vendors because different vendors may design their workflow engines to be compatible with the WDL format of the WDL file . This allows the workflow model defined in the WDL file  to be transportable across different vendor workflow engine platforms.
