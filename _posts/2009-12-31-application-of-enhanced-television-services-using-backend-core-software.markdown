title: Application of enhanced television services using back-end core software
abstract: A method and system to permit TV viewers to interact with program content broadcast over a subscriber network, such as cable, satellite, internet, or cellular telephone. The details of the ability for the viewer to interact is embedded as data in the program signal. The subscription provider broadcasts a visual indicator as a small icon during programming that informs the viewer that interaction is permitted. The viewer then uses a remote control to purchase products, vote on events, respond to polls, download files, request information, and request callback actions. The TV viewer uses the remote control to send information to a set-top box front-end application, and to iteratively create transactions that are batched and then sent to a back-end core application and database which then handles fulfillment.

The Present Application is also a continuation-in-part (CIP) of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/552,235 (hereinafter, the '235 Application) filed on Sep. 1, 2009 entitled ENHANCED TELEVISION SERVICES and issued as U.S. Pat. No. 8,132,212 as well as PCT International Application Ser. No. PCT\/US09\/55635 (hereinafter, the '635 Application), which is the international counterpart of the '235 Application. Both the '235 and '635 Applications further claimed the benefit of and priority to both the '772 Provisional Application and U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61\/093,713 (hereinafter, the '713 Provisional Application) filed on Sep. 2, 2008 entitled ENHANCED TELEVISION SERVICES. The Present Application claims the benefit of and priority to the '235 Application, the '635 PCT Application, the '772 Provisional Application, and the '713 Provisional Application and the '635 PCT Application. The '235 Application, the '635 PCT Application, the '772 Provisional Application, and the '713 Provisional Application are all incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. The subject matter of this application is also related to that of U.S. patent application publication no. US 2012\/0144414.","The '235 Application disclosed an interactive television system that allows subscribers to perform a great many functions than those currently available by using their TV remote controls.","Interactive television is very attractive to cable service providers. Cable companies are in the process of adopting the \u201cEnhanced TV Binary Interchange Format\u201d (EBIF) and the \u201cOpen Cable Application Platform\u201d (OCAP). EBIF is a multimedia content format defined by a specification developed under the \u201cOpenCable\u201d project of CableLabs (Cable Television Laboratories, Inc.). The primary purpose of EBIF is to present to a television viewer one or more multimedia pages, similar to web pages, but specialized for use within an enhanced television or an interactive television system. Action sequences are executed as a result of firing certain predefined events, such as a page load event, a key press event, a click event, etc. These events are triggered by the viewer using the remote control. Execution of all events are serialized and controlled by event handlers. On the other hand, OCAP is an operating system layer designed for consumer electronics that connects to a television system. Unlike operating systems on a personal computer, the cable company controls what OCAP programs run on the consumer's television set. Also designed by CableLabs for the cable networks of North America, OCAP programs are intended for interactive services such as eCommerce, online banking, Electronic program guides, and digital video recording. The OCAP standard has not yet been approved by the FCC.","A Multiple System Operator (MSO) is an operator of multiple cable television systems. A cable system in the US, by FCC definition, is a facility serving a single community or a distinct governmental entity, each with its own franchise agreement with the cable company. Though in the strictest sense any cable company that serves multiple communities is thus an MSO, the term today is usually reserved for companies that own a very large number of cable systems.","The '235 Application disclosed an innovative suite of products and services bundled as Enhanced Television Service (ETS). ETS functions both on an EBIF and OCAP platform. ETS delivers a host of interactive functions specifically tailored to the broadcast program or commercials. The enhanced and empowered media is then transmitted to the MSO in any one of the many available formats for eventual transmission to the viewer. Invisible and unobtrusive until invoked by the viewer's existing remote control, the enhanced media suddenly reveals a wealth of onscreen information and choices. With no additional equipment installation or modification, the standard cable television remote control transforms the once passive viewer into a participant ordering information downloads, voting, responding and making instant purchases. The ETS handles all of these transactions from order processing to billing and fulfillment. By delivering a host of interactive functions, cable television operators empowered with the ETS solution can increase their competitive position while maximizing their networks financial potential. Through an intuitive portal application, advertisers are able to create and manage their own enhanced television events. They control the look, feel and exact moment the trigger is available to the viewer. Advertisers\/Vendors can also upload products for sale or download and associate them with events described above. The portal also provides statistical data on the performance of events in a dashboard like manner. Also through an intuitive web portal subscribers can look at order history, wish lists, download items and purchase promotional products. This web portal resides in the MSO's web portal. Again, ETS handles all of these transactions from order processing to billing and fulfillment.","A TV viewer will hereinafter be referred to interchangeably as a subscriber or a viewer. Subscribers can interact with the broadcast program or commercial with the remote control. They can participate in the following transactions using the ETS system:","1\u2014Purchase\n\n","2\u2014Polling\/Voting\n\n","3\u2014Request\/Download Information\n\n","4\u2014View Transaction history\n\n","The ETS System provides the following features:\n\n","Typically, when viewer interaction is possible, an icon (called an iBug) will appear on the screen (usually in the lower right-hand corner). At that point, the viewer will be able to press a button on the remote control that would bring up a menu that is specific to the currently viewed channel. By contrast, the GUIDE button brings up a universal guide no matter what channel is being viewed.","The subscriber interacts directly with a software system called ETS Edge that was described in detail in the '235 Application. To perform its functions, the ETS Edge front-end software must interact with more extensive back-end software called ETS Core. The ETS Core software was described in overview in the '235 Application. Every MSO will have multiple ETS Edge systems that are geographically located on its head ends. In addition to multiple ETS Edges, every MSO will have one ETS Core system that is centrally located within that MSO. The data from multiple ETS Core systems will go to the Data Warehouse on regular basis for persistent storage and reporting purposes. The Present Application describes the ETS Core system in detail.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0180","num":"0192"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"The ETS Core controls:\n\n","The ETS Core communicates directly with the Data Warehouse which stores information regarding:\n\n","Third party vendors and shippers (e.g., Amazon) and payment processors (e.g., PayPal) communicate directly with the ETS Core through an MSO network, as do administrators (Admin) and customer service representatives (CSR). Each MSO network has a plurality of ETS Edge interfaces that provide geographically local viewer polling, purchasing, downloading, and event presentation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0184","num":"0212"},"figref":"FIG. 2","ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0011","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0011-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0012","list-style":"none"},"li":["different tiers of the ETS system;","protocols used for communication;","data flow between the systems;","different types of users of the system; and","third party systems integration."]}}}},"Whenever the subscriber interacts with the TV, he or she interacts using the Set-top Box (STB) that is associated with that TV. The customized application (Xlet) that is sitting on the STB will listen to these user interactions. The Xlet application will send the relevant requested data to the ETS Edge system and the ETS Edge will respond back to the Xlet. This transaction data will eventually go from ETS Edge to ETS Core system in real time or near real time basis. The ETS Core system will process the actual transaction. In the same way, when an event is created in the ETS Core system, that event data will be distributed to the relevant ETS Edges. When an ETS Edge receives a request from the TV subscriber, the relevant event data will be sent back to the Xlet in the form of the response.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0186","num":"0219"},"figref":"FIG. 3","ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0013","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0013-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0014","list-style":"none"},"li":["Web Portals","Business Application Engine","Common Business Services","Third Party Integration Services\n\nWeb Portals\n"]}}}},"Web portals use the ETS Core system. These portals are developed by using web scripting languages to render pre-defined user interfaces so that the user can log into the portal, and can perform activities such as view past and current transactions, purchase products, update profiles, etc. The web server of each of the portals communicates with the ETS Core system for each user request, and it is the ETS Core system which actually applies the relevant business logic to each and every user activity, updates the database, and returns the result back to the portal which renders the view page to the user. The ETS Core system has the following web portals:","Administrator Portal\n\n","Subscriber Portal\n\n","Vendor Portal\n\n","CSR Portal","The CSR portal will be used by the CSR to support the customers.","Business Application Engine","Business Application Engine comprises the logic to process the User requests and automate transaction processing. It inserts the order into the core system and applies business logic into it. It contacts the payment gateway to charge the user for the product (if it is a product sale). All successful transactions will be forwarded to an internal or third party fulfillment center. The confirmation of the transaction will be sent from the third party billing and fulfillment systems. Product sale, download request and voting are all handled as a part of this subsystem.","Common Business Services","Common Business Services can be accessible from any portal and includes the following services:\n\n","Order Management\n\n","Product Management","This module allows products to be created, updated, or deleted.","Event Management\n\n","Inventory Management\n\n","Identity Management\n\n","These services are used to integrate with third party vendors and include the following:","Datacenter Service\n\n","Shipment Service\n\n","Payment Service\n\n","Customer History\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0206","num":"0269"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"140pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["The ETS Core system","Java, JSP, Ruby on Rails, PHP, Ofbiz, Tomcat"]},{"entry":[{},"Application server, Oracle clustered database"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}},"br":{}},"The staging environment is configured as such:\n\n","The business requirements for the ETS Core system can be detailed in two categories:","Functional Requirements:","1) Third Party API","A standard application programming interface (API) that provides third-party developers the ability to utilize CORE services for order processing, billing and fulfillment. This is a programmatic (API) interface not a presentation layer interface so the system is capable of providing \u201chooks\u201d into our system to process order generated by third parties.","2) Dashboard and Reports","A standard and secure interface for vendor and partners to view their event performance and information in near real-time dashboard and be capable of generating ad-hoc reports views on the same data. Report generating metrics should be based on: Event ID, Product ID, Geography or DMA, Event Type (IR, Polling, Purchase, Digital), Event Coverage (National\/Regional\/Local), # of Transactions Completed, # of Transactions Canceled, # of Transactions Added to WISH LIST, # of Transactions (Volume), Transaction Price (Dollar Amount, Fee, Ad Sponsored, etc.), Transactions Frequency (per minute, hour, day, week, month, year, quarter, etc.), Transactions Payment Type (Visa, Amex, Discover, etc.), Transactions Denied (e.g. problem with payment, account blocked, etc.), Transaction Shipping Type (Overnight, Standard, Email, Cellular, etc.), By Vendor (Events, Transactions, Fulfillment Site, etc.), By MSO (Events, Transactions, etc.) Main or summary reporting should include Number of Transactions, Transaction Totals by MSO\/Region, etc","A shipping service module will select a shipment carrier that is offered by the fulfillment house. The carriers included are USPS, UPS, and FedEx. It will then calculate the total amount by getting the rate from the selected carrier through carriers provided API.","3) Product Management","Product identification of images, group\/party, pricing, multiple item discount, product (Good\/Digital Good\/Service), category, features, description, inventory, storage, supplier, fulfillment methods, fulfillment logic tiers\u2014One to many(e.g. warehouse A, then B, then C), geography or DMA, availability period, status, SKU, ISBN, Catalog ID, UPC code, DMA or Region Deployment Requirements, etc.","4) Background Processing","Based on the event type and\/or geographic location of MULTIPLE or SINGLE transactions, the CORE system needs to be capable of intelligently acting on those INCOMING requests and be capable of acting on them in a number of ways.","5) Events and Event Panels\n\n","6) Wish List","Ability to manage WISH LIST items (view\/initiate order\/checkout\/remove) from the Portals (Admin, Subscriber and CSR).","7) Data Warehouse\n\n","8) Monitoring Management\n\n","The ETS Core software is described in the drawings using several diagrammatic representations. First, there are high-level conceptual models that describe the structures and functions of the main components. This is followed by HIPO diagrams. HIPO was a diagrammatic documentation system for software developed by IBM. Information regarding this system can be found in IBM Publication GC20-1851-1 entitled: \u201cHIPO\u2014A Design Aid and Documentation Technique.\u201d It was originally designed to promote \u201cstructured programming.\u201d However, since the introduction of \u201cobject oriented programming,\u201d HIPO has fallen into disuse. Nonetheless, it is still an excellent tool for describing software systems. HIPO is an acronym that stands for Hierarchy plus Input, Process, Output. HIPO documentation comprises a series of diagram charts.","The first chart in each series is a hierarchy chart. This chart, appearing like a corporate organization chart, displays the calling relationship between the various system modules. Each module appears as a block in the diagram. Lines connect these modules to show their hierarchy. Hierarchy is further shown by assigning numeric labels to the modules. Normally, the highest order module would be labeled 1.0. Modules immediately below it hierarchically would be labeled 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, . . . , and so on. Modules hierarchically below 2.0 (for example) would be labeled 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, . . . , and so on. Modules hierarchically below 2.1 (for example) would be labeled 2.1.1, 2.1.2, 2.1.3, . . . and so on. Therefore, by looking at the numeric label of any module, one can determine its level of hierarchy. A black triangle located at the corner of the module block indicates that the module is re-used many times either as a subroutine or as an object.","Following the hierarchy chart, each module depicted on that chart receives an IPO chart. The IPO chart is divided into three columns. The leftmost column represents INPUT. The rightmost column represents OUTPUT. The central column represents PROCESS. This is where the various steps in the process are described. Most of the information in the INPUT and OUTPUT columns is graphical (e.g., representing terminals, hard drives, printers, etc.). Most of the information in the PROCESS columns is descriptive text showing the procedural steps. Arrows connect the PROCESS column to the INPUT and OUTPUT columns to show data flow.","Each IPO chart may have an Extended Description showing notes about the various steps in the process. These act almost like footnotes in a document. They are usually too detailed or extraneous to include in the steps denoted in the PROCESS column.","Finally, many modules have architecture flow diagrams that show a linear flow of the procedures executed by those modules","The basic ETS Core portals are described as follows:","1) Admin","A standard, plug-able (into existing MSO administration portals) secure interface for Customer Service Representatives (CSR's), Managers & Administrators to have access to an event, order, subscriber, product, inventory, maintenance, monitoring, reporting and security management ALL based on their job responsibilities and roles to limit system access.\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0231","num":"0321"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"ADMINISTRATIVE PORTAL (Overview)"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"147pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"1.0 ETS Core - Admin"]},{"entry":[{},"\u20032.0 Catalog"]},{"entry":[{},"\u20033.0 Customer Service"]},{"entry":[{},"\u20034.0 Facility"]},{"entry":[{},"\u20035.0 Party"]},{"entry":[{},"\u20036.0 Web Tools"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Table 1 represents an overview of the Administrative Portal of the ETS Core system.  is a HIPO Hierarchy diagram showing the organization of the Administrative Portal software modules.

Currently, advertisers display their products on television hoping that viewers will purchase these products. They blast commercials onto television sets knowing that the more exposure they receive, the greater number of products will be purchased. Generally, advertisers do not know what associated program or what time slots produce the best results. There are general parameters, but the exact source of incentives to purchase is mostly unknown. Some advertisers provide toll-free telephone numbers for viewers to call. In response, many viewers call those numbers immediately to place orders. A few call later, but most viewers do not take the time to call. Once the telephone number disappears from a viewer's memory, the advertiser can be assured that the viewer will not call. Use of a remote control, already in the user's hand, makes purchase of a product easy and immediate. In response to an advertisement, a user can click a product into his or her shopping cart, and can submit orders after the program finishes. In addition, advertisements may now be \u201cpushed\u201d while the program is still running. For example, during a program, a symbol appears on the bottom of the screen. A user knows that when such a symbol appears, he or she may press a button on the remote control to get more information. Yet, the program continues to run, and the view is uninterrupted. The information may be in the form of a vote request or of a special purchase offer.
