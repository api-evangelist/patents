Field of the Invention","The invention disclosed herein relates generally to methods and systems for analyzing and using digital video compositions, and more particularly to a method and system for determining the characteristics of a video composition using measurable criteria.","2. Background of the Prior Art","Historically, much of what attracts us to a particular song is found in the basic structure of the music. Particular rhythms, changes in key and certain melodic patterns define the psychological and very human response we all have to music. In a similar fashion, particular characteristic variables of films, video-shorts, mobile videos, music videos, videogames, advertisings, video clips, and television programs affect how viewers respond to the production.","While the number of possible plot lines combined with all of the other variables in recorded films, video-shorts, mobile videos, music videos, videogames, advertisings, video clips and television programs allow for a seemingly infinite number of combinations, the patterns that we find pleasing have not changed. By analyzing images, sound, script, and structure similar mathematical patterns can be discerned.","This document will refer to the term \u201cvideo\u201d as a generic term to include all video formats including films, video-shorts, mobile videos, music videos, videogames, advertisings, video clips, and television programs, among others.","It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and system for measuring the characteristics of a video composition, and establishing a collection of digital video compositions that may be sorted upon such characteristics.","It is another object of the present invention to enable a method and system to compare digital video files to discover video similarities.","It is another object of the present invention to provide a method and system for determining a preferred video characteristic profile for a video viewer.","It is another object of the present invention to provide a method and system for analyzing \u201cvideos\u201d (films, video-shorts, mobile videos, music videos, videogames, advertisings, video clips, and television programs) to make video recommendations, video classification, video discovery, personalized video games.","It is another object of the present invention to enable a method and system to compare new digital video files with historical commercially successful videos.","It is another object of the present invention to provide a method and system for analyzing \u201cvideos\u201d (films, video-shorts, mobile videos, music videos, videogames, advertisings, video clips, and television programs, among others) to predict market success.","In accordance with the above objects, an artificial intelligence recommendation system and method is provided. The system and method accomplish this task by analyzing, for each video format, a database of films, video-shorts, mobile videos, music videos, videogames, advertisings, video clips and television programs in order to identify key similarities between different videos, and then recommending videos to a user depending upon their preferences.","The system uses a series of complex artificial intelligence algorithms to analyze a plurality of characteristics in a video composition. The characteristics analyzed are relevant variables for characterizing films, video-shorts, mobile videos, music videos, videogames, advertisings, video clips and television programs, among others, including: image analysis (both static and video dynamics), sound analysis (including video, voice, sounds, and noise), script analysis, structural analysis (length, scene structure, scene changes etc), and metadata analysis (name of studio, director, actors, etc. . . . ). This approach enables the creation of \u201cconstellations\u201d of videos with similar characteristics, even from different genres and styles, enabling fast, accurate, and less costly comparison of films, TV programs, and videos for potential market success, video classification, and recommendation. The video recommendation includes video discovery and personalization through all digital channels including internet, mobile, personal computers and hand set devices.","The various features of novelty that characterize the invention will be pointed out with particularity in the claims of this application.","The invention summarized above and defined by the enumerated claims may be better understood by referring to the following description, which should be read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. This description of an embodiment, set out below to enable one to build and use an implementation of the invention, is not intended to limit the enumerated claims, but to serve as particular examples thereof. Those skilled in the art should appreciate that they may readily use the conception and specific embodiments disclosed as a basis for modifying or designing other methods and systems for carrying out the same purposes of the present invention. Those skilled in the art should also realize that such equivalent assemblies do not depart from the spirit and scope of the invention in its broadest form.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"]},"The raw materials for the system are films, video-shorts, mobile videos, music videos, videogames, advertisings, video clips, and television programs. These are stored in a digital file, which is the main starting point for all embodiments of the invention. The first step performed by the system is to analyze an existing digital video file in order to create a descriptive profile for the video characteristics of the file. In a first stage, the analysis portion reads a \u201cvideo\u201d file and extracts some data. This data can be represented as a series of numbers, which are the main input for future processing. Such processing depends on the final application, and can use algorithms such as Principal Components Analysis (PCA), KNearest Neighbors (kNN), etc.","The processes, according to the present invention, start by analyzing a large and representative sample of video files. A database is created for each country consisting of movies that have performed well, within the best window time frame. For example, historical data for movies would include: national and worldwide sales and distribution figures, revenues, DVD\/video sales and rental figures, audience ratings, awards garnered, release date, season, permanence of the movie, re-releases of the movie, etc. Additional data may include data associated with the Title, director, actors, studio, music production, associated books for the script (if any) etc. For TV programs, the database is similar, but may also include historical information on minute-to-minute audience ratings for each program. The minute-to-minute information will be aggregated and disaggregated according to the learning systems described herein. The process analyzes several characteristics of the video, such as sound and camera movements, and measures how the characteristics change over time. Parameter analysis is described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,081,579 to Alcalde et al. the specification of which is included herein by reference, in its entirety.","The purpose of the initial analysis performed by the system is to analyze a variety of physical parameters of the videos stored in the database. Such physical parameters describe quantifiable characteristics of the film or TV program that may be mathematically modeled to create a descriptive, electronic \u201cdescriptors' vector\u201d for each video. Moreover, the analyzed parameters are based on cognitive and perceptual analysis, and the system is referred to as a Media Intelligence Universe System. The characteristics have been identified to be the ones that are measurable and quantifiable. Often the characteristics are detected unconsciously. In general, the mix of parameters is more important than any individual parameter. To implement the methods described herein, the system particularly analyzes one or more of the following characteristics for each video composition. Not all of the characteristics necessarily provide distinctions in the video program. Combinations of some or all of these characteristics may be employed without departing from the spirit and scope of the instant invention.","The parameters that are mathematically analyzed can be divided into four primary components with accompanying sub-components, which include:","1. Static Image Analysis Includes\n\n","2. Video and Image Movements\n\n","3. Script Analysis\n\n","4. Music and Sound\n\n","The main processes of the Media Intelligence Technology are shown in .\n\n","Process #1 organizes data in a Database and allows to correct and detect errors in the input data, both in the files and structure. In the case of TV programs, the data coming from the audience and from the programs are processed together.","For Process #2, the videos are transformed (consisting of several recordings in QuickTime format, divided by advertisements in some cases) into sequences of frames\/photograms and audio files.","As an example, we will describe a chapter of a soap opera. It can be observed that the advertisements are located immediately after the soap opera. However, most of the advertisements are also divided into video files respectively. In the case of TV programs, frames\/photograms provide a lot of information concerning the introduction of advertisements.","The frame\/photogram extraction method has proven to be very efficient to analyze a great amount of videos quickly. While projecting on a high resolution, up to 13\u00d710 frames\/photograms (grabbed with a rate of 2 per second), it is possible to immediately display about 30 seconds per chapter. This display, together with the characters' identification, is carried out in parallel.","Process #3 comprises the following main modules:","Module 1: Supervised perceptual analysis. Extraction of the amount of characters and identification of the characters in a scene without using the script information.","Module 2: Supervised cognitive analysis. Three parameters are evaluated for each scene.\n\n","Module 3: Automatic perceptual analysis. For this analysis, several techniques can be used. The results of applying a frame\/photogram input rate to the system of 2 frames\/photograms per second and an audio sample frequency of 24 kHz with only one channel is presented as an example.","The first processing unit calculates simple statistics (such as the amount of red, green, blue, saturation, light level\/luminosity, tone, and other complex parameters such as the light level period (until the second order) and the statistic parameter called Hu's Momentum which is invariable with rotation and scale\/range.  shows a frame\/photogram sequence that shows an image when translating the channels red, green, and blue to tone, saturation, and light level\/luminosity.","The following processing unit calculates the tone and saturation histogram in order to distinguish the most present tonalities. As it can be observed, at the left top section of each photogram there is a black box of 4\u00d74 strips corresponding to the tone-saturation two-dimensional histogram. This system is very useful to automatically locate scene and shot changes because the histogram should not vary with mouth movements and face gestures during a conversation among several characters of the video.","It is possible to observe this characteristic in the photogram sequence. As seen in , the advertisements have different histograms compared with the rest of frames\/photograms in the case of TV programs, with the objective of attracting more attention.","The third processing unit looks for structures made up by lines, aiming to help with the determination of the visual complexity of an image.  shows the original frames\/photograms with a marker (it appears in red color at the bottom of each frame\/photogram). For this specific example, the marker provides information about the quantity of linear structures in the image.  illustrates a processed sequence.","The next processing unit of an image is one of the most complex in the whole system. It deals with the calculation of the amount of movement between two consecutive frames\/photograms (optical flow). From other point of view, the objective is to calculate if a frame\/photogram sequence does not show abrupt changes of shots and scene (see ).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0125"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},"As we can observe, the image is divided into quadrants, which are analyzed separately in order to obtain their corresponding equivalents in the frame\/photogram below and, like this, calculate the optical flux. The fifth image-processing unit analyzes data from a frequency point of view (the same way can be done with the sound). The frame\/photogram sequence shown in  displays the frequency analysis where it can be extracted where the \u2018image energy\u2019 concentrates.","This processing is repeated for the image in a grey scale, and for the components in red, green, and blue.  shows, for the same frames\/photograms of the sequence in , their corresponding spectrums relocated into a polar system where an average for all the components is calculated by using the same distance as the zero frequency.","The last processing unit supplements\/complements the complexity measurement by means of a color segmentation algorithm. The more complex is a scene, the more objects it contains. An example of this analysis is presented in . The segmentation algorithm output sequence is shown in .","It is possible to observe how the upper frames\/photograms are less complex than the last frames\/photograms from the sequence.","Concerning the automatic analysis of the audio parameters, the following list of Basic parameters is processed at a first level:","1. Sound power","2. Spectrum fractiles (50% to 90%) from low frequencies","3. Maximum frequency and frequency centroid","4. Power of low, medium and high frequencies","5. Power break (low, medium, and high totals).","6. Harmonic detector (frequency and power)","With these basic parameters, it is possible to develop more complex parameters such as music detectors, music and voice, or voice alone.  show a monogram for 5 minutes of audio as well as an example of two of the extracted parameters (percentile 70% of the frequency energy and the level of the most powerful harmonic). Sound analysis techniques are described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,081,579, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","Process #4 establishes correlations among descriptors. Having obtained all necessary descriptors, a preliminary analysis that relates those parameters with audience data is processed. Some simple examples related to the underway study of cognitive data and its connection with the audience rating are presented below.","1. Rating\/Scene Character Video .","The average rating for every scene type, as well as the associated average rating, the maximum rating and the standard drift\/variation\/deviation are analyzed.

Generalized ELO (\u201cGELO\u201d) Module.","The ELO rating is a means of comparing the relative strengths of chess players, devised by Professor Arpad Elo. Players gain or lose rating points depending on the ELO rating of their opponents. If a player wins a game of chess in a rated tournament, they gain a number of rating points that increases in proportion to the difference between their rating and their opponent's rating.","Of course, the Elo rating does not supply any information on the individual aspects of a chess player's capabilities; it does not rate the individual style as a player, or how well his defense and game endings are. Ratings provide merely a comparison of performances, no more and no less. Nevertheless, the Elo rating system has proved to be a relatively accurate measure for predicting the outcome of chess matches, based on a quantified figure of the strength of individual chess players.","The GELO Measures Output Module of the Media Intelligence Universe is based on an innovative measure system that generalizes the application of ELO rating systems that are commonly applied in chess. Hereinafter we will denominate this new Generalized ELO system the GELO system.","The GELO measures allow in general when comparing new \u201cVideos\u201d (Films, video-shorts, mobile videos, music videos, videogames, advertisings, video clips and television programs, among others) with previously successful videos and with the predefined measure of success stated in each case, to predict the success potential of the new video in relation to the pre-defined measure.","As an example (but by no means restricting the scope of application), and in order to fix ideas the method is described as applied to TV shows (exemplifying the concept of \u201cvideo\u201d) and the correlation between GELO measures and the audience ratings (exemplifying the concept of pre-defined measure of success). We will also present the way knowledge of the causes of TV rating gain or loss can be extracted using the GELO system to cognitive and image processing parameters such as image complexity, scene type (violence, love, family love, or action), presence of certain characters, audio spectrum, etc. The same process can be used for any video type.","To understand the behavior of GELO measures for audience ratings for a TV show (and also the competitors' evolution) it is necessary to process the historical successful videos in two separate ways as illustrated in .","The first module is the cognitive analysis module where scenes, commercials, and introductory materials are tagged with a time stamp in order to relate them to minute-to-minute rating data. Scenes are classified as interior, exterior, and also the type of scene (as described in process # 3).","Characters are also identified for each scene to determine which are the characters that produce the highest or lowest ratings. Other parameters are considered as for example the intensity of the scene, where each scene is measured with a number between 0 and 5.","The second module as described in process # 3: the perceptual analysis module would be applied in this case to gather visual and audio parameters from frames and sequences of frames in order to look for relationships with the minute-to-minute ratings. The perceptual parameters applied in this example include (but are not restricted to):","1. Simple red, green, blue, saturation, hue, and luminosity statistical measurements per frame.","2. Hue and saturation two-dimensional histogram","3. Line structures","4. Optical flow to detect movement and camera displacement over the scene","5. Fourier Spectral histogram of the luminosity map","6. Image complexity","7. Audio analysis: music, voices, and sounds (sound power, statistical model, low and high frequencies power ratio, harmonic detector, power steps, and frequency centroid).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0105","num":"0164"},"figref":["FIG. 16","FIG. 16"]},"All the chapters are pre-processed with both modules (cognitive and perceptual modules) systematically creates a large database of media descriptors, scene types, characters identification, etc.","Due to the fact that, in this example, the audience rating information is only given in a minute-by-minute basis, all this information is condensed by minutes using the minimum, the maximum, the mean and the standard deviation of all the parameters obtained during the same minute.","Once all the information has been processed and included into a database, then the GELO number can be used to transform all this information into knowledge that reflects the causes underneath audience rating variation. Chapters and their ratings are displayed in a matrix with fast-time (minute-by-minute rating) in the columns and slow-time (chapter to chapter) in the rows. This can be seen in , where the ratings for a TV show are displayed over a period of two months approximately. It is important to show that the start and the end time of the TV show vary from chapter to chapter.  shows the rating over two months for the same TV show (between 0% and 30%).","The media analyzed parameters are also transformed into a similar matrix such as the one seen in , which shows an example of image complexity mean (red) and image complexity standard deviation in a minute-by-minute basis.","This allows the application of the GELO number for the immediate term (that means, comparing ratings inside the same chapter) and for the long term (comparing between chapters separated in time).","The GELO system establishes a different rating (from the ELO system) gain\/loss step depending on the number of times an identity plays a game. The same approach can be extended to characters, scene intensity, and media parameters.

Furthermore, the ability to seek the videos in sets of perceptual and cognitive temporal parameters and apply the GELO rating model to them, represents the next step beyond the state of art of video analysis. The direct application to TV programs presented shows the next generation\u2014beyond the state of the art\u2014for TV rating analysis.","In a preferred embodiment, the processes described herein measure innovation\/prediction cycles in video structure by using spectrum variables for power law detection. They also measure deviation analysis from the universality trend through detection of cycles from the universality trend and the detection of innovation and prediction wavelets.","As shown in , following analysis of the video characteristics, software modules according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention learn a user's video preferences. The software uses two modules; one called ADAM, a cluster recognition engine, and another called EVE, a recommendation engine.","ADAM is a conceptual clustering engine that is based on physical pattern recognition models. This non-supervised learning system generates a hierarchical tree structure that is based on topological metrics, which automatically determines the final number of clusters while allowing for automated related variable detection. The methodology for detecting social trends is completely scalable, and has been successfully applied in many other areas. It is also used for the preliminary visualization engine described in more detail below.","EVE is a non-linear kernel learner, which had been successfully used in many other commercial applications. The application of EVE in video is similar to the referred application \u201cMusic Taste Test\u201d in U.S. Pat. No. 7,081,579. This supervised learning system uses technology that has been proven to outperform statistical and neural network systems. A mathematically elegant solution which is relatively easy to customize and refine, the algorithm uses a direct strategy to capture personal Von Neumann Morgenstern utility functions. Due to their elegant and parsimonious mathematical architecture, both ADAM and EVE have been easily ported to new operating system environments, such as Symbian 60.","After the system has learned a user's video preferences, it can connect the user with video selections based on his or her likes and dislikes.

The different types of mathematical procedures used to extract characteristic parameters are described in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 7,081,579. The analysis module is designed to be extremely portable and self-constituent, which means that it contains all the information it requires. Accordingly, the input of the MIU server is a list of videos with their respective descriptors (set of real numbers that could define different type of signal analysis, for example, the mean frequency, the level of noise, the mean power, image noise, rhythm, camera movements, etc). A unique identifier is assigned to each video, which is used to retrieve metadata from the database, such as title, name of studio, director, actors, clip location, etc.","Sometimes it is useful to apply a technique called Eigen Value Decomposition to find a reduced set of useful descriptors such as based on Principle Component Analysis (PCA) condensing the information because descriptors are not totally independent. So as to be able to filter the recommended list, some auxiliary non-mathematical information is also sent (such as, the year and the genre of the song). All this information is stored in an ASCII file that the MIU Server can read, parse, and analyze. The format of the MIU Server input ASCII file may be as follows:","id;0;1;1;YEAR;GENRE;PCA1;PCA2;PCA3;VAR1;VAR2;VAR3;VAR4;VAR5 . . .","where PCA_ refers to specific parameter values and VAR_ refers to the video descriptors.","The PHP module has the possibility to select whether to use the PCAs or the descriptors. With PCAs, the calculations are done faster, but with the descriptors, it will be possible to also send weights to disable some descriptors and find, for example, videos with similar rhythm but with different moods.","An important aspect of the present invention is to analyze historical data related to the commercial success of films, video-shorts, mobile videos, music videos, videogames, advertisings, video clips, and television programs in order to create a \u201csuccess\u201d database. Such parameters may include additional data such as total sales, date of release, awards, critical acclaim, and other common indicators of commercial success. The success database will enable comparisons between new or unreleased content and previously released content regarding the intrinsic \u201cvideo\u201d parameters (as the ones described above), in order to predict the market success of new projects as well as gain other meaningful data to inform other marketing decisions. Each analyzed video is mapped onto a grid and positioned according to its mathematical characteristics, as illustrated in . Videos with mathematical similarities are positioned very close to one another. The videos that had been recent successes were grouped into a limited number of small \u201csuccess\u201d clusters all over the grid but with vast spaces between them.","The techniques taught by the present invention can be used throughout the creation and lifetime of the project. Below is listed some of the utility in the Pre-production, Post production, and Marketing phases. However, the potential of the product can have an impact in all the Industry value chain.","1) Pre-Production","At the pre-production level, the system generally does not have a global application. However it can analyze separately the main ingredients of the video when ready (previous to the production) such as script, initial music tracks selection, actors voices, dailies, etc.","2) Post Production","During postproduction, the system of the present invention can aid in pacing, scene length, music placement, Foley recording, scene exclusion, etc. . . . Consider, for example, a new film in production, if the project is close to a \u201csuccess cluster\u201d (of similar films\u201d), editing can be optimized in order to move the final production toward a \u201csuccess cluster\u201d.  is an illustration of three new videos as analyzed and graphed on the grid of \u201csuccess clusters\u201d. In this illustration, there is one video that falls squarely within a success cluster, one video that is on the edge of a success cluster and one video that is clearly outside the success clusters.","3) Marketing","The final product will be analyzed and compared to other releases enabling market comparisons, success potential objective measures, and clues to better position the product.","4) Film Recommendation for Final Consumers","In the retail space, either physical or digital, for TV, Films or videos a Film Recommendation system for TV programs or videos can be developed based on the similarities that determine the Film clusters\/TV program clusters or video clusters. The similarities are determined trough the EVE and ADAM non-supervised and supervised learning systems using affinity values. The affinity value is a rating that shows how closely related the mathematical patterns in one video are to another. The lower the affinity value between two videos the more closely related they are.","The learning systems use artificial intelligence applications as well as other methods to analyze the underlying mathematical patterns in the videos. The technology can isolate and separate many distinct events that occur in films, video-shorts, mobile videos, music videos, videogames, advertisings, video clips, and television programs, among others. By doing this, combined with other mathematical calculations, the system can develop a highly accurate and scientific tool. By revealing some before-unseen scientific information about films, video-shorts, mobile videos, music videos, videogames, advertisings, video clips and television programs, among others we can use that to better understand the art and man's desire to be engulfed in compelling entertainment.","The invention has been described with references to a preferred embodiment.
