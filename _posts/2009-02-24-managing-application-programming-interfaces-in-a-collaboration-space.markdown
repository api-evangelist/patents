title: Managing application programming interfaces in a collaboration space
abstract: Embodiments relate to systems and methods for managing application programming interfaces in a collaboration space. A collaboration space, such as a wiki site, can host a set of collaboration tools and resources, including, for example, content tools, communication tools, and other resources for the users of the space. The collaboration space can also incorporate and expose a set of application programming interfaces, such as command and data-passing structures to permit users to invoke applications and/or services from within the wiki site or other collaboration space. The set of applications/services be hosted on a remote server or co-hosted on the collaboration server, and can include, for instance, database, spreadsheet, media content, or other applications or services. The invoked applications/services can return data to the requesting user via the collaboration space. Users can subscribe to different applications and/or services available via the collaboration space.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD","BACKGROUND OF RELATED ART","DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present teachings relate to systems and methods for managing one or more third-party application programming interfaces in a collaboration space, and more particularly to platforms and techniques for deploying and managing wiki sites or other collaboration spaces, in which the space or site is equipped to expose a set of application programming interfaces and other resources to permit users of the space to invoke third-party applications or services.","Community collaboration platforms and websites are known which allow members from a public or private community to contribute to or modify content which is shared on the platforms and websites. One form or type of these platforms and related websites is known as \u201cwikis.\u201d In one use, software developers can utilize wikis as a platform for the developers and the community to submit updates, report problems, post fixes, exchange messages and\/or the like with the goal to help develop applications and other software or services. Opening up the platform to a community often facilitates the development of the software by providing users a platform to easily and freely submit bug fixes, updates and ideas.","Existing collaboration platforms and software wikis, however, provide no mechanism to allow users to call third party applications or services directly from the wiki site. In other words, software development sites organized as wikis often contain content-management resources to accept source code, comments, email, or other content exchanges. However, those sites do not incorporate programming interfaces to permit contributors to the wiki to invoke third-party databases, messaging tools, or other software or services from within the wiki framework itself. It may be desirable to provide methods and systems for managing a wiki site or other collaboration space which include direct interfacing capabilities to third-party or other applications or services.","Embodiments of the present teachings relate to systems and methods for managing one or more third-party application programming interfaces in a collaboration space. More particularly, embodiments relate to platforms and techniques to support a wiki site or other collaboration space, configured to expose a set of application programming interfaces (APIs) which permit a user to invoke third-party applications or services from within the collaboration space.","In implementations, the collaboration space can in general permit a set of users to access the collaboration space, and upload, access and download content to and from the collaboration space. The content can include, for example, email content or tools, code archive content or tools, instant messaging or other messaging content or tools, calendar or scheduling content or tools, or other content, tools, or resources to help manage the content posted to and maintained by the wiki site or other collaboration space. In embodiments, the collaboration space can be supported by a collaboration server or other host. In embodiments, the collaboration server or other resources used to support the collaboration space can be extracted or maintained in a cloud computing environment.","According to embodiments, the collaboration space can likewise be configured to host or contain a set of application programming interfaces (APIs) to permit a user to invoke or access one or more third-party applications or services, from within the collaboration space. A user who uploads a set of software stress test data can, for instance, invoke or access the application programming interface for a third-party database to transmit that data to a separately hosted instance of that database, to analyze and return reports based on the data shared through that hosted API. In embodiments, the third-party application or service can be hosted in the server supporting the collaboration space itself, or on remote servers.","In implementations, the collaboration space can further be configured to incorporate a set of local executable application resources that can include, for example, available application language or other interpreters, compilers, runtime environments, or other application resources to allow applications to be directly hosted and execute in the collaboration space, itself. In embodiments, the resulting wiki site or other collaboration site or space can be referred to as a \u201cpiki\u201d site or space. In embodiments, the set of hosted applications that reside or are instantiated in the collaboration space, can be configured as Web applications. The hosted Web applications can be served to one or more of the set of users, directly from the collaboration space.","Reference will now be made in detail to exemplary embodiments of the present teachings, which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Where possible the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","132","110","110","112","132","110","110","112"]},"The collaboration space  can be generated or supported by a collaboration server . Collaboration server  can communicate with a data store  to store and manage code, content, applications, APIs, and\/or other resources related to collaboration space . Collaboration server  can likewise comprise a set of content management resources , a set of API resources , and a set of executable application resources . Set of content management resources  can comprise software and\/or other tools to receive, maintain, and provide access to messaging, code, and other content or media hosted in collaboration space . Set of API resources  can comprise software and\/or other resources or tools to support set of APIs  for any one or more third-party applications, tools, services, and\/or other resources through which a user in set of users  can invoke one or more applications in set of applications\/services .","Set of API resources  can for instance include a library of APIs registered to collaboration space  via collaboration server . The registered APIs in set of API resources  can include for instance definitions of commands, variables, parameters, data types, and\/or other specifications to permit a user to pass requests, parameters, and\/or other data back and forth to set of applications\/services . In embodiments, one or more individual applications and\/or services in set of applications\/services  can be hosted in a remote or separate application server . In embodiments, one or more individual applications and\/or services in set of applications\/services  can in addition or instead be hosted in collaboration server , itself.","According to embodiments, set of users  can for instance be entitled to invoke or access individual applications and\/or services in set of applications\/services based on an authorization or subscription profile. One user in set of users  can, for example, maintain a subscription to Web-based database applications or services, along with media download services, entitling that user to access and exchange data with an online data store, and\/or download audio or other content. In embodiments, different users can maintain different access privileges for different applications and\/or services in set of applications\/services . In embodiments, some or all users can be provided with common access rights to defined APIs in set of API resources .","In implementations, when provided, set of executable application resources  can comprise software and\/or other tools to maintain, configure, and\/or execute or instantiate set of applications  or other software within collaboration space . Set of executable application resources  can comprise, for instance, application language frameworks, compilers or interpreters such as, for example, Python, PERL, Java\u2122, Ruby on Rails, Visual Basic\u2122 available from Microsoft Corp., Struts, or other languages, platforms, and\/or other resources. Set of executable application resources  can comprise a Web application framework to permit collaboration server  to serve applications to one or more users in a set of users  via one or more networks . One or more networks  can be or include the Internet, or other public or private networks. Set of users  can include, for instance, anonymous public users, registered or authenticated users, or other users who wish to access collaboration space , for example, to participate in the development of applications or other software. The set of applications  can include, for example, applications such as software development applications, for instance, debugging tools, performance metric tools, or other applications. In embodiments, set of applications  can include applications migrated by users to the collaboration space , and can include one or more Web application to be served to requesting users. In embodiments, set of applications  can be provided in addition to set of APIs . In embodiments, set of APIs  can be provided in collaboration space  without a separate set of applications .","As shown in , in operation the collaboration space  can present a set of content , set of APIs , and set of applications  to any one or more users in the set of users  who access the collaboration space . In embodiments, one or more applications and\/or services in the set of applications\/services  can be invoked or accessed via the set of APIs  presented in collaboration space . A user can, for example, transmit a set of digital photographs to collaboration space  with a request to store that content to an online photo store. In embodiments, the user can access an underlying application or service in set of applications\/services  hosted on application server  or elsewhere to upload, store, and perform photo correction, printing, or other operations on that content. In embodiments, for further example, the user can invoke an API for a database or spreadsheet application to generate a report on data provided by the user. In embodiments, the reports, data, or other outputs or information generated by set of applications\/services  can be communicated to the requesting user in the form of third-party application data . In embodiments, set of applications\/services  and associated set of APIs  can be configured to accept APIs, applications, services or other resources uploaded by users of collaboration space . Other applications, services, and other resources can be invoked via set of APIs , and other sets or types of output can be generated and\/or exchanged via set of APIs .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["102","110","110","108","118","102","124","126","130","130","124","116","124","128","118","124","126","128","116","124","104","134","106","110","110"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["402","404","110","102","406","102","104","110","408","102","134","410","102","132","110","412","102","108","414","102"]},"In , the collaboration server  can act to invoke the corresponding application and\/or service in set of applications\/services , for instance, by communicating with a remote application server  and\/or by executing internal applications or services.
