title: Method for the data exchange between network devices
abstract: Two or more electronic devices are connected via a bus system building a cluster or chain of devices. A device can be selected using a control device, wherein an user interface for the selected device is generated based on description data which are stored in the selected device and are transferred to the control device. A single user interface is shown on a display of the control device which allows to operate at least two devices simultaneously. The user interface of a first device is displayed as main user interface and the user interface of a second device is rendered within the main interface as reduced user interface which includes only operation elements necessary for operation of the second device in combination with the first device.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims the benefit, under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7365 of International Application PCT\/EP01\/11747, filed Oct. 11, 2001, which was published in accordance with PCT Article 21(2) on May 2, 2002 in English and which claims the benefit of European patent application No. 00122864.2, filed Oct. 20, 2000.","The invention relates to a method for the data exchange between network devices, especially to the data exchange between two HAVi devices connected via IEEE1394 bus.","For controlling several AV devices within a network of home entertainment products the so-called HAVi (Home Audio Video Interoperability) standard has been developed. This standard specifies the control of television sets, video recorders, set top boxes and other devices, especially for the control of the exchange of digital audio and video streams. The devices are connected via the IEEE 1394 bus (i.LINK\u00ae or Fire-Wire\u00ae), which has enough capacity to simultaneously carry multiple digital audio and video streams.","Each device added to the HAVi network automatically installs its own application and interface software and is automatically registered by the system so that other devices know what it is capable of. So-called Application Programming Interfaces of the most common AV functions have been standardized. Furthermore, functions on a device within the HAVi networking system may be controlled from another device within the system.","HAVi defines two different ways of using User-Interfaces (UIs). Both solutions are working in principle in the same way: one device within the network (target) provide UI-elements or a kind of a complete UI to a display device (controller). The controller renders the UI-elements or executes the complete UI, respectively. The first mode is called Data Driven Interaction (DDI), the second one UI by havlets.","For a DDI-UI a part of a network is shown in . A display device  and a controlled device  are connected via an IEEE 1394 bus . The target device in the IEEE1394 network comprises a Device Control Module (DCM) , which can provide DDI-elements to the network for creating a UI. It is also able to control the device, natively, by commands.","Because a DCM is registered within the HAVi network, a DDI controller  can \u201csubscribe\u201d to the DCM . This is the start of an interaction between the DDI controller  and the DCM  to transmit the DDI-elements to the controller, display them to the user and afterwards to translate the user's action on these DDI-elements to native commands in the DCM.","It is one object of the invention to disclose a method for the data exchange between network devices which allows to simplify the simultaneous operation of two or more devices. This object is achieved by the method disclosed in claim .","The invention is based on the recognition of the following fact. The above described user interface is fine to control one device with its UI. However, the HAVi-standard shows a lack in setting up a service between two IEEE1394 devices, e.g. the copying of video-data from a camcorder to a VCR. This is because the user has to handle two UIs, on one he has to play the camcorder, on the other he has to set the VCR in record-mode.","In principle, according to the inventive method at least two devices are simultaneously operated with a single user interface, wherein the user interface of a first device is displayed as main user interface and the user interfaces of a second device is rendered within the main interface as reduced user interface which includes only operation elements necessary for operation of the second device in combination with the first device.","Advantageous additional embodiments of the inventive method are disclosed in the respective dependent claims.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["6","7","8"]},"Furthermore, a reduced user interface  is displayed which is provided by an other DCM. This reduced user interface  is generated as follows, wherein as an example the control device is a television set and the selected device is a camcorder.","Initially, the user sitting in front of the television set selects the camcorder on the television screen, e.g. by clicking on an icon representing the camcorder. As a result the user is provided with the main panel for controlling the camcorder.","Due to a registry scan of the controller, the user is able to provide possible sink and source devices within the network for the camcorder. So the controller is also able to render a\/two choice lists of sink\/source devices within the camcorder user interface. Two separate lists can be displayed, wherein the first list comprises sink devices and the second list comprises source devices. Also a combined list can be displayed which comprises sink devices and source devices. The sink\/source devices can be listed in text form or can be displayed by corresponding icons. The list(s) can also comprise further details of the sink\/source devices. So the kind of data streams processable by the devices can be displayed, e.g. source device for MPEG  audio and video signals.","When selecting, for example, a digital VCR as a sink device from the list, the HAVi-stream-setup between the camcorder and the digital VCR will be done by the controller. In addition the sink device's DCM (VCR) will provide a reduced user interface, which is also rendered within the main (camcorder) user interface and comprises only the elements of the VCR which are necessary for operation as a sink device, e.g. \u201crecord\u201d, \u201cplay\u201d, \u201cpause\u201d, \u201cforward\u201d, \u201crewind\u201d.","To help the controller rendering it's own elements within the DDI-targets UI, the DDI-target provide placeholder-elements for the sink\/source choice lists and the reduced UI and rendering attributes for these elements.","The interaction between the controller and the target starts in response to a subscribe command send from the controller to the target. The target memorizes the software element which sent this message and returns identification data (ID). The controller uses this ID as an argument for a command for obtaining the complete content of the DDI element for rendering on the display of the controller device. Contrary to the current HAVi specification the DDI-target must provide not only one RootPanelID for building the main UI, but it should provide 3 PanelIDs, one for each the MainRootPanel, the reduced SinkPanel and the reduced SourcePanel. These three PanelIDs can be specified independently. However, it is also possible to specify directly only the PanelID for the MainRootPanel and to specify further that the two following PanelIDs correspond to the reduced SinkPanel and reduced SourcePanel, respectively.","In addition, certain functions of the sink and source devices can be combined, e.g. the camcorder UI's \u2018play\u2019 button and the sink UI's \u2018record\u2019 button can be replaced by one \u2018copy to\u2019 button. This not only enhances the clarity of the displayed user interface but also simplifies the simultaneous operation of the devices. For this handling it is mandatory that a \u2018play\u2019 button of a general UI must have the attribute \u2018start source\u2019 and a \u2018record\u2019 button of a general UI must have the attribute \u2018start sink\u2019. Further on, the attributes \u2018start source\u2019 and \u2018start sink\u2019 must not assigned to more the one DDI-element of the whole UI, each. Respectively, a \u201cstop source\u201d and \u201cstop sink\u201d for the \u201cstop\u201d button or a \u201cpause source\u201d and \u201cpause sink\u201d for the \u201cpause\u201d button can be used for a general UI.","The invention can be used for the simultaneous operation of two or more bus connected electronic devices, especially of two or more HAVi devices connected via IEEE1394 bus."],"heading":["BACKGROUND","INVENTION","EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"DRAWING","p":"Embodiments of the invention are described with reference to , which shows a network including a display device connected to a controlled device, and , which shows an user interface according to the inventive method."},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
