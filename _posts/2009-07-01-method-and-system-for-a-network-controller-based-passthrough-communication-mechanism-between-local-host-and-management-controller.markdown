title: Method and system for a network controller based pass-through communication mechanism between local host and management controller
abstract: A network controller in a communication device may be operable to route local host-management traffic between a local host and a management controller within the communication device, wherein the local host may be operable to utilize its network processing resources and function during communication of the local host-management traffic. A dedicated management port may be configured in the network controller to enable receiving and/or transmitting local host-management traffic communicated from and/or to the local host separate from the local host's network traffic communicated via the network controller. The host-management traffic is communicated between the network controller and the management controller via NC-SI interface. The management controller may be assigned Internet protocol (IP) based addressing information for use during routing of local host-management traffic. The IP addressing information may be preset statically, assigned automatically from a list of available addresses, or configured dynamically via a DHCP server function.

For example, the remote management agent  and\/or the management service  may enable utilizing WS-Management and\/or ASF messaging, via the management connection , to enable management operations between the management device  and the network device .","The ASF protocol is a first generation management standard that may be utilized to perform out-of-band management operations, where network devices may be managed remotely by system administrators. The ASF protocol based management may comprise use of User Datagram Protocol (UDP) based stack to enable communication between management devices and network devices. Devices comprising ASF functionality and\/or interfaces may be ASF capable, wherein said devices may perform management operations via ASF messages. For example, in instances where the network device  may be ASF capable, the management device  may utilize ASF based messaging to perform management of the network device .","More recently, the WS-Management protocol has been developed as the next generation management protocol. WS-Management is based on Web Services, which typically utilize SOAP (XML based messaging) and\/or HTTP(S) as a SOAP transport for communications. SOAP over HTTP(S) may require use of HTTP\/TLS\/TCP stack implementation, which may ensure improved security, reliability, and OS-independence. Within the WS-Management protocol, the Common Information Model (CIM) has been defined to provide object oriented representation of management data and\/or managed subsystem which may be utilized during WS-Management operations.

The management device  and\/or the network device  may utilize network cards (NIC) to enable sending and\/or receiving network traffic via the management connection . Network controllers that may be utilized in the management device  and\/or the network device  may process network traffic that may comprise WS-Management based messaging, which may be transmitted and\/or received via TCP\/IP packets.","In an exemplary aspect of the invention, the network device  may be configured to enable performing management operations locally, by interacting directly, for example, with the network device , utilizing similar mechanisms as the ones used during remote management operations.

For example, the system  may be integrated in, and\/or may correspond to various components in the network device , and may enable the network device  to participate in WS-Management and\/or ASF management operations, substantially as described in .","The network controller  may comprise suitable logic, circuitry, code, and\/or interfaces which may enable processing of the network traffic . The network traffic  may comprise received and\/or transmitted network packets communicated via a network connection, for example an Ethernet (IEEE 802.3) connection. The network traffic  may comprise packets that are sent to and\/or from the local host , which may be communicated between the network controller  and the local host  via the host traffic . The host traffic  may be communicated via one or more connections based on one or more interfaces. For example, the host traffic  may be communicated via a Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCI-E) bus.","The network controller  may also be operable to communicate with the management controller  to enable exchange of management based messaging and\/or data, via the management traffic , which may be communicated between the management controller  and external devices, for example. In that regard, the management traffic  may comprise data and\/or messages that may be transmitted and\/or received in the system  during management operations. For example, the management traffic  may comprise WS-Management based messaging communicated by the system  to enable performing of WS-Management services. The management traffic  may be communicated, for example, via Network Controller Sideband Interface (NC-SI) based connections.","The management controller  may comprise suitable logic, circuitry, code, and\/or interfaces that may enable managing and\/or controlling management based operations. The management controller  may be operable to process management messaging and\/or data, received and\/or transmitted via the network controller  for example, which may be based on a specific management standard including the WS-Management standard for example. In that regard, the management controller  may be operable to determine and\/or perform management operations based on the WS-Management stack. The management controller  may also be operable to interact with other components in the system  to communicate, manage, control, and\/or process management messaging and\/or data. For example, the management controller  may be enabled to communicate with the local host  to enable performing management operations that are requested and\/or controlled locally and\/or directly via the system . The management controller  may communicate directly with the local host  via a Low Pin Count (LPC) bus, for example.","In operation, the network controller  may enable processing network traffic . In the downlink direction, the network controller  may be operable to process network packets to separate and\/or route inbound host-based and management-based messaging. In the uplink direction, the network controller  may be operable to receive messages which originate from the local host  and\/or the management controller . The network controller  may then generate network packets that may be communicated external to the system , by the network traffic . The management controller  may be utilized, in the system , to handle the processing management messages and\/or data received from external devices and\/or systems, and\/or to perform, manage, and\/or control management operations, based on the WS-Management standard for example.","In an exemplary aspect of the invention, the management controller  may be operable to perform, manage, and\/or control management operations that may be initiated and\/or requested directly and\/or locally in the system . local interactions with the system  may be facilitated via, for example, a web browser-based interface, which may be supported via the local host . The local host  may communicate the management commands and\/or requests to the management controller , and\/or receive management related data and\/or responses, via the host-management link . Direct interfacing between the management controller  and the local host  may be register based and\/or bus based, and may require dedicated communication transport stacks that may be unique to used interfaces. Communication via the host-management link  may utilize, for example, Keyboard Controller Style (KCS) based interfaces to facilitated communication via a LPC bus. Use of dedicated and\/or direct host-management interfacing, however, may not be desirable because it may require additional and\/or dedicated support via the local host  and\/or the management controller . The local host  may also need to have knowledge about the management controller  and\/or the local host , and\/or their available interfacing capabilities, to facilitate such direct interfacing. This may also lead to requiring use of separate communication stacks, via the local host  and\/or management controller , based on the whether management communication, via the local host , is local or remote. In addition, use of dedicated host-management link (e.g., via LPC bus) may degrade performance due to limitations in data transfer rates. In additional, delays may also be caused by necessary interface-specific processing on both ends. For example, in cases where a WS-Management stack is utilized, in the local host , to perform management operations requested remotely, a different stack, an IPMI based stack for example, may be utilized to enable use of LPC based interface to communicate with the management controller . Therefore, different application programming interface (API) and\/or access protocol may be used and\/or needed during direct host-management controller interaction via the host-management link .","Accordingly, in various embodiments of the invention, the network controller  may be operable to provide pass-through routing support, wherein the local host-management controller traffic may be communicated via the network controller  to make use of, for example, already existing interfaces between the network controller , and the local host  and the management controller , respectively. For example, a local host-management routing functionality may be provided via the network controller , which may enable communication of management messages and\/or data between the local host  and the management controller  using existing network processing function in the local host , such the management messages and\/or data may be communicated as network messages. Accordingly, the network controller  may be operable to provide pass-through communication support to facilitate local host-management traffic routing, wherein the network controller  may provide and\/or support, for example, control and\/or configuration logic, packet filtering capabilities, and\/or communication interfaces to enable such communication between the local host  and the management controller .","Various methods may be utilized to enable providing pass-through routing support via the network controller . The pass-through routing may be provided based on virtual local area network (VLAN). The local host  and\/or the management controller  may utilize, for example, virtual network interface controller (VNIC) based functionality to enable local host-management communication via the network controller . The local host-management traffic may be, for example, filtered in the network controller  based on source MAC addressing information and\/or virtual local area network (VLAN) information, where the VLAN operations, which may comprise VLAN tag insertion and\/or stripping, may be done within the network controller  during routing of local host-management traffic. The pass-through routing support via the network controller  may also be provided based on packet filtering within the network controller , where the local host-management traffic packets may be communicated by the local host  and\/or the management controller  identical to communication of external traffic packets. Alternatively, interfacing to the management controller , via the network controller , may be presented to the local host  as an interface that is similar but separate and\/or distinct from the local host's external networking interface via the network controller . In some instances, use of the external network access of the local host  and\/or the management controller via the network controller , however, may present some challenges. For example, local host-management communication, via the network controller , may not be available when the system  loses external network access because as far the local host  is concerned, the network is perceived to be down. In addition, even in cases where there may be external network access, if messaging intended for the management controller  is communicated as outbound network traffic, messages may be communicated by the network controller  external to the system . Because switching standards prevent resending packets received in network switches via the same ports they were received on, the network packets carrying host-management messaging may not be send back to the network controller  to be sent to the management controller . Accordingly, in an exemplary embodiment of the invention, local host-management pass-through routing support may be provided via the network controller  such that communication of management messages and\/or data between the local host  and the management controller  may utilize existing network processing in the local host , but may be performed distinct from the local host's external network messaging. This functionality may enable the local host  to send and\/or receive management data via the host traffic  using unique and\/or dedicated interfacing parameters during local host-management communication such that the controller  may then be operable to distinguish between external traffic and local management traffic which may be communicated directly between the network controller  and the management controller , via the management traffic .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 2B","FIG. 2B","FIG. 2B"],"b":["202","204","230","232","234","240","242","244","250","252","254","256","258"]},"The network-side PHY\/MAC processing module  may comprise suitable logic, circuitry, code, and\/or interfaces that may enable performing PHY and MAC processing operations within the network controller  during external transmission and\/or reception of data.

The data transferred via the RMII function  may comprise, for example, Ethernet frames that may comprise PHY\/MAC addressing information. Communication between the network controller  and the management controller  may be performed based on the network controller sideband interface (NC-SI), which is a DMTF protocol that defines interfacing between a management controllers and network controllers during transmission and\/or reception of management traffic by the management controllers via the network controllers, during out-of-band management operations for example.

For example, the network controller  may receive packets from the local host  via the host interface  and\/or from the management controller  via the RMII function . In step , a determination of whether the received packets correspond to host-management controller traffic may be performed in the network controller . For example, with regard to packets received from the local host , the determination may be made based on the port via which they were received. Packets received via the management port  may be determined to correspond to local host-management controller traffic while Packets received via the external networking port  may be determined to correspond to external network traffic communication. A determination of the destination of packets received from the management controller  may be made based on the outbound management packet filtering module . In instances where it may be determined that packets received in the network controller  do not correspond to local host-management controller traffic; the exemplary steps may proceed to step . In step , external network traffic routing operations may be performed by the network controller . For example, packets received from the local host , via the external networking port , and\/or from the management controller  may be processed via the network-side PHY\/MAC processing module  for transmission as network packets.","Returning to step , in instances where it may be determined that packets received in the network controller  correspond to local host-management controller traffic; the exemplary steps may proceed to step . In step , local host-management controller traffic packets may be communicated to the management controller , based on the NC-SI interface, via the RMII function  and the management-side PHY\/MAC processing module , and\/or may be communicated to the local host  via the management port .","Various embodiments of the invention may comprise a method and system for a network controller based pass-through communication mechanism between local host and management controller. The network controller  may be operable to route local host-management traffic between a local host  and the management controller  within the system . The local host  may be operable to utilize its network processing resources and function during communication of the local host-management traffic via the network controller . The management port  may be configured in the host interface  in the network controller  to enable receiving and\/or transmitting local host-management traffic communicated from and\/or to the local host  while the networking port  in the host interface  is utilized to communicate the local host's network traffic  via the network controller . The local host-management traffic is communicated between the network controller  and the management controller  via a NC-SI interface, utilizing the RMII function , the network-side NC-SI command support , the management-side NC-SI command support , and management-side PHY\/MAC processing module , which are normally utilized to enable communicating management traffic communicated between the management controller  and external entities via the network controller .","The network controller  may be operable to utilize packet filtering to enable routing the local host-management traffic, based on, for example, different MAC\/IP addresses assigned to the management controller  for remote and local management operations, respectively. The management controller  may be assigned Internet protocol (IP) based addressing information, a MAC\/IP address for example, for use during routing of local host-management traffic. Accordingly, the packet filtering may be performed based on MAC\/IP addresses. The IP address assigned to the management controller  may be preset statically, assigned automatically from a predetermined list of available IP addresses, and\/or configured dynamically via a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server function, which may run within the management controller . The packet filtering may be performed on all received inbound packets, via the inbound network packet filtering module , and\/or on outbound management packets communicated via the outbound management packet filtering module  in the management controller . The local host  may be operable to discover availability of routing of local host-management traffic via the network controller , by querying the management controller  and\/or the network controller  for example. The query messaging performed during discovery operations may be performed using WS-Management and\/or Alert Standard Format (ASF) messages.","Another embodiment of the invention may provide a machine and\/or computer readable storage and\/or medium, having stored thereon, a machine code and\/or a computer program having at least one code section executable by a machine and\/or a computer, thereby causing the machine and\/or computer to perform the steps as described herein for a network controller based pass-through communication mechanism between local host and management controller.","Accordingly, the present invention may be realized in hardware, software, or a combination of hardware and software.
