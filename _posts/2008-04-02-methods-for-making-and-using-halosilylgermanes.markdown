No. 60\/909,505, filed 2 Apr. 2007; which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","The invention described herein was made in part with government support under grant number FA9550-06-01-0442, awarded by the U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research and grant DMR-0526604 and IIP-0638253, awarded by the National Science Foundation. The United States Government has certain rights in the invention.","The present application relates generally to the fields of chemistry, optoelectronics, silicon-germanium alloys, semiconductor structures, and related methods and devices.","Heteroepitaxial GeSilayers on Si(100) with high Ge contents are of interest due to many applications in key technologies such as solar cells, MEMS, quantum cascade lasers and Si-based photonics (see, Mooney, P. M.; Chu, J. O. 2000, 30, 335; and Tromp, R. M.; Ross, F. M. 2000, 30, 431), including high speed modulators and photodetectors (see, Kuo et al., 2005, 437, 1334). However, these materials are much less developed in spite of this high impact potential in IR optical devices. In addition, they serve as virtual substrates for growth of high mobility, strained Si and Ge device channels, and are also considered as a potential pathway to monolithic integration of III-V based devices with Si technologies (Lee et al., 2004, B 22 (1), 158; and Kasper, E.; Heim, S. 2004, 224, 3). The best current route to these materials is complicated and fraught with difficulties, requiring both high temperature growth of thick (>10 \u03bcm) compositionally graded films and a chemical-mechanical planarization step to relieve the misfit strain between the GeSiepilayer and Si substrate and produce a flat surface, respectively (see, Currie et al., 1998, 72 (14), 1718).","Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) methods that allow growth of Ge-rich (Ge\u226750 atom %) device-quality alloys on Si that cannot be obtained by conventional routes have been recently developed (see, Ritter et al., 2005, 127(27), 9855-9864; Hu et al., 2005, 87(18), 181903\/1-3; and Chizmeshya, et al., 2006, 128(21), 6919-6930). Ge-rich films can enable higher speeds in microprocessors, lower power consumption in cell phones, silicon-based photonics, and more efficient solar cells (see, Mooney and Chu, supra; and Tromp and Ross, supra). The technology utilizes previously unknown designer Si\u2014Ge hydride precursors to precisely control the chemical composition, morphology, and microstructure of the corresponding films, circumventing the need for thick graded layers and lift off techniques (see, Currie et al., supra).","To prepare such semiconductor structures, SiGealloys can be deposited selectively in, for example, the source and drain regions of a transistor architecture. Conventional selective growth of SiGealloys is achieved using high temperature reactions of chlorosilanes, germane and elemental Clwhich typically do not yield films with suitable morphology and microstructure in the high Ge concentration range. For example, selective growth of SiGealloys has been achieved using high temperature reactions of chlorosilanes, germane and elemental Cl. However, the complexity of the associated multicomponent reactions and the presence of corrosive Clcall for alternative approaches to selective growth. This need is particularly acute in the high Ge-concentration range, for which the chlorosilane route does not yield selectively deposited films with suitable morphology, microstructure or composition. Furthermore, for high Ge content the conventional processes lead to high dislocation densities, non-uniformities in strain, lack of compositional control, and reduced film thickness, all of which ultimately can degrade the quality and performance of the stressor material thereby limiting the practical usefulness of this approach.","Therefore, there exists a need in the art for methods for the deposition of SiGematerials, methods for the selective deposition of SiGematerials, and in particular, high Ge content SiGematerials on substrates which avoid the issues described above.","The invention provides methods for the preparation of compounds of the molecular formula SiGeHX, wherein X is halogen, and x, y, z, and a are defined herein.","The invention further provides compounds of the molecular formula SiGeHX, wherein X is halogen, and x, y, z, and a are defined herein.","The invention provides the substantially pure compounds prepared according to the methods of the invention.","The invention also provides methods for the preparation of semiconductor structures through the deposition of high-Ge content SiGefilms on substrates using the compounds of the invention.","The invention also provides methods for the selective deposition of a SiGelayer comprising contacting a substrate having a surface layer comprising at least two portions, wherein a first portion of the surface layer comprises a semiconductor surface layer and a second portion of the surface layer comprises an oxide, nitride, or oxynitride surface layer, wherein the SiGelayer is formed only on the first portion of the substrate.","The key building blocks of the new technology are the entire halo(germyl)silane sequence of molecules SiGeHX, where X is a halogen and the remaining variables are defined herein, which are obtained in viable high-purity yields via synthetic methodologies described herein. The inherent incorporation of the SiGemolecular core into the films provides unprecedented control of morphology, composition, and strain. Work in this area addresses a critical need for precursors and processes that deposit such films under low temperature CMOS compatible conditions with throughput rates that are significantly higher than those offered by existing processes.","Replacing some or all of the H atoms on the silicon atoms of a SiGeH, species with halogens, provide several desirable benefits, such as, built-in HX leaving groups that can function as cleaning agents for removal of impurities from the growth surface, in situ, during growth of the desired films. They can also promote selective growth of a variety of device structures (strained Si, SiGe and strained Ge) on patterned Si wafers. In general, selective growth of SiGefilms on Si surfaces with SiOpatterned features can be achieved during growth by generation of in situ etchants such as HCl, and promote selective growth of crystalline material on the unmasked areas around the patterned regions on the wafer. The larger mass of the halo(germyl)silanes provides an increased kinetic stability allowing growth to be conducted at even lower temperatures than with SiGehydrides, for example, HSiGeH.","In a first aspect, the invention provides a method for the preparation of compounds of the molecular Formula (I),\n\nSiGeHX\u2003\u2003(I)\n\nwherein x is 1, 2, 3, or 4; y is 1, 2, 3, or 4; z is 2(x+y+1); a is 1 to 3x; and X is halogen, provided that (i) each X is bonded only to Si; and (ii) the sum of x and y is less than or equal to 5, comprising the step of, treating a compound of the molecular Formula (II),\n\nSiGeH\u2003\u2003(II)\n\nwith a compound of the formula BX, AlX, or a metal chlorinating agent, at a temperature of about \u221280\u00b0 C. to about 25\u00b0 C.; such a method is referred to hereafter as Method A.\n","As demonstrated herein, compounds according to Formula (I) can be used, for example, in controlled depositions to produce stoichiometric SiGefilms possessing desired properties for semiconductor applications including perfectly crystalline and epitaxial microstructures, smooth morphologies, and uniformly strain-relaxed states. The compounds of Formula (I) are herein demonstrated to be remarkably stable over extended periods of time, and thus represent viable molecular sources for potential industrial applications.","Compounds according to this aspect of the invention include any conformational form of the compound, including but not limited n, g, and iso-forms of the compounds, and combinations thereof.","Exemplary silicon-germanium hydrides starting materials of Formula (II) for the methods according to this aspect of the invention comprise or consist of those compounds listed in Table 1. All Si and Ge atoms in the compounds are tetravalent. In the isobutane- and isopentane-like isomers, the Si and Ge atoms inside the brackets are directly bound to the Si or Ge to the left of the brackets; the Si or Ge in parenthesis outside of the brackets at the far right in some of the compounds are directly bound to the last Si or Ge inside of the

In mismatched heteroepitaxy applications these materials exhibit copious dislocations (at levels unacceptable for most device applications), strain non-uniformities and high surface roughness. A distinct and important advantage of our compounds, films, and methods over conventional ones is that the incorporation of the entire Si\u2014Ge molecular core promotes the formation of exceptionally uniform bonding arrangements over the entire crystal, leading to relaxed (or uniformly stressed) films with planar surface morphology (no surface ripples). A crucial advantage is the unprecedented low growth temperatures which reduce surface mobility of the Si and Ge atoms and prevent mass segregation thereby resulting in highly uniform compositional and strain profiles at the atomic level.","The intact incorporation of the massive Si\/Ge cores into the film also leads to low surface diffusion and high sticking coefficients compared to the conventional low mass compounds. The high reactivity promotes high growth rates which increase systematically with the mass of the precursors","Furthermore, the incorporation of the entire Si\/Ge framework of the chemical vapor into the lattice is particularly important in the formations of SiGenanoscale systems (quantum dots and wires) because it allows precise control of morphology, tunable composition, and structure that cannot be accomplished by vapor deposition of separate silanes and germanes, or by molecular beam epitaxy of solid Si and Ge sources. The precise control of composition and corresponding morphology, both of which ultimately determine the physical properties of these nanoscale materials is a crucial issue. Any compositional variations that exist within and among individual nanostructures will have a significant impact on the optical and electronic properties and on the performance of devices. In the MBE case an average concentration is assigned on the basis of the flux ratio utilized to grow the materials. In the CVD approach the local stoichiometry on the scale of the nanostructure size is even less certain because reactions of various molecular sources cannot be simultaneously controlled at every site throughout the sample. Thus neither technique can guarantee systematic growth of Si\u2014Ge nanoscale structures with controllable composition, strain and size.","Such highly defined patterns can be determined using standard methods in the art, such as neutron diffraction.","In further aspect, the invention provides semiconductor structures, comprising a substrate and an Si\u2014Ge layer comprising or consisting of a backbone of one or more compounds according to any one of the formulas (I)-(XXIV).

A typical reaction was allowed to proceed at 0\u00b0 C. for 2 hours and produced pure single phase material in significant yields (\u02dc40%) based on the amount of the starting hydride material used. The latter was recovered under these optimum conditions and was recycled in subsequent preparations. Attempts to increase the yield by extending the reaction time generated mixtures of monochloro compound 1 with minor amounts of the di-substituted derivative ClSi(GeH)(2). To enhance formation of (2), we increased the Cl activity in the reaction medium by using higher molar ratios of BCland SiH(GeH). For a stoichiometric 2:3 combination of the reactants as described by Eq 2 we obtained a mixture of (1) and (2) in yields of 20% and 15%, respectively indicating a significant increase of the second chlorination at the Si center, as expected.\n\n2BCl+3SiH(GeH)\u2192BH+3ClSi(GeH)\u2003\u2003(2)\n\nWhen the chlorine activity was further increased by combining the reactants in \u02dc1:1 molar ratio the ClSi(GeH)(2) species was predominately produced (20% yield) while the formation of ClHSi(GeH)(1) was essentially suppressed (1% yield). In both cases copious amounts of diborane byproducts were evolved in addition to a polymeric solid which was present in quantities insufficient for a reliable characterization. Pure compound 2 was then isolated as a volatile (vapor pressure of 7 Torr at 22\u00b0 C.) colorless liquid by trap-to-trap distillation.\n","(b) Synthetic routes to ClSi(GeH)(3): The preparation of compound 3 was initially explored by stoichiometric 3:1 combinations of SiH(GeH)and BCl. These typically produced mixtures of the ClSi(GeH)and SiH(GeH)compounds which were impossible to separate due to the similarity in their boiling points. Prolonged reaction times eventually led to the formation of nonvolatile polymeric solids which are likely derived from the decomposition of polychlorinated trisilylgermanes. This indicates that over time the chlorination occurs at the Ge sites in addition to Si eventually producing unstable products. However, the preparation of compound 3 was readily obtained in \u02dc20% yield at 0\u00b0 C. and a 10 minute reaction time using a 1:1 molar ratio of SiH(GeH)and BCl. Pure compound 3 is a stable, colorless liquid with a room temperature vapor pressure of \u02dc2 Torr.","(c) Chlorination of bridging Si sites in butane-like (GeH)(SiH): The chlorination studies of (HGe)SiHhave shown that the Si site is preferentially chlorinated to produce a range of new compounds. However, in the case of the simplest SiHGeHspecies this prior work established that consecutive chlorinations of terminal Si\u2014H bonds is difficult to achieve. On the other hand the chlorination of propane-like molecules containing bridging SiHsingle centers such as SiH(GeH)is much more straightforward. This is also found to be the case for the isostructural trisilane SiH(GeH),where its bridging SiHis the most susceptible site to full chlorination while the terminal Si\u2014H bonds are significantly less prone to this type of substitution. In view of this reaction behavior, we pursued a brief study to explore chlorination of related Si\u2014Ge based macromolecules that offer a greater capacity for Si\u2014H substitutions at bridging sites. These compounds are designed not to contain terminal Si\u2014H bonds but rather incorporate highly reactive \u2014SiH\u2014SiH\u2014 based linkages, exclusively. The simplest candidate that fulfills these criteria is the butane-like (SiH)(GeH)species which we have previously prepared and studied in detail from a fundamental and practical perspective. The availability of two equivalent reaction sites in this molecule makes the order and degree of chlorination of fundamental interest and represents a natural extension of our synthetic strategy to produce an entire genus of halogenated Si\u2014Ge macromolecular hydride derivatives containing SiGe, GeSiGe, and GeSiSiGe cores. Finally in view of our success in reconciling simulated structural and spectroscopic properties with experiment for the simpler members of this family we undertook a systematic study of the entire sequence of ClHSi(GeH)(n=1-4) molecules and all possible conformations to explore the reaction trends in this more complex system.","f) Synthesis and characterizations of ClHSiSiH(GeH)(4) and ClHSi(GeH): The mono substituted ClHSiSiH(GeH)(4) species was readily obtained by reacting an excess of BClwith (SiH)(GeH)in a 2:3 ratio. A typical reaction time of one hour at an optimum temperature of 0\u00b0 C. yielded diborane, but also a small amount of unreacted starting material was recovered under these conditions as confirmed by NMR. Efforts to achieved full conversion of (SiH)(GeH)using longer reaction times and higher temperatures produced intractable polymeric solids that could not be fully characterized. Compound 4 was isolated by distillation as a colorless liquid with a nominal vapor pressure of \u02dc2 Torr. Its Si spectrum showed two peaks due to the SiHand SiHCl moieties at \u221297.0 and \u221215.0 ppm, respectively. These are down-shifted with respect to the SiHresonance (\u2212105.0) of the starting material and are consistent with a single chlorine substitution at the Si center. The H spectra revealed a triplet (3.05), a pentet (3.33) a sextet (5.02) and a doublet (3.26) corresponding to protons bonded in the sequence of GeH\u2014SiH\u2014SiHCl\u2014GeH. The integrated intensities, the coupling patterns and the positions of the peaks collectively point to this atomic arrangement. The shift corresponding to the Ge\u2014H furthest from the Cl site (3.05) is close to that of the starting material (3.11) while the shift of the Ge\u2014H adjacent to the SiHCl is slightly downshifted (3.26). The SiHpeak (3.33) is remarkably close to that of the starting material (3.29) and to other bridging SiHligands in silygermane compounds. The sextet corresponding to the SiHCl (5.02) is significantly down shifted due to the presence of Cl and is close to the one observed in ClHSi(GeH)(5.07). The molecular structure is further confirmed with 2-D H COSY which yielded the following correlations: (i) The 3.26 (doublet) and the 5.02 (sextet) are associated with \u2014GeH\u2014SiHCl\u2014, (ii) the 5.02 (sextet) and 3.33 (pentet) are associated with \u2014SiHCl\u2014SiH\u2014 and (iii) the 3.33 (pentet) an 3.05 (triplet) are associated with \u2014SiH\u2014GeH\u2014. The H-Si HMQC NMR corroborated the latter assignments and indicated direct couplings between the Si (\u221297) and the H (3.33, pentet), and between the Si (\u221215) and the H (5.02, sextet).","The dichlorinated ClHSi(GeH)species was obtained as a mixture of two substitutional isomers, ClSiSiH(GeH)and (ClHSi)(HGe). Liquid samples with vapor pressure of \u02dc1 Torr were prepared by reactions of BCland (SiH)(GeH)in a 1:1 ratio at 0\u00b0 C. The reaction time in this case was considerably reduced to \u02dc20 minutes compared to the mono-chlorination, to avoid formation, or mitigate decomposition, of unstable byproducts that were also produced under these conditions. The very close boiling points of the dichlorinated ClSiSiH(GeH)and (ClHSi)(HGe)derivatives precluded their individual separation by normal distillation or fractionation techniques. Accordingly their identity was established and their structures were primarily elucidated by H, and Si NMR including 2D H COSY and H-Si HMQC analyses. For the (ClHSi)(HGe)species the proton NMR spectra showed a doublet at 3.26 ppm due to the terminal GeHprotons and a pentet at 4.98 ppm corresponding to the bridging SiH protons. The integrated intensity ratio of the GeHand SiH peaks were found to be 3:1 respectively, as expected. The H spectra also displayed three additional peaks at 3.43 (singlet), 3.42 (quartet) and 3.07 ppm (triplet) which were assigned to the GeH, SiHand GeHprotons of the sequence contained in the HGe\u2014SiCl\u2014SiH\u2014GeHspecies. The Si spectra of the samples exhibited three distinct resonances at 24.4, \u221288.7 and \u221217.0 ppm corresponding to the SiCland SiHof HGe\u2014SiCl\u2014SiH\u2014GeHand SiH of (ClHSi)(HGe), respectively. Note that the SiHSi resonance of the ClSiSiH(GeH)is significantly shifted downfield (\u221288.7) with respect to the starting material (\u2212105) due to the presence of the chlorine atoms bound to the adjacent silicon. The proposed structures of (ClHSi)(HGe)and ClSiSiH(GeH)are further confirmed by a 2D H COSY spectrum, which only show two sets of crosspeaks correlating to Ge\u2014H and Si\u2014H resonances at 3.26 and 4.98 ppm as well as 3.07 and 3.42 ppm, respectively. The H-Si HMQC spectrum revealed that the protons at 4.98 and 3.42 ppm are directly coupled to Si resonances at \u221217.0 and \u221288.7.","Simulation Studies of ClHHSiGe Molecules","A primary goal was to elucidate, on energetic and structural grounds, the chlorination trends of HSiGeH. The list of compounds presented in Table 3 is augmented to include the ClSiGeHspecies as well as the compounds HSiGeHCl, HSiGeHClwith Cl atoms bound exclusively to Ge. The latter have tentatively observed but not on a reproducible basis. This is presumably due to their relative instability with respect to decomposition or additional chlorinations at their Si sites to produce molecules containing at most four chlorine atoms combined, as observed.","We calculated standard reaction free energies, \u0394Gat 298 K, following the generalized reaction given in Eq.

J. Frisch et al. 03, Revision B.04, Gaussian Inc 2003). The vibrational spectra of all ClHSi\u2014GeHmolecules exhibit positive definite vibrational frequencies, indicating that the ground state structures are dynamically stable. It is noteworthy that a coarse structure optimization of the ClHSi\u2014GeHmolecule produces a soft mode corresponding to internal GeHrotation. A summary of key molecular properties is presented in Table 4, which compares the dipole moments, rotational constants, bond lengths and bond angles across the sequence. The dipole moment increases significantly with the substitution of chlorine into the silyl unit of the molecules, ranging from \u02dc0.15 D HSi\u2014GeHto 10-fold this value (1.67 D) in ClSi\u2014GeH. The structural bonding trends through the sequence are unremarkable, with principal bonds exhibiting little variation with respect to the inclusion of chlorine. For example, the Si\u2014Ge, Ge\u2014H and Si\u2014H bonds change by less than a few parts per thousand throughout the molecular sequence while the largest variation is found in the Si\u2014Cl bonds, which decrease by several % in going from ClHSi\u2014GeHto ClSi\u2014GeH. The bond-angle variations are also generally small, and the trend reveals an increase in both the H\u2014Si\u2014Ge and Cl\u2014Si\u2014Ge angles with chlorine content. The H\u2014Ge\u2014Si angles also exhibit a minor systematic decrease consistent with increased long range repulsion between the germyl protons and the chlorine atoms. Also listed in Table 3 is the ground state electronic energy (E) of all molecules together with the latter values corrected for zero point energy (ZPE), thermal energy (\u0394E), enthalpy (\u0394H) and free energy (\u0394G) at 300 K.","Symmetry analysis of the optimized ground state structures indicates that the end member molecules, HSi\u2014GeHand ClSi\u2014GeH, are both prolate symmetric tops possessing Csymmetry, while the mono- and di-chlorinated variants are asymmetric tops possessing a lower Csymmetry. The vibrational spectra of the end members are therefore less complex than those of the less symmetric (x=1, 2) molecules. This is evident from Table 5 which lists the calculated infrared active vibrational features throughout the molecular sequence. Corresponding low and high frequency plots of the calculated spectra are presented in , respectively. No frequency scaling has been applied to these calculated spectra and mode assignments used in Table 5 follow the designations within these figures. In general, the high frequency spectra contain two primary features corresponding to asymmetric and symmetric Ge\u2014H stretches (2120-2160 cm) and their asymmetric and symmetric Si\u2014H counterparts (2220-2240 cm). The corresponding low frequency spectra (200-1200 cm) are significantly more complex, and general assignments (by frequency range) are as follows: (i) 120-160 cm: Si\u2014Cl rocking modes, (ii) 320-350 cm: Si\u2014Ge stretching, (iii) 520-530 cm: Si\u2014Cl stretches, (iv) 380-480 cm: asymmetrical GeH\/SiHrocking vibrations, (v) 740-800 cm: symmetric GeH\/SiHrocking vibrations and (vi) 800-950 cm: various GeHand SiHwagging vibrations. Among these modes the most intense infrared bands are those in group (v), designated as symmetric GeH\/SiHrocking modes. We note that the frequencies of these intense bands are essentially the same in the end member molecules, occurring at 796 cmin HSi\u2014GeHand 793 cmin ClSi\u2014GeH. These spectral features shift to lower frequencies 780 cmand 746 cmin the lower symmetry molecules, ClHSi\u2014GeHand ClHSi\u2014GeH, respectively.","A detailed comparison of the calculated and observed spectra of ClHSi\u2014GeHis presented in . Based on our prior simulation work using comparable basis sets and model chemistries (see, Chizmeshya et al., 2006, 128(21), 6919-6930) we have applied scale factors of 0.989 and 0.979 frequency scale factors to the calculated low- and high-frequency spectra, respectively. As can be seen from the figure the calculated frequencies and intensities match their experimental counterparts very closely, suggesting that the vibrational assignments for ClHSi\u2014GeHpresented in Table 4 are reliable. We note that a slight reduction in the scale factor used for the high frequency range ()) would improve the agreement further. Finally, the simple harmonic vibrational analysis presented here does not account for the splittings observed experimentally. We have investigated several possible origins for this splitting, including dimeric interactions and anharmonic effects. In the former case selective vibrational features are split when molecules are coupled depending upon their detailed relative configurations. The interaction strengths were calculated to be on the order of a tenth of a kcal\/mol, and therefore, unlikely to be operative at room temperature. The most likely origin of the systematic \u02dc12 cmsplittings observed is coupling to rotations in the asymmetrical top molecules. It is noteworthy that the splittings occur in all bands, including the high-frequency Ge\u2014H and Si\u2014H modes. This can be explained by the relatively low symmetry of the ClHSi\u2014GeHmolecule, which leads to A symmetries for all vibrational modes (e.g., no A\u2032 or A\u2033 symmetry vibrations). Using the rotational constants for the ClHSi\u2014GeHmolecule listed in Table 4, we have calculated the room temperature rotational band profiles corresponding to A-, B- and C-type contours using an asymmetrical top computer program. These are compared in  which indicates that the profiles are distinct and that the C-type contour closely matches to the observed absorption band shapes, and in particular the apparent splitting of approximately 13 cm.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0404","num":"0494"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00006","num":"00006"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"322pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 5"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Unscaled harmonic vibrational frequencies of the HSi\u2014GeH, ClHSi\u2014GeH, ClHSi\u2014GeH"},{"entry":"and ClSi\u2014GeHmolecules and their corresponding assignments.

In both cases, we have obtained materials with high quality morphological and microstructural properties. Nevertheless, the use of SiHGeHfor low-temperature CMOS selective growth of small size device features is not practical due to the dramatic drop in growth below 475\u00b0 C. (in fact the growth rate is negligible below 450\u00b0 C.). In contrast both ClHSiGeHand (GeH)(SiH)yield growth rates at least 10 times higher than those obtained from SiHGeHin the 400-450\u00b0 C. range, and these compounds even display significant film growth at temperatures below 400\u00b0 C. It should also be noted that the film quality is comparable using either ClHSiGeHor (GeH)(SiH)to grow SiGe.","However, albeit (GeH)(SiH)shows promise from a technical perspective it represents a demonstration in principle rather than a true proof of concept from an industrial perspective. For instance, this compound is difficult to synthesize in quantities greater than a few grams and its thermal stability in relation to storage and transportation is not well understood.","Thus, the ClHSiGeHcounterpart appears to be a more practical candidate as a 50\/50 SiGe source. Its synthesis is much easier to scale up and the starting materials are readily available and inexpensive. The single step reaction of BClwith HSiGeHis conducted in a solvent free environment ensuring facile isolation and purification to produce semiconductor grade material. Further, due to its high vapor pressure, the compound can be readily integrated with existing commercial processes involving single-wafer low pressure CVD furnaces.","All manipulations were carried out under inert conditions using standard high vacuum line and drybox techniques. Dry, air-free solvents were distilled from either anhydrous CaClor sodium benzophenone ketyl prior to use. All NMR spectra were collected on a Gemini 300 MHz spectrometer. Samples were dissolved in deuterated toluene, and all nuclei were referenced either directly or indirectly to the proton signal of TMS or the residual solvent peak as indicated. Gaseous Infrared spectra were obtained in 10-cm cells fitted with KBr windows. Mass spectrometry data were obtained using a Leybold-Inficon quadrupole mass spectrometer. Boron trichloride (Matheson gas products 99.95%) was distilled to remove residual HCl contaminants and its purity was confirmed by Infrared and mass spectra prior to use. Lithium tetrahydroaluminate (Aldrich), phenyl trichlorosilane (Aldrich), trifluoromethane sulfonic acid (Alfa Aesar), cesium chloride (Aldrich) and electronic grade germane gas (donated by Voltaix, Inc.) were used as received. The starting materials phenylsilane was prepared by reduction of phenyl trichlorosilane with LiAlH, and phenyl monochlorosilane was prepared by the reaction of phenylsilane with gaseous HCl. Phenylsilylgermane (Lobreyer et al., 1991, 124, 2405-2410), germylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate, and germylsilane (Hu et al., 2005, 87(18), 181903\/1-3) were prepared according to literature procedures. All starting materials were checked by NMR spectroscopy to verify their purities. Potassium germyl (KGeH) was synthesized via a modified literature preparation in monoglyme by reaction of gaseous GeHwith a finely dispersed sodium-potassium (80% K) alloy. Note: the Teflon bar that was used to stir the GeH\/Na\u2014K\/monoglyme solution was encapsulated in glass owing to the high reactivity of Teflon with Na\u2014K alloys.","The growth studies were conducted on Si(100) substrates in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) deposition system.

We note the following trends in these data: (a) For a fixed number of Cl atoms on the Si site, increasing the number of Cl atoms on Ge site enhances the shielding of the SiHprotons resulting in a systematic upheld shift of the latter. For example in the sequence ClSiHGeH, ClSiHGeHCl and ClSiHGeHCl, the Si\u2014H shifts are 5.57, 5.35 and 5.15 ppm, respectively (steps of \u02dc0.2 ppm). Similarly for ClSiHGeH, ClSiHGeHCl and ClSiHGeHClthe SiHshifts are 4.68, 4.54 and 4.38 ppm respectively (steps of \u02dc0.1 ppm). (b) By contrast, the GeHshifts are independent of the number of Cl on the Si site and simply scale down field in proportion to the number of Cl atoms on Ge site (\u03b4GeH: \u02dc3.2 ppm for \u201c\u2014GeH\u201d, 4.8 ppm for \u201c\u2014GeHCl\u201d and 6.0 ppm for \u201c\u2014GeHCl\u201d roughly independent of the number of Cl attached to Si). (c) The trends in the Si shifts are more subtle, and our study finds that for a fixed number of Cl on the Si site slight down field shifts are associated with increasing Cl on the Ge site (for \u201cClHSi-\u201d molecules, \u03b4Si are \u221224.6, \u221224.3, \u221222.9 for 0, 1 and 2 Cl on the Ge site, respectively). (d) Furthermore this effect becomes more pronounced as the number of Cl on the Si site is increased (for \u201cClHSi-\u201d molecules, 6Si are 9.8, 3.4, \u22121.1 for 0, 1 and 2 Cl on the Ge site, respectively). This suggests that chlorines bonded to Ge systematically shield the Si nuclei as the number of Cl atoms is increased.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0422","num":"0512"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00008","num":"00008"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"105pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},"TABLE 7"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Compound",{"sup":"1"},{"sup":"29"}]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"HSiGeH","3.52 (q, SiH)","3.18 (q, GeH)","\u221291.60"]},{"entry":[{},"ClGeHSiH","3.25 (t, SiH)","4.86 (q, GeH)"]},{"entry":[{},"ClSiHGeH","4.68 (q, SiH)","3.12 (t, GeH)","\u221224.61"]},{"entry":[{},"ClSiHGeHCl","4.47 (t, SiH)","4.80 (t, GeH)"]},{"entry":[{},"ClSiHGeHCl","4.38 (t, SiH)","6.12 (t, GeH)","\u221222.87"]},{"entry":[{},"ClSiHGeH","5.57 (q, SiH)","3.25 (d, GeH)","9.77"]},{"entry":[{},"ClSiHGeHCl","5.35 (t, SiH)","4.82 (d, GeH)","3.36"]},{"entry":[{},"ClSiHGeHCl","5.15 (d, SiH)","5.97 (d, GeH)","\u22121.12"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"left","id":"FOO-00003"},"sup":"b","sub":["7","8 "]}]},{"entry":[{},"CDused as a solvent, and all values referenced to TMS"]}]}}]}}},"Growth experiments were conducted to investigate the applicability of ClHSiGeHto form semiconductor alloys at low temperatures. The chemical vapor (1) was reacted on the clean Si surface to form films via desorption of HCl and Hbyproducts. The precursor partial pressure and reaction temperature were typically in the range of 10-10Torr and 350\u00b0 C.-450\u00b0 C., respectively. The film composition was determined by Rutherford backscattering (RBS) to be SiGereflecting precisely the Si\/Ge ratio of the ClHSi\u2014GeHprecursor. The heteroepitaxial character of the synthesized films was initially investigated by random and channeling RBS, which indicates that the material is perfectly aligned with the substrate.  shows that the ratio of the aligned versus the random peak heights (\u03c7), which measures the degree of crystallinity, decreases from 25% at the interface to 10% at the surface. This indicates a typical defect \u201cpile up\u201d near the interface while the upper portion of the film is relatively defect free. The film crystallinity was thoroughly investigated by high resolution cross sectional electron microscopy (XTEM) which revealed commensurate SiGe\/Si interfaces and perfectly monocrystalline epilayer microstructure (see ). The TEM samples showed very few defects penetrating through the layer which is consistent with the RBS channeling observation. X-ray diffraction (XRD) revealed highly aligned layers with mosaics spreads as low as degrees strained. The layers were slightly strained as grown, and a nominal XRD relaxation of 75% was observed for a film thickness \u02dc80 nm. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies show that films with thickness of 80-100 nm display RMS values of 0.7 and 1.1 nm, respectively, for 10\u00d710 \u03bcmareas, indicating highly planar surfaces. No \u201ccross hatched\u201d surface patterns caused by misfit dislocations produced during strain relaxation were observed even for films annealed up to 700\u00b0 C. In fact, the surface roughness either remained the same or improved slightly with annealing indicating that the sample planarity is thermally robust.","The deposition of ClHSiGeHwas conducted at 450\u00b0 C. (10Torr) and produced films with thickness ranging from 10-80 nm at growth rates approaching 1 nm which is slightly higher than that obtained from the deposition of ClHSiGeH. For films exceeding 10-20 nm in thickness a quantitative analysis based on RBS showed that the Si content can be as low as 43%. For thinner samples (<10 nm) the film composition was derived from high-resolution XRD data because the Si content was difficult to extract from the substrate background using RBS. For thicker samples we observed a systematic reduction from the expected (ideal) 50% stoichiometry when the deposition pressure is reduced from 5\u00d710to from 1\u00d710Torr. Silicon depletion is likely enhanced under the lower pressure conditions due to facile surface desorption of multi-chlorinated Si species, such as stable SiHCldecomposition byproducts. The crystallographic alignment and surface morphology of these films were found to be of comparable quality to those obtained from depositions of ClHSiGeH. Nevertheless, their XTEM characterizations showed lower threading dislocation densities of the layers, and superior microstructural quality of the interface regions. This includes flawless epitaxial registry and atomically abrupt transitions between the film and the substrate, consistent with the absence of elemental intermixing between the two materials at the low growth temperatures.","The strain state properties of the films were extensively characterized using HR-XRD. Two representative samples with layer thicknesses of \u02dc10 nm and 60 nm are discussed further. Precise in-plane and perpendicular lattice constants were determined by high resolution (224) and (004) on and off axis reciprocal space maps of the entire structure.","In the case of the thinner sample the XRD data revealed that the growth produces two discernible layers in which the initial layer adjacent to the interface is fully strained to the Si substrate (a=a=5.4309 and a=5.5991 \u212b) and has a thickness of is 5-7 nm (see ). Note that in , [2] (corresponding to the layer adjacent to the interface as shown in the schematic inset) falls directly below the Si (224) peak indicating perfect lattice matching within the interface plane. Its elongation is due to the small thickness of the layer. A more diffuse peak [1] is also clearly visible and corresponds to the upper portion of the film. Note that peak [1] lies below the relaxation line connecting the Si peak to the origin, indicating partial relaxation (\u02dc50%).","Using elementary elastic strain relations (\u2208=\u22122C\/C\u2208 where Cand Care bulk SiGe elastic constants, and \u2208 and \u2208 are the perpendicular and parallel strains), the known bowing behavior of bulk Si\u2014Ge alloys, and the structural data above, the composition of the initial alloy layer was determine to be 45%\u00b12 Ge and 55%\u00b12 Si. The XRD data also showed a diffuse, high mosaicity peak (peak [1] in ) indicating that the upper portion of the film (grown following the initial layer) is 50% relaxed and has lattice constants a=5.4845 \u212b and a=5.5654 \u212b corresponding to a composition of \u02dc47\u00b12% Ge and 53\u00b12% Si. This indicates that this upper layer possesses stoichiometries closer to the expected 50\/50 value in accordance with precursor Si\u2014Ge content. In this diffusion limited low temperature growth process the tendency to strain-match with Si can only be achieved by incorporation of excess Si at the interface layer. Beyond a certain critical thickness, (\u02dc50-60 \u212b under these conditions) the strain is gradually relieved without any measurable defect formation, enabling the full stoichiometry of the precursors to be incorporated.","In the case of the 60 nm thick film we observe that the growth also produces the same initial fully strained layer (\u02dc10 nm thick) adjacent to the interface, followed by a transition to a partially strained bulk film whose Si content approaches nominal target values.  shows an XTEM micrograph of the entire film thickness in (100) projection. Note that the film surface is atomically flat and the bulk material is devoid of threading defects within a wide field of view (typically 2 \u03bcm). The high resolution image of the interface region shows perfect commensuration and no indication of misfit dislocations in spite of the large mismatch. This observation is consistent with full pseudomorphic growth as determined by XRD. The lack of defects can be explained by our observation of an inherent compositional gradient which accommodates the strain throughout the film. These mechanisms are unique to the low temperature growth protocol afforded by the specifically designed precursor chemistry employed in this study.","Next we pursued preliminary growth studies of SiGealloys using the newly prepared chlorinated compounds to evaluate their selective-area growth potential in prototype microelectronic devices. The experiments utilized test wafers containing an array of device structures including simple transistors and various patterns masked by amorphous nitride and oxide thin layers. The depositions were conducted using gas source molecular beam epitaxy (GSMBE) at \u02dc5\u00d710Torr and 400-450\u00b0 C., via direct insertion of the compound vapor pressure into the chamber at base pressure of 10Torr. The film growth targeted the formation of Ge-rich compositions in the range of \u02dc65-75% which have applications in IR optolectronics such as photodetectors and modulators. The \u201cas deposited\u201d samples were examined by optical microscopy which indicated that the color of the nitride\/oxide masked regions on the surface of the wafer had remained unchanged while the color of the pure Si regions had turned from metallic grey to light brown. The latter is characteristic of high Ge content SiGesuggesting that selective deposition had potentially occurred. Additional characterizations of the wafers were performed by cross sectional electron microscopy (XTEM), Raman scattering, Rutherford backscattering (RBS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) and the data collectively revealed the presence of atomically flat Si\u2014Ge films with single crystalline microstructures throughout the samples. The film nominal thickness was estimated by the random RBS and confirmed by XTEM to be in the 50 nm range spanning the full height of the drain\/source (S\/D) recess region. Average growth rates up to \u02dc7 nm per minute were obtained in these experiments. XTEM micrographs of all samples clearly demonstrated that the Si\u2014Ge films deposited selectively and conformably on typical device structures filling the drain\/source recess regions (S\/D).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0430","num":"0520"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 7","FIG. 9"],"sub":["0.26","0.74 ","2","3","2 "]},"Micro Raman spectroscopy was used to study the selectivity of growth and determine the Si\u2014Ge composition throughout the wafer surface at a spatial resolution of \u02dc1 \u03bcm. The spectra of all samples obtained from the nitride\/oxide covered features showed only a single peak corresponding to the Si\u2014Si vibrations of the underlying substrate, indicating that no discernable Si\u2014Ge growth had occurred in these areas in agreement with the XTEM observations. The Raman spectra obtained from the unprotected Si regions, however, showed three additional peaks corresponding to the characteristic Si\u2014Si, Si\u2014Ge and Ge\u2014Ge alloy vibrations, indicating significant growth of crystalline SiGefilms with composition of SiGe. It is important to note that the Raman composition was obtained as an average from a large number measurements of individual device features throughout the entire wafer, and closely matched the bulk film composition obtained from RBS. The RBS\/Raman results collectively suggest that precise compositional control can be achieved by selective area deposition of our compounds. These afford low temperature depositions that produce controllable and fairly homogeneous alloys within and among individual device architectures. This level of uniformity is critically important for achieving reliable, reproducible and cost effective device fabrication and performance. In addition the use of single sources simplifies significantly the integration scheme by circumventing complex multi-component reactions and corrosive Cletchants which are necessary to promote selective deposition in conventional processes.","In addition to selective deposition experiments we also explore the possibility of achieving highly strained states in our deposited films.  show a reciprocal space map (RSM) of a \u02dc40 nm thick SiGelayer grown by deposition of ClHSi(GeH). The composition of the film as measured by RBS closely matches that of the corresponding precursor indicating that the entire SiGecore is being incorporated into the material. The in plane and vertical lattice parameters were determine to be 5.4986 \u212b and 5.6530 \u212b, respectively. Using these values and standard elasticity theory we obtain an unprecedented compressive strain of 1.6%. Note that this value is significantly higher than the 1.2% strains that are possible from state of the art film containing 30% Ge. The RSM plot in  reveals that our film is \u02dc40% relaxed suggesting that it may be possible to realize fully strained films beyond the current proof of principle state reported here by optimizing deposition conditions such as the growth rate and temperature.","All of the U.S. patents, U.S. patent application publications, U.S. patent applications, foreign patents, foreign patent applications and non-patent publications referred to in this specification and\/or listed in the Application Data Sheet, are incorporated herein by reference, in their entirety.","From the foregoing it will be appreciated that, although specific embodiments of the invention have been described herein for purposes of illustration, various modifications may be made without deviating from the spirit and scope of the invention.
