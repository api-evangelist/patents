title: System and method for controlling communication of private information over a network
abstract: A system and method for controlling access to private information over a network is provided including a privacy preference repository accessible by one or more subjects of the private information and by a private access bureau. The privacy preference repository stores privacy preferences configured by the subjects to indicate conditions for disclosure of said private information. A policy repository that stores legal criteria for accessing the private information is also accessible by the private access bureau. The private access bureau is configurable to receive requests from privacy-enabled systems for privacy directives that take into account the privacy preferences and legal criteria required to release particular documents on said privacy enabled system in response to the privacy-enabled systems.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/426,190, filed on Dec. 22, 2010 the contents of which are incorporated in its entirety.","The present disclosure relates to systems and methods for controlling the regulation of data flow including private information over a network, and more particularly to a privacy decision point, authorizations manager, or bureau in communication with user privacy preference repositories and policy repositories for controlling access to private information over the Internet.","The development of automated systems and methods for exchanging private information such as medical records and data between various healthcare stakeholders has been attempted and found to be technically and logistically challenging, particularly at large scale. Such systems and methods involve challenges such as digitizing paper records, connecting disparate systems, securing electronic channels, authenticating identity, developing broadly-accepted semantic structures, and navigating legal\/regulatory requirements. As an infrastructure for such systems and methods develops, improved methods for regulating the flow of private data are needed in order to fulfill a number of key operational functions attendant to satisfying legal and regulatory requirements and to engender trust in the system.","Such systems for regulating the flow of data must address potentially conflicting interests from various stakeholders. For example, in the case of healthcare information, the individual about whom such records pertain may prefer that no one see certain parts of their medical information under any circumstance, while a healthcare worker, researcher or public health official may wish to use that information for providing services and securing timely payment, conducting research, or verifying compliance, each with varying needs for data access and the right to share at least some portion of the data (or information derived from it) with others.","Similarly, a company selling health-related products or services may wish to utilize the information to target marketing messages to the data subject, with the hope of increasing sales. To the extent these goods and services are valued by them, this use of the consumer's private information may be highly useful and appreciated. However, the use of non-public information to generate this targeted marketing message\u2014particularly if it is not viewed as being of benefit\u2014could be considered by the data subject (and in some cases, by the law) as a violation of the individual's right to privacy, and the use or release (particularly if sold) of the information that gave rise to this offer as having been a breach of trust by the party to whom the person initially provided the data.","Different jurisdictions have addressed these sorts of conflicting interests with a set of heterogeneous laws such that the country has multiple (and at times contradictory) rules associated with data use and sharing, including (in some instances) the requirement for, and content of, notices of privacy practices and express authorization that may be required. Generally speaking, when such state laws are more stringent than the federal law regarding limitations imposed on the use and\/or disclosure of this information, state laws are given precedence; and when the federal law is more restrictive than under the applicable state statute, the federal law takes precedence. Despite concerted efforts to \u201charmonize\u201d these regulations in an effort to make implementing data exchanges across jurisdictional boundaries less challenging legally, the heterogeneity of jurisdictionally distinct laws and applicable regulations persists. Moreover, each institution or corporate entity that holds such information (individually referred to herein as a \u201cdata holder,\u201d or collectively as \u201cdata holders\u201d) may within the broad bounds of governing laws and\/or guidelines develop its own policies and procedures for when data is released, or when (by way of non-limiting example) express consent by the individual to whom such records pertain, or their designated agent or representative, is required.","Such data holder privacy policies are commonly lengthy, exceedingly complex, and generally filled with legal terminology. Some groups criticize such policies for being excessively restrictive and representing an impediment to meaningful data exchange, and others criticize these policies for being overly permissive and deceptive by virtue of creating the appearance of protections that is far greater, they contend, than is actually the case. And nearly everyone criticizes the written policies for being incredibly difficult to understand, full of obfuscated language, and of extremely limited practical value. Accordingly, whether it pertains to signing the mandatory Acknowledgement of Privacy Policies notice required by HIPAA on a paper form in the presence of a witness, or clicking on the \u201cagree\u201d box in the case of online click-through policy disclosures, clearly a majority of consumers perceive that beyond wholesale opt-out, they have no other choice and thus consent so they can get on with their transactions. For these reasons, such blanket and arguably uninformed consent practices are also troubling to a number of advocacy groups, regulatory officials and lawmakers.","Complicating matters even further, applicable laws, regulatory policies, institutional rules, and consumer wishes respecting the right to access, employ and\/or share private data are inherently subject to changes over time as political will or personal preferences shift, as concerns are exposed in the media or through investigative studies, or in response to changes in circumstance, knowledge, awareness or perspective. This is true not only in healthcare, but also across a large number of fields of use. A non-limiting list of fields presenting similar challenges and for which the instant invention is relevant includes financial and investment documents and services; official documents and e-government services; legal, employment and educational documents; online social networking, gaming and behavioral marketing; online lead generation; search engine usage; geo-location, cyber-security, law enforcement, and energy [smart grid].","The regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide is currently in flux and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future. Practices regarding the collection, use, storage, transmission and security of personal information by companies operating over the Internet, using mobile platforms and employing location-based technologies have increasingly come under public scrutiny, and civil claims alleging liability for the breach of data privacy have been asserted against numerous healthcare, social networking, online marketing and Internet search firms. The U.S. government, including the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Commerce, has announced that it is reviewing the need for greater regulation over the collection of information concerning consumer behavior on the Internet, potentially including regulations aimed at restricting certain targeted advertising practices. In addition, the European Union is in the process of proposing reforms to its existing data protection legal framework, which may result in a greater compliance burden for companies with users in Europe; and judicial decisions in several recent European court cases against Google and other large data holders have shown an increasing trend towards empowering consumers to control what data about themselves may be disclosed online when it is objectionable to them.","In 2009, in conjunction with adoption of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (or HITECH) Act, Congress adopted what some observers describe as being the most sweeping new privacy regulations focusing on healthcare data since 1996, when HIPAA was initially enacted. HITECH directs a federal investment of over $20 billion into health information technology (HIT) infrastructure and establishes strong incentives to encourage doctors and hospitals to use standards-based HIT systems to electronically exchange patients' health information. In conjunction with this bold stimulus effort to advance health data exchange (and to some degree borne out of associated concerns by consumer interest groups over attendant privacy risks and other implications), HITECH expressly mandates strengthening federal privacy and security laws to protect identifiable health information from misuse.","As the foregoing overview suggests, there presently exist significant challenges in seeking to apply to confidential information (as well as databases and\/or documents containing at least some confidential information) otherwise highly effective, in many cases already widely employed, Internet-based technologies such as search engines, social networks, inference engines, location and behavioral tracking, and data mining. Difficulties arise from trying to apply these technologies that were designed for publicly accessible data to the rigors of simultaneously adhering to potentially highly restrictive, heterogeneous, and ever-changing data access and usage restrictions commonly associated with private data. And these challenges are multiplied by data replication, mirroring and packet transmission technologies that are used to minimize latency time, address load variations, and assure high reliability factors\u2014all of which system users today take as givens for leading websites and web-based services. Accordingly, a number of observers have gone so far as to assert that it is impossible to reconcile traditional notions of privacy with these sorts of networked technologies and increasingly pervasive database integration tools and techniques; and thus in deference to the benefits these technologies can afford, privacy should no longer be anticipated.","To at least some degree, the challenge of designing sufficient tools for data regulation, distributed management, and accountability arises in part from the design of the Internet, and conscious tradeoffs that have been made in its fundamental architecture. As described in the 1988 review paper entitled \u201c,\u201d this architecture intentionally does not presume the underlying networks themselves can support multiple types of services, in part because this would violate one of the fundamental goals, which was to support all existing networks as well as new innovations that extend beyond what can even be foreseen. Instead, the hope was that multiple types of services could be constructed out of the basic datagram building block using algorithms within the host and the gateway. And that on the other side of what is commonly referred to as the architecture's \u201cnarrow waist,\u201d a number of different transport protocols could be used to provide all sorts of services and incorporate different networks and network providers.","Thus, although the Internet makes it possible in principle for any sort of data to flow from any device to anyplace over virtually any means, it has historically done a poor job in respecting authority and governance issues and taking into account privacy issues because in a very real sense, its fundamental architecture simply wasn't designed with these needs in mind\u2014or perhaps more forgivingly, the needs were recognized, but were not as high on the list of priorities at the time. Rather, the central philosophy of the architecture was (and to a large measure still is) to support as many networks as possible and to enable the universal interconnection of multiple networking technologies and heterogeneous links into a single interoperable network.","While this has worked extremely well in many respects, it can also be observed that some of the more significant anxieties regarding the Internet and the application of Internet-based systems and methods with respect to confidential information arise from the tradeoffs made in adopting such a ubiquitous philosophy. Thus, as entities increasingly seek to employ the Internet and Internet-based systems as a means for communicating confidential information such as medical records, financial information, and a wide array of sensitive and\/or personally identifying characteristics that are highly desirable for some persons and systems to see and utilize, but potentially damaging or embarrassing if shared ubiquitously, this presents a unique challenge.","Without meaningfully addressing the issue of data flow regulation, already prevalent problems such as data misuses, privacy breaches, and legal violations are likely to become even more frequent as use of these technologies proliferates. It is widely known that today's Internet companies, are constantly being criticized for perceived privacy violations. Federal and state regulators, investors, and consumers all want to be assured that data holders are, on the one hand, adequately addressing consumers' reasonable concerns about minimizing related privacy risk (and from the data holders' perspective, associated concerns about reducing privacy violation risks), and at the same time to ensure that privacy protections do not foreclose the numerous benefits to be gained from greater data liquidity, including improved services, cost savings, increased revenue and profits.","In general, in one aspect, the disclosure features a system and method for regulating the flow of data including private information over a network, and more particularly for establishing and operating a privacy decision point, authorization manager, bureau or the like (collectively referred to herein as a \u201cprivate access bureau\u201d) in communication with user preference repositories and policy repositories for controlling access to private information over one or more networks, including the Internet.","While a private access bureau may be established for a single enterprise, geographic area, network, or market segment, in one illustrative embodiment, the private access bureau is established as a consumer-centric, cross-industry facility such that its user preference repositories and policy repositories are utilized by multiple entities, enterprises, websites, online services, networks, and other data holders, data seekers and data subjects. Also, in another illustrative embodiment, the private access bureau (or a few such competing bureaus as is the case for consumer credit ratings bureaus) is independent and privacy policy-agnostic (meaning that it takes no position on whether data that its systems and services help to regulate should be shared widely or maintained as being strictly confidential) so that consumers and data holders have less reason to doubt that the actions of the private access bureau is tainted by an agenda beyond fulfilling its intended purpose of regulating the flow of such data in accordance with then applicable policies and personal privacy preferences. Any systems that confer and to the extent applicable, base their actions to control access to or sharing of data they are holding based on privacy directives received from the private access bureau are collectively referred to herein as being \u201cprivacy-enabled,\u201d and the applications and services employed by them as being \u201cprivacy-assured\u201d.","In another general aspect of the disclosure, the private access bureau houses granular privacy preferences (to the extent any have been submitted) for each unique user, together with institutional rules and jurisdictional regulations; and in a preferred embodiment, these individual preferences and rules are collected for all websites, firms and other enterprises that utilize the bureau and\/or store the consumers' personal information. Each data holder makes inquiries of the private access bureau to acquire proof of the original authorization to access, utilize or share personal data (or personal data elements), or alternatively to verify the right to do so (i.e., absent express consent) on the basis of then current, applicable policies. To the extent there is any question, in one illustrative embodiment of the disclosure, the private access bureau enables the consumer to dynamically update their privacy preference settings (including in response to inquiries initiated, when necessary or preferred, by the private access bureau), from any standards-based Web browser or Web-enabled mobile device.","An optional aspect of the disclosure relates to establishing and communicating to consumers a more understandable and enabling privacy policy for a company, institution, website, social network, or online service based on utilizing the private access bureau. Thus, for example, in one illustrative embodiment, the privacy policy disclosure for a large social networking service could reflect a baseline (institutional) policy concerning the extent to which that website or service may access, use and\/or share data that it receives from consumers but acknowledge that some users may want more (or less) private treatment of their data or identity than the baseline policy stipulates and, to the fullest extent permitted under the then applicable law, the website or service will abide by each individual user's personal privacy preferences as reflected, from time to time, within the private access bureau. And in one illustrative embodiment, such a \u201cconcierge treatment\u201d policy may be accompanied by a modest fee for the website or service agreeing to abide by more restrictive privacy obligations than its baseline policy dictates. This has the effect of making it possible for consumers who wish heightened privacy protections to pay for foreclosing certain otherwise lawfully permitted uses of their data, and at the same time to provide the service with a means by which to sustain its operations notwithstanding such curtailment in its baseline policy.","In a further illustrative embodiment, the consumer would be able to establish and monitor compliance with such privacy settings from a single source rather than one website or Internet-based service at a time. In another illustrative embodiment, if the data subject establishes less restrictive privacy preferences than the site's baseline policy and the law provides, this election might entitle the data subject to receive a share of the income derived by the site or service from such enhanced usage rights respecting that data.","In yet another general aspect, the invention adjudicates competing policies and personal privacy preferences to ascertain, to the extent possible, which policy or privacy preference dictates the privacy directive issued by the private access bureau. For example, if (1) the data of a consumer who is a resident of a state that has more highly restrictive regulations concerning data sharing than under federal law is (2) being held by a data holder located in a state with an applicable statute for this type of data and\/or use that is less stringent than the federal law, and (3) the consumer has not expressed any privacy preference regarding how their data should be treated even though (4) in addition to stating a baseline institutional policy that is more restrictive than its state law but less restrictive than the state law of the state in which the consumer resides, the institutional policy of the data holder (5) states that it will abide by the consumer's wishes if requested, then the private access bureau would adjudicate these competing policies and user preferences (or absence of any) to specify, if possible, which applies to the data holder's proposed access, use or sharing of the data. Such decision concerning the net effect of all applicable policies and privacy preferences regarding the access, use or sharing of data is referred to herein as a \u201cprivacy directive\u201d; and the process of determining among potentially competing policies and privacy preferences which has precedence over the other is referred to as \u201cadjudication\u201d.","In yet another optional aspect of the disclosure, a system and method is provided to ascertain when inconsistencies, contradictions, ambiguities, and\/or gaps in existing laws, regulations, rules, and policies render a privacy directive impossible to completely adjudicate. And in one illustrative embodiment, a system and method is also provided to recommend changes in applicable law, regulations or policies to resolve the observed challenges or gaps, and to communicate this to the appropriate legislative or administrative rule-making authority.","And in yet a further aspect of the disclosure, a system and method is provided for integrating the private access bureau with the system and method for recruiting subject for research studies and clinical trials, set forth in applicant's currently co-pending application Ser. No. 12\/750,036, filed on Mar. 30, 2010, the contents of which are incorporated in their entirety by reference.","Illustrative embodiments of the present disclosure provide a system for controlling access to private healthcare information including a privacy preference repository accessible by one or more subjects of the private information and by the private access bureau. The privacy preference repository stores privacy preferences configured by the subjects of the data to indicate conditions for disclosure of said private information. A policy repository, which stores legal and regulatory criteria as well as institutional rules for accessing the private information, is accessible by the private access bureau. The private access bureau is configurable to receive requests from privacy-enabled systems for privacy directives taking into account, and where possible having the capacity to adjudicate, applicable privacy preferences and privacy policy criteria required to release particular documents on said privacy-enabled system in response to the privacy-enabled system having receiving a request for access to the private information by a system user or a third-party employing a privacy-assured application.","In several non-limiting examples, the systems and methods are described in connection with the private access bureau for implementing consumer control over the release of private data by a \u201cCovered Entity\u201d as defined in HIPAA, and for implementing regulatory requirements in a large-scale healthcare information exchange, such as a national or international healthcare information exchange. A centralized system including one or more private access bureaus acts as an automated advisor in regulating the flow of healthcare data with respect to a regulatory framework including numerous laws, preferences and policies relating to such healthcare documents and data. The private access bureau interacts at a system level to provide access decisions in response to receiving a request for data and processing rules over that data in accordance with the regulatory framework.","According to the disclosure, any kind of access and sharing policies can be reflected, and can be readily modified and reflected, at all privacy-enabled systems across the network. In addition to enabling dynamic consent by individual users, the invention will thereby lessen the risk that future changes in law or applicable regulations disrupt the core operating systems of a website or service that utilizes the private access bureau.","In a further aspect of the disclosure, assuming that an applicable law historically permitted an entity to use and disclose to third-parties a certain type of data such as an IP address, and that this law is changed by the lawmaking body, such that following an effective date, the disclosure of an IP address becomes prohibited without first receiving the express consent of the subject of the data. Even though what was previously permitted is now prohibited, no change would be required in the core operating system of any privacy-enabled service to implement the change according to one aspect of the disclosure. This is because each website or web-based service would merely continue to access or share the data it holds based on privacy directives issued by the private access bureau. And while privacy directives issued by the private access bureau would, in this illustrative example, change from \u201cgreen\u201d (permitted) to \u201cred\u201d (prohibited) or \u201cyellow\u201d (conditioned upon consent of the data subject) based on the applicable law change, everything else in the system would function technically in the same way as before the change in law took effect. Thus, from and after the new law's effective date, privacy directives for any data subject who does not have an express consent for sharing his or her IP address included in their privacy preferences profile would change from permissive to restrictive until the now requisite authorization is received and reflected in such privacy preferences data.","In another further illustrative embodiment of the disclosure assuming that the retention of a comprehensive audit trail of data disclosures that was previously not required becomes, on the basis of a newly-enacted state law, mandatory for any users who are residents of that state. Once again, in a preferred embodiment of the private access bureau, no changes are required in the core operating system of any privacy-enabled service, but rather the tracking of such disclosures for residents of the state must be added as a feature of the private access bureau.","As noted in the foregoing, it is widely known that today's Internet companies are constantly being criticized for perceived privacy violations, and one could argue that no matter what these companies do in terms of amending their privacy policy, some groups will continue to be dissatisfied. In one aspect of the disclosure, it is provided that the traditional privacy policy may be supplemented and\/or replaced with a policy incorporating reference to each consumer's then current privacy preferences in the private access bureau that constrains or expands such rights in the baseline institutional policy from time to time, affords a number of advantages. Among these, it enables the site to respond that users who disagree with, are confused by, or otherwise don't wish to take the time to try and figure out the institution's baseline privacy policy should set their privacy preferences in the private access bureau. To the extent the latter change may require a nominal fee, a portion of such fee can be paid to the website or web-based service as a means of earning a return for its services and\/or content without acting in a manner that is contrary to the data subject's wishes. At the same time, because other users may be less concerned about privacy, it will potentially afford the site more rights for those users who set privacy preferences expressly authorizing data access, usage rights, or sharing privileges that are greater than would otherwise be available merely on the basis of the entity's baseline policy or data derived by implication (rather than permission).","Similarly, it will be readily appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that it is advantageous to have a way, through the private access bureau, to address ambiguities or conflicts under existing law or institutional policies by permitting these to be explicitly addressed in the short term through the dynamic consent mechanism that is an integral part of the preferred system, as well in the long term\u2014with the cooperation of the applicable lawmaking authorities\u2014to be definitively resolved through application of the optional system and method for identification and resolution of ambiguities, contradictions and gaps in statutory language to be adjudicated computationally in the manner hereinafter described.","Those of ordinary skill in the art will additionally appreciate the advantage afforded by the disclosure having effectively provided an alternative to the traditional \u201cproprietary siloed approach\u201d in which privacy and data access policy are established and implemented for a single entity, enterprise, website, online service or network, by enabling the capital costs for establishing privacy controls to be shared across numerous users, and continued attention to be placed on system improvements and continuous innovation. Additionally, the fact that the private access bureau in an illustrative embodiment is both independent and privacy policy-agnostic provides the greatest basis for engendering trust since the private access bureau does not have an ulterior motive of gaining access to user data given that the private data itself remains in an illustrative embodiment at all times with the company, enterprise, website or service rather than the bureau.","At the same time, the system and method provide for greater reliability of user authentication, audit trails, and the opportunity for each user to effectively set up their preferences a single time, and then permit them to grow with visits to other privacy-enabled sites or services.","Other advantages and features of the present invention will be better understood from the following description, taken together with the following drawings, and from the claims.","In an illustrative embodiment of the invention that is described herein with reference to , a private access bureau provides a centralized advisory system  for determining the access rights each time confidential documents or private information such as personal healthcare data is shared. A data seeker  makes a request  of data holder  for a piece of healthcare data and\/or data holder  seeks to share data with data seeker . Before deciding whether or not to do so and in order to help inform that decision, data holder  queries  the private access bureau  seeking guidance on the proposed data sharing. After analyzing access permission and rules governing the subject data, the private access bureau  sends a response  to data holder , such response taking into account in a preferred embodiment the then current status of available information concerning whether such proposed data sharing with data seeker  is permissible under international, national, state, institutional and personal privacy laws, regulations, policies and privacy preferences. Data holder  either shares or withholds the subject data in accordance with response  from the private access bureau .","Depending on the wishes of data holder  (and the permitted terms of use of the private access bureau), such privacy directives  may be treated as informative, binding, or a hybrid of the two. In the case of the former, the final decision respecting the proposed access, use and\/or sharing of the record or data remains in the complete discretion of record holder  (whose actions eventually taken may or may not comport with the privacy directive). Alternatively, the data holder may elect to treat privacy directive  as binding, and integrate these directives with one or more aspects of data holder's security systems. In this optional embodiment, for example, transmitting or opening encrypted data packets may require that the applicable privacy directive permit such transmittal or access, respectively. While security and privacy are distinct functions, that are both technically and operationally unique, they are related architecturally and are coupled (conjoined) in a preferred embodiment. In this later case, and in systems that may be configured as hybrids of the two approaches, privacy directives  may be employed to afford an enhanced security mechanism by incorporating such directives as bounded architectural attributes that inform security of a privacy-enabled system and\/or privacy-assured application both within procedural (e.g., user prompted) and systemic (e.g., automatic) functions.","In an illustrative embodiment, an indication  of the action taken by data holder  in respect to accessing or sharing the data is contemporaneously generated and sent back from the data holder  to the private access bureau , which in a preferred embodiment maintains an independent audit record of all data sharing between nodes and\/or users of the network. Thus, in one preferred embodiment, the private access bureau may fulfill as an outsourced service the regulatory requirement under HITECH that data holders provide, if requested by data subjects, an \u201caccounting of disclosures\u201d concerning said data holder's sharing of the data subject's healthcare records and other information.","Referring to , the private access bureau  includes or has access to a repository of healthcare data directives, which include the various rules governing access of each piece of healthcare data. The directives can include consumer preferences  (e.g., \u201cI want to share my data only with my doctor\u201d); legal and\/or regulatory policies  (e.g., \u201cdata for minors cannot be shared without parental consent\u201d); and\/or institutional policies  (e.g., \u201cno data is shared without payment of $X\u201d), for example.","Illustratively, an access request  including appropriate credentials is sent to the private access bureau as an electronic request. The private access bureau  includes an adjudication engine , which interprets the directives in response to the request and automatically generates a responsive recommendation indicating whether to allow access to the requested data. The private access bureau  sends this recommendation in an electronic response  to the requester. The private access bureau generates and maintains an optional audit record  for each major step in the adjudication process. The private access bureau  can also include in a preferred embodiment an optional transaction database  in which a payment record for data access fees (if any) is maintained, for example.","Accordingly, to the extent that data holder  (or other party whose approval is needed before data is shared with data seeker ) establishes a transaction fee for permitting access to such data or information, the private access bureau may assess such charge or charges in connection with adjudicating and providing the privacy directive response . And in one preferred embodiment, the private access bureau may sustain the cost of its own operations by taking a portion of such transaction fee or fees, if any, before in turn disbursing them to the appropriate parties to whom related fees are obligated (i.e., the data holder , any parties\u2014including the data subject \u2014and any other parties or service providers that data holder  specifies). One of the challenges with health information exchange has been developing a sustainability plan for entities involved in data exchange once government subsidies expire. The herein described transaction database  may be used as the mechanism by which HIEs (Health Information Exchanges) earn income and are able to defray their own operating costs.","The illustrative recommendation process using the private access bureau executes very quickly, in the order of a few seconds or less, from the time a request is sent to the time that a response is delivered to the data holder , privacy-enabled systems and\/or privacy-assured applications. Within the response a data holder  receives actionable advice regarding the proposed sharing of data with data seeker . The advice can be used by a data holder to decide upon an appropriate data sharing mechanism, such as electronic transmission or hand delivery, for example. Actual healthcare data need never reside with the private access bureau, which is responsible for maintaining the directives metadata and transaction history but not the documents and\/or data to which these pertain. Persons of ordinary skill in the art will recognize the benefit of employing unique identifiers such as GUIDs (globally unique identifiers), DOIs (digital object identifiers), \u201cHandles\u201d and the like to represent this data\u2014whether it be a single pixel, a word, phrase, document or entire library\u2014to which these privacy directives pertain.","In the illustrative embodiment, a delivery mechanism for the private access bureau is similar to the well-known Domain Name Server (DNS) model for propagating IP addresses tied to Internet addresses in which the DNS server merely acts as a switch for directing Internet data. Like the DNS server, in a preferred embodiment, the private access bureau acts as a switch in directing the flow of healthcare data.","In addition to the system interaction mechanism described above, embodiments of the private access bureau can also provide one or more interfaces to allow interaction between various healthcare stakeholders. For example, such interfaces can include a portal for consumers to create new directives for their healthcare data, such as explicitly allowing certain researchers to view their non-personal healthcare data or allowing the researches to view the data only with the consumer's explicit permission.","A benefit of the private access bureau is that it provides a centralized decision making capability. A multitude of various directives are stored in a single location. Logical decisions can be made based on the directives and requests received at the central location. The private access bureau acts as adjudicator of the known laws and information. Even when the laws change, the bureau architecture persists and is capable of instantaneously reflecting those changes.","Another benefit is that the private access bureau is completely automated in the way it receives requests, makes decisions, and returns responses. Other systems interact with it behind the scenes as part of their process when exchanging data. The private access bureau only stores the directives that cover the data and not the data itself. Data holders remain the steward of the data and remain responsible for the appropriate use of that data (which they can determine, or be assisted in determining, through privacy directives generated by the private access bureau.) In addition, the private access bureau acts as the independent steward for the audit information.","In an illustrative embodiment, the private access bureau provides facilities for record holders to establish and bill for charges applicable to data sharing. This allows for a system in which data would not be shared until payment for data sharing is collected, for example.","To the extent that privacy can be protected, an electronic health data interchange improves data liquidity to benefit all of the medical stakeholders. The private access bureau model improves data liquidity for consumers by allowing them to open new channels of access for their healthcare data. It allows them to explicitly allow specific data seekers to see their data, overriding legal and institutional policies protecting that data. For example, they could allow their medical information to be shared (or not shared) with researchers. Consumers set their privacy preferences once and this applies to all data holders of their information.","Various institutions, both data holders and data seekers, have improved healthcare data liquidity with the private access bureau model. Data holders benefit by having explicit clarity on when they can share their data (including knowing definitively that the applicable rules by which they are asked to abide are contradictory or ambiguous), allowing them to interact with data seekers freely without having to determine the appropriate access themselves, or to turn to the data subject when appropriate or as an ultimate authority in the event the law and regulations do not provide them requisite clarity for data exchange. Data seekers benefit by having access to more explicitly shared data.","Medical research benefits from the data liquidity brought by the private access bureau. Researchers are able to tap into the vast amount of personally-identified medical data held by data holders based on explicit permissions (whereas current law precludes them from such access except, in certain instances, based on costly and time-consuming institutional practices, and in other cases based on employing much more limited data sets than would otherwise be preferred.)","The private access bureau also benefits commercial enterprises. For example, drug companies can focus their marketing efforts to specific individuals who have allowed portions of their medical data to be shared, perhaps initially in a de-identified form, based on their conditions or symptoms. Identity and other contact details can be added through the dynamic controls of the private access bureau as the consumer becomes convinced that there is sufficient value to them in revealing these details or permitting these enhance private access rights. Using such techniques, new markets can be created based on much more highly targeted marketing.","Consumers have more control and visibility over their healthcare data in the private access bureau model. Consumers, by interfacing with the private access bureau, can provide explicit instructions on when\/how their healthcare data is to be exchanged. Based on the adjudication engine, the consumer's privacy preferences can be reflected in privacy directives issued by the private access bureau, which effectively override more restrictive legal and\/or institutional policies, thereby empowering the consumer to do more with their data. For example, the consumer may decide to explicitly allow their information to be shared with medical researchers for recruitment purposes, personalized medicine, and other secondary uses, where before their data would be \u201clocked up\u201d by privacy restrictions in data silos.","The private access bureau interfaces with other healthcare stakeholders on behalf of the consumer. The consumer does not have to directly interface with these other stakeholders when it comes to the exchange of their healthcare data. For example, the consumer may decide to deny all access to their healthcare data, which would be enforced by the private access bureau. The consumer does not have to interact with the data seekers in this case since the bureau would deny access (unless a greater directive, such as the right to \u201cbreak the glass\u201d for access in the case of a medical emergency when the individual's data is deemed relevant to timely providing them care, took precedence on the basis of applicable law.)","By interfacing with the private access bureau, the consumer can get a consolidated \u201ccredit report\u201d of their healthcare data transactions\u2014who has sought to access it, where it has been shared, and on the basis of what declarations and authority. They can use this information in numerous ways, including auditing the exchange and sharing of their data, tracing the spread of the data, and reporting documented misuse to the appropriate authorities\u2014in one preferred embodiment, all from a single interface or portal.","Besides the consumer, other healthcare stakeholders establish certain preferences, rights, laws, and policies that are accounted for in the private access bureau model. The private access bureau makes its decisions by factoring all directives and accounting for the known policy requirements for each stakeholder. The private access bureau preferably takes into account both consumer rights laws (i.e., the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, \u201cHIPPA\u201d) as well as individual consumer preferences. Data holders benefit from simplified ways to handle data privacy since the private access bureau model, once populated with relevant data, accounts for applicable laws, policies and personal preferences.","The private access bureau accounts for and prioritizes legal obligations at both the State and federal level. Healthcare data is shared appropriately with confidence. Since the private access bureau tracks all access and sharing, auditing data exchanges is simplified.","Various institutions have their own policies for the exchange of data outside their legal requirements. For example, an institution may not allow any of their medical data to be shared to marketing groups even if they are legally allowed to do so. These policies could also address the access of medical data internally to enforce policies such as \u201cminimum necessary\u201d rules under HIPAA. The private access bureau is able to navigate these policies by intelligently processing them, along with other directives, whenever there is a healthcare data request.","In addition to all its other services, the private access bureau logs its activities for history, tracking, and accountability. The private access bureau provides an interface for the consumer to centrally view all the access requests and decisions of their healthcare data. Other stakeholders, presuming the appropriate authority or authorization, may utilize audit logs generated by the private access bureau for a number of beneficial reasons. For example, a government agency may use the logs to investigate the misuse of data. Lawmakers may use the audit logs to track the effectiveness of certain laws. By analyzing the log, consistent undesired outcomes could result in creating new laws, or clarifications to existing laws, to correct them. New laws may be written by analyzing the log to implement corrective actions when consistent undesired outcomes are noted. Tracking data exchanges could also lead to alerting-type services similar to those provided by credit bureaus or online search services. Whenever there is a data exchange of a certain criteria, for example, the consumer could be notified.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0069"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 7"],"b":["1102","1103","1104","1106","1108","1110","1105"]},"In yet another one optional preferred embodiment, multiple members of the community are invited to vote on the best possible settings taking into account various considerations. Such crowd-sourcing techniques are thus used to communicate for a user what privacy preference settings may be best suited for them, and effectively function as guides . Social networking may also be used to refer ones privacy settings to close friends or family members (or to solicit their assistance and advice in setting ones own), which has the dual benefit of saving consumers time in figuring out the way they wish to proceed, communicating meaningful advice, and initiating viral marketing growth through word of mouth referrals. Additionally, it provides an opportunity for a new user to read about the high-level selections that these guides made in setting their privacy preferences, and to be assisted in a manner that does not feel coercive since the recommendations made by guides possessing different perspectives might lead to diametric-ally opposing privacy preference settings.","Once selected, the privacy preferences are stored in a privacy directives database  within the private access bureau .

When a request for a document or search query is received from a third party privacy-enabled system or privacy-assured application , the private access bureau  filters applicable policies  included in the policy repository  and filters applicable individual privacy preferences  included in the privacy preferences repository  to identify policies and privacy preferences related to the requested document or data.","The privacy bureau  performs a directive and policies conflict detection step ; and to the extent any conflicts are thereby detected, includes an adjudication step  that seeks to resolve these conflicts, if any, between applicable individual privacy preferences, laws, regulations and\/or institutional policies, for example, to establish the privacy directive  to be applied to a requested document or data. When the superior adjudicated outcome of adjudicator resolution  indicates that a patient's express consent is required before providing access to a document or information, and the patient's privacy preferences so permit seeking this input by the patient (the data subject), the adjudicator  communicates a request for the patient's consent to the patient  via a network \u2033. Patient  is then provided an opportunity to dynamically update her privacy preferences from any Web browser  or web-enabled mobile application such as described in , preferably by clicking within user interface  on \u201cgreen\u201d to permit, \u201cred\u201d to decline, and \u201cyellow\u201d to defer or condition such response.","This action produces an additional privacy preference  by the patient  that is added to the privacy preferences database  in the manner described hereinabove and, in turn, provides the basis for updating the decision from the adjudicator . This, in turn, generates privacy directive , which is communicated to the privacy-enabled system or privacy-assured application  via a network \u2032\u2033. Upon receipt of privacy directive , a corresponding message  appears within the third party privacy-enabled system or privacy-assured application  to verify that the system user has a right to see and\/or access the requested record or data on the basis of such privacy directive. In the event that the privacy directive serves merely as a recommendation, the message may inform the system user of the results of the private access bureau process and require that the user decide on one or more manual actions based upon such advice. In a preferred embodiment, wherein the privacy directive additionally serves as an enforcement point in such privacy-enabled system or privacy-assured application, the system would automatically take such input into account by either providing the requested action or foreclosing it in a manner that is in accord with such privacy directive .","Privacy directive key \u2032 summarizes with regard to an illustrative embodiment, the basis for n indication such as a green light, red light or yellow light representing the extent of the data seeker's right to access, view and\/or receive the requested data. For example, a green light may signify that (1) \u201cprivate access\u201d is granted to the record seeker according to a data subject's privacy preference, for example that the data seeker is a particular researcher who is expressly granted the right to receive the PII whereas on the basis of law or institutional policies absent such express consent, that person or entity would not have such right; or (2) no \u201cprivate access\u201d has been granted but an authority permits access without the data subject's consent, for example, in an emergency medical circumstance, according to controlling Federal and State law, the medical records of the patient are accessible for treatment-related purposes by an attending emergency room physician irrespective of whether the patient consents or not to such access. A red light may signify that (1) the subject's privacy preference prohibits access by this data seeker and this privacy preference is not-over ridden by a controlling authority; or (2) an authority such as the applicable Federal or State law prohibits access without patient consent and no \u201cprivate access\u201d had been granted in the subject's privacy preference. A yellow light may signify that (1) an authority allows access without consent but a private access directive states a subject's preference to prohibit access; or (2) a level of uncertainty exists that requires further investigation (e.g., the adjudicator could not reach resolution). In the case of a yellow light wherein the adjudicator could not reach resolution, an illustrative embodiment of the invention provides reasons in message  concerning why such resolution could not be reached including details under current law that may assist the data holder regarding how to address the circumstance notwithstanding this challenge in adjudicating to a clear resolution. Additionally, in a preferred embodiment, the system would prompt the data holder and other affected stakeholders in such a circumstance to participate in the enclosed channel private network  or use case illustrations  described in conjunction with . If at least a portion of the record is deemed accessible to the data seeker, the privacy-enabled application or system then opens the record or permissible portion of a requested record , or opens proceeds of a search query  for access by a requestor , \u2032.","Applicant's co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/075,344, entitled \u201cSystem and Method for selectively redacting information in electronic documents\u201d focuses on redacting certain fields or data elements within documents such that a portion but not the entire document may be accessible to some data seekers. It will be apparent to persons of ordinary skill in the art that the operation of the private access bureau supports the effectuation of these redacted fields. To the extent that the document incorporates redactions to designate that a portion (but not all) of a document may be disclosed to a data seeker, then the data holder will need to abide by such redaction requirements before sharing the document as a whole. In a preferred embodiment, the privacy-enabled records system or privacy-assured application employs the privacy directive to render the document  giving effect to the intended redaction(s). However, in the event that the data holder's system does not provide this feature of a preferred embodiment, then the data holder must either manually redact the appropriate portions of the document based on system message  before sharing it with the data seeker, or alternatively secure consent  from the data subject in the manner hereinabove described such that the redaction is withdrawn and the entire document may be shared with the data seeker or withhold sharing the document on the basis of its not being in a position to carry out the requisite redaction.","The private access bureau  also includes an audit handler  that receives notification from the privacy-enabled system or privacy-assured application via a network \u2033\u2033, such as the Internet, when a privacy-enabled record or query is opened.

In a preferred embodiment, the services of the private access bureau are exposed as integration profiles via stateless, reusable Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) services developed as adapters. Multiple binding adapters are implemented to accommodate multiple profiles and multiple bindings, i.e., SOAP over HTTPS, REST-full services, XML over HTTPs, and newer technologies that supplant these in the future. All API calls are secured using industry standard patterns such as WS-Trust, SAML and XACML, enforcing message authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality.","The illustrative API call sequence shows patient  setting  privacy preferences  from any standards-based Web browser or Web-enabled mobile device connected via network \u2032, such as the Internet, to the privacy preference management system (PPMS) component  of private access bureau . As previously described in conjunction with , such privacy preferences  are retained in the privacy preferences repository database  (also  of ) that is connected to the PPMS. The PPMS is also connected to legal authority database  (corresponding to policy repository  of ), which in turn contains policy directives, preferably in the ontology described above or another machine computable form, reflecting Federal law \u2032, State law \u2033, and institutional policies \u2032\u2033. This architecture is extensible, such that if the private access bureau needs to take into account laws, rules, regulations or fees of other applicable jurisdictions such as international bodies, regional, county, city, trade affiliations or the like, collectively other \u2033\u2033, as part of the legal authority database, this is capable of being readily added.","Audit service  is updated  for the set preferences event .

Additionally, patient  can preferably subscribe to receive alerts based on updates to the audit service  that affect the data and\/or records of such data subject.","A researcher  logs in  and authenticates as an authorized user of the privacy-enabled system of record seeker  within a privacy-enabled network . Said researcher  requests data  using said record seeker's privacy-assured application or service, and upon receiving said data request , record seeker  initiates a data request  from the actual record holder . It will be apparent that such request may be systemic (such as when the researcher  proposes to open a record for a specific patient on a hospital records system that in turn must access that record from a second hospital's database within the network). Or, alternatively, such request may be inquiry-based (such as when researcher  initiates an inquiry utilizing a privacy-enabled search engine to locate any document containing one or more keywords or concepts that are located on any of the servers whose data is searchable and may be retrieved provided that this is in accordance with applicable privacy directives), and that in turn produces in response a list of documents fulfilling the search parameters, each with a hypertext link to the record holder assuming that the data holder has the right to make this information available to it.","Before responding to such request for access, or to such request for search results responsive to such an inquiry, record holder  initiates a SAML assertion  to the private access bureau. Upon receipt by the private access bureau  of such inquiry, the PPMS  runs the privacy directives execution engine  generally in the manner described with regard to the operation of the private access bureau  in . The system captures the data request event  in audit service ; and if the inquiry is able to be answered immediately based on the database contents of the privacy preferences and legal authority database, responds to record holder  via an XACML statement  with a privacy directive (as illustrated by directive response  of  and described with respect to  and \u2032 of ).","Alternatively, if the request is not capable of being answered without input by the data subject, then a notice of its processing status having been pended  is sent via network \u2033 to record holder  and a request for express consent  is sent via network \u2032 to the patient . Audit service  is simultaneously updated so that in the event record holder  wishes to check the status  of the decision, this information is available to said record holder  across network \u2033 from audit service . Subsequently, when patient  consents or declines  to permit the proposed action in the manner hereinabove described, this response updates the privacy preferences repository database  of , updates the audit service , and communicates a privacy directive  to record holder  via an XACML statement over network \u2033. Because this action requires an intervening action by patient  (or timing-out of the system due to the failure of the data subject to timely respond), the step of communicating privacy directive  to record holder  is shown as taking place asynchronously. Additionally, the fact of the privacy directive  or  having been sent to record holder  is recorded in a capture disposition event  update to the audit service.","Upon receipt of the privacy directive  or , as applicable, record holder  is able to consider the recommendation communicated therein and thereafter fulfill or decline to fulfill  the data seeker's request. Accordingly, in the example given above of the privacy-enabled record holder system, record holder  is able to provide (or on the basis of not having adequate privacy permissions to do so), decline to provide, the requested document; and in the second example of a privacy-enabled search engine, record holder  is able to display the permissible search results.

To address this challenge and provide the benefits of greater health information sharing, systems are available for health enterprises (or collaborations of multiple health enterprises) to better integrate such data. For example Microsoft\u00ae Amalga, HealthVision's Cloverleaf, and Antellio's PIE products each assist an enterprise to aggregate data from various clinical, laboratory, financial and administrative systems in order to permit a comprehensive consumer-centric view that includes, for example, test results, imaging procedures, lab results, dictated reports of surgery, as well as patient demographics and contact information. Additionally, a number of health information exchanges (HIEs) have built and are building networks of health enterprises, and numerous standards bodies and industry committees, including private and government-sponsored initiatives, have developed and seek to develop data standards to help reduce such integration challenges within new HIT hardware and software systems. The goal of these various integration systems  is to increasingly integrate the data within the historical silos of information. Even though in , integration system  is shown as being a system such as Microsoft Amalga, persons of ordinary skill will appreciate that similar principles to those described herein will generally apply to other instances wherein an integration system represents a junction point for the exchange of data between nodes on the network such as is the case with HIEs, RHIOs and the like.","In accordance with the principles of the invention, one of the core functions of the private access bureau is to enable a patient (i.e., such as patient  on ) from a standards-compliant Web browser or Web-enabled mobile device such as smart phone  to easily and unambiguously communicate with health enterprise  concerning her wishes as to sharing her personal data that said enterprise  is holding on one or more of the systems within the protected boundaries of its infrastructure .

Upon receipt of such notice, preferably accompanied by an explanation of the reasons for the proposed action, the patient may indicate her approval or disapproval via user interface , by clicking on consent button  or decline button , respectively.","On this basis, in the manner described with regard to , above, the private access bureau will generate privacy directive  to allow \u2032 or prohibit \u2032 the data from being used or shared in the manner described. Alternatively, as discussed in conjunction with , below, the patient may click on one or more hypertext links to view or request additional information, or select snooze button  in order to be reminded at a later time.","In a preferred embodiment, the private access bureau also permits the patient to initiate the proposed transmittal to a third-party entity, such as a Personal Health Record or other entity. To the extent that such record exists in an electronic form, in accordance with the principles of the invention and as required under HITECH from and after a designated implementation deadline, the records can be transmitted electronically by health enterprise  or may be sent as \u201ca paper record,\u201d preferably with a tracking code for such transmittal being entered (for example, in a preferred embodiment, through an integration of the private access bureau with a courier system's automated tracking systems) or manually.","Persons of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate the substantial difference that exists between the foregoing approach and systems such as the BlueButton\u00ae Initiative announced in August  and other vendor-tethered systems wherein the means of granting such request (or conducting such authorization action in response to an alert) is limited to a single data holder or data seeker system. Thus, in one preferred embodiment, enterprise  provides a free private access bureau account to all of its patients ()-() as part of registration and as a supplement to the required HIPAA Notice disclosures process, with those patients who already have a private access bureau account utilizing it to grant data disclosure authorizations appropriate to their reasons for being attended by said health enterprise. This has the advantage of permitting each account holder's identity to be verified and witnessed by an employee of enterprise , in turn providing an added means to help reduce the chances of error or identity fraud.","Once such private access bureau accounts exist, the patient is able to declare whether she wishes for data to be shared in various ways and, if she would find this helpful, to receive independent perspectives on doing so based on conferring with a trusted guide . Thus, the enterprise has a ready means to present to patients ()-() opportunities for data sharing that some patients may view as being of benefit and others might prefer to decline. Among other things, these include authorizing the transfer of certain records into a third-party PHR such as Microsoft HealthVault or a different system designated by the patient, authorizing data to be accessible for research and\/or clinical trials recruitment purposes; consenting to organ donor programs and voluntary data registries, and the like, and in which case only the subset of patients wishing such special data sharing arrangement ()-() may voluntarily elect to participate.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0102","num":"0108"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 7("],"i":"a","b":["1502","1502","1504","1502","1328"]},"Splash screen  describes, from a consumer's perspective, several key features and benefits of the private access bureau.

Persons of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that within certain jurisdictions and for some recipients of such agent designation, this action may require additional paper-based authorizations and\/or confirmation steps that, depending on jurisdiction, must be witnessed by a third-party and\/or notarized in advance of submittal. In such instances, in a preferred embodiment, the system would prompt the user to enter all of the pertinent information into the system, automatically enter these in the appropriate legal form and format using a templates directory for such authorities, and instruct the user what additional steps are required. For example, the system might prompt the user to print and bring the completed form to a notary public, and provide them with a physical address and\/or fax number to send the form, once properly notarized.","The list of record holders  can be prepared in a number of ways. Among these, the names can be manually entered by the user from his or her records or selected from a pick-list provided by the system. Once the user has entered a stakeholder, such as his or her insurer, the system may recognize and present for the user's consideration any parties who have made a claim against the patient's insurance over a designated period of time. It will be apparent how this \u201creverse claiming\u201d method can be employed with a variety of other stakeholders. Another means for populating the list of record holders  may be based on entities and\/or individuals appearing in a Lexis\/Nexis, consumer credit bureau, or data aggregator report for the individual, which generally identifies parties with whom there are established accounts and\/or some sort of activity. Additionally, there are several fields where the market share of various vendors is so substantial that one or a few of just a handful of possible firms exist, with whom the user is likely to have had contact. And for these entities, a preferred embodiment may broadcast a request once authorized to do so by the user, asking that if they have records that they so indicate, such that the user may decide whether he or she wishes to add these to list .","As shown, the record holders list  is preferably grouped into a number of intuitive categories, thereby making it easy for a user to indicate preferences as s a group. Each category preferably includes a number  that designates the number of individuals presently in that category, and hypertext links for viewing  the more detailed list as well as for editing (e.g., adding, deleting and\/or revising the listed contact information)  the list. The interface also identifies  the reason (including the data subject) to whom it pertains, and provides a summary of the purpose . It also provides an explanation  concerning the proposed action and context-sensitive primary action keys, including consent button , decline button , and snooze button , as well as link  to read about these alternatives, and other options. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that various authorities provide the right to the data subject to specify that manner in which they with the data to be treated, which may in turn trigger voluntary, best-efforts based and\/or mandatory action by the data holder. For example, whereas under HIPAA, the Turning next to , a simplified illustration shows the effect of the patient setting privacy preferences generally as described in the foregoing examples to effect and manage the sharing of data by other data holders in accordance with the teachings of the invention. A data subject's Web-enabled mobile device  (corresponding to device  in ) above) is running a mobile version of interface  of the private access bureau. In the manner described in respect to ), the data subject sends privacy directives \u2032 and \u2033 to various record holders\u2014in the case of this illustration, including a major pharmacy benefits provider and a major national testing laboratory\u2014via a network \u2032 and \u2033 such as the Internet. In the case of the data holders selected for the foregoing illustration, both firms have already developed and currently offer mobile interfaces (pictured as  for Medco and  for Quest Labs, respectively) that give patients an opportunity to create user accounts, receive medical information, obtain pricing, place orders (in the case of prescriptions) and make appointments (in the case of lab procedures), set reminders, and growing list of related features and functions. In both instances, these vendors currently provide patients the opportunity to download in Acrobat\u00ae a copy of their prescription history  and laboratory test results  respectively, and at least one of the firms offers the ability to upload this information to Microsoft HealthVault, a PHR.","However, these actions must be managed directly from a website or mobile application for the respective vendor and the selected PHR. In turn, this can require considerable effort by a patient, particularly when one appreciates that each patient may have several dozen (or more) such relationships. Thus, even if each company offers similar capabilities now or in the future, the account setup, website designs and configuration of appropriate settings for each of these firms are all somewhat different, time-consuming, and for some consumers, difficult to learn and recall one site to the next. This is particularly true for the elderly and persons who are chronically ill, who on the one hand could benefit the most from this sort of system; and at the same time are the least likely to use a system that requires logging into, establishing online accounts at, and managing multiple websites. Moreover, consumers\u2014and particularly patients\u2014are often frustrated by needing to respond to essentially the same basic questions about themselves and their medical history  and their basic user preferences  with each new vendor and provider.","In accordance with one preferred embodiment of the invention, all of this complexity is instead managed from a single, simplified user interface . The operations of the private access bureau mask the complexity and variability of interface design, and to make certain that the patient only has to answer the same question (such as their name and whether they authorize marketing by affiliated entities, etc) once and that this data is re-used (or customized and used, if the patient prefers) across all of the sites.","Thus, upon acceptance of the agency representation issued by the data subject having selected, for example, consent  in ) and receipt of a privacy directive authorizing transfer of such information as a result of the data subject having selected consent  in ), these data holders respond by sending the requested data via a network \u2032\u2033 and \u2033\u2033 such as the Internet to the data repository location  specified by the data subject. Without limiting the foregoing, such data repository location  may be a PHR, a health records data bank, a personal information manager, or any other properly configured facility that the patient is comfortable establishing and\/or designating to hold this sort of information. In connection with the foregoing, it should be noted that one provision of the HITECH Act gives the patient a legal right to instruct any data holder to provide this information to the patient or to the party to whom the patient directs; and at all times following an implementation deadline, each data holder is required to comply with this request. As noted above, although the foregoing steps are illustrated based upon using mobile device , each can similarly be initiated from a patient portal for the private access bureau via a standards-based Web browser.","If authorized by the records subject, said data repository  may in a manner that is well understood by persons of ordinary skill in the art of database search engines, allow certain of its records to be periodically crawled  (and\/or otherwise submit the data contained therein) to be indexed  by one or more privacy-enabled search engines . In accordance with the teachings of the invention, such privacy-enabled search engine  is able to permit property authenticated persons (or bots) to search for relevant data by making queries from any standards-based Web browser or Web-enabled device, and receive search results as and when authorized by the then applicable privacy directives.","As described hereinabove, in applicant's issued patents and other co-pending filings, and in connection with  below, in certain cases, receiving the desired results from such search queries may require the express authorization of the data subject before the results of a search query may be returned to the individual searcher. Such private access bureau inquiries  are sent via a network \u2032\u2033\u2033 such as the Internet, and are shown through the actions of the private access bureau to result in privacy alerts (e.g., consent requests)  that appear on user interface  of the data subject's mobile device  or corresponding browser interface-based alerts. The responsive action taken by the data subject, such as clicking on consent button  or  of ) in order to dynamically make updates to his or her privacy preferences  are communicated via network \u2033\u2033\u2033 such as the Internet to the private access bureau. These updates will correspondingly, and through the operation of the private access bureau as described hereinabove, result in updates to the privacy directives  effecting disclosure (or not) of search results via such one or more privacy-enabled search engines .","Although the foregoing disclosure describes the use of data repository  to aggregate data from a variety of sources, one of the advantages of the invention is to make it possible for the data to rather remain at the location of each data holder. In this one optional preferred embodiment, each data holder would permit the privacy-enabled search engine  to crawl and index information on said data holder's web server. This offers a number of advantages as have been previously discussed in applicants various filings and co-pending applications.","By way of another non-limiting example, the hereinabove described invention offers potentially significant advantages over the present state of the art in the field of social media. Persons of ordinary skill in the art of social media will readily appreciate that there is increasing concern by consumers, regulatory agencies and advocacy groups surrounding privacy in this field. Social media applications have become the poster child for the problems of the industry, including concerns about online tracking, location-based tracking, use of personal data without permission, and frequent changes to the company's privacy policy and privacy controls. By design, most social media privacy policies and privacy settings are vague, confusing and subject to change, including returning the settings back to the \u201cdefault\u201d levels which require users who are concerned about privacy to figure out how to configure new user interfaces and reinstate their earlier settings each time the company changes its system. In general, consumers don't trust social media applications to have their privacy interests at heart. And this is not an isolated problem, in part as a result of the reasons described in the Background section above.","The private access bureau ported through social media applications in accordance with the teachings of the invention provides users the opportunity to set all of their privacy settings from a single interface, and to receive alerts whenever their social media provider institutes changes that require these settings to be updated. The system is able to utilize trusted guides, crowd sourcing and \u201cfriend\u201d referrals regarding desirable privacy settings and strategies, as well as explanations and comparative ratings for why these are preferred over other approaches. Once instituted by a user, these same settings\u2014and the underlying principles upon which the granular setting are based\u2014can apply to a user's social media application and, similar to the method described above, be re-used (or customized and used) as the basis for other popular websites. This will provide the advantages described herein associated with setting one's privacy preferences once and managing these privacy settings across multiple websites and domains where ones personal data is held from a user interface that is designed to make privacy as simple and intuitive as possible, and that includes active alerts when privacy concerns require the user's attention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0120","num":"0126"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 9("],"b":["9","9","1702","1704","1706","1708","1708"],"i":["a ","b","a"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0121","num":"0127"},"figref":"FIG. 9(","i":"b","b":["1701","1667","1660"]},"The patient indicates one or more search terms  to commence the process of locating a physician. Generally, this search may be based on medical need and corresponding specialty, geographic convenience, patient feedback ratings, availability within a preferred date\/time range, and other factors. Rectangular box  displays the results of the search query based on the criteria indicated. If these results are not acceptable, the patient may elect to return  to the earlier step and conduct another search based on different criteria, and by either adding, deleting or simply amending search terms or ranges, possibly produce different results. From results list , the patient may select a doctor of interest  and review a profile and other information about them . If the patient wishes to continue searching, then she may return  to the search results screen  (or alternatively all the way back to ) and select one or more other doctors to review. Alternatively, if the doctor\/date\/time are deemed acceptable, then the patient selects a time shown  and fills out the fields needed in order to book an appointment with that professional .","In a preferred embodiment of the system, the patient is presented an opportunity  to share her medical history with the doctor. Persons of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that this will provide the doctor's staff a chance to pull the appropriate records in advance, possibly confirm credit history acceptability, and check with the doctor if something in the records suggests that someone different should see this patient. This will permit both the doctor (and his staff) to be better prepared for the appointment, thereby saving time and reducing overhead cost. From the patient's perspective, this opportunity to complete some of the paperwork in advance of the appointment is also able to reduce the time required when the patient arrives, and for simultaneously improving the quality of the data available to the doctor at the point of care.","Nevertheless, if the patient declines in step  to supply medical history in advance of the appointment (or in one preferred embodiment, is unwilling to make her information accessible to search by the medical professional), then she is returned to the beginning webpage , which ends the online scheduling flow. Alternatively, if she indicates a willingness to share her medical profile, then in one preferred embodiment, the system fetches a medical history template  for the doctor with whom she has booked an appointment, or if the professional or his staff have not yet approved a template for this purpose, then the system provides a generic template for the type of professional. In step , the patient is asked (or if permissions are available from the private access bureau, then the system may already know) whether she has an existing medical profile. If she does, then in step , the selected template is filled using data from the patient's existing profile, and in step  the pre-completed form is displayed to the patient for review. Alternatively, if in step , the patient does not already have medical information from which the system is able to pre-populate the template, then the patient is prompted in step  to manually fill out the form fields, whereupon it is displayed to the patient for review .","The patient is then asked at step  whether all of the data included in the form is complete and current as shown. In an optional preferred embodiment, any responses that are incomplete, or for which conflicting or illogical data appears, will be highlighted. If the patient wishes to supplement any responses, she is returned to step  to manually enter and\/or update the appropriate information. At the point that she is comfortable at step  that the form is complete, the system will proceed to step  and preferably ask whether she has a private access bureau account (or if permissions are available from the bureau, then the system may already know she does). If so, then the system asks at step  (or in an optional preferred embodiment already knows based on current privacy preferences) whether the current privacy settings permit the data to be shared with the intended recipient. If such rights to share the information already exist as confirmed by the transfer API sequence  generally as illustrated in  (and if deemed useful, confirmed by the patient in an optional preferred step), then authorization is given to the data holder in step  to make the information available and it is sent to the medical professional (or they are informed that it is available to them via privacy-enabled search) in step , the audit log service is updated , and the patient is returned to the beginning webpage , which ends the online scheduling flow.","Alternatively, if at step , the patient indicates that she does not have an account, she is redirected to the private access bureau to establish a new account  before continuing. Whether in setting up a new account, or alternatively for an existing account adding additional privacy preferences that permit the data to be shared with the selected person, role and\/or group, then at step , the patient is presented with an opportunity to make this designation. In one preferred embodiment, this is achieved using an alert such as illustrated by user interface  in ); and in optional step , the patient is presented one or more opportunities to consider other possible privacy settings. List  provides a number of examples, including making data available for clinical trials recruitment generally in the manner illustrated by user interface  in ), expressly permitting data to be used to tailor marketing offers for goods or services of interest to the patient at this time, and soliciting data from other sources such as described above in conjunction with  and user interface  of ).","In a preferred embodiment, all of these additional privacy preferences are important but since setting them was not the primary reason for the patient's visit, discretion needs to be used to avoid overwhelming the patient with too many approvals from list  during a single user session. And, at the conclusion of step , in such alternative workflow, authorization is given to the data holder in step  to make the information available and it is sent to the medical professional (or they are informed that it is available to them via privacy-enabled search) in step , and the audit log service is updated in step . At this point, the patient is returned to the beginning webpage , which ends the online scheduling flow. Persons of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that in one preferred system, the entity providing online scheduling (e.g., fulfilling steps  through ) may be different from the one (or ones) holding the patient's relevant medical data from which the medical history may be rapidly and thoroughly compiled (e.g., fulfilling steps  through ), and the private access bureau (e.g., fulfilling the remaining steps  through ) are not the same. Accordingly, a feature of one preferred embodiment of the private access bureau is to enable this specialization, and the added efficiency of permitting personal medical records to remain in the hands of the entities that originally created them (and be responsive to search), as described above.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0128","num":"0134"},"figref":["FIGS. 10","FIG. 10("],"i":["a ","e ","a"],"b":"10"},"Subparts (a) and (c) of  are representative of a traditional, consumer-facing Internet search engine. ) shows a conventional Web-browser  used to access the search Home Page , which in turn displays a number of channels  and a search field .

For example, list  includes \u201cMake certain you are logged in\u201d (since one of the common requirements for successfully searching for private information is that the searcher be logged in and properly authenticated) and \u201cVerify that you are authorized to search for this record\u201d (since the essence of such privacy directives is to ascertain whether the searcher has the right\u2014e.g., is authorized in the manner hereinabove described\u2014to receive a private data element in her search results. Yet another recommendation listed that is unique to privacy-enabled search is \u201cAdd another identifying term to help distinguish between persons with the same name.\u201d Thus, for example, if there were two patients of the same first and last name, and who both had the same doctor's name in the search results, but wherein the data for only one of these two were permitted to be shared with the searcher, neither result could be displayed until this possible overlap was resolved that could lead to erroneously disclosing one of the two results. Thus, for example, entry of the mailing address for the user or a telephone number might be sufficient to distinguish between the data subjects, such that if the privacy directive for that result provided the searcher with the right to see these records, then it would appear in the search results page. However, another aspect of the invention provides added protections through dynamic consent; and generally as described above with respect to , the system sends an alert requiring action by the data subject.","In this regard, mobile device  is shown, and includes privacy alert  corresponding to the alert previously described in connection with user interface  of ). To the extent that the foregoing search query was presented by the physician listed as a data seeker, and the patient was the person authorized to grant consent to access said records that are responsive to such inquiry, then by clicking on the green consent button , he would be able to update the privacy directive concerning such responsive data in the manner hereinbefore described, and the search results would thereafter appear in said data seeker's search results \u2032 shown in ). As illustrated, based on the effect of such privacy directive, note  indicates that there are four results that are responsive to the query and for which the searcher has the right to see search results. Each of these results are displayed with a subject line or title , a brief excerpt  showing the portion of the data that includes key search terms, and a hypertext link  for accessing the record from the server on which it is contained such as data repository  on , or other privacy-enabled Web server.","In one preferred embodiment, the search results also contain responsive documents for which the underlying document is held elsewhere\u2014perhaps not even in a digital form. Thus, for example, search result  shows that a prior healthcare claim paid by the patient's insurance company includes the relevant search terms. This result is accompanied by a link where this estimate of benefits report is contained. And, as shown in the example, this result may include link  that provides the user an ability to order the underlying record from the data holder. Display advertising , which in this case is able to be permission based, is presented, and includes links  for additional information and to arrange contact.","Now turning to ), which depicts practice of the principles hereof suitable for implementation in the system identified in , a description of which follows thereafter. In this regard, it will be observed that the first numbered element in ) is rectangular box , entitled \u201cEnclosed channel private network.\u201d Persons of ordinary skill in the art of social networking will note that the label shown for rectangular box  also indicates that the network is focused on a single jurisdiction. While it is not required that each jurisdiction be addressed in a separate private professionals network, it is nonetheless deemed preferable that this be done.","As described with respect to ), multiple jurisdictions rules are preferably taken into account in processing an inquiry respecting which a data holder may wish to share information with a data seeker. However, given the objective that the system continuously improve over time, which is anticipated to require actions to amend and\/or clarify various laws, statutes and rules, which will necessarily require actions in different jurisdictions, it is deemed preferable that each jurisdiction be able to function independently. At the same time, it would be highly desirable that experiences attained for one jurisdiction such as a state or province be considered by others undertaking similar rules-making discussions, and therefore in a preferred embodiment there may be a role for a neutral party who has worked with (or is concurrently working with) multiple jurisdictions. For the foregoing reasons, the preferred embodiment reflects that private network  is focused on the critical topics of discussion  respecting rules making authority  for use cases . Thus one role for such optional neutral party may be to bring such critical topics  and\/or the existence of use cases  to the attention of professionals network .","Such network is comprised of various subject matter experts, inquirers and commentators , including in a preferred embodiment lawyers (), and privacy compliance officers () who possess experiences working with and\/or for entities that handle confidential documents. Additionally such professionals would preferably include public officials and their spokespersons (); as well as various cause-related advocates and other persons having an interest in the exchange (or, as the case may be, in limiting the exchange) of confidential data and records (). In a preferred embodiment, each of such subject matter experts, inquirers and commentators  are able to access and participate in professional network  using a standards-based Internet browser and interface, illustrated by arrows () through (), respectively, from computers () through () illustrated on , below.","The results of discussions, internal opinion polling, posts, and the corresponding input offered by such community members, invited guests, as well as the materials provided by such persons with respect to such discussions (collectively herein referred to as \u201ccrowd-sourcing\u201d), is compiled and analyzed using various data analytics means  that is well known to those of ordinary skill in the art to ascertain the consensus, if any, regarding the clarity and applicability of specific laws, rules, statutes, regulations, policies and the like. Normal curve  reflects one possible result of such data analysis. While there are obviously an infinite variety of possibilities for how readily accessible machine computation rules may be derived for various jurisdictions and\/or institutions, curve  is offered merely for illustrative (rather than ascription) purposes as of a particular point in time (e.g., as of \u201ctime \u201d).","Persons of ordinary knowledge in the art will observe that normal curve  includes asymptotic nodes () and (), which as shown in ), are considered to constitute \u201cgold standard\u201d cases under the indicated jurisdiction's and\/or institution's existing laws, regulations or policies for the reason that according to the professionals network, there is little to no disagreement as to the meaning and applicability of such law, regulation or policy  to a given use case . Thus asymptote (), shown at the far left end of normal curve  and shaded solid green in the illustration, represents those instances in which the professionals network reflects for a particular use case  that the jurisdiction or data holder institution permits sharing the data. For the purposes of illustrating the clarity of this input\u2014preferably including favorable comments regarding the input made by others, including those that may commonly tend to disagree with the position or speaker\u2014this asymptote is also accompanied by the notation \u201c100\/0\u201d and a \u201cgreen light,\u201d respectively meaning that for the particular use case, there was unanimity (or near unanimity within a commonly-accepted bound of variation) that sharing is permissible under the applicable law, statute, policy or the like .","By way of a non-limiting example, consider that if the use case  involved access to medical data respecting a patient's EKG results from a electrocardiogram taken several days earlier for a now unconscious patient being seen in a hospital emergency room after complaining of chest pains in the middle of the night, and where the requester (e.g., the data seeker) is an emergency room physician, and the purpose for which she is requesting the record is to consider the appropriate treatment for the patient as a comparative data point to the EKG results shown at the time the patient is being examined. In this use case, under the laws of a large majority of state jurisdictions in the United States as well as federal law under HIPAA, the categorization of the applicable law and action\u2014in this case, \u201cdata sharing is permissible\u201d even without the patient's consent or authorization\u2014would be quite likely. Accordingly, this case  would be characterized under the applicable jurisdiction's regulations  as falling within category () reflected in ).","Asymptote (), shown at the far right of normal curve  and shaded solid red in the illustration, represents those instances in which crowd-sourcing the views of professionals network  reflects for a use case that the jurisdiction or data holder institution prohibits sharing the data. For the purposes of illustrating the clarity of this input\u2014preferably including favorable comments regarding the input made by others, including those that may commonly tend to disagree with the position or speaker\u2014this asymptote is also accompanied by the notation \u201c0\/100\u201d and a \u201cred light\u201d meaning that for the particular use case, there was unanimity that sharing is not permitted under the applicable law, statute, policy or the like.","As another non-limiting example, assume that the patient's chest pains pass and, given the circumstances, were diagnosed by attending medical professionals as most likely having been digestion related. Assume further that as the patient is completing his discharge paperwork, one of the attending nurses notices that the patient appears to have Psoriasis on one shoulder. Assume that she is aware that a pharmaceutical firm is trying to recruit a cohort of subjects for a Phase II trial of an investigational Psoriasis medication, and that given the patient's age and other demographic information, she thinks that he might meet criteria, and that she therefore would like to share his name, contact information, and relevant medical data with the research sponsor. Finally, assume that the institutional policy stipulates that in order to protect patient privacy, providing the names of individuals to researchers as potential subjects requires following the terms of the IRB, which in this instance states that all contacts must be made through the patient's personal doctor and\/or based on responding to inquiries from prospective subjects who've responded to IRB-approved advertisements. Given these facts, if we presume that the professionals network  for the hypothetical jurisdiction concludes that for the applicable use (e.g., sharing personally identifiable information with the research sponsor) requires patient consent that has not been obtained, then the use case  and rule  would fall within the \u201cdata sharing is not permitted\u201d area designated as area () on ).","Turning next to the area situated in between these two extremes, which is designated on the illustration as area  and labeled \u201cQuestionable to some degree,\u201d it will be apparent that the shading ranges from a greenish yellow color adjacent to area (), to a reddish yellow tint immediately adjacent to area (). The area also includes the phrase \u201c99\/1\u21921\/99\u201d to designate that analysis of the proceeds of crowd-sourcing input from professionals network  reflects less than a \u201cgold standard\u201d 100\/0 or 0\/100 conclusion with respect to rules  for specific use cases .

Optionally, in one preferred embodiment of the system, in order to reduce the ability of a recalcitrant or consistently unreasonable contributor, members of the community  might be polled about their view of such argument, and only those arguments considered by a threshold percentage of the professional network  determined to be credible would be taken into account for purposes of such data analytics .","Thus, in the foregoing example, assume that use case  was modified to include as an additional fact that oral permission was first requested by the institution's employee and given by the individual, and a poll the professionals network  concerning whether this would be adequate consent under their jurisdiction's regulations and\/or policies  was conducted. In this instance, even if the network was strongly leaning one way or the other, it would still be reflected as \u201cyellow\u201d for the purposes of the preferred embodiment being described. Nevertheless, given the strong concurrence leaning in one way for this use case, the situation could fall within area , namely \u201copportunities for new rulemaking or lawmaking.\u201d","This area, consisting of sub-parts () and (), shows that based on the distribution of crowd-sourcing data collected\u2014there is an opportunity for getting new law-making or rule-making to clarify that the leaning is correct (or not) so that in the future\u2014e.g., in \u201ctime \u201d, such factual situation would be able to be declared as falling within the asymptote rather than the blurred area in between. If the rules making body, for example, wanted to make it clear than oral approvals were insufficient, the rule could specify that with written proof of consent, the use case  would fall within asymptote () but that all other cases would produce a \u201csharing is not permitted result\u201d ().","Persons of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that gold standard cases () and (), and all \u201cin between\u201d cases , can be compiled and included using conventional means in rules database , where these are reflected as rules () through (), respectively. As shown in ), in step , a weighted expression of these analytics can then be incorporated using conventional means in the programming of the private access bureau  for this particular jurisdiction and\/or institution. As shown, these rules can be applied by such private access bureau when, in effect, asked by the data holder administrator in step  \u201cDo I have the right to share this data with them?\u201d (e.g., referring to authorizing access to specific data by a particular data seeker for a specified use). This may be useful in establishing legal and institutional directives  and  of  (and corresponding policies ,  and  in  and legal authority database  in .","Similarly, opportunities falling within area  shown in ) can be referred as potential changes in laws, policies and regulations  to the appropriate rules making authority , along with the results of deliberations of constituents  regarding that or those rules , and their affect on use case . Although not explicitly shown in ), this is reflected by use of computer  to generate documents used (directly or via electronic connectivity) to such rules making authority  of .","Turning next to ), persons of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate that this illustration shows the effect of changes instituted by such jurisdiction  between timeand time. Thus, as illustrated, over time, conversion of opportunity areas () and () to rules that are deemed by such professionals network as being clear, concise and non-ambiguous, will result in changing asymptote () into area ()(), and asymptote () into area ()(), with the area reflecting residual use cases that are questionable according to at least some threshold percentage of the professionals network being reduced from  to (). These additional rules would be incorporated as updates to policy repository database  for this jurisdiction and\/or institution, such that the rules are current and up-to-date. As noted in the figure, there would still likely remain at timeadditional opportunities for new law-making and\/or rule-setting between timeand a future date (e.g., time), such opportunities being illustrated as areas ()() and ()().","Turning finally to ), it is shown that in a preferred embodiment, the private access bureau would include as its processing rules  (corresponding to the respective policy database repository shown in ,  and ) the weighted expression of the analytics from multiple jurisdictions -() through -(), contained in rules databases -() through (). To date, much of health information exchange has been funded through government grants; and persons of ordinary skill in the art of health data exchange will appreciate that considerable concern has been expressed regarding the need for entities involved in data exchange as well as a number of governmental and\/or quasi-governmental entities that may be optimally positioned to serve as third-party neutrals to become self-sustaining. In order to help defray related costs and provide an economic return, entities involved in compiling such rules databases may in one option preferred embodiment establish a licensing fee or other usage charge for permitting the incorporation and use of their rules into the processing of the private access bureau. Thus, as a non-limiting example, if a private access bureau charges for its services on a per click basis using payment collection method  of , then a percentage of each such click fee may be paid as a service fee to the jurisdictions from whom the applicable data was derived, an annual licensing fee may be charged for such use, and\/or some combination of such arrangements may be utilized. The utility of such system need not be limited to healthcare regulations, laws and policies.","Finally now turning to , it will be observed that this figure depicts the primary components of a preferred system in accordance with the principles of this aspect of the invention. Depicted therein are digital data processor , including a processor section , a random access memory section , and an input\/output control section . Digital data processor  is connected via input\/output control section , to workstation  (including a monitor, keyboard and pointing device), one or more drives or alternative storage media  for storage of software and data, and printer . As shown, the software and data maintained on storage media  preferably includes a profiles database file (), activity log file (), analytics file () and rules database (). Such rules database preferably includes sub-parts ()(), ()() and ()(), comprising rules for use cases described with respect to  in which according to various jurisdictional authorities, data sharing is permissible, not permitted, and for which sharing is questionable to some degree.","As depicted, digital data processor , as well as its sub-components -, peripherals -, and related databases and\/or software (), (), () and (), comprise the system managed and maintained by a professional network operator. Said network operator, along with other computers (), (), () and () are coupled via network  to file server . As depicted, computer () comprises a representative workstation used by attorneys () having an interest (either personally, or on behalf of one or more clients) in the topics discussed in professional network  running on network . Computer () is illustrative of a representative workstation employed by privacy and\/or other compliance officers () having an interest (either personally, or on behalf of one or more clients). Although it is considered likely that a number of attorneys and privacy officers employing the system will also be users of the services of the private access bureau and may employ a single computer workstation, these individuals are nonetheless depicted separately in  solely for the purposes of illustrating the invention.","Computer () depicts a representative workstation maintained by a public official or regulatory agency () for oversight purposes and to respond to questions or provide materials to the professional network . Computer () illustrates a representative workstation employed by one or more advocates or other interested parties (). Digital data processor , as well as its sub-components - and peripherals -, preferably comprise a conventional commercially available personal computer or workstation adapted in accord with the teachings herein for storing, accessing and processing data bases, rules and algorithms ()-(). Computers ()-() and server  also comprise conventional commercially available components of their respective types.
