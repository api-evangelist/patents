abstract: The present invention describes a system and method for communicating voice and data over a packet-switched network that is adapted to coexist and communicate with a legacy PSTN. The system permits packet switching of voice calls and data calls through a data network from and to any of a LEC, a customer facility or a direct IP connection on the data network. The system includes soft switch sites, gateway sites, a data network, a provisioning component, a network event component and a network management component. The system interfaces with customer facilities (e.g., a PBX), carrier facilities (e.g., a LEC) and legacy signaling networks (e.g., SS7) to handle calls between any combination of on-network and off-network callers.

Field of Invention","The present invention relates generally to telecommunications networks and, more particularly, to a system and method for providing transmission for voice and data traffic over a data network, including the signaling, routing and manipulation of such traffic.","2. Related Art","The present invention relates to telecommunications and in particular to voice and data communication operating over a data network. The Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) is a collection of different telephone networks owned by different companies which have for many years provided telephone communication between users of the network. Different parts of the PSTN network use different transmission media and compression techniques.","Most long distance calls are digitally coded and transmitted along a transmission line such as a T1 line or fiber optic cable, using circuit switching technology to transmit the calls. Such calls are time division multiplexed (TDM) into separate channels, which allow many calls to pass over the lines without interacting. The channels are directed independently through multiple circuit switches from an originating switch to a destination switch. Using conventional circuit switched communications, a channel on each of the T1 lines along which a call is transmitted is dedicated for the duration of the call, whether or not any information is actually being transmitted over the channel. The set of channels being used by the call is referred to as a \u201ccircuit.\u201d","Telecommunications networks were originally designed to connect one device, such as a telephone, to another device, such as a telephone, using switching services. As previously mentioned, circuit-switched networks provide a dedicated, fixed amount of capacity (a \u201ccircuit\u201d) between the two devices for the entire duration of a transmission session. Originally, this was accomplished manually. A human operator would physically patch a wire between two sockets to form a direct connection from the calling party to the called party. More recently, a circuit is set up between an originating switch and a destination switch using a process known as signaling.","Signaling sets up, monitors, and releases connections in a circuit-switched system. Various signaling methods have been devised. Telephone systems formerly used in-band signaling to set up and tear down calls. Signals of an in-band signaling system are passed through the same channels as the information being transmitted. Early electromechanical switches used analog or multi-frequency (MF) in-band signaling. Thereafter, conventional residential telephones used in-band dual-tone multiple frequency (DTMF) signaling to connect to an end office switch. Here, the same wires (and frequencies on the wires) were used to dial a number (using pulses or tones), as are used to transmit voice information. However, in-band signaling permitted unscrupulous callers to use a device such as a whistle to mimic signaling sounds to commit fraud (e.g., to prematurely discontinue billing by an interexchange carrier (IXC), also known as a long distance telephone company).","More recently, to prevent such fraud, out-of-band signaling systems were introduced. Out-of-band signaling uses a signaling network that is separate from the circuit switched network used for carrying the actual call information. For example, integrated services digital network (ISDN) uses a separate channel, a data (D) channel, to pass signaling information out-of-band. Common Channel Interoffice Signaling (CCIS) is another network architecture for out-of-band signaling. A popular version of CCIS signaling is Signaling System 7 (SS7). SS7 is an internationally recognized system optimized for use in digital telecommunications networks.","SS7 out-of-band signaling provided additional benefits beyond fraud prevention. For example, out-of-band signaling eased quick adoption of advanced features (e.g., caller id) by permitting modifications, to the separate signaling network. In addition, the SS7 network enabled long distance \u201cEqual Access\u201d (i.e., 1+ dialing for access to any long distance carrier) as required under the terms of the modified final judgment (MFJ) requiring divestiture of the Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs) from their parent company, AT&T.","An SS7 network is a packet-switched signaling network formed from a variety of components, including Service Switching Points (SSPs), Signaling Transfer Points (STPs) and Service Control Points (SCPs). An SSP is a telephone switch which is directly connected to an SS7 network. All calls must originate in or be routed through an SSP. Calls are passed through connections between SSPs. An SCP is a special application computer which maintains information in a database required by users of the network. SCP databases may include, for example, a credit card database for verifying charge information or an \u201c800\u201d database for processing number translations for toll-free calls. STPs pass or route signals between SSPs, other STPs, and SCPs. An STP is a special application packet switch which operates to pass signaling information.","The components in the SS7 network are connected together by links. Links between SSPs and STPs can be, for example, A, B, C, D, E or F links. Typically, redundant links are also used for connecting an SSP to its adjacent STPs. Customer premises equipment (CPE), such as a telephone, are connected to an SSP or an end office (EO) switch.","To initiate a call in an SS7 telecommunications' network, a calling party using a telephone connected to an originating EO switch, dials a telephone number of a called party. The telephone number is passed from the telephone to the SSP at the originating EO (referred to as the \u201cingress EO\u201d) of the calling party's local exchange carrier (LEC). A LEC is commonly referred to as a local telephone company. First, the SSP will process triggers and internal route rules based on satisfaction of certain criteria. Second, the SSP will initiate further signaling messages to another EO or access tandem (AT), if necessary. The signaling information can be passed from the SSP to STPs, which route the signals between the ingress EO and the terminating end office, or egress EO. The egress EO has a port designated by the telephone number of the called party. The call is set up as a direct connection between the EOs through tandem switches if no direct trunking exists or if direct trunking is full. If the call is a long distance call, i.e., between a calling party and a called party located in different local access transport areas (LATAs), then the call is connected through an inter exchange carrier (IXC) switch of any of a number of long distance telephone companies. Such a long distance call is commonly referred to as an inter-LATA call. LECs and IXCs are collectively referred to as the previously mentioned public switched telephone network (PSTN).","Emergence of competitive LECs (CLECs) was facilitated by passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which authorized competition in the local phone service market. Traditional LECs or RBOCs are now also known as incumbent LECs (ILECs). Thus, CLECs compete with ILECs in providing local exchange services. This competition, however, has still not provided the bandwidth necessary to handle the large volume of voice and data communications. This is due to the limitations of circuit switching technology which limits the bandwidth of the equipment being used by the LECs, and to the high costs of adding additional equipment.","Since circuit switching dedicates a channel to a call for the duration of the call, a large amount of switching bandwidth is required to handle the high volume of voice calls. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that the LECs must also handle data communications over the same equipment that handle voice communications.","If the PSTN were converted to a packet-switched network, many of the congestion and limited bandwidth problems would be solved. However, the LECs and IXCs have invested large amounts of capital in building, upgrading and maintaining their circuit switched networks (known as \u201clegacy\u201d networks) and are unable or unwilling to jettison their legacy networks in favor of the newer, more powerful technology of packet switching. Accordingly, a party wanting to build a packet-switched network to provide voice and data communications for customers must build a network that, not only provides the desired functionality, but also is fully compatible with the SS7 and other, e.g., ISDN and MF, switching networks of the legacy systems.","Currently, internets, intranets, and similar public or private data networks that interconnect computers generally use packet switching technology. Packet switching provides for more efficient use of a communication channel as compared to circuit switching. With packet switching, many different calls (e.g., voice, data, video, fax, Internet, etc.) can share a communication channel rather than the channel being dedicated to a single call. For example, during a voice call, digitized voice information might be transferred between the callers only 50% of the time, with the other 50% being silence. For a data call, information might be transferred between two computers 10% of the time. With a circuit switched connection, the voice call would tie-up a communications channel that may have 50% of its bandwidth being unused. Similarly, with the data call, 90% of the channel's bandwidth may go unused. In contrast, a packet-switched connection would permit the voice call, the data call and possibly other call information to all be sent over the same channel.","Packet switching breaks a media stream into pieces known as, for example, packets, cells or frames. Each packet is then encoded with address information for delivery to the proper destination and is sent through the network. The packets are received at the destination and the media stream is reassembled into its original form for delivery to the recipient. This process is made possible using an important family of communications protocols, commonly called the Internet Protocol (IP).","In a packet-switched network, there is no single, unbroken physical connection between sender and receiver. The packets from many different calls share network bandwidth with other transmissions. The packets are sent over many different routes at the same time toward the destination, and then are reassembled at the receiving end. The result is much more efficient use of a telecommunications network than could be achieved with circuit-switching.","Recognizing the inherent efficiency of packet-switched data networks such as the Internet, attention has focused on the transmission of voice information over packet-switched networks. However, such systems are not compatible with the legacy PSTN and therefore are not convenient to use.","One approach that implements voice communications over an IP network requires that a person dial a special access number to access an IP network. Once the IP network is accessed, the destination or called number can be dialed. This type of call is known as a gateway-type access call.","Another approach involves a user having a telephone that is dedicated to an IP network. This approach is inflexible since calls can only be made over the IP network without direct access to the PSTN.","What is needed is a system and method for implementing packet-switched communications for both voice calls and data calls that do not require special access numbers or dedicated phones and permit full integration with the legacy PSTN.","The present invention is a system and method for communicating both voice and data over a packet-switched network that is adapted to coexist and communicate with a PSTN. The system permits efficient packet switching of voice calls and data calls from a PSTN carrier such as, for example, a LEC, IXC, a customer facility or a direct IP connection on the data network to any other LEC, IXC, customer facility or direct IP connection. For calls from a PSTN carrier, e.g., LEC or IXC, the invention receives signaling from the legacy SS7 signaling network or the ISDN D-channel or from inband signaling trunks. For calls from a customer facility, data channel signaling or inband signaling is received. For calls from a direct IP connection on the data network, signaling messages can travel over the data network. On the call destination side, similar signaling schemes are used depending on whether the called party is on a PSTN carrier, a customer facility or a direct IP connection to the data network.","The system includes soft switch sites, gateway sites, a data network, a provisioning component a network event component and a network management component. The system of the invention interfaces with customer facilities (e.g., a PBX), carrier facilities (e.g., a PSTN carrier, a LEC (e.g., ILECs and CLECs), an independent telephone company (ITC), an IXC, an intelligent peripheral or an enhanced service provider (ESP)) and legacy signaling networks (e.g., SS7) to handle calls between any combination of on-network and off-network callers.","The soft switch sites provide the core call processing for the voice network architecture. Each soft switch site can process multiple types of calls including calls originating from or terminating at off-network customer facilities as well as calls originating from or terminating at on-network customer facilities. Each soft switch site receives signaling messages from and sends signaling messages to the signaling network. The signaling messages can include, for example, SS7, integrated services digital network (ISDN) primary rate interface (PRI) and in-band signaling messages. Each soft switch site processes these signaling messages for the purpose of establishing new calls through the data network and tearing down existing calls and in-progress call control functions. Signaling messages can be transmitted between any combination of on-network and off-network callers.","Signaling messages for a call which either originates off-network or terminates off-network can be carried over the out-of-band signaling network of the PSTN via the soft switch sites. Signaling messages for a call which both originates on-network and terminates on-network can be carried over the data network rather than through the signaling network.","The gateway sites originate and terminate calls between calling parties and called parties through the data network. The soft switch sites control or manage the gateway sites. In a preferred embodiment, the soft switch sites use a protocol such as, for example, the Internet Protocol Device Control (IPDC) protocol, to manage network access devices in the gateway sites to request the set-up and tear-down of calls. However, other protocols could be used, including, for example, network access server messaging interface (NMI) and the ITU media gateway control protocol (MGCP).","The gateway sites can also include network access devices to provide access to network resources (i.e., the communication channels or circuits that provide the bandwidth of the data network). The network access devices can be referred to generally as access servers or media gateways. Exemplary access servers or media gateways are trunking gateways (TGs), access gateways (AGs) and network access servers (NASs). The gateway sites provide for transmission of both voice and data traffic through the data network. The gateway sites also provide connectivity to other telecommunications carriers via trunk interfaces to carrier facilities for the handling of voice calls. The trunk interfaces can also be used for the termination of dial-up modem data calls. The gateway sites can also provide connectivity via private lines and dedicated access lines (DALs), such as T1 or ISDN PRI facilities, to customer facilities.","The data network connects one or more of the soft switch sites to one or more of the gateway sites. The data network routes data packets through routing devices (e.g., routers) to destination sites (e.g., gateway sites and soft switch sites) on the data network. For example, the data network routes internet protocol (IP) packets for transmission of voice and data traffic from a first gateway site to a second gateway site. The data network represents any art-recognized data network including the global Internet, a private intranet or internet, a frame relay network, and an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) network.","The network event component collects call events recorded at the soft switch sites. Call event records can be used, for example, for fraud detection and prevention, and billing.","The provisioning event component receives provisioning requests from upstream operational support services (OSS) systems such as, for example, for order-entry, customer service and customer profile changes. The provisioning component distributes provisioning data to appropriate network elements and maintains data synchronization, consistency, and integrity across multiple soft switch sites.","The network management component includes a network operations center (NOC) for centralized network management. Each network element (NE) (e.g., soft switch sites, gateway sites, provisioning, and network event components, etc.) generates simple network management protocol (SNMP) events or alerts. The NOC uses the events generated by each network element to determine the health of the network and to perform other network management functions.","In a preferred embodiment, the invention operates as follows to process, for example, a long distance call (also known as a 1+ call). First, a soft switch site receives an incoming call signaling message from the signaling network. The soft switch site determines the type of call by performing initial digit analysis on the dialed number. Based upon the information in the signaling message, the soft switch site analyzes the initial digit of the dialed number of the call and determines that it is a 1+ call. The soft switch site then queries a customer profile database to retrieve the originating trigger plan associated with the calling customer. The query can be made using, for example, the calling party number provided in the signaling message from the signaling network. This look-up in the customer profile database returns subscription information. For example, the customer profile may indicate that the calling party has subscribed to an account code verification feature that requires entry of an account code before completion of the call. In this case, the soft switch site will instruct the gateway site to collect the account code digits entered by the calling party. Assuming that the gateway site collects the correct number of digits, the soft switch site can use the customer profile to determine how to process the received digits. For account code verification, the soft switch site verifies the validity of the received digits.","Verification can result in the need to enforce a restriction, such as a class of service (COS) restriction (COSR). In this example, the soft switch site can verify that the account code is valid, but that it requires that an intrastate COSR should be enforced. This means that the call is required to be an intrastate call to be valid. The class of service restriction logic can be performed within the soft switch site using, for example, pre-loaded local access and transport areas (LATAs) and state tables. The soft switch would then allow the call to proceed if the class of service requested matches the authorized class of service. For example, if the LATA and state tables show that the LATA of the originating party and the LATA of the terminating party are in the same state, then the call can be allowed to proceed. The soft switch site then completes customer service processing and prepares to terminate the call. At this point, the soft switch site has finished executing all customer service logic and has a 10-digit dialed number that must be terminated. To accomplish the termination, the soft switch site determines the terminating gateway. The dialed number (i.e., the number of the called party dialed by the calling party) is used to select a termination on the data network. This termination may be selected based on various performance, availability or cost criteria. The soft switch site then communicates with a second soft switch site associated with the called party to request that the second soft switch site allocate a terminating circuit or trunk group in a gateway site associated with the called party. One of the two soft switch sites can then indicate to the other the connections that the second soft switch site must make to connect the call. The two soft switch sites then instruct the two gateway sites to make the appropriate connections to set up the call. The soft switch sites send messages to the gateway sites through the data network using, for example, IPDC protocol commands. Alternately, a single soft switch can set up both the origination and termination.","The present invention provides a number of important features and advantages. First, the invention uses application logic to identify and direct incoming data calls straight to a terminating device. This permits data calls to completely bypass the egress end office switch of a LEC. This results in significant cost savings for an entity such as an internet service provider (ISP), ILEC, or CLEC. This decrease in cost results partially from bypass of the egress ILEC end office switch for data traffic.","A further advantage for ISPs is that they are provided data in the digital form used by data networks (e.g., IP data packets), rather than the digital signals conventionally used by switched voice networks (e.g., PPP signals). Consequently, the ISPs need not perform costly modem conversion processes that would otherwise be necessary. The elimination of many telecommunications processes frees up the functions that ISPs, themselves, would have to perform to provide Internet access.","Another advantage of the present invention is that voice traffic can be transmitted transparently over a packet-switched data network to a destination on the PSTN.","Yet another advantage of the invention is that a very large number of modem calls can be passed over a single channel of the data network, including calls carrying media such as voice, bursty data, fax, audio, video, or any other data formats.","Further features and advantages of the invention, as well as the structure and operation of various embodiments of the invention, are described in detail below with reference to the accompanying figures.","In the figures, like reference numbers generally indicate identical, functionally similar, and\/or structurally similar elements. The figure in which an element first appears is indicated by the leftmost digit(s) in the reference number.","I.

In step , soft switch  receives an incoming IAM signaling message from an SS7 GW , signaling an incoming call from calling party  on carrier facility  of a co-carrier.","In step , soft switch  sends IPDC commands to trunking gateway  to set up a connection (e.g. a DS0 or DS1 circuit) between carrier facility  and TG  described in the received IAM signaling message.

Soft Switch","Referring back to , soft switch  provides the call processing function for telecommunications network . Call processing refers to the handling of voice and data calls. There are a number of important call processing functions handled by soft switch . Soft switch  processes signaling messages used for call setup and call tear down. These signaling messages can be processed by in-band of out-of-band signaling. For an example of out-of-band signaling, SS7 signaling messages can be transmitted between signaling network  and soft switch . (Soft switch  refers to soft switches , and .)","Another call processing function performed by soft switch  is preliminary digit analysis. Preliminary digit analysis is performed to determine the type of call arriving at soft switch . Examples of calls include toll free calls, 1+ calls, 0+ calls, 011+ calls, and other calls recognized by those skilled in the art.","One important feature of soft switch  is communicating with CS\/CDB  to retrieve important customer information. Specifically, soft switch  queries CS\/CDB  to retrieve a customer trigger plan. The customer trigger plan effectively identifies the service logic to be executed for a given customer. This trigger plan is similar to a decision tree pertaining to how a call is to be implemented. Subsequently, soft switch  executes the customer trigger plan. This includes the processing of special service calls requiring external call processing, i.e., call processing that is external to the functions of telecommunications network .","Another important function soft switch  is communicating with RS  to provide network routing information for a customer call. For example, soft switch  can query RS  to retrieve the route having the least cost from an off-network calling party  (homed to gateway site ) to an off-network called party  (homed to gateway site ) over data network . Upon finding the least cost route, soft switch  allocates ports on TGs , . As described in detail below, soft switch  can also be used to identify the least cost route termination and allocate gateway ports over AGs ,  between an on-network calling party  (homed to gateway site ) and an on-network called party  (homed to gateway site ).","Soft switch  also communicates with AGs , , TGs , , and NASs ,  over data network . Although AGs , , TGs ,  and NASs ,  can communicate with a plurality of soft switches, as illustrated in , these network nodes (referred to collectively as access servers , , , and ) are respectively assigned to a primary soft switch. This primary soft switch, e.g., soft switch , assumes a primary responsibility or control of the access servers. In addition, the access servers can be as respectively assigned to secondary switches, which control the access servers in the event that the primary soft switch is unavailable.","Referring back to , western soft switch site , central soft switch site  and eastern soft switch site  are geographically diverse. For example, western soft switch site  can be a soft switch site located in San Diego, Calif. Central soft switch site  can be a soft switch site located in Denver, Colo. Eastern soft switch site  can be a soft switch site located in Boston, Mass.","It is permissible that additional network nodes are provided at any of soft switch sites ,  and . For example, additional elements, including, e.g., SS7 GW , CDB , and RS can be collocated at western soft switch site . Examples of other supporting elements of western soft switch site  are an announcement server (ANS), a network event collection point (NECP), an SCP, and on-network STPs.

MMI can be used as a direct controller for management and machine actions. It should be noted that this is not intended to be the main control interface, but is rather available to accommodate the need for on-site emergency maintenance activities.","Yet another interface permits communication between soft switches , . A soft switch-to-soft switch interface will be described further with reference to . A soft switch -to-soft switch  interface permits communication between the soft switches ,  that control the originating call-half and terminating call-half of call flow . The soft switch -to-soft switch  interface allows soft switches ,  to set up, tear down and manage voice and data calls. Soft switch  to soft switch  interface can allow for a plurality of inbound and outbound signaling types including, for example, SS7, ISDN, and in-band E&M signaling.","In telephony, E&M is a trunking arrangement generally used for two-way (i.e., either side may initiate actions) switch-to-switch or switch-to-network connections. E&M signaling refers to an arrangement that uses separate leads, called respectively the \u201cE\u201d lead and the \u201cM\u201d lead, for signaling and supervisory purposes. The near-end signals the far-end by applying \u221248 volts DC (\u201cVDC\u201d) to the \u201cM\u201d lead, which results in a ground being applied to the far end's \u201cE\u201d lead. When \u221248 VDC is applied to the far-end \u201cM\u201d lead, the near-end \u201cE\u201d lead is grounded. \u201cE\u201d lead originally stood for \u201cear,\u201d i.e., when the near-end \u201cE\u201d lead was grounded, the far end was calling and \u201cwanted your ear.\u201d \u201cM\u201d originally stood for \u201cmouth,\u201d because when the near-end wanted to call (i.e., to speak to) the far end, \u221248 VDC was applied to that lead.","When a PBX wishes to connect to another PBX directly, or to a remote PBX, or to an extension telephone over a leased voice-grade line (e.g., a channel on a T-1), the PBX can use a special line interface. This special line interface is quite different from that which the PBX uses to interface to directly-attached phones. The basic reason for the difference between a normal extension interface and a long distance interface is that the respective signaling requirements differ. This is true even if the voice signal parameter, such as level and two-wire, four-wire remain the same. When dealing with tie lines or trunks, it is costly, inefficient, and too slow for a PBX to do what an extension telephone would do, i.e., to go off hook, wait for a dial tone, dial, wait for ringing to stop, etc. The E&M tie trunk interface device is a form of standard that exists in the PBX, T-1 multiplexer, voice-digitizer, telephone company world. E&M signaling can take on a plurality of forms. At least five different versions exist. E&M signaling is the most common interface signaling method used to interconnect switching signaling systems with transmission signaling systems.","The sample configuration depicted in , can use a soft switch -to-soft switch  protocol. In , the access servers depicted are trunking gateways , . TGs ,  are connected to the switch circuit network (SCN), i.e., signaling network , via SS7 trunks, ISDN trunks, and in-band trunks. The originating soft switch  can receive a call over any of these trunks. The signaling information from these SS7, ISDN, and in-band trunks is processed by soft switch  to establish the originating call-half. The signaling information processed by soft switch , can be used to determine the identity of terminating soft switch . The identity of terminating soft switch  is required to complete the call.","Originating soft switch  can then communicate the necessary information to complete the call, via an inter-soft switch communication (ISSC) protocol. Terminating soft switch  can be required to be able to establish the terminating call-half on any of the supported trunk types. The ISSC protocol can use a message set that is structured similarly to the IPDC protocol message set. The messages can contain a header followed by a number of tag-length-value attributes. The incoming signaling message for the call being placed, can be carried in a general data block of one of the attribute value pairs (AVPs). The other AVPs, can contain additional information necessary to establish a voice-over-IP connection between the originating and terminating ends of the call.","b. SS7 Gateway","SS7 gateways (GWs) ,  will now be described further with reference to  and . In , SS7 GWs ,  receive signaling messages from signaling network  and communicate these messages to soft switch . Specifically, for SS7 signaled trunks, SS7 GWs ,  can receive SS7 ISUP messages and transfer them to soft switch . SS7 GWs ,  can also receive signaling messages from soft switch  and send SS7 ISUP messages out to signaling network .","(1) SS7 Gateway Example Embodiment","In an example embodiment, SS7 GWs ,  can be deployed in a two (2) computing element (CE) cluster , depicted in .

OMNI is a telecommunications middleware product that runs on a UNIX operating system. An exemplary operating system is the SUN UNIX, available from SUN Microsystems, Inc. of Palo Alto, Calif. The core of OMNI resides logically below the service applications, providing a middleware layer upon which telecommunications applications can be efficiently deployed. Since the operating system is not encapsulated, service applications have direct access to the entire operating environment. Because of OMNI's unique SIGNALWARE architecture, OMNI has the ability to simultaneously support variants of SS7 signaling technology (ITU-T, ANSI, China and Japan).","The SIGNALWARE architecture core is composed of the Message Transfer Part (MTP) Layer 2 and Layer 3, and Service Connection Control Part (SCCP). These core protocols are supplemented with a higher layer of protocols to meet the needs of a target application or service. OMNI supports multiple protocol stacks simultaneously, each potentially with the point code format and protocol support of one of the major SS7 variants.","OMNI SIGNALWARE Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are found on the higher layers of the SS7 protocol stack.

In order to assure that all signaling messages for a particular call get to the correct one of soft switches , , , it is necessary to partition SS7 signaling across the available soft switches based upon the circuits that each soft switch services.","It is much more efficient to run SS7 links to soft switches than to each individual access server (compare to the conventional approach requiring an SS7 link to each SSP). Centralization of SS7 signaling traffic interconnection enables benefits from economies of scale, by requiring less SS7 interconnection links.","An exemplary technique for distributing circuits across soft switches , , is based upon the originating point code (OPC), destination point code (DPC), and CIC. OPC represents the originating point code for a circuit group, i.e., the point code of a local exchange carrier (LEC) switch, or signal point (SP). For example, the LEC providing CICs - , and CICs -  can have an OPC  of value . The LEC providing CICs - , and CICs -  can have an OPC  of value . The LEC switch providing CICs - , and CICs -  has an OPC  of value . Similarly, DPC represents the destination point code for a circuit group, i.e., the point code of soft switch site .

H.323 will be the foundation of future LAN-based products for consumer, business, entertainment, and professional applications.","H.323 is an umbrella recommendation from the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) that sets standards for multimedia communications over Local Area Networks (LANs) that do not provide a guaranteed Quality of Service (QoS). These networks dominate today's corporate desktops and include packet-switched TCP\/IP and IPX over Ethernet, Fast Ethernet and Token Ring network technologies. Therefore, the H.323 standards are important building blocks for a broad new range of collaborative, LAN-based applications for multimedia communications.","The H.323 specification was approved in 1996 by the ITU's Study Group 16. Version 2 was approved in January 1998. The standard is broad in scope and includes both stand-alone devices and embedded personal computer technology as well as point-to-point and multipoint conferences. H.323 also addresses call control, multimedia management, and bandwidth management as well as interfaces between LANs and other networks.","H.323 is part of a larger series of communications standards that enable videoconferencing across a range of networks.

It is the dominant standard of the next generation of Internet phones, audio conferencing terminals, and video conferencing technologies.","All H.323 terminals must also support H.245, which is used to negotiate channel usage and capabilities.  depicts an exemplary H.323 terminal . Three other components are required: Q.931 for call signaling and call setup, a component called Registration\/Admission\/Status (RAS), which is a protocol used to communicate with a gatekeeper ; and support for RTP\/RTCP for sequencing audio and video packets.","Optional components in an H.323 terminal are video codecs, T.120 data conferencing protocols, and MCU capabilities (described further below).","Gateway  is an optional element in an H.323 conference.  depicts an example H.323 gateway. Gateways  provide many services, the most common being a translation function between H.323 conferencing endpoints and other terminal types. This function includes translation between transmission formats (i.e. H.225.0 to H.221) and between communications procedures (i.e. H.245 to H.242). In addition, gateway  also translates between audio and video codecs and performs call setup and clearing on both the LAN side and the switched-circuit network side.  shows an H.323\/PSTN Gateway .","In general, the purpose of gateway  is to reflect the characteristics of a LAN endpoint to an SCN endpoint and vice versa. The primary applications of gateways  are likely to be:\n\n","Gateways  are not required if connections to other networks are not needed, since endpoints may directly communicate with other endpoints on the same LAN. Terminals communicate with gateways  using the H.245 and Q.931 protocols.","With the appropriate transcoders, H.323 gateways  can support terminals that comply with H.310, H.321, H.322, and V.70.","Many gateway  functions are left to the designer. For example, the actual number of H.323 terminals that can communicate through the gateway is not subject to standardization. Similarly, the number of SCN connections, the number of simultaneous independent conferences supported, the audio\/video\/data conversion functions, and inclusion of multipoint functions are left to the manufacturer. By incorporating gateway  technology into the H.323 specification, the ITU has positioned H.323 as the glue that holds the world of standards-based conferencing endpoints together.","Gatekeeper  is the most important component of an H.323 enabled network. It acts as the central point for all calls within its zone and provides call control services to registered endpoints. In many ways, an H.323 gatekeeper  acts as a virtual switch.","Gatekeepers  perform two important call control functions. The first is address translation from LAN aliases for terminals and gateways to IP or IPX addresses, as defined in the RAS specification. The second function is bandwidth management, which is also designated within RAS. For instance, if a network manager has specified a threshold for the number of simultaneous conferences on the LAN, the Gatekeeper  can refuse to make any more connections once the threshold is reached. The effect is to limit the total conferencing bandwidth to some fraction of the total available; the remaining capacity is left for e-mail, file transfers, and other LAN protocols.  depicts a collection of all terminals, gateways , and multipoint control units  which can be managed by a single gatekeeper . This collection of elements is known as an H.323 Zone.","An optional, but valuable feature of a gatekeeper  is its ability to route H.323 calls. By routing a call through a gatekeeper, it can be controlled more effectively. Service providers need this ability in order to bill for calls placed through their network. This service can also be used to re-route a call to another endpoint if a called endpoint is unavailable. In addition, a gatekeeper  capable of routing H.323 calls can help make decisions involving balancing among multiple gateways. For instance, if a call is routed through a gatekeeper , that gatekeeper  can then re-route the call to one of many gateways based on some proprietary routing logic.","While a gatekeeper  is logically separate from H.323 endpoints, vendors can incorporate gatekeeper  functionality into the physical implementation of gateways  and MCUs .","Gatekeeper  is not required in an H.323 system. However, if a gatekeeper  is present, terminals must make use of the services offered by gatekeepers . RAS defines these as address translation, admissions control, bandwidth control, and zone management.","Gatekeepers  can also play a role in multipoint connections. To support multipoint conferences, users would employ a Gatekeeper  to receive H.245 Control Channels from two terminals in a point-to-point conference. When the conference switches to multipoint, the gatekeeper can redirect the H.245 Control Channel to a multipoint controller, the MC. Gatekeeper  need not process the H.245 signaling; it only needs to pass it between the terminals , ,  or the terminals and the MC.","LANs which contain Gateways  could also contain a gatekeeper  to translate incoming E.164 addresses into Transport Addresses. Because a Zone is defined by its gatekeeper , H.323 entities that contain an internal gatekeeper  require a mechanism to disable the internal function so that when there are multiple H.323 entities that contain a gatekeeper  on a LAN, the entities can be configured into the same Zone.","The Multipoint Control Unit (MCU)  supports conferences between three or more endpoints. Under H.323, an MCU  consists of a Multipoint Controller (MC), which is required, and zero or more Multipoint Processors (MP). The MC handles H.245 negotiations between all terminals to determine common capabilities for audio and video processing. The MC also controls conference resources by determining which, if any, of the audio and video streams will be multicast. MCU  is depicted in .","The MC does not deal directly with any of the media streams. This is left to the MP, which mixes, switches, and processes audio, video, and\/or data bits. MC and MP capabilities can exist in a dedicated component or be part of other H.323 components. A soft switch includes some functions of an MP. An access server, also sometimes referred to as a media gateway controller, includes some of the functions of the MC. MCs and MPs are discussed further below with respect to the IPDC protocol.","Approved in January of 1998, version 2 of the H.323 standard addresses deficiencies in version 1 and introduces new functionality within existing protocols, such as Q.931, H.245 and H.225, as well as entirely new protocols. The most significant advances were in security, fast call setup, supplementary services and T.120\/H.323 integration.","(1) Project Account Codes","Project Account Codes can be used for tracking calls for billing, invoicing, and Class of Service (COS) restrictions. Project account code (PAC) verifications can include, for example, types Unverified Unforced, Unverified Forced, Verified Forced, and Partially Verified Forced. A web interface can be provided for a business customer to manage its accounts. The business customer can use the web interface to make additions, deletions, changes, and modifications to PAC translations without involvement of a carrier's customer service department.","An example of call processing using PACs follows. PAC SCP of  can receive validation requests from Soft-Switch  after Soft-Switch  has requested and received PAC digits. The PAC digits can be forwarded to SCP for verification. When SCP receives this request, SCP can compare the entire PAC, if the PAC type is Verified Forced, against a customer PAC table. SCP can compare only the verified portion of the PAC, if the PAC type is Partially Verified Forced, against the customer PAC table.","The PAC digits can be sent from Soft-Switch  to SCP in the \u2018Caller Entered Digits\u2019 field. The indicated customer can be sent from Soft-Switch  to SCP in the \u2018Customer\u2019 field.","(2) Basic Toll-Free","Basic Toll-Free Service SCP can translate a toll free (e.g., 800 and 888) number to a final routing destination based on a flexible set of options selected by a subscriber. Basic toll-free service supports e.g., 800 and 8XX Service Access Codes. Subscriber options can include, for example: 1) routing based on NPA or NPA-NXX of calling party; 2) routing based on time of day and day of week; 3) routing based on percent distribution; 4) emergency override routing; and 5) blocking based on calling party's NPA or NPA-NXX or ii-digits.","An exemplary embodiment of basic toll-free SCP is a GENESYS Network Interaction Router available from GENESYS of San Francisco, Calif. The GENESYS Network Interaction Router product suite provides Basic Toll-Free service. Soft-Switch  can send route requests to SCP for any Toll Free numbers that Soft-Switch  receives. SCP can then attempt to route the call using a route plan or trigger plan that has been defined for that Toll Free (dialed) number. SCP can have several possible responses to a soft switch routing request, see Table 10 above. Using the subscriber routing option (described in the previous paragraph) SCP can return a number translation for the Toll Free number. For example, SCP can receive a dialed number of 800-202-2020 and return a DDD such as 303-926-3000. Alternatively, SCP can return a circuit identifier. SCP usually returns a circuit identifier when the termination is a dedicated trunk to a customer premise equipment (CPE). Then if SCP determines that it can not route the call or has determined to block the call (per the route plan), SCP returns a \u2018route to resource\u2019 response to Soft-Switch  with an announcement identifier. In this case Soft-Switch  can connect the calling party with Announcement Server  for the playing of an announcement and then disconnect the caller.","SCP can store call events in CDR database tables on SCP .

The first type of data is that used to initialize connections between components. Examples of such data used to initialize connections between network components include the following: IP address and port numbers for all servers that soft switch  must communicate with; information indicating initial primary\/secondary\/tertiary configurations for server relationships; configuration information for access gateways ,  and trunking gateways , ; number and configuration of bays, modules, lines and channels (BMLC); relationship of module, line and channels to originating point code (OPC), destination point code (DPC) and circuit identification code (CIC) values; relationship of module, line and channels to trunk groups; call processing decision trees for soft switch processing; mapping of OPC, DPC and CIC values soft switches ; mapping of access server ,  ports to dedicated access line (DAL) identifiers and customer IDs; tables necessary to support class of service (COS) restrictions; local access transport area (LATA) tables; state tables; and blocked country code tables.","The second set of data can be categorized as that data needed by soft switch  for use during call processing.

Soft switch  passes a DDD number, an international DDD (IDDD) number, or a circuit group to route server  in a \u201croute request\u201d message. Using this information from soft switch , route server  can return the port on an AG ,  or TG ,  that should be used to terminate this call.

Upon receipt of the IAM message from SS7 GW , soft switch  performs some initial digit analysis to determine the type of the call.","In step , for calls involving customer features, soft switch  can use the ANI of calling party  (i.e., the telephone number of calling party ) to query a customer profile database in configuration server . This is done to identify the originating customer's feature set. Each customer's feature set is known as a \u201ctrigger plan\u201d for origination of the call. A trigger plan can be thought of as a flowchart which branches based on certain triggering events dependent on the caller's identity. Customer trigger plans  reside in a customer profile on configuration server .","In step , the customer profile database of configuration server  returns the customer trigger plan  to soft switch . Soft switch  can perform any processing necessary to implement the customer's specified originating triggers.","Application logic in soft switch  can then generate a translated number or an identification of the terminating circuit group for this call. For example, in the case of an 800 call, a translation may be requested as in step  of an SCP . SCP  converts the 800 number into a normal number for termination, and in step  returns the number to soft switch .","In step , in order to translate the translated number or circuit group into an egress port, soft switch  makes a route request to route server . The routing logic uses the NPA-NXX-XXXX to identify the terminating circuit group. Upon identifying the terminating circuit group, the route logic queries a circuit group to soft switch mapping table in route logic  of route server , to identify the target soft switch that handles the identified termination. For example, the target soft switch may be soft switch . It is important to note that there can be multiple route choices, and therefore there can be multiple soft switches ,  supporting a single route request.","In step , route server  responds to soft switch  with the terminating circuit group. In this example, the terminating circuit group is included in trunks connected to trunking gateway , which is serviced by a different soft switch (namely soft switch ) than originating soft switch .

Examples of data logged by an exemplary soft switch  include: a call origination record on the originating side, call termination information on the terminating side, an account code record, egress routing information, answer information on the originating side, call disconnect information on the originating side, call disconnect information on the terminating side, and final event blocks with call statistics.","Exemplary soft switch  can record data during call processing. Soft switch  transfers call events from RNECP  to MNEDB  for storage. This call event data, stored in MNEDB , can be used by various downstream systems for post-processing. These systems include, for example, mediation, end-user billing, carrier access billing services (CABS), fraud detection\/prevention, capacity management and marketing.","There are at least two types of EBs. Example Mandatory and Augmenting event blocks can be explained as follows.","Mandatory EBs are created by soft switch  during the initial point-in-call analysis. Initial point-in-call analysis includes going off-hook, (picking up the telephone set) call <insert> setup, initial digit analysis (i.e., digit analysis prior to any external database transactions or route determinations).","Since other events such as, for example, session\/call answer, and SCP transactions, can occur during call processing, soft switch  can create augmenting EBs. Augmenting EBs are EBs which can augment the information found in a mandatory EB. Events such as, for example, route determination, and answer indication, can be recorded in an augmenting EBs.","Examples of mandatory and augmenting EBs follow. For a complete illustration of these EBs, the reader is referred to Tables 20-143 and the corresponding discussions below. Specifically, Tables 20-48 provide mandatory EBs, Tables 49-60 provide augmenting EBs, and Tables 61-143 provide the call event elements that comprise the Ebs.","(1) Example Mandatory Event Blocks EBs","The following event blocks are examples of Mandatory Event Blocks:\n\n","(2) Augmenting Event Blocks EBs","The following event blocks are examples of Augmenting Event Blocks:\n\n","h. Software Object Oriented Programming (OOPs) Class Definitions","(1) Introduction to Object Oriented Programming (OOP)","In an example embodiment, soft switch site  comprises a plurality of object oriented programs (OOPs) running on a computer. As apparent to those skilled in the art, soft switch site  can alternatively be written in any form of software.","(a) Object Oriented Programming (OOP) Tutorial","OOPs can be described at a high level by defining object oriented programming classes. For example, in an embodiment of the present invention, soft switch  comprise an OOP written in an OOP language. Example languages include C++ and JAVA. An OOP model is enforced via fundamental mechanisms known as encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism.","Encapsulation may be thought of as placing a wrapper around the software code and data of a program. The basis of encapsulation is a structure known as a class. An object is a single instance of a class. A class describes general attributes of that object. A class includes a set of data attributes plus a set of allowable operations (i.e., methods). The individual structure or data representation of a class is defined by a set of instance variables.","Inheritance is another feature of an OOP model. A class (called a subclass) may be derived from another class, (called a superclass) wherein the subclass inherits the data attributes and methods of the superclass. The subclass may specialize the superclass by adding code which overrides the data and\/or methods of the superclass, or which adds new data attributes and methods.","Thus, inheritance represents a mechanism by which subclasses are more precisely specified. A new subclass includes all the behavior and specification of all of its ancestors. Inheritance is a major contributor to the increased programmer efficiency provided by the OOP. Inheritance makes it possible for developers to minimize the amount of new code they have to write to create applications. By providing the significant portion of the functionality needed for a particular task, classes on the inheritance hierarchy give the programmer a head start to program design and creation.","Polymorphism refers to having one object and many shapes. It allows a method to have multiple implementations selected based on the type of object passed into a method and location. Methods are passed information as parameters. These are parameters passed as both a method and an invocation of a method. Parameters represent the input values to a function that the method must perform. The parameters are a list of \u201ctyped\u201d values which comprise the input data to a particular message. The OOP model may require that the types of the values be exactly matched in order for the message to be understood.","Object-oriented programming is comprised of software objects that interact and communicate with each other by sending one another messages. Software objects are often modeled from real-world objects.","Object-oriented programs of the present invention are hardware platform independent. Client computer  in a preferred embodiment is a computer workstation, e.g., a Sun UltraSPARC Workstation, available from SUN Microsystems, Inc., of Palo Alto, Calif., running an operating system such as UNIX. Alternatively a system running on another operating system can be used, as would be apparent to those skilled in the art. Other exemplary operating systems include Windows\/NT, Windows98, OS\/2, Mac OS, and other UNIX-based operating systems. Exemplary UNIX-based operating systems include solaris, IRIX, LINUX, HPUX and OSF. However, the invention is not limited to these platforms, and can be implemented on any appropriate computer systems or operating systems.","An exemplary computer system is shown in . Other network components of telecommunications network , such as, for example, route server  and configuration server , can also be implemented using computer system  shown in . Computer system  includes one or more processors . Processor  is connected to a communication bus .","Client computer  also includes a main memory , preferably random access memory (RAM), and a secondary memory . Secondary memory  includes hard disk drive  and\/or a removable storage drive . Removable storage drive  reads from and\/or writes to a removable storage unit  in a well known manner. Removable storage unit  can be a floppy diskette drive, a magnetic tape drive or a compact disk drive.

Computer programs can also be called computer program products. Such computer programs, when executed, enable computer system  to perform the features of the present invention as discussed herein. In particular, the computer programs, when executed, enable the processor  to perform the features of the present invention. Accordingly, such computer programs represent controllers of computer system .","In another embodiment, the invention is directed to a computer program product comprising a computer readable medium having control logic (computer software) stored therein. The control logic, when executed by processor , causes processor  to perform the functions of the invention as described herein.","In yet another embodiment, the invention is implemented primarily in hardware using, for example, one or more state machines.

A class defines methods  and variables  that are included in a particular type of software object . Software objects  that belong to a class are called instances of the class. A software object  belonging to a particular class will contain specific values for the variables contained in the class. For example, a software class of vehicles may contain objects that define a truck, a car, a trailer and a motorcycle.","In object oriented programming, classes are arranged in a hierarchical structure. Objects that are defined as special cases of a more general class automatically inherit the method and variable definitions of the general class. As noted, the general class is referred to as the superclass. The special case of the general class is referred to as the subclass of the general class. In the above example, vehicles is the general class and is, therefore, referred to as the superclass. The objects (i.e. truck, car, trailer, and motorcycle) are all special cases of the general class, and are therefore referred to as subclasses of the vehicle class.","(3) Class Definitions","Example OOP class definitions are now described.

For the in-band signaling T1 configuration, the circuit can support wink start or loop start signaling.","The next six paragraphs briefly introduce wink start, loop start, and ground start signaling as would be apparent to a person having ordinary skill in the relevant communications signaling art.","Wink start refers to seizing a circuit by using a short duration signal. The signal is typically of a 140 millisecond duration. The wink indicates the availability of an incoming register for receiving digital information from a calling switch. Wink starts are used in telephone systems which use address signaling.","Loop start refers to seizing a circuit using a supervisory signal. A loop start signal is typically generated by taking the phone off hook. With a loop start, a line is seized by bridging a tip and ring (i.e., the wires of the telephone line) through a resistance. A loop start trunk is the most common type of trunk found in residential installations. The ring lead is connected to \u221248 V and the tip lead is connected to 0 V (i.e., connected to ground). To initiate a call, a \u201cloop\u201d ring can be formed through the telephone to the tip. A central office (CO) can ring a telephone by sending an AC voltage to the ringer within the telephone. When the telephone goes off-hook, the DC loop is formed. The CO detects the loop and the fact that it is drawing a DC current, and stops sending the ringing voltage.","Ground starting refers to seizing a trunk, where one side of a two-wire trunk (the ring conductor of the tip and ring) is temporarily grounded to get a dial tone. Ground starts are typically used for CO to PBX connections. Ground starting is effectively a handshaking routine that is performed by the CO and PBX. The CO and PBX agree to dedicate a path so that incoming and outgoing calls cannot conflict, so that \u201cglare\u201d cannot occur.","The PBX can check to see if a CO ground start trunk has been dedicated. In order to see if the trunk has been dedicated, the PBX checks to see if the tip lead is grounded. An undedicated ground start trunk has an open relay between 0 V (ground) and the tip lead connected to the PBX. If the trunk has been dedicated, the CO will close the relay and ground the tip lead.","In a ground start, the PBX can also indicate to the CO that it requires a trunk. The PBX has a PBX CO caller circuit. The PBX CO caller circuit can call a CO ground start trunk. The PBX CO caller circuit briefly grounds the ring lead causing DC current to flow. The CO detects the current flow and interprets it as a request for service from the PBX.","\u201cGlare\u201d occurs when both ends of a telephone line or trunk are seized at the same time for different purposes or by different users. Glare resolution refers to the ability of a system to ensure that if a trunk is seized by both ends simultaneously, then one caller is given priority, and the other is switched to another trunk.","AGs  and  interface to the PSTN via T1 CAS signaling and ISDN PRI trunks.

Grooming functions of DACS  include the consolidation of traffic from partly filled incoming lines with a common destination and segregation of incoming traffic of differing types and destinations. A traditional DACS  can have one of several available architectures. Example architectures, which accommodate different data rates and total port counts, include narrowband (or 1\/0), wideband (or 3\/1), and broadband (or 3\/3).","As backbone traffic has grown, with increased data traffic, there is an emerging need for even higher capacity DACS , having interface speeds of OC-48 and beyond, as well as cell and packet-switching capabilities to accommodate the increasing data traffic.","As data traffic continues to grow, increasing the demands of telecommunications networks, and as through-put speeds increase, DACS (e.g., DACS ) are migrating to include higher-speed switching matrices capable of terabit throughput. DACS  can also include high-speed optical interfaces.","Telecommunications network  can also make use of virtual DACS (VDACS). VDACS are conceptually the use of a computer software controlled circuit switch. For example, a DACS can be built which is capable of intercommunicating with a soft switch via, a protocol such as, for example, internet protocol device control (IPDC), to perform the functionality of a DACS.","In one embodiment of the invention, a NAS is used to terminate co-carrier, or local trunks, and a TG is used to terminate long distance trunks. In such a system, if a voice call were to come in over a NAS, then the voice call could be transmitted to the TG for termination. One approach that can be used to terminate this voice call includes occupying an outgoing channel to transmit the call out of the NAS and into the TG. Another approach uses a commandable DACS, a VDACS. The VDACS can cross-connect on command, so as to act as a commandable circuit switch. In practice, the soft switch can send a command down to the VDACS via IPDC, for example. A VDACS can be built by using a traditional DACS with the addition of application program logic supporting control and communication with a soft switch.","e.

If the router is not directly connected to the destination domain, then the router can route the packet to the router's default router, i.e. a router higher in a hierarchy of routers. Since each router has a default router to which it is attached, a packet can be transmitted through a series of routers to the destination domain and to the destination host bearing the packet's final destination address.","b. Local Area Networks (LANs) and Wide Area Networks (WANs)","A local area network (LAN) can be thought of as a plurality of host computers interconnected via network interface cards (NICs) in the host computers. The NICs are connected via, for example, copper wires so as to permit communication between the host computers. Examples of LANs include an ethernet bus network, an ethernet switch network, a token ring network, a fiber digital data interconnect (FDDI) network, and an ATM network.","A wide area network (WAN) is a network connecting host computers over a wide area. In order for host computers on a particular LAN to communicate with a host computer on another LAN or on a WAN, network interfaces interconnecting the LANs and WANs must exist. An example of a network interface is a router discussed above.","A network designed to interconnect multiple LANs and\/or WANs is known as an internet. An internet can transfer data between any of a plurality of networks including both LANs and WANs. Communication occurs between host computers on one LAN and host computers on another LAN via, for example, an internet protocol (IP) protocol. The IP protocol requires each host computer of a network to have a unique IP address enabling packets to be transferred over the internet to other host computers on other LANs and\/or WANs that are connected to the internet. An internet can comprise a router interconnecting two or more networks.","The \u201cInternet\u201d (with a capital \u201cI\u201d) is a global internet interconnecting networks all over the world. The Internet includes a global network of computers which intercommunicate via the internet protocol (IP) family of protocols.","An \u201cintranet\u201d is an internet which is a private network that uses internet software and internet standards, such as the internet protocol (IP). An intranet can be reserved for use by parties who have been given the authority necessary to use that network.","c. Network Protocols","Data network  includes a plurality of wires, and routes making up its physical hardware infrastructure. Network protocols provide the software infrastructure of data network .","Early network protocols and architectures were designed to work with specific proprietary types of equipment. Early examples included IBM systems network architecture (SNA) and Digital Equipment Corporation's DECnet.","Telecommunications vendors have moved away from proprietary network protocols and technologies to multi-vendor protocols. However, it can be difficult for all necessary vendors to agree on how to add new features and services to a multi-vendor protocol. This can be true because vendor-specific protocols can in some cases offer a greater level of sophistication. For example, initial versions of asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) completed by the ATM Forum did not have built-in quality of service (QoS) capabilities. Recent releases of the specification added those features, including parameters for cell-transfer delay and cell-loss ratio. However, interoperability among equipment of different vendors and device performance still need improvement.","The IETF is working on defining certain Internet protocols (IP) \u201cclasses of service\u201d. IP classes of service could provide a rough equivalent to ATMs QoS. IP classes of service is included as part of the IETF's integrated services architecture (ISA). ISA's proposed elements include the resource reservation protocol (RSVP), a defined packet scheduler, a call admission control module, an admission control manager, and a set of policies for implementing these features (many of the same concepts already outlined in ATM QoS).","(1) Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol (TCP\/IP)","The Internet protocol (IP) has become the primary networking protocol used today. This success is largely a part of the Internet, which is based on the transmission control protocol\/Internet protocol (TCP\/IP) family of protocols. TCP\/IP is the most common method of connecting PCs, workstations, and servers. TCP\/IP is included as part of many software products, including desktop operating systems (e.g., Microsoft's Windows 95 or Windows NT) and LAN operating systems. To date, however, TCP\/IP has lacked some of the desired features needed for mission-critical applications.","The most pervasive LAN protocol to date, has been IPX\/SPX from Novell's NetWare network operating system (NOS). However, IPX\/SPX is losing ground to TCP\/IP. Novell has announced that it will incorporate native IP support into NetWare, ending NetWare's need to encapsulate IPX packets when carrying them over TCP\/IP connections. Both UNIX and Windows NT servers can use TCP\/IP. Banyan's VINES, IBM's OS\/2 and other LAN server operating systems can also use TCP\/IP.","(2) Internet Protocol (IP)v4 and IPv6","IPv6 (previously called next-generation IP or IPng) is a backward-compatible extension of the current version of the Internet protocol, IPv4. IPv6 is designed to solve problems brought on by the success of the Internet (such as running out of address space and router tables). IPv6 also adds needed features, including circuiting security, auto-configuration, and real-time services similar to QoS. Increased Internet usage and the allocation of many of the available IP addresses has created an urgent need for increased addressing capacity. IPv4 uses a 32-byte number to form an address, which can offer about 4 billion distinct network addresses. In comparison, IPv6 uses 128-bytes per address, which provides for a much larger number of available addresses.","(3) Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP)","Originally developed to enhance IPv4 with QoS features, RSVP lets network managers allocate bandwidth based on the bandwidth requirements of an application. Basically, RSVP is an emerging communications protocol that signals a router to reserve bandwidth for real-time transmission of data, video, and audio traffic.","Resource reservation protocols that operate on a per-connection basis can be used in a network to elevate the priority of a given user temporarily. RSVP runs end to end to communicate application requirements for special handling. RSVP identifies a session between a client and a server and asks the routers handling the session to give its communications a priority in accessing resources. When the session is completed, the resources reserved for the session are freed for the use of others.","RSVP offers only two levels of priority in its signaling scheme. Packets are identified at each router hop as either low or high priority. However, in crowded networks, two-level classification may not be sufficient. In addition, packets prioritized at one router hop might be rejected at the next.","Accepted as an IETF standard in 1997, RSVP does not attempt to govern who should receive bandwidth, and questions remain about what will happen when several users all demand a large block of bandwidth at the same time. Currently, the technology outlines a first-come, first-served response to this situation. The IETF has formed a task force to address the issue.","Because RSVP provides a special level of service, many people equate QoS with the protocol. For example, Cisco currently uses RSVP in its IPv4-based internetwork router operating system to deliver IPv6-type QoS features. However, RSVP is only a small part of the QoS picture because it is effective only as far as it is supported within a given client\/server connection. Although RSVP allows an application to request latency and bandwidth, RSVP does not provide for congestion control or network-wide priority with the traffic flow management needed to integrate QoS across an enterprise.","(4) Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP)","RTP is an emerging protocol for the Internet championed by the audio\/video transport workgroup of the IETF. RTP supports real-time transmission of interactive voice and video over packet-switched networks. RTP is a thin protocol that provides content identification, packet sequencing, timing reconstruction, loss detection, and security. With RTP, data can be delivered to one or more destinations, with a limit on delay.","RTP and other Internet real-time protocols, such as the Internet stream protocol version 2 (ST2), focus on the efficiency of data transport. RTP and other Internet real-time protocols are designed for communications sessions that are persistent and that exchange large amounts of data. RTP does not handle resource reservation or QoS control. Instead, RTP relies on resource reservation protocols such as RSVP, communicating dynamically to allocate appropriate bandwidth.","RTP adds a time stamp and a header that distinguishes whether an IP packet is data or voice, allowing prioritization of voice packets, while RSVP allows networking devices to reserve bandwidth for carrying unbroken multimedia data streams.","Real-time Control Protocol (RTCP) is a companion protocol to RTP that analyzes network conditions. RTCP operates in a multi-cast fashion to provide feedback to RTP data sources as well as all session participants. RTCP can be adopted to circumvent datagram transport of voice-over-IP in private IP networks. With RTCP, software can adjust to changing network loads by notifying applications of spikes, or variations, in network transmissions. Using RTCP network feedback, telephony software can switch compression algorithms in response to degraded connections.","(5) IP Multi-Casting Protocols","Digital voice and video comprise of large quantities of data that, when broken up into packets, must be delivered in a timely fashion and in the right order to preserve the qualities of the original content. Protocol developments have been focused on providing efficient ways to send content to multiple recipients, transmission referred to as multi-casting. Multi-casting involves the broadcasting of a message from one host to many hosts in a one-to-many relationship. A network device broadcasts a message to a select group of other devices such as PCS or workstations on a LAN, WAN, or the Internet. For example, a router might send information about a routing table update to other routers in a network.","Several protocols are being implemented for IP multi-casting, including upgrades to the Internet protocol itself. For example, some of the changes in the newest version of IP, IPv6, will support different forms of addressing for uni-cast (point-to-point communications), any cast (communications with the closest member of a device group), and multi-cast. Support for IP multi-casting comes from several protocols, including the Internet group management protocol (IGMP), protocol-independent multi-cast (PIM) and distance vector multi-cast routing protocol (DVMRP). Queuing algorithms can also be used to ensure that video or other multi-cast data types arrive when they are supposed to without visible or audible distortion.","Real-time transport protocol (RTP) is currently an IETF draft, designed for end-to-end, real-time delivery of data such as video and voice. RTP works over the user datagram protocol (UDP), providing no guarantee of in-time delivery, quality of service (QoS), delivery, or order of delivery. RTP works in conjunction with a mixer and translator and supports encryption and security. The real-time control protocol (RTCP) is a part of the RTP definition that analyzes network conditions. RTCP provides mandatory monitoring of services and collects information on participants. RTP communicates with RSVP dynamically to allocate appropriate bandwidth.","Internet packets typically move on a first-come, first-serve basis. When the network becomes congested, Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) can enable certain types of traffic, such as video conferences, to be delivered before less time-sensitive traffic such as E-mail for potentially a premium price. RSVP could change the Internet's pricing structure by offering different QoS at different prices.","The RSVP protocol is used by a host, on behalf of an application, to request a specific QoS from the network for particular data streams or flows. Routers can use the RSVP protocol to deliver QoS control requests to all necessary network nodes to establish and maintain the state necessary to provide the requested service. RSVP requests can generally, although not necessarily, result in resources being reserved in each node along the data path.","RSVP is not itself a routing protocol. RSVP is designed to operate with current and future uni-cast and multi-cast routing protocols. An RSVP process consults the local routing database to obtain routes. In the multi-cast case for example, the host sends IGMP messages to join a multi-cast group and then sends RSVP messages to reserve resources along the delivery paths of that group. Routing protocols determines where packets are forwarded. RSVP is concerned with only the QoS of those packets as they are forwarded in accordance with that routing.","d. Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)","A virtual private network (VPN) is a wide area communications network operated by a telecommunications carrier that provides what appears to be dedicated lines when used, but that actually includes trunks shared among all customers as in a public network. A VPN allows a private network to be configured within a public network.","VPNs can be provided by telecommunications carriers to customers to provide secure, guaranteed, long-distance bandwidth for their WANs. These VPNs generally use frame relay or switched multi-megabyte data service (SMDS) as a protocol of choice because those protocols define groups of users logically on the network without regard to physical location. ATM has gained favor as a VPN protocol as companies require higher reliability and greater bandwidth to handle more complex applications. VPNs using ATM offer networks of companies with the same virtual security and QoS as WANs designed with dedicated circuits.","The Internet has created an alternative to VPNs, at a much lower cost, i.e. the virtual private Internet. The virtual private Internet (VPI) lets companies connect disparate LANs via the Internet. A user installs either a software-only or a hardware-software combination that creates a shared, secure intranet with VPN-style network authorizations and encryption capabilities. A VPI normally uses browser-based administration interfaces.","(1) VPN Protocols","A plurality of protocol standards exist today for VPNs. For example, IP security (IPsec), point-to-point tunneling protocol (PPTP), layer 2 forwarding protocol (L2F) and layer 2 tunneling protocol (L2TP). The IETF has proposed a security architecture for the Internet protocol (IP) that can be used for securing Internet-based VPNs. IPsec facilitates secure private sessions across the Internet between organizational firewalls by encrypting traffic as it enters the Internet and decrypting it at the other end, while allowing vendors to use many encryption algorithms, key lengths and key escrow techniques. The goal of IPsec is to let companies mix-and-match the best firewall, encryption, and TCP\/IP protocol products.","(a) Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP)","Point-to-point tunneling protocol (PPTP) provides an alternate approach to VPN security than the use of IPsec. Unlike IPsec, which is designed to link two LANs together via an encrypted data stream across the Internet, PPTP allows users to connect to a network of an organization via the Internet by a PPTP server or by an ISP that supports PPTP. PPTP was proposed as a standard to the IETF in early 1996. Firewall vendors are expected to support PPTP.","PPTP was developed by Microsoft along with 3Com, Ascend and US Robotics and is currently implemented in WINDOWS NT SERVER 4.0, WINDOWS NT WORKSTATION 4.0, WINDOWS 95 via an upgrade and WINDOWS 98, available from Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash.","The \u201ctunneling\u201d in PPTP refers to encapsulating a message so that the message can be encrypted and then transmitted over the Internet. PPTP, by creating a tunnel between the server and the client, can tie up processing resources.","(b) Layer 2 Forwarding (L2F) Protocol","Developed by Cisco, layer 2 forwarding protocol (L2F) resembles PPTP in that it also encapsulates other protocols inside a TCP\/IP packet for transport across the Internet, or any other TCP\/IP network, such as data network . Unlike PPTP, L2F requires a special L2F-compliant router (which can require changes to a LAN or WAN infrastructure), runs at a lower level of the network protocol stack and does not require TCP\/IP routing to function. L2F also provides additional security for user names and passwords beyond that found in PPTP.","(c) Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP)","The layer 2 tunneling protocol (L2TP) combines specifications from L2F with PPTP. In November 1997, the IETF approved the L2TP standard. Cisco is putting L2TP into its Internet operating system software and Microsoft is incorporating it into WINDOWS NT 5.0. A key advantage of L2TP over IPsec, which covers only TCP\/IP communications, is that L2TP can carry multiple protocols. L2TP also offers transmission capability over non-IP networks. L2TP however ignores data encryption, an important security feature for network administrators to employ VPNs with confidence.","Data network  will now be described in greater detail relating to example packet-switched networks. It will be apparent to persons having skill in the art that multiple network types could be used to implement data network , including, for example, ATM networks, frame relay networks, IP networks FDDI WAN networks SMDS networks, X-25 networks, and other kinds of LANs and WANs.","It would be apparent to those skilled in the art that other data networks could be used interchangeably for data network  such as, for example, an ATM, X.25, Frame relay, FDDI, Fast Ethernet, or an SMDS packet switched network. Frame relay and ATM are connection-oriented services. Switched multi-megabyte data service (SMDS) is a connection-oriented mass packet service that offers speeds up to 45 Mbps. Originally, SMDS was intended to fill the gap for broadband services until broadband ISDN (BISDN) could be developed. Because the infrastructure for BISDN is not fully in place, some users have chosen SMDS.","e. Exemplary Data Networks","(1) Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)","ATM is a high-bandwidth, low-delay, packet-switching, and multiplexing network technology. ATM packets are known as \u201ccells.\u201d Bandwidth capacity is segmented into 53-byte fixed-sized cells, having a header and payload fields. ATM is an evolution of earlier packet-switching network methods such as X.25 and frame relay, which used frames or cells that varied in size. Fixed-length packets can be switched more easily in hardware than variable size packets and thus result in faster transmissions.","Each ATM cell contains a 48-byte payload field and a 5-byte header that identifies the so-called \u201cvirtual circuit\u201d of the cell. ATM can allocate bandwidth on demand, making it suitable for high-speed combinations of voice, data, and video services. Currently, ATM access can perform at speeds as high as 622 Mbps or higher. ATM has recently been doubling its maximum speed every year.","In an example embodiment, data network  is an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) network. An ATM cell of data network  includes a header (having addressing information and header error checking information), and a payload (having the data being carried by the cell).","ATM is a technology, defined by a protocol standardized by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU-T), American National Standards Institute (ANSI), ETSI, and the ATM Forum. ATM comprises a number of building blocks, including transmission paths, virtual paths, and virtual channels.","Asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) is a cell based switching and multiplexing technology designed to be a general purpose connection-oriented transfer mode for a wide range of telecommunications services. ATM can also be applied to LAN and private network technologies as specified by the ATM Forum.","ATM handles both connection-oriented traffic directly or through adaptation layers, or connectionless traffic through the use of adaptation layers. ATM virtual connections may operate at either a constant bit rate (CBR) or a variable bit rate (VBR). Each ATM cell sent into an ATM network contains addressing information that establishes a virtual connection from origination to destination. All cells are transferred, in sequence, over this virtual connection. ATM provides either permanent or switched virtual connections (PVCs or SVCs). ATM is asynchronous because the transmitted cells need not be periodic as time slots of data are required to be in synchronous transfer mode (STM).","ATM uses an approach by which a header field prefixes each fixed-length payload. The ATM header identifies the virtual channel (VC). Therefore, time slots are available to any host which has data ready for transmission. If no hosts are ready to transmit, then an empty, or idle, cell is sent.","ATM permits standardization on one network architecture defining a multiplexing and a switching method. Synchronous optical network (SONET) provides the basis for physical transmission at very high-speed rates. ATM also supports multiple quality of service (QoS) classes for differing application requirements, depending on delay and loss performance. ATM can also support LAN-like access to available bandwidth.","The primary unit in ATM, the cell, defines a fixed-size cell with a length of 53 octets (or bytes) comprised of a five-octet header and 48-octet payload. Bits in the cells are transmitted over a transmission path in a continuous stream. Cells are mapped into a physical transmission path, such as the North American DS1, DS3, and SONET; European, E1, E3, and E4; ITU-T STM standards; and various local fiber and electrical transmission payloads. All information is multiplexed and switched in an ATM network via these fixed-length cells.","The ATM cell header field identifies the destination, cell type, and priority, and includes six portions. An ATM cell header includes a generic flow control (GFC), a virtual path identifier (VPI), a virtual channel identifier (VCI), a payload type (PT), a call loss priority (CLP), and a header error check (HEC). VPI and VCI hold local significance only, and identify the destination. GFC allows a multiplexer to control the rate of an ATM terminal. PT indicates whether the cell contains user data, signaling data, or maintenance information. CLP indicates the relative priority of the cell, i.e., lower priority cells are discarded before higher priority cells during congested intervals. HEC detects and corrects errors in the header.","The ATM cell payload field is passed through the network intact, with no error checking or correction. ATM relies on higher-layer protocols to perform error checking and correction on the payload. For example, a transmission control protocol (TCP) can be used to perform error correction functions. The fixed cell size simplifies the implementation of ATM switches and multiplexers and enables implementations at high speeds.","When using ATM, longer packets cannot delay shorter packets as in other packet-switched networks, because long packets are separated into many fixed length cells. This feature enables ATM to carry CBR traffic, such as voice and video, in conjunction with VBR data traffic, potentially having very long packets, within the same network.","ATM switches take traffic and segment it into the fixed-length cells, and multiplex the cells into a single bit stream for transmission across a physical medium. As an example, different kinds of traffic can be transmitted over an ATM network including voice, video, and data traffic. Video and voice traffic are very time-sensitive, so delay cannot have significant variations. Data, on the other hand, can be sent in either connection-oriented or connectionless mode. In either case, data is not nearly as delay-sensitive as voice or video traffic, conventionally. Conventional, however, data traffic is very sensitive to loss. Therefore, ATM conventionally must discriminate between voice, video, and data traffic. Voice and video traffic requires priority and guaranteed delivery with bounded delay, while data traffic requires, simultaneously, assurance of low loss. According to the present invention, data traffic can also carry voice traffic, making it also time-dependent. Using ATM, in one embodiment, multiple types of traffic can be combined over a single ATM virtual path (VP), with virtual circuits (VCs) being assigned to separate data, voice, and video traffic.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0777","num":"1092"},"figref":"FIG. 16B","b":["1618","1620","1622","1624","1626","1628","1630","1632","1634","1636","1638","1640","1642","1644","1646","1648","1650","1620","1622","1624","1626","1622","1624","1626","1628","1630","1632","1634","1636","1638","1640","1642","1644","1646","1648","1650","1628","1650","1622","1620","1622","1626","1628","1650"]},"The capability of ATM to switch to a virtual channel level is similar to the operation of a private or public branch exchange (PBX) or telephone switch in the telephone world. In a PBX switch, each channel within a trunk group can be switched. Devices which perform VC connections are commonly called VC switches because of the analogy to telephone switches. ATM devices which connect VPs are commonly referred to as VP cross-connects, by analogy with the transmission network. The analogies are intended for explanatory reasons, but should not be taken literally. An ATM cell-switching machine need not be restricted to switching only VCs and cross-connection to only VPs.","At the ATM layer, users are provided a choice of either a virtual path connection (VPC) or a virtual channel connection (VCC). Virtual path connections (VPCs) are switched based upon the virtual path identifier (VPI) value only. Users of a VPC can assign VCCs within a VPI transparently, since they follow the same route. Virtual channel connections (VCCs) are switched upon a combined VPI and virtual channel identifier (VCI) value.","Both VPIs and VCIs are used to route calls through a network. Note that VPI and VCI values must be unique on a specific transmission path (TP).","It is important to note that data network  can be any of a number of other data-type networks, including various packet-switched data-type networks, in addition to an ATM network.","(2) Frame Relay","Alternatively, data network  can be a frame relay network. It would be apparent to persons having ordinary skill in the art, that a frame relay network could be used as data network . Rather than transporting data in ATM cells, data could be transported in frames.","Frame relay is a packet-switching protocol used in WANs that has become popular for LAN-to-LAN connections between remote locations. Formerly frame relay access would top out at about 1.5 Mbps. Today, so-called \u201chigh-speed\u201d frame relay offers around 45 Mbps. This speed is still relatively slow as compared with other technology such as ATM.","Frame relay services employ a form of packet-switching analogous to a streamlined version of X.25 networks. The packets are in the form of frames, which are variable in length. The key advantage to this approach it that a frame relay network can accommodate data packets of various sizes associated with virtually any native data protocol. A frame relay network is completely protocol independent. A frame relay network embodiment of data network  does not undertake a lengthy protocol conversion process, and therefore offers faster and less-expensive switching than some alternative networks. Frame relay also is faster than traditional X.25 networks because it was designed for the reliable circuits available today and performs less-rigorous error detection.","(3) Internet Protocol (IP)","In an embodiment, data network  can be an internet protocol (IP) network over an ATM network. It would be apparent to persons having ordinary skill in the art, that an internet protocol (IP) network (with any underlying data link network) could be used as data network .

Internet Protocol Device Control (IPDC) Protocol","a. IPDC Base Protocol","The IPDC base protocol described below, provides the basis for the LP device control family of protocols. The IPDC protocols include a protocol suite. The components of the IPDC protocol suite can be used individually or together to perform multiple functions. Functions which can be performed by the IPDC protocol suite include, for example, connection control, media control, and signaling transport for environments where the control logic is separated from the access server  and . The IPDC protocol suite operates between the media gateway controller and the media gateway. The media gateway controller can be thought of as soft switch . The media gateway can be thought of as access servers  and , including, for example, TGs  and , AGs  and  and NASs  and . The corresponding entities of media gateway controller and the media gateway are the call control and media control portions of the H.323 gateway.","IPDC acts to fulfill a need for protocols to control gateway devices which sit at the boundary between the circuit-switched telephone network and the Internet and to terminate circuit-switched trunks. Examples of such devices include NASs  and  and voice-over-IP gateways, also known as access servers  and , including TGs  and  and AGs  and . This need for a control protocol separate from call signaling arises when the service control logic needed to process calls lies partly or wholly outside the gateway devices. The protocols implement the interface between soft switch  and access servers , . IPDC views access servers  and , also known as media gateways, as applications which may control one or more physical devices. In addition to its primary mandate, IPDC can be used to control devices which do not meet the strict definition of a media gateway such as DACS  and  and ANSs  and . IPDC builds on a base provided by DIAMETER. DIAMETER has a number of advantages as a starting point including, for example, built-in provision for control security, facilities for starting up the control relation, and ready extensibility both in modular increments and at the individual command and attribute level. DIAMETER is specifically written for authentication, authorization and accounting applications. Calhoun, Rubins, \u201cDIAMETER based protocol\u201d, July 1998. The DIAMETER based protocol specification was written by Pat Calhoun of Sun Microsystems, Inc. and Alan C. Rubins of Ascend Communications.","The IPDC protocol includes a message header followed by attribute-value-pairs (AVPs) an IPDC command is a specialized data object which indicates the purpose and structure of the message which contains the IPDC command. The command name can be used to denote the message format.","A DIAMETER device can be a client or server system that supports the DIAMETER based protocol. Alternatively, a DIAMETER device can support extensions in addition to the DIAMETER based protocol.","An IPDC entity can be any object, logical or physical, which is subject to control through IPDC or whose status IPDC must report. Every IPDC entity has a type. Types of IPDC entities include, for example, a media_gateway_type, a physical_gateway type, a station_type, an equipment_holder type, a transport_termination type, an access_termination type, a trunk_termination type, a signaling_termination type, a device_type, a modem type, a conference_port type, a fax_port type, a stream_source type, a stream_recorder type, an RTP_port type, an ATM_spec type, an H323_spec type, and a SIP_spec type.","An IPDC protocol endpoint can be used to refer to either of the two parties to an IPDC control session, i.e. the media gateway controller (e.g., soft switch ), or the media gateway (e.g., access servers  and ). To the extent that IPDC can be viewed as providing extensions to DIAMETER, an IPDC protocol endpoint can also be a DIAMETER device.","A transaction can be a sequence of messages pre-defined as part of the definition of IPDC commands which constitute that sequence. Every message in the sequence can carry the same identifier value in the header and the same transaction-originator value identifying the originator of the transaction.","DIAMETER packets or IPDC messages can be transmitted over UDP or TCP. Each DIAMETER service extensions draft can specify the transport layer. For UDP, when a reply is generated the source and destination ports are reversed. IPDC requires a reliable, order-preserving transport protocol with minimal latency so that IPDC control can be responsive to the demands of call processing. UDP combined with a protocol description satisfies these requirements, and is therefore the default transport protocol for IPDC. It would apparent to those skilled in the art that network operators can choose to implement transmission control program (TCP) instead for greater security, or for other reasons.","The IPDC base protocol is a publically available document published on the Internet. It is important to note, that the IPDC based protocol is a document in a so called, \u201cInternet-draft,\u201d as of the time of the writing of this publication. Internet-drafts are working documents of the internet engineering task force (IETF), its areas, and its working groups. Other groups can also distribute working documents as Internet-drafts. Internet-drafts can be updated, replaced or obsoleted by other documents at any time.","It would be apparent to someone skilled in the art that an alternative base protocol could be used.","Command AVPs include a plurality of DIAMETER based commands and additional IPDC commands. For example, DIAMETER base commands include, for example, command-unrecognized-IND, device-reboot-IND, device-watchdog-IND, device-feature-query, device-feature-reply, device-config-REQ, and device-config-answer. Additional IPDC commands include, for example, command-ACK and message-reject.","In addition to command AVPs, a plurality of other AVPs exist, including, for example, DIAMETER base AVPs, and additional IPDC AVPs.

Public key cryptography support includes, for example, X509-certificate, X509-certificate-URL, and static public key configuration.","b. IPDC Control Protocol","The IPDC is a control protocol that facilitates the delivery of voice and data services requiring interconnection with an IP network. The IPDC protocol permits a soft switch control server to control a media gateway or access server. IPDC includes signaling transport, connection control, media control and device management functionality. These control functions include creation, modification, and deletion of connections; detection and generation of media and bearer channel events; detection of resource availability state changes in media gateways; and signal transport.","Alternatively, other protocols can be used to provide this control. For example, the network access server messaging interface (NMI) protocol or the media gateway control protocol (MGCP). The MGCP protocol from the Internet engineering task force (IETF) supports a subset of the functionality of the IPDC protocol plus the simple gateway control protocol (SGCP) from Bellcore and CISCO. SGCP includes connection control and media control (i.e. a subset of IPDC media control) functionality.","IPDC protocol allows a call control server, i.e. a soft switch , to command a circuit network to packet network gateway (a media gateway), i.e. an access server , provides the control mechanism to for setting up, tearing down and managing voice and data calls. The term packet network gateway is intended to allow support for multiple network types including, for example, an IP network and an ATM network, data network . In addition, the IPDC protocol supports the management and configuration of the access server . The following types of messages are described in this document: start-up messages describing access server start-up and shut-down; configuration messages describing access server, soft switch and telco interface query and configuration; maintenance messages describing status and test messages; and call control messages describing call set-up tear-down and query for data, TDM and packet-switched calls.","The architecture in which IPDC operates incorporates existing protocols wherever possible to achieve a full interconnection of IP-based networks with the global switched telephone network (GSTN). The architecture accommodates any GSTN signaling style, including, for example, SS7 signaling, ISDN signaling and in-band signaling. The architecture also accommodates an interface with H.323 voice-over-IP networks.","A modification to the H.323 architecture can allow H.323 networks to be seamlessly integrated with SS7 networks.","Until now, H.323 protocols have been defined assuming that an H.323 to GSTN gateway uses an access signaling technique such as ISDN or in-band access signaling for call set-up signaling on the GSTN. The H.323 architecture did not readily accommodate the use of SS7 signaling for call set-up via H.323 gateways, creating a gap in the standards. Until now, H.323 standards have distinguished between multi-point processor (MP) functions and multi-point controller (MC) functions only in the definition of multi-point control units (MCUs). Recent international telecommunications union (ITU) work on H.323 version III has considered extending the concept of MC\/MP separation to H.323 gateways as well as MCUs. Separation of the MC function from the H.323 gateway can allow SS7 to be properly interconnected with an H.323 network. By separating the MC function from the MP function, a separate SS7 signaling gateway, such as, for example, SS7 GW , can be created to interconnect the SS7 network with the H.323 network. Such an SS7 gateway can implement the H.323 gateway MC function as a signaling interface shared among multiple H.323 gateway MP functions.","At least five functions must be performed in order to interface an H.323 network to a GSTN network. The functions include, for example, a packet network interface, H.323 signal intelligence, GSTN signaling intelligence, a media processing function and a GSTN circuit interface.","In an H.323 gateway which interfaces with an in-band signaled or ISDN-signaled GSTN trunk, all of these five functions could be performed with a H.323 gateway. However, in a H.323 gateway which interfaces with a SS7 signaled trunk, the functionality could be more optimally partitioned to allow for a group of SS7 links to be shared among multiple H.323 gateway MP functions. For example, an H.323 gateway MC function could include, for example, a packet network interface, H.323 signaling intelligence, and GSTN SS7 signaling intelligence. In addition, an H.323 gateway MP function could include a packet network interface, a media processing function, and a GSTN circuit interface. Thus, the H.323 gateway functionality could be separated into the H.323 gateway MC function and the H.323 gateway MP function.","In another embodiment, the MC function could be further partitioned. For example, H.323 gateway MC function could include a packet network interface, H.323 signaling intelligence, and a packet network interface. An SS7 gateway could include additional MC functions, such as, for example, a packet network interface, and a GSTN SS7 signaling intelligence. The physical separation of the H.323 gateway MC function from the SS7 gateway provides several advantages, including, for example, more than one SS7 gateway can be interfaced to one or more MC functions, allowing highly reliable geographically redundant configurations; service logic implemented at the H.323 gateway MC function (or at an associated gatekeeper) can be provisioned at a smaller number of more centralized sites, reducing the amount of data replication needed for large-scale service implementation across an H.323 network; and SS7 gateway to H.323 gateway MC functional interface could be a model for other signaling gateways, such as, for example, an ISDN NFAS gateway, a channel-associated C7 signaling gateway, and a DPNSS gateway. In fact, once service providers have implemented service logic at the H.323 gateway MC function for their SS7 signaled trunks, the following anomalies become apparent, for example, service providers will likely want to exercise the same or similar service logic for their ISDN and in-band signal trunks as well as their SS7 signaled trunks; and service providers will want to incorporate media processing events into the service logic implemented at the H.323 gateway MC function (or at an associated gatekeeper).","The IPDC protocol is intended to interface the MC function with the MP function in H.323 to GSTN gateways. Based upon events detected in the signaling stream, the H.323 gateway MC function must be able to create, delete, and modify connections in the H.323 gateway MP function. Also, the H.323 gateway MC function must be able to create or detect events in the media stream which only the H.323 gateway MP function has access to. A standardized protocol is needed to allow an H.323 gateway MC function to remotely control one or more H.323 gateway MP functions. Therefore, IPDC was created to allow H.323 gateway MC function to remotely control one or more H.323 gateway MP functions. Specifically, soft switch  can remotely control one or more access servers .","The IPDC protocol uses the terminology of bay, module, line and channel. A bay is one unit, or set of modules and interfaces within an access server . A stand-alone access server  or a multi-shelf access server  can constitute a single bay. A module is a sub-unit that sits within a bay. The module is typically a slot card that implements one or more network line interfaces, e.g., a dual span T1 card. A line is a sub-unit that sits within a module. The line is typically a physical line interface that plugs into a line card, e.g., a T1. A channel is a sub-unit within a line. The channel is typically a channel within a channelized line interface, e.g., one of the 24 channels in a channelized T1.","All numbers in the IPDC protocol should be in binary, and coded in network byte order (big endian or motorola format). The format for date\/time fields is a 4 bytes integer expressing the number of seconds elapsed since Jan. 1, 1990 at 0:00.","The soft switches  and  (e.g., primary\/secondary\/tertiary, etc.) are completely hot-swappable. Switching to a backup soft switch  does not require fall back in call processing states or other IPDC-level operation on access server . Both soft switches  and  follow the operations of the other soft switch, precisely.","The message exchange as defined in IPDC can be implemented over any IP base protocol. Suggested protocols include, e.g., TCP and UDP.","Access server  can include the following configuration items: IP addresses and TCP or UDP ports of any number of soft switches  to which access server  should connect; bay number (8 bytes, in alpha numeric characters); system type (9 bytes, in alpha-numeric characters); and protocol version supported.","An IPDC packet can have the following components included in its format, for example, a protocol ID, a packet length, a data field tag, a data field length, data flags, an optional vendor ID, data and padding. For example, a protocol ID may exist in a first byte. Packet length can be a 2 byte field appearing second, a single byte reserved field can then occur followed by a 4 byte data field tag. Next a 2 byte data field length can be used, followed by a single byte data flag, and a single byte reserved field. Next, a 4 byte optional vendor ID can exist. Next, the data included in the body of the message can contain a variable number of 4 byte aligned tag, length, value combinations. Finally, a 3 byte data and single byte padding field can be placed in the IPDC packet. For all IPDC messages, the message type and transaction ID are required attribute value pairs.","The message code must be the first tag following the header. This tag is used in order to communicate the message type associated with the message. There must only be a single message code tag within a given message. The value of this tag for each message type may be found below.","The transaction ID is assigned by the originator of a transaction. The transaction ID must remain the same for all messages exchanged within a transaction. The transaction ID is a 12-byte value with the following tag, length, value format: the first 4 bytes can contain a data field tag; the next two bytes can include the data field length; the next byte can contain flags; the next byte is reserved; the next 4 bytes can contain an originator ID; the following 4 bytes can contain originator ID; and in the last 4 bytes there can exist in the first bit the originator, and in the remaining bytes the transaction correlator 31 bits.","c.

Voice Services","Telecommunications voice network services supported by the present invention include, for example, origination and termination of intralata, interlata and international calls seamlessly between the PSTN and Telecommunications network . Access can be achieved by switched or dedicated access lines. Call origination can be provided via Feature Group D (FGD) and direct access line (DAL) (T-1\/PRI) access to access servers ,. Local access can be provisioned via the PSTN with FGD and co-carrier termination to trunking gateways , . Dedicated DS0s, T-1s and T-3s can connect an end user's CPE directly to AGs ,. In one embodiment; a standard unit of measurement for usage charges can be a rate per minute (RPM). Where telecommunications network  provides the DS0s, T-1s, and T-3s, there can be an additional monthly recurring, charge (MRC) for access.","In one embodiment, ingress and egress can be via the PSTN. In another embodiment, native IP devices can originate and terminate calls over data network  over the IP protocol. In such an environment, flat rated calling plans are possible.","a. Private Voice Network (PVN) Services","Private voice network (PVN) services can be a customer-defined calling network that allows companies to communicate \u201con-net\u201d at discounted prices. The backbone of the product can be dedicated access connectivity, such as, for example, using a DAL or ISDN PRI for access to telecommunications network . Using a capability called dedicated termination service (DTS), calls that originate either by PIC or a dedicated access method can terminate on dedicated facilities when possible. For example, assume a customer with five locations across the country (e.g., in on-net cities) has T-1s deployed at each site. Calls between those five sites can be significantly discounted due to the fact that the carrier owning telecommunications network  originates and terminates the calls on dedicated facilities at little cost. Additionally, customers will be able to add others to their PVN, such as, for example, business partners, vendors, and customers, enabling the customer (as well as the others) to further reduce their communications costs.","In one embodiment, service can be provided to customers for a MRC, with no additional charge for on-net calls, and with a charge on a rate per minute basis for all other types of calls. In another embodiment, no MRC can be required, and all calls can be charged on a RPM basis. In another embodiment, the RPM may vary according to the type of call placed.","Network requirements can include use of dedicated termination service (DTS). DTS can allow long distance calls that originate from a FGD or DAL to terminate on a DAL. Traditionally, these calls are routed to POTS lines. This functionality can enable the network to determine if the call can be terminated over its own facilities and, if so, rate it appropriately. DTS is the backbone functionality of PVN. A routing table can allow the network to identify calls that originate from either an ANT or Trunk Group that has been assigned an associated terminating Trunk Group. In one embodiment, 700, 800, and 900 type calls can not originate over DALs.","Customer premises equipment (CPE) requirements can include a CSU\/DSU with a router for Multiple Service T-1 with dedicated access, and a customer can have an option to lease or buy them.","b. Long Distance or 1+ Services","Long distance (1+) service can allow a customer to place long distance calls to anywhere in the U.S., Canada, USVI, and Puerto Rico by dialing 1 plus an area code (NPA), plus a 7-digit phone number. International calls can be placed by dialing 011 plus a country code (CC), plus a city code, plus a number. Both switched and dedicated access can be available from on-net cities or from off-net cities (i.e., through a designated off-net carrier).","(1) Project Account Codes (PAC)","Project Access Codes (PACs) can be, for example, two to twelve digits. PACs, can be end user defined or predefined codes that are assigned to, for example, employees, projects, teams, and departments. PACs can be used, for example, by a customer to track such things as intralata, interlata, and international calls.","An example benefit to a customer of using PACs is that PACs can allow businesses to allocate and track costs of specific projects. Additionally, they can be used to track employee or department calls and expenditures. PACs can also be used to prevent unauthorized long distance calling. In one embodiment, an invoice can track account codes individually and can then group the codes in a hierarchical fashion as well.","Operationally, PACS can be entered by a calling party after dialing, e.g., a local, long distance, or international phone number. The calling party can hear a network-generated tone prompting the calling party to enter the PAC code. Once the PAC code has been entered and authorized, the call can be connected as usual.","All types of PACs can be translated on the invoice from code to text, i.e., PAC number \u201c1234\u201d could be translated to a \u201cMarketing Department\u201d and PAC number \u201c4567\u201d could be translated to \u201cJohn Doe.\u201d An example invoice could show call detail records (CDR) and total expenditures for each PAC.","If an invalid code is entered, a voice prompt can immediately respond with a message such as, for example, \u201cInvalid code, please try again.\u201d A second invalid entry can prompt the same message. A third can prompt another message, such as, e.g., \u201cGoodbye.\u201d PAC Translation would not occur in this instance.","If a user fails to enter any account code, the same prompting for receipt of an incorrect account code entry, can take place. A time out can occur after, for example, 3.5 seconds of no activity. PAC Translation would not occur in this instance.","Customers with PIC access can be required to wait for a tone before entering a PAC. Customers with dedicated access can complete the entire dialing sequence (phone number and PAC) without waiting for the tone and be connected without even hearing the tone. If, however, the customer (using dedicated access) pauses after dialing the phone number, the network can still generate a tone prompting the user for the PAC.","Business customers can have the ability to modify their PAC tables via a world wide web Internet interface. The modification functions can include, for example, additions, deletions, changes, and modifications of verbal translations. These changes can take effect within, e.g., 60 minutes or less.","Customers that choose PAC Translation can have the translation, not the actual account code, presented on an invoice. Customers that do not use PAC Translation can have the account code presented on the invoice.","PAC tables can be associated to any type of resource (e.g., Master Account, ANI, Trunk Group, Location Account, and\/or Authcode). Multiple PAC tables, in one embodiment, cannot be associated with a single resource.","(a) PAC Variations","Verified Forced PACs enable a customer to assign PACs to, e.g., employees, teams and departments, that force the end-user to enter the PAC prior to completing a long distance call.","Unverified Forced PACs can require that a PAC (of the chosen digit length, e.g., four digits) be entered to complete a call, however the digits are not pre-determined and the customer can have the ability to use all PACs in a given digit length. For example, with four-digit PACs, the customer could use any code from 0001-9999.","Unverified Unforced PACs are the same as Unverified Forced PACs, but do not require a caller to enter the PAC to complete the long distance call. Unforced PACs can have, for example, a # override feature allowing calls to be connected quickly without relying on a network timeout to connect the call. If after, e.g., 3.5 seconds a PAC is not entered, the call can connect as usual. If a user enters a lower number of digits than the PAC table indicates, a prompt \u201cInvalid code, please try again\u201d can be announced. At this point, the pound override feature can be used or the user can try again. A second wrong entry can produce the same prompt and a third can prompt \u201cGoodbye.\u201d If a user enters more digits than has been setup on the PAC table, the first digits that comprise the correct PAC length can be used and the remaining digits ignored. Translation can occur (if activated) for the digits that correspond to the PAC table only. Billing presentation can also show the correct digit length.","Partially Verified Forced PACs can range from, for example, 4 to 12 digits. A portion of the PAC can be verified while the remaining portion is not; however, the entire digit stream can be forced. The customer can choose the digit length for user authentication as well as determine the digit length project accounting portion. A minimum of e.g., 2 digits can be verified and can occur before the unverified portion of the digit stream. For example, a customer can choose a 5-digit PAC and the first two digits would authenticate the user and the remaining digits would be used for accounting purposes. Additionally, each portion of the PAC can have the option to be translated by the customer for invoice and web presentation, i.e., PAC \u201c12345\u201d could be translated to \u201c12\u201d=John Doe and \u201c345\u201d could translate to \u201cProject X.\u201d","Department summary by PAC group enables a customer to choose any given set of PACs associated with a single table and group them under a customer chosen heading. For example, the header \u201cMarketing\u201d can contain codes ,  and , and the header \u201cCustomer Care\u201d can contain codes ,  and . The invoice can present summaries under each header.","(2) Class of Service Restrictions (COSR)","Class of Service Restrictions (COSR) can allow a customer to restrict outbound calling by certain jurisdictions. Restrictions can be set at, e.g., the account, ANI, Trunk Group, Authcode, or PAC level. The customer can be able to modify the COSR through, e.g., a web interface. Alternatively, some destinations, such as, e.g., international destinations, could not be modified by a customer directly and the customer could be required to contact customer care for approval.","Exemplary COSRs include, for example, interlata COSRs restricting calls to a customer's LATA only; intrastate calls restricting calls to the customer's originating state; interstate calls, allowing end-users to place domestic calls only anywhere in the U.S. whether local, intralata, intrastate, or interstate; domestic and dedicated international destinations allowing domestic calling as well as international calling to selected countries (based on country code) as determined by the customer; and domestic and selected international (i.e., can exclude high-risk countries) that allows callers to place all types of domestic and international calls.","Domestic and international can be the default, unless otherwise specified by the customer. A list of high risk countries can be unavailable unless otherwise requested by the customer. These high risk countries can have an increased probability of fraud and can require proper credit and sales approval.","In an example embodiment, PACs can be the first service restriction look-up followed by restrictions set up at the account level. High risk countries can always be blocked unless otherwise requested by the customer.","(3) Origination and Termination","A plurality of forms of access ban be provided including, for example, primary interexchange carrier (PIC), dedicated (T-1\/T-3\/PRI), and 101-XXXX.","Customers pre-subscribed to the telecommunications carrier owning telecommunications network  can have PIC access to the network via FGD trunks from an LEC. This access method can allow for, e.g., intralata, intrastate, interstate, and international calling.","Dedicated customers can originate calls using local facilities such as T-1\/T-3 on telecommunications network .","101-XXXX customers with an established account and ANIs loaded into the billing system can access telecommunications network . In this instance, customers do not have to have PIC access. If an end-user dials 101-XXXX without first establishing an account with the respective ANIs, calls can be blocked at the network level and the end-user can hear a recording explaining the call cannot be completed and to contact the operator for further assistance.","The order entry (OE) portion of the order management system (OSS) supports non-PICd ANIs. This system can load the ANIs into a soft switch, e.g., as subscribed \u201cnon-PICd\u201d ANIs which allows calls to be placed via 101-XXXX. These ANIs can stay non-PICd until the customer has requested a change to the PIC. Regular system maintenance does not NC these designated ANIs to telecommunications network  carrier and identifies these ANIs as Subscribed Non-PICd. Because 101-XXXX can only allowed for customers of telecommunications network , LEC billing (CABS) will not be necessary for direct customers.","Casual calling can be allowed through resale and wholesale customers, if requested. The customer can be required to have its own CIC code to do so. Call treatment discrimination can be necessary for Resale and Wholesale customers in this instance. The network can identify the customer type by the CIC and allow or disallow casual access. In this instance, LEC billing arrangements can be necessary. CIC code billing can be available as an option for wholesale and resale customers.","(4) Call Rating","For domestic calls, example call ratings of 1-second increments with, for example, 18-second minimums per call, can be supported.","For international calls, example call ratings of 1-second increments with 1-minute minimums per call, can be supported.","Example times of day (TOD) and days of week (DOW), etc., can be rated differently. For example, 8 am-5 pm Monday through Friday can be rated differently than 5:01 pm-7:59 am Monday through Friday and all day Saturday and Sunday.","Term discounts can be provided for long-term service contract commitments.","(5) Multiple-Service T-1","1+ toll-free, internet access, private line and dedicated access lines can be provisioned over the same multiple service T-1. Multiple service T-1 can support two-way trunks.","(6) Monthly Recurring Charges (MRCs)","MRCs can be charged for any combination of enhanced or basic services either as a group or stand-alone.","(7) PVN Private Dialing Plan","PVN Private dialing plan services can also be offered on a customized basis.","(8) Three-Way Conferencing","A 3-way conferencing bridge can be created by the end-user by choosing the conferencing feature from the enhanced services menu. The end-user enters up to, e.g., two additional phone numbers and is then connected by a bridge.","(9) Network Hold with Message Delivery","A service which places the caller on hold while playing an announcement message can be offered as a service to customers.","c. 8XX Toll Free Services","Toll-free service can allow calling parties to dial an 8XX number and terminate the call to either a POTS line or DAL. The person or company receiving the call is responsible for the cost of the transaction.","Termination can be available to both on-net and off-net areas in the U.S. Off-net can be handled CB. Calls can originate anywhere in the U.S. plus, e.g., Canada, USVI, and Puerto Rico.","Real-time ANI network-based feature can pass the originating ANI to the customer answering the call. The number is viewed by the operator of the answering end using CPE. This can be used by call centers wishing to pull customer records based on the customer's phone number. This can be a DAL-only service. Default delivery can provide an entire ANI. Customers can add up to 2 delimiters.","Dialed Number Identification Service (DNIS) is a network-based feature that can provide the answering party with the toll-free (or customer delivered) number dialed. Customer-owned computer telephony equipment can provide the display. DNIS allows multiple toll-free numbers to be used on a single trunk group in a call-center setting because of its ability to display which number has been dialed enabling the calls to be handled uniquely. This can be a DAL-only service. Customers can order DNIS in a variety of numbering format schemes from, for example, 4-10 digits. DNIS can be the entire toll-free number. DNIS can be any portion of the toll-free number. DNIS can be any customer defined number from, for example, 4-10 digits. Default delivery can include the entire toll-free number. Customer can define the number with up to two delimiters.","(1) Enhanced Routing Features","Time of Day (TOD) routing routes toll-free calls to alternate, customer-defined destinations based on the time of day. Routing can be determined by the customer in one-minute increments. The time of day can be determined by the terminating location's time zone. A day can be equal to 12:00 am to 11:59 pm.","Day of Week (DOW) routing routes toll-free calls to alternate, customer-defined destinations based on the day of week. The time of day is determined by the terminating location's time zone. A day can be equal to 12:00 am to 11:59 pm.","Area Code ((NPA) routing routes toll-free calls to alternate, customer-defined destinations based on the area code the originating phone call came from.","NPA-NXX routing routes toll-free calls to alternate, customer-defined destinations based on the area code and prefix of the originating ANI.","Geographic routing routes toll-free calls to alternate, customer-defined destinations based on the state the originating phone call came from.","Multi-carrier routing routes pre-determined percentages of toll-free calls over a single toll-free number to alternate carriers defined by the customer. This is a function of the SMS database.","Percentage Allocation routing routes toll-free calls to alternate, customer-defined destinations based on call distribution percentages. Percentages can be defined down to the nearest 1%.","Day of Year (DOY) routing routes callsed based on days of the year that are determined by the customer.","Extension routing routes calls based on end-user DTMF input. These extensions are pre-defined by the customer and can range from 2 to 12 digits. A table can be built that associates a terminating point, e.g., an ANI or Trunk Group, with an extension. A network prompt such as, for example, a \u201cbong tone,\u201d can be used. A time out of, for example, 3.5 seconds can be used. An invalid entry prompt, such as \u201cInvalid Code, Please Try Again,\u201d can be used. A two \u201cinvalid entry\u201d maximum and then a \u201cGoodbye\u201d and a network disconnect can be used.

The call is then connected.","Calling cards can allow customers to make long distance, international, and local calls while away from their home or office. These calls are billed monthly on the same invoice with other telecommunications services.","(1) Calling Card Features","Calling card services can include a plurality of features such as, for example, universal toll-free access number (UAN); UAN authorization code; class of service (COS) restrictions; reorigination; usage cap; authorization code (authcode) translation; invoice presentation; project account codes (PACs); dial correction; 3-way conferencing; and dedicated termination service.","Universal Toll-Free Access Number (UAN) is the toll-free number that accesses the calling card platform from anywhere in the US, Puerto Rico, USVI, and Canada. The UAN serves all customers that choose the UAN.","UAN Authorization Code authenticates the end user. For UAN customers, the code consist, for example, of 10 digits followed by a PIN number, totaling 14 digits in length. The 10 digits can either be randomly generated or can be requested by the customer as the customers Billing Telephone Number (or any other phone or number sequence). The PIN can also either be randomly generated or can be requested by the customer. The default can be random generation for both Authcode and PIN numbers. No more than 10 PIN numbers can be assigned to a single Authcode. An additional 6-digit international PIN can be generated for customer use when originating calls from an international destination. This PIN can be entered in lieu of the 4-digit domestic PIN.","The customer can limit calling card use based on Class of Service Restrictions (COS) restrictions. Cards can as a default have domestic (all 50 states, Canada, USVI, PR) origination and termination only. International origination and termination can be made available upon request by the customer.","Re-Origination will allow customers to place multiple calling card calls without having to hang up, dial the access number, and enter the authorization code again. The feature can be initiated by depressing for 2 full seconds.","Usage Cap limits any given authcode to a customer determined usage limit. Once the maximum dollar limit is hit the card ceases working and prompts the customer to contact customer service. Usage limits can be set in $10 increments and at daily, weekly, or monthly thresholds. When a customer is approaching its maximum, a prompt can be announced stating \u201cyour usage limit is near its maximum, you have X minutes remaining, please contact customer service.\u201d The prompt can begin when the user reaches 90% of its allowance based on dollars. In the even the customer is in the middle of a connection, only the card owner will hear the prompt. If a new call is placed and the en-user is already within the 90% threshold, a prompt will notify the customer of the number of minutes that are available after the terminating number is entered. The number of minutes will be based on the termination point and the rating associated with it.","Authcode translation allows a customer to translate authorization codes to, for example, a user name or department name up to a 25 character maximum.","An invoice can by default show 10 digits of the 14 digits and associate each authcode with expenditures. If the customer chooses Authcode Translation, the invoice can automatically present the translation and not the authcode.","A customer can associate a PAC Table with the customer's Authcodes. PAC table rules apply. An end-user can be prompted as usual after entering in the authcode and terminating ANI. The prompts apply to PACs on calling card as an long distance service.","If a phone number is mis-dialed, dial correction allows the user to hit the * key to delete the current entry and being to re-enter the phone number in its entirety.","Personal Toll-Free Access Number (PAN) service provides a toll-free number that accesses the calling card platform from anywhere in the US, Puerto Rico, USVI, and Canada.

If the first is busy, for example, the call would be sent to the next number in the list. If the call reached the end of the list, the call could disconnect or terminate into whatever type of messaging service that might be available. These lists can be toggled on or off via a web or IVR interface. Up to 5 lists can be created.","Busy Detection re-routes busy calls to an alternate destination. In the case of fax, the web interface shows when and where the fax was delivered.","IVR Interface permits a customer to change termination points and toggle on or off Termination preference lists via DTMF tones. A customer could be prompted for a pass-code for security purposes.","Dedicated Termination Service (DTS) allows forwarded calls to terminate On-PVN over dedicated facilities.","User Authentication ensures that a user authorized routing modifications by, e.g., entry of a code or PIN.","g. Debit Card\/Credit Card Call Services","Debit card and credit card calls are permitted and are similar to calling card services calls with the addition of third-party credit check processing.","Customers have access to a web interface that manages, e.g., names, phone numbers, e-mail addresses, company names, addresses, and scheduling. Customers can enter and maintain their own contacts. By selecting names and a meeting time, customers can easily administer their own conference from the desktop. Additionally, the moderator can view the participants that have and have not connected.","Participants can be notified of, e.g., the conference time, dial-in number (if applicable), subject, and participants by, e.g., e-mail, pager, fax, or voice message.","Network Dial-Out service allows the conference moderator to direct-dial each participant at the phone number of choice. When a participant answers the phone a bridge is created.

Other attendees could, e.g., not be able to hear the muted person, nor, e.g., could the muted person be able to hear other participants in the conference.","Customized Greeting permits customers to generate and load their own greeting that a caller will hear before being connected to the bridge.","Code Access permits a participant to hear a prompt asking for a code (determined by moderator) that could allow access to the conference. The code can be entered, e.g., via dual tone multiple frequencies (DTMF) tones.","h. Local","Local Voice can comprise two separate elements. The first element of Local Voice, which is also the foundation of the service, is commonly referred to as \u201cDial Tone\u201d. The other element is referred to as Local Calling\/Traffic, which is the usage that is generated on the Dial Tone. Each element is addressed separately below.","(1) Local Voice\/Dial Tone (LV\/DT)","Local Services deliver services comparable to what incumbent ILECs provide. LV\/DT provides, in its basic form, 10 digits phone numbers and\/or services that can access the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). LV\/DT provides the customer the ability to place and receive calls on their LV\/DT, whether the calls are local, long distance, international, toll-free or service (611, 411, 911, 0, 00) types of calls. Call types can be from an on network customer or from an off network caller.","Two types of digital\/trunking protocols currently in use today are PBX Digital Trunking and ISDN\/PRI. Analog services can be provided as well. Digital trunks interface with Hybrid and PBX CPE equipment.","LD\/VT adheres to the tariffs and regulations that govern Local Service providers in each market that the service is launched. For example, federal, state and local taxes can apply where applicable.","Local access can be available in those cities where the owner of telecommunications network  has co-carrier status and a POP within the serving wire center.","The two prevalent protocols that LD\/VT emulates are Digital PBX Trunking and ISDN\/PRI. Only one Rate Center that is generic to the customers physical address is allowed with each delivery. Foreign Exchange service is another option but not in combination with a customer's designated Rate Center.","Digital PBX Trunking (Digital PBX) or (DPbx) trunking uses a DS-1 4-wire (1.544 Mbit) for the underlying transmission facility. Line Code options of AMI or B8ZS, and framing options of Super-Frame (SF) or Extended SuperFrame (ESF) can be offered. Service provides 24 digital channels at 56K per DSO. Fractional DS-1s can also be available with a minimum of 12 DSOs ordered. Each DSO channel carries the signaling overhead. DPbx can be channelized as one-way inbound, one-way outbound or two-way trunk groups. Incoming calls hunt to an idle channel within a trunk group, low to high, while the customer hunts high to low. Customer must yield to a carrier under \u201cglare\u201d conditions. Calls are initiated with trunk seizure and confirmed by a receiving end via \u201cwink\u201d signaling. Addressing can be selected as, e.g., Dual Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) or Multi-Frequency (typically used for interoffice communications). Answer Supervision is provided on outbound calls.","ISDN also can use a DS-1 4-wire transmission facility. Configurations of PRI can be 23B+D or 24B channels. Each B (bearer) channel transmission is at 64 kpbs \u201cclear channel\u201d since the signaling is handled on the \u201cD\u201d or data channel for the circuit. In order for a customer to order a 24B circuit, they must have at a minimum one 23B+D configuration. In a preferred embodiment, customers can have a back up D channel when ordering multiple PRIs with a 24B configuration. Customers can also preferably order PRI with a line coding of B8ZS and framing of ESF. ANI delivery can be standard with PRI service.","When customers order either a DPBX or ISDN\/PRI service, each inbound only or two-way trunk group can automatically be provisioned with one phone number. If more than one phone number is needed per trunk group, DID services can be ordered.","Direct Inward Dial (DID) service can be delivered to a customer's CPE equipment via inbound only or two-way trunks. The switch can deliver the dialed telephone number (up to 7 digits), sometimes referred to as DNIS, to the premise switch. Number blocks are ordered in blocks of 20 consecutive numbers i.e. 555-1230 thru 555-1249.","(2) Call Handling Features","(a) Line Hunting","There are several different forms of line hunting. There is no additional charge, regardless of which hunting method is utilized. The form a customer selects will depend on their business application.","Series completion hunting allows calls made to a busy directory number to be routed to another specified directory number. Series completion hunting begins with the originally dialed member of the series completion group, and searches sequential for an idle directory number from the list of directory numbers. A telephone number is assigned to each member of the series completion hunt. When hunting reaches the last number in the group without finding an idle station, a busy signal can occur.","Multi-line hunting provides a sequential hunt over the members in the multi-line hunt group. A phone number is assigned to the main number, but each line in the hunt group can have a phone number or a \u201cTer\u201d (Terminal) identifier assigned to it.","Circular hunting allows all lines in a multi-line hunt group to be tested for busy, regardless of the point of entry into the group. When a call is made to a line in a multi-line hunt group, a regular hunt is performed starting at the station associated with the dialed number. The hunt continues to the last station in the group, then proceeds to the first station in the group and continues sequentially through the remaining lines in the group. Busy tone can be returned if hunting returns to the called station without finding an alternative station that is idle. Usually in this situation, all members of the multi-line hunt group can be identified with a phone number.","Uniform Call Distribution (UCD) hunting, an enhanced form, has specific uses for customers. (UCD is not to be confused with Automatic Call Distribution (ACD), which is an enhanced version of UCD.) The UCD feature is a hunting arrangement that provides uniform distribution of terminated calls to members of a multi-line hunt group. UCD does a pre-hunt for the next call, searches for the next idle member and can set the member as the start hunt position for the next call. If no idle member is found, the start hunt position can be the last called member plus 1.","(b) Call Forward Busy","Call Forwarding Busy Line can automatically redirect incoming calls to a pre-designated telephone number when the line is busy. This service can establish a fixed forward-to telephone number. In one embodiment, it is not a customer changeable number. An order is issued by a carrier to change the forward-to number. When Call Forward Busy line is activated, the customer can pay for the local and\/or toll usage charges. This feature can carry a flat monthly rate.","(c) Call Forwarding Don't Answer","Call Forwarding Don't Answer can automatically redirect all calls to another telephone number when a telephone is not answered within a specified amount of time. This service can establish a fixed forward-to telephone number. In one embodiment, it is not a customer changeable number. An order can be issued to change the forward-to number. The customer can choose the number of rings before the line forwards the call. When Call Forwarding Don't Answer is activated, the customer can pay for the local and\/or toll usage charges. This feature can carry a flat monthly rate.","(d) Call Forward Variable","Call Forwarding Variable allows the user to redirect all incoming calls to another telephone number. This service can use a courtesy call that allows the customer to notify a party at the \u201cforward-to-number\u201d that the customer's calls will be forwarded to the second party's number. Activating the service also returns a confirmation tone to the originator. Call Forwarding Variable can take precedence over other features and services such as Call Forwarding Busy\/Don't Answer, Call Waiting and Hunting. When this feature is activated, the customer can pay for any local and\/or toll usage charges. This feature can carry a flat monthly rate.","(e) Call Hold","Call Hold can enable a user to put any in-progress call on hold by flashing the switchhook and dialing a code. This frees the line to originate another call. Only one call per line can be held at a time. The held call cannot be added to the originated call. This feature is not to be confused with the hold button on a telephone set. The party placed on hold will not hear anything (unless customer subscribes to Music-On Hold service). This feature carries a flat monthly rate.","(f) Three-Way Calling","Three-way Calling service can allow a line in the talking state to add a third party to the call without operator assistance. To add a third party, the user flashes the switchhook once to place the first party an hold, receives recall dial tone, dials the second party's telephone number, then flashes the switchhook again to establish the three-way connection. The second switchhook flash can occur any time after the completion of dialing, i.e., when the second party answers, a two-way conversation can be held before adding the original party for a three-way conference.","(g) Call Transfer","Call Transfer can conference and transfer an established inbound call to another number. When this feature is used to transfer a call to a local or toll number, the customer initiating the feature can pay for the resulting call charges. Call Transfer can be used in conjunction with Three-way calling.","(h) Call Waiting\/Cancel Call Waiting","Call Waiting Terminating service can alert the user to an incoming call while the phone is already in use. The service signals the customer with two separate tones or tone patterns. The calling party can hear ringing or a tone\/ring combination. Call Waiting Terminating can take precedence over Call Forwarding Busy Line. Call Waiting Terminating service can be canceled on a per call basis. This can be done by entering a code prior to placing a call or during a call.","Call Waiting Originating service can allow a customer to send, to another line within a group, a Call Waiting tone if the other line is busy.","(1) Extension or Station-to-Station Calling","Station-to-Station (or \u201cabbreviated\u201d) dialing can allow one station line to call another station line without having to go through the public network. Calls of this nature are usually classified as an intercom call. Intercom calls do not carry any type of local or toll charges because they occur within a common group of numbers. A station-to-station call can be dialed by using 2-6 digits. An example would be placing a call to an internal station having the phone number 667-2345. If the dialing sequence is set at 4 digits, the call could be completed simply by dialing 2-3-4-5. If the common group is set for 3-digit station-to-station dialing, all other station lines can also then set to 3-digit dialing.","(j) Direct Connect Hotline\/Ring Down Line","Direct Connect service automatically dials a pre-selected number. Simply taking the receiver off-hook can activate this service. No access codes or telephone numbers need to be dialed. The Direct Connect number can be selected when service is ordered and can be changed by placement of an order, such as, for example, via a web interface. The Direct Connect number can be, e.g., an internal line number, a local number or a long distance number. If the call is sent to another local or long distance number, the customer can pay for the usage charges.","(k) Message Waiting Indicator","Message Waiting Indication can come in two forms and is used primarily with Voice Mail. A first form of this feature can provide the station line user with an audible indication that Voice Mail has been activated. The stutter tone can be heard when the user goes off-hook, alerting the user that a message has been left in the voice mailbox. When the message has been retrieved, the stutter tone can disappear.","A second form of message waiting indication can be a visual prompt. The visual prompt can operate the same way as the stutter dial tone except that it can use a signal to light a lamp on the customer's phone.","(l) Distinctive Ringing","This feature can enable a user to determine the source of an incoming call from a distinctive ring. The pattern can be based on whether the call (1) originates from within a group, (2) originates external to the group, (3) is forwarded from the attendant position, or (4) originates from a line with a Call Waiting Originating feature.","Distinctive Ringing can comprise two call processing components: Party Filtering and Calling Party Filtering. The distinctive ringing components can provide for distinctive ringing patterns to be applied to a terminating line based on the originating line. Each component can have a list of multiple options that can be chosen from to customize the distinctive ringing. When Distinctive Ringing is assigned to a line, it can be immediately active. The station user cannot deactivate the feature in one embodiment. An order can be placed to have Distinctive Ringing deactivated.","(m) Six-Way Conference Calling","Six-way conference calling can allow a non-attendant station to sequentially call up to five (5) other parties after dialing the access code. The non-attendant station can add parties together to make an, e.g., six-way call. The originator of the six-way call can be billed for the usage charges. There are no limitations on the number of stations that can be assigned a Six-way Conference calling group.","(n) Speed Calling","Speed calling can allow a user to dial selected numbers using fewer digits than are normally required. One- and two-digit abbreviated dialing codes can be offered. Speed calling can be, e.g., available as an eight-number list (Speed Calling 8), and a thirty-number list (Speed Calling 30). Speed Calling 8 can use codes 2 through 9. Speed Calling 30 can use codes 20 through 49. Customers can order both options on one station line for a total of 38 speed calling codes. Any combination of local and long distance numbers, service access codes and 3-digit numbers (such a 9-1-1) can be entered into the Speed Calling list. The number of digits stored within each code can be limited to, e.g., 16.","(o) Selective Call Rejection","Call Rejection can allow a customer to pre-select up to a set number of phone numbers to reject any incoming calls from those numbers. If the number is not known, this feature can also be activated via a code after the call has been completed. A code can be entered to cancel Call Rejection at any time.","(p) Remote Activation of Call Forward Variable","This feature can enable a customer to activate or deactivate Call Forwarding Variable from a remote site. To activate or deactivate the feature from a remote site, a Touch Tone service and a Pin Code can be used, for example. The Pin Code can be required for security reasons.","(3) Enhanced Services","(a) Remote Call Forward (RCF)","Remote Call Forward (RCF) service can allow a business to establish a local presence in other areas without having to invest in a hardwired solution. RCF can create a virtual inbound only service, e.g., via software programming. A customer can make a request from the local service provider for a phone number that can be with a rate center that is not associated with the address to where the calls are to terminate. The RCF can be provisioned to forward all incoming calls to a customer specific phone number. This can in one embodiment, be a non-customer changeable number except via an order. Depending upon the locality of the service, the forwarding of calls can generate a local call, a local toll call or a long distance call, which can be invoiced to the RCF customer. Calls can be forwarded to a toll free service and in one embodiment do not carry a per call charge. RCF can carry a flat MRC.","When a customer requests multiple calls to be terminated at one time, RCF paths can be ordered. Depending upon the number of paths ordered, the number of calls that can be terminated simultaneously can be determined. Each path can carry a flat MRC.","(b) Voice Messaging Services","Voice Messaging services can provide a customer the control of determining how communications are to be handled at their business. Voice messaging combined with local service can create a total business solution. Voice messaging can provide the customer with flexibility and total call coverage.","The foundation of voice messaging can be the voice mailbox, which can provide for the repository of messages. These messages can be, for example, voice or fax. The voice mailbox can be configured according to the customer's needs with various levels or grades of service. Retrieval of messages can be performed through various methods that can range, e.g., from a local, to a remote and toll free access.","Voice messaging components take a basic voice mailbox and enhances it. Enhancements can include such features as, for example: broadcast services; one number location services; pseudo auto attendant; dial out capabilities; revert to operator; fax on demand; and informational services.","Voice messaging services can be broken down into three categories. The categories of voice messaging services can include, integrated voice messaging, stand-alone voice messaging, and enhanced voice messaging.","(c) Integrated Voice Messaging","Integrated voice messaging can tie the customer's phone number with the voice messaging platform. The customer's caller needs to dial only one number in order to contact the customer. The integration can be accomplished via call handling features to the voice-messaging platform such as call forwarding busy, call forwarding no answer, call forwarding variable and message waiting indication. Basic applications for this type of service can include private\/individual lines and multi-lines and multi-line hunt arrangements that can require call coverage. By using an integrated version of voice messaging, the customer can also receive a \u201crevert to operator\u201d feature as part of the package.","This type of service can be application specific. A customer gives out only one number to its customers for them to reach it. If a customer does not what to answer the phone, when a call is transferred, it can still ring according to parameters set up by the call handling features, in one embodiment.","(d) Stand-Alone Voice Messaging","Stand-alone yoke messaging can provide customers with individual voice mailboxes. These mailboxes can be set up with, their own phone numbers and need not be tied to a customer's phone number. Therefore, in one embodiment, they do not have \u201crevert to operator\u201d services and message waiting indication. These mailboxes can be useful to, e.g., a sales organization which has employees which do not have an office with phone services.","Depending upon the application, a pseudo-integration type of service can be set up. By using call-handling features, calls can be forwarded to the phone number assigned to a voice mailbox.","(4) Class Services","A name and number display can be provided.","An automatic call back\/ring again service can allow automatic return of the last incoming call (i.e., whether answered or missed). If the number called back is busy, automatic call back service can alert the user with a special ring when the user's line and the line the user is calling back are both idle. This feature can be assigned on an individual line basis. The ringback alerting interval can be varied from, e.g., 24 to 48 seconds, inclusive in, e.g., 6-second increments. Automatic callback service can be activated before receiving another incoming call. Outgoing calls can be placed before activating automatic callback on the last incoming call. This service can work well with call waiting.","(5) Class of Service Restrictions","A local only COS restriction restricts all calls to locally terminated ones.","(6) Local Voice\/Local Calling (LV\/LC)","This second segment of Local voice is referred to as local calling. Local calling is the traffic that is within a LATA but does not constitute a long distance call. Depending upon the market that the service is being provided in, local calling can be a for fee or free service.","i. Conferencing Services","(1) Audio Conferencing","A 3-way conferencing bridge can be created by the end-user by choosing the conferencing feature from the enhanced services menu. The end-user enters up to, e.g., two additional phone numbers and is then connected by the bridge.","Dedicated Termination Service (DTS) allows long distance calls from the calling card to terminate to a Dedicated PVN site if applicable. Non-PVN calls could terminate regularly over FGD trunks. The network can determine if the call can be terminated over its own facilities and if so, rate it appropriately. DTS calls can be priced less than calls that terminate over FGD. A routing table allows the network to identify calls that originate from a calling card that has been assigned an associated terminating Trunk Group.","(a) Audio Conferencing Features","Audio conferencing can allow a customer to setup a call with two or more participants. The customer, through an easy to use web interface, can create a conferencing bridge.","This service can be available to all customers who sign up for the service. Because the call is being setup through a web interface, conferences can be setup anywhere access to the Internet is available.","(2) Video Conferencing","Video conferencing can be provided over telecommunications network .","14. Data Services","a. Internet Hosting","Internet hosting services can be provided over the network of the claimed invention. An Internet Services Provider (ISP) can use server and communications services including Internet access from the telecommunications network and can be billed for the usage. High speed connectivity can be provided as well as World Wide Web, File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Gopher and other Internet hosting services.","b. Managed Modem Services","Managed modem service is a service provided to users of communications services, such as an ISP. Managed modem services provide modem services to subscribers of the ISP. As an ISP signs up new subscribers, access can be provided to the subscriber over modems provided by a networking services provider (NSP). Modems can be shared by a plurality of ISPs and economies of scale can be obtained by requiring a lower overall number of modems and associated communications network hardware. Other dialing services can be made available over the data network of the invention.","c. Collocation Services","Network services can be provided co-located with a customer. For example, the telecommunications network carrier can provide TG, AG, and NAS access at the customer premises for such purposes as high speed modem access. By placing telecommunications network components on site at a customer location, various advantages can be gained by the telecommunications provider and subscriber.","d. IP network Services","Other Internet access services can be made available for a client, such as intranet and PVN services.","e. Legacy Protocol Services\u2014Systems Network Architecture (SNA)","Access to IBM Systems Network Architecture (SNA) services can be made available over data network  of the invention.","f. Permanent Virtual Circuits","Permanent Virtual Circuit services can be supported. For example, separate SNA PVCs can be provided.","15. Additional Products and Services","Telecommunications network  can be used to deliver a plurality of new product and service offerings. For example, new services include, services can be configured via Internet worldwide web connection to telecommunications network . Additional service offerings include that billing options can be announced at the beginning of a call. Another new service enables the announcement of the cost of a call to be read at the conclusion of a telephone call. Telecommunications network  also supports connectivity of native IP devices, such as, for example, a SELSIUS phone. Additional new products and services include integration of native IP and unified PBX\/file server devices into telecommunications network . See for example customer net  shown in . Attached to network  are a variety or native IP devices . For example, IP Client  can be a personal computer capable of VOIP telephony communication, including voice digitizing, network interface card and transmission hardware and software. PBX\/File Server  is a native IP device with hybrid data\/voice functionality, such as, for example, PBX  functionality with optionally collocated access gateway (AG)  functionality for telephony access by phones , and data services functionality such as, for example, file server  functionality. Another new service enables messaging joined with find-me type services.","In addition to the new services just described enabled by telecommunications network , it should be noted that telephone calls over telecommunications network  deliver call quality which is better than the standard PSTN. Telecommunications network  also permits read reporting of call statistics and call volumes and billing information to commercial clients, for example. Telecommunications network  also permits dynamic modification over the route traversed by traffic via worldwide web access.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1925","num":"2325"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00194","num":"00194"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"175pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Term","Definition"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["access tandem (AT)","An AT is a class 3 or 3\/4 switch used to switch calls"]},{"entry":[{},"between EOs in a LATA.
