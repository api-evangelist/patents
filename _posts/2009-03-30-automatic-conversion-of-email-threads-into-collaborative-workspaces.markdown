title: Automatic conversion of email threads into collaborative workspaces
abstract: Automatic conversion of an email thread (or another form of electronic communication, such as IM chat content) into a collaborative workspace can begin with the detection of the addition of a reply message to an existing email thread by an email conversion handler. The existing email thread can include a main message and one or more reply messages. Satisfaction of user-defined or administrator-defined conversion criteria can then be assessed for the existing email thread. When the conversion criteria are satisfied, the existing email thread can be automatically converted into an artifact of a collaborative workspace contained within a collaborative environment. The collaborative workspace can be specific to the existing email thread. The designated participants of the existing email thread can be members of both the email and collaboration systems, and can be provided access to the collaborative workspace.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","BRIEF SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present invention relates to the field of electronic communications and, more particularly, to the automatic conversion of email threads into collaborative workspaces.","Organizations rely upon a variety of electronic communication systems to conduct daily business. Systems providing communication services such as email and online collaboration environments help to bridge the distances between geographically dispersed users. Email is often the primary means of exchanging and\/or distributing information to a group of users.","However, the effectiveness of email exchanges, referred to as threads, tends to decrease as the thread grows. That is, the more replies made by the participants of the email thread, the more difficult it becomes for the participants to absorb and\/or organize the data presented within the email thread. Further, the open-nature of email allows for participants to exclude existing participants and include other participants in their replies. This creates additional email threads that are separate from, but related to the original email thread. These additional email threads and the original email thread then continue to grow and consume more storage space within the email system.","A collaborative system is a better option for discussions that have a high amount of activity, such as a large quantity of replies and\/or exchanges of large amounts of data. However, at the start of an email thread, the amount of activity the email thread will generate is not known or easily predicted. Once the email thread has progressed to the point where it becomes obvious that a collaboration system is a better medium, participants are faced with transferring the contents of the email thread into the collaboration system manually or foregoing the data of the email thread by starting the topic anew in the collaboration system. Regardless of which option is selected, the data of the email thread is left within the email system until deleted or archived by individual participants, since participants often do not have the means by which to remove the email thread as a whole from the email system once it is no longer needed.","One aspect of the present invention can include a method for automatically converting an email thread into a collaborative workspace. Such a method can begin with the detection of the addition of a reply message to an existing email thread by an email conversion handler. The existing email thread can include a main message and one or more reply messages. Satisfaction of user-defined or administrator-defined conversion criteria can then be assessed for the existing email thread. When the user-defined or administrator-defined conversion criteria are satisfied, the existing email thread can be automatically converted into an artifact of a collaborative workspace contained within a collaborative environment. The collaborative workspace can be specific to the existing email thread. The designated participants of the existing email thread can be members of both the email and collaboration systems, and can be provided access to the collaborative workspace. In one embodiment, converted threads are moved from the email system. Further, subsequent email messages associated with a converted thread can be automatically moved from the email system to the collaborative workspace after an initial conversion takes place. In one embodiment, additional content communicated outside email (e.g., IM chat content) can also be moved to the collaborative workspace.","Another aspect of the present invention can include a system for automatically converting an email thread into a collaborative workspace. Such a system can include an email thread and an email conversion handler. The email thread can encapsulate data that represents an exchange of electronic messages between members of an email system. The electronic messages can include a main message and one or more reply messages, which can optionally contain file attachments. The email conversion handler can be configured to automatically relocate the data of the email thread from the email system into a collaborative workspace of a collaboration system. The data can be stored as an artifact within the collaborative workspace. The designated members of the email thread can be members of the collaboration system. In one embodiment, members can be associated with profiles, where the profiles can define conditions and preferences for converting email threads into a collaborative workspace. The profiles can be handled locally through a desktop policy or centrally, which would allow administrators of an organization (such as administrators in charge of the email server and\/or the servers providing the collaborative workspaces) to control conditions for converting email threads.","Yet another aspect of the present invention can include a computer program product for automatically converting an email thread into a collaborative workspace that includes a computer readable storage medium having embedded computer usable program code. The computer usable program code can be configured to detect the addition of a reply message to an existing email thread of an email system. The existing email thread can include a main message and one or more reply messages. The computer usable program code can also be configured to assess the satisfaction of user-defined or administrator-defined conversion criteria by the existing email thread. Additionally, the computer usable program code can be configured to automatically convert the existing email thread into an artifact of a collaborative workspace contained within a collaborative environment, when the user-defined or administrator-defined conversion criteria are satisfied. The collaborative workspace can be specific to the existing email thread. The designated members of the existing email thread can be members of both the email and collaboration systems, and can be provided access to the collaborative workspace.","The present invention discloses a solution for automatically converting the data of an email thread (or other series of communications, such as IM chat content) into a collaboration workspace of a collaboration system. User-configurable conversion criteria can define the conditions under which an email thread is converted. In one embodiment, the conversion criteria can be defined by a set of policies, which can be implemented as desktop policies and\/or centrally administered organizational policies. An email conversion handler can monitor email threads to determine when the conversion criteria have been met. The email conversion handler can then relocate data associated with the email thread into a collaborative workspace created specifically for the email thread. Within the email system, the email thread data can be replaced with a redirection message that informs the participants of the email thread of the conversion to the collaborative workspace. In one embodiment, moving the email thread to the collaborative workspace causes messages related to the thread to be deleted from one or more email servers, which conserves storage space. In one embodiment, once an email thread has been identified for conversion into a collaboration space, subsequent email messages associated with the thread can be automatically moved to the collaboration space when received by an email server.","The present invention may be embodied as a method, system, or computer program product. Accordingly, the present invention may take the form of an entirely hardware embodiment, an entirely software embodiment (including firmware, resident software, micro-code, etc.) or an embodiment combining software and hardware aspects that may all generally be referred to herein as a \u201ccircuit,\u201d \u201cmodule\u201d or \u201csystem.\u201d Furthermore, the present invention may take the form of a computer program product on a computer-usable storage medium having computer-usable program code embodied in the medium. In one embodiment, the invention is implemented in software, which includes but is not limited to firmware, resident software, microcode, etc.","Furthermore, the invention can take the form of a computer program product accessible from a computer-usable or computer-readable medium providing program code for use by or in connection with a computer or any instruction execution system. For the purposes of this description, a computer-usable or computer readable medium can be any apparatus that can contain, store, communicate, propagate, or transport the program for use by or in connection with the instruction execution system, apparatus, or device. The computer-usable medium may include a propagated data signal with the computer-usable program code embodied therewith, either in baseband or as part of a carrier wave. The computer usable program code may be transmitted using any appropriate medium, including but not limited to the Internet, wireline, optical fiber cable, RF, etc.","Any suitable computer usable or computer readable medium may be utilized. The computer-usable or computer-readable medium may be, for example but not limited to, an electronic, magnetic, optical, electromagnetic, infrared, or semiconductor system, apparatus, device, or propagation medium. Examples of a computer-readable medium include a semiconductor or solid state memory, magnetic tape, a removable computer diskette, a random access memory (RAM), a read-only memory (ROM), an erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM or Flash memory, a rigid magnetic disk and an optical disk. Current examples of optical disks include compact disk-read only memory (CD-ROM), compact disk-read\/write (CD-R\/W) and DVD. Other computer-readable medium can include a transmission media, such as those supporting the Internet, an intranet, a personal area network (PAN), or a magnetic storage device. Transmission media can include an electrical connection having one or more wires, an optical fiber, an optical storage device, and a defined segment of the electromagnet spectrum through which digitally encoded content is wirelessly conveyed using a carrier wave.","Note that the computer-usable or computer-readable medium can even include paper or another suitable medium upon which the program is printed, as the program can be electronically captured, via, for instance, optical scanning of the paper or other medium, then compiled, interpreted, or otherwise processed in a suitable manner, if necessary, and then stored in a computer memory.","Computer program code for carrying out operations of the present invention may be written in an object oriented programming language such as Java, Smalltalk, C++ or the like. However, the computer program code for carrying out operations of the present invention may also be written in conventional procedural programming languages, such as the \u201cC\u201d programming language or similar programming languages. The program code may execute entirely on the user's computer, partly on the user's computer, as a stand-alone software package, partly on the user's computer and partly on a remote computer or entirely on the remote computer or server. In the latter scenario, the remote computer may be connected to the user's computer through a local area network (LAN) or a wide area network (WAN), or the connection may be made to an external computer (for example, through the Internet using an Internet Service Provider).","A data processing system suitable for storing and\/or executing program code will include at least one processor coupled directly or indirectly to memory elements through a system bus. The memory elements can include local memory employed during actual execution of the program code, bulk storage, and cache memories which provide temporary storage of at least some program code in order to reduce the number of times code must be retrieved from bulk storage during execution.","Input\/output or I\/O devices (including but not limited to keyboards, displays, pointing devices, etc.) can be coupled to the system either directly or through intervening I\/O controllers.","Network adapters may also be coupled to the system to enable the data processing system to become coupled to other data processing systems or remote printers or storage devices through intervening private or public networks. Modems, cable modem and Ethernet cards are just a few of the currently available types of network adapters.","The present invention is described below with reference to flowchart illustrations and\/or block diagrams of methods, apparatus (systems) and computer program products according to embodiments of the invention. It will be understood that each block of the flowchart illustrations and\/or block diagrams, and combinations of blocks in the flowchart illustrations and\/or block diagrams, can be implemented by computer program instructions. These computer program instructions may be provided to a processor of a general purpose computer, special purpose computer, or other programmable data processing apparatus to produce a machine, such that the instructions, which execute via the processor of the computer or other programmable data processing apparatus, create means for implementing the functions\/acts specified in the flowchart and\/or block diagram block or blocks.","These computer program instructions may also be stored in a computer-readable memory that can direct a computer or other programmable data processing apparatus to function in a particular manner, such that the instructions stored in the computer-readable memory produce an article of manufacture including instruction means which implement the function\/act specified in the flowchart and\/or block diagram block or blocks.","The computer program instructions may also be loaded onto a computer or other programmable data processing apparatus to cause a series of operational steps to be performed on the computer or other programmable apparatus to produce a computer implemented process such that the instructions which execute on the computer or other programmable apparatus provide steps for implementing the functions\/acts specified in the flowchart and\/or block diagram block or blocks.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","120","125","165","155","100","120","125","155","130"]},"Participants  can utilize an email application  associated with the email system  running from a client device  to perform actions upon an email thread . The client device  can be an electronic computing device capable of running the email application , such as a personal computer or mobile phone. The email application  can represent a software program configured to allow a participant  to execute the various functions of the email system .","An email thread  can represent a series of electronic communications between participants  of the email system . The email thread  can be stored by the email system  in a repository  and can include a main message , one or more reply messages , and any included file attachments . The main message  can correspond to the originating message of the email thread . The reply messages  can represent responses made by the participants  of the main message  and\/or subsequent reply messages . File attachments  can be contained within the main message  and\/or the reply messages .","The email system  can represent the hardware and\/or software components necessary to support the use of email by the participants . In addition to the basic elements, the email system  can include an email conversion handler . The email conversion handler  can represent a software system and\/or application configured to automatically convert an email thread  to a collaborative workspace . In one embodiment, conversion of the email content to the collaborative workspace  can modify a format of the email messages and\/or attachments. For example, email messages conforming to an OUTLOOK specific format can be converted into a PDF format, which can be easier for collaborating participants  to utilize due to its more standardized nature.","In another contemplated embodiment, the email conversion handler  can operate from a server or system external to the email system . In such an embodiment, the server or system from which the email conversion handler  operates can be configured to communicate with the email system  and collaboration system  over the network .","To determine when an email thread  should be converted, the email conversion handler  can utilize a set of user-defined (or administrator-defined) conversion criteria . Alternatively, conversion of an email thread  can occur responsive to user input (e.g., manual trigger, such as selected a GUI button established for this purpose). The user-defined conversion criteria  can represent one or more assessable conditions that, when determined as satisfied by the email thread , trigger the conversion of the email thread  to the collaborative workspace .","Examples of assessable conditions can include, but are not limited to, the quantity of reply messages , the amount of storage space consumed by the email thread , the quantity of active participants , the amount of time that has elapsed from the transmission of the main message , a combination of one or more of these conditions, and the like. Additionally, the user-defined conversion criteria  can utilize BOOLEAN logic to create conditions that are more complex.","The email conversion handler  can be configured to assess email threads  for satisfaction of the user-defined conversion criteria  in various manners, based on implementation and\/or business preferences. For example, the email thread  can assessed when a participant  selects an option to create a reply message  for the email thread  and\/or when the email system  is experiencing a shortage of storage space.","The user-defined conversion criteria  can be configured via a user interface (not shown) that can be presented to an administrator of the email system  and\/or to a participant  having the proper privileges within the email application . Further, restrictions to the modification of user-defined conversion criteria  can be proliferated using policies and\/or user profiles. The policies and\/or profiles can be locally applied and managed (e.g., desktop policies applied at the client device ) or can be centrally applied and managed (e.g., organizational policies handled by a designated administrator). Use of organizational policies can permit an administrator to control which triggers and conditions result in email (or other messaging) content to be moved to the collaborative workspaces .","Over time, participants  can continue to interact with the email thread  by adding reply messages  and\/or file attachments . When the email thread  satisfies the user-defined conversion criteria , the email conversion handler  can be invoked to relocate the email data  for the email thread  from the email system  to the collaboration system . In one embodiment, once an email thread  has been selected for conversion to the collaborative workspace , subsequent related email messages (additional to the ones in an original thread) can also be moved to the collaborative workspace automatically.","When conversion of the email thread  is determined, the email conversion handler  can communicate with the collaboration system  to create a collaborative workspace  for the email thread . The email data  corresponding to the email thread  can then be moved into the repository  of the collaboration system  and associated with the created collaborative workspace . In this situation, the email data  can be considered to be stored as an artifact of the collaborative workspace .","Once the collaborative workspace  is created, the participants  of the email thread  can be provided access to the new collaborative workspace . Association can be achieved by correlating the email addresses of the participants  from the email thread  with those contained in the collaboration system . If a participant  is not registered with the collaboration system , the email conversion handler  can be configured to send notice of such exceptions to a designated participant  or administrator for resolution.","Conversion of the email thread  can also include removal of the associated email data  from the repository . Since this is an automated process, many participants  may be unaware that the email thread  has been converted to a collaborative workspace . Thus, the email conversion handler  can replace the email data  of the email thread  with a redirection message .","The redirection message  can take the place of the email thread  within the repository . Information can be included in the redirection message  to notify the participant  that the email thread  has been converted. For example, the redirection message  can contain a hyperlink or path location to the collaborative workspace , the name of the collaborative workspace , and\/or a listing of participants . In one embodiment, the removal of data  from repository  can occur after a predefined delay and\/or set of conditions are satisfied to ensure that email recipients  are not confused by the moving of the email thread to the collaborative workspace . In one embodiment, specifics of whether email data  is to be deleted from repository  and\/or changed responsive to a move to the collaborative workspace  can be configured to suit administrator and\/or participant  preferences.","It should be noted that the redirection message  is considerably smaller in size, and, therefore, storage space consumption, than the email thread . Thus, the majority of storage space consumed by the email thread  can be reclaimed for use by the email system . This is of note since the data  of the email thread  can be stored in multiple mailboxes within the repository .","It is important to emphasize that an automated mechanism is not currently available in known existing art (outside the instant disclosure) to convert email threads into collaborative workspaces. Conventional systems would utilize a manual process, which may not be able to remove all of the associated email data  from the repository . Further, the user-defined conversion criteria  can establish a uniform selection process for email threads .","As used herein, presented repositories  and  can be a physical or virtual storage space configured to store digital information. Repositories  and  can be physically implemented within any type of hardware including, but not limited to, a magnetic disk, an optical disk, a semiconductor memory, a digitally encoded plastic memory, a holographic memory, or any other recording medium. The repositories  and\/or  can be a stand-alone storage unit as well as a storage unit formed from a plurality of physical devices. Additionally, information can be stored within repositories  and  in a variety of manners. For example, information can be stored within a database structure or can be stored within one or more files of a file storage system, where each file may or may not be indexed for information searching purposes. Further, repositories  and\/or  can utilize one or more encryption mechanisms to protect stored information from unauthorized access.","Network  can include any hardware\/software\/and firmware necessary to convey data encoded within carrier waves. Data can be contained within analog or digital signals and conveyed though data or voice channels. Network  can include local components and data pathways necessary for communications to be exchanged among computing device components and between integrated device components and peripheral devices. Network  can also include network equipment, such as routers, data lines, hubs, and intermediary servers which together form a data network, such as the Internet. Network  can also include circuit-based communication components and mobile communication components, such as telephony switches, modems, cellular communication towers, and the like. Network  can include line based and\/or wireless communication pathways.","Although examples presented herein are focused upon email threads  associated with an email system  it should be understood that the disclosure is not so limited. That is, any series of electronic communications (e.g., IM chat content, blog discussions, voice mail files, e-faxes, etc.) can be moved to a collaborative workspace  in accordance with the inventive arrangements disclosed herein. Additionally, multiple types of different messages related to a central topic (e.g., thread) can be converted together and grouped into a single collaborative workspace . For example, email messages associated with a thread, related blog discussions, and\/or related IM chat content can each be moved to a single collaborative workspace  responsive to a triggering event.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","100"]},"The email conversion handler  can represent a software system and\/or application configured to automatically convert an email thread to a collaborative workspace. To perform this task, the email conversion handler  can include an assessment engine , a data relocation manager , and user-defined conversion criteria .","The assessment engine  can represent the component of the email conversion handler  that determines when an email thread satisfies the user-defined conversion criteria . For example, if a user-defined conversion criterion  is ten reply messages, then the assessment engine  can determine the quantity of reply messages contained within the email thread.","Once values for the user-defined conversion criteria  have been determined for the email thread, the assessment engine  can then determine if the email thread should be converted to a collaborative workspace. For example, of the ten user-defined conversion criteria , the email thread has satisfied four, but conversion of an email thread requires that six user-defined conversion criteria  be met. Thus, the assessment engine  would not initiate the conversion of this email thread.","When the assessment engine  determines the need for an email thread to be converted, the data relocation manager  can be invoked. The data relocation manager  can represent a component of the email conversion handler  configured to handle relocation the data of the email thread from the email system to the collaboration system. For this task, the data relocation manager  can include a data collection component  and a collaboration system facilitator .","The data collection component  can be configured aggregate the data for the email thread being relocated. For example, the data collection component  can retrieve all the copies from the repository of the email system, including related threads that have branched off, and consolidate the copies into a data composite of the email thread. As part of data aggregation, the data collection component  can also create a consolidated list of users participating in the email thread so they can be given access to the collaborative workspace. In one embodiment, additional related content, such as IM chat content, blog discussion content, etc. related to an email thread can also be aggregated into a consolidated workspace at this time.","Additionally, the data collection component  can be configured to perform any format changes to the aggregated email thread data necessary for the storage within the collaboration system. For example, the HyperText Markup Language (HTML) format of the email thread retrieved and consolidated may result in a file whose size is too large for the collaboration system. The data collection component  can be configured to execute a resolution measure, such as converting the HTML to text or separating the email thread into two smaller files, in order to bring the email thread data into compliance with the collaboration system. Additionally, proprietary formats can be converted to more standardized ones (e.g., PDF formats, XML formats, etc.) to ensure that all participants are able to view\/interact with collaborative content without requiring specialized applications that may not be loaded upon their client devices.","Since the data collection component  is tasked with finding the email thread data, it can also be configured to replace the data with the redirection message after the data has been moved into the collaborative workspace. That is, because the data collection component  identifies the storage locations of the email thread data within the repository of the email system, it can also be configured to utilize this information to replace the data with the redirection message.","The collaboration system facilitator  can be the interface mechanism for the email conversion handler  and the target collaboration system. For example, the collaboration system facilitator  can be configured to execute commands within the collaboration system such as creating the collaborative workspace. Commands for the collaboration system can utilize an application programming interface (API) associated with the collaboration system or another comparable medium supported by the collaboration system.","It should be appreciated that the email conversion handler  although focusing upon email content can be adapted for handling other content types. For example, an IM handler having functionality similar to the email conversion handler  can be included in an IM server and used to convert IM chat content into collaborative workspace content.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","300","100","200","300"]},"Method  can begin in step  where the email conversion handler can detect the addition of a reply message to an email thread. The email thread can then be assessed to determine values for the user-defined (or administrator-defined) conversion criteria in step . In step , it can be determined if the user-defined conversion criteria have been satisfied.","When the email thread does not satisfy the user-defined conversion criteria, flow can proceed to step  where the email conversion handler can continue to monitor the email threads of the email system. From step , flow can return to step .","When the email thread satisfies the user-defined conversion criteria, then step  can execute where a collaborative workspace can be created for the email thread within the collaboration system. The access privileges of the collaborative workspace can be configured to include the participants of the email thread in step .","In step , the data for the email thread can be collected from the email system. The collected data can be packaged as an artifact for the collaborative workspace in step . In step , the artifact can then be stored and associated with the collaborative workspace.","The email thread can be replaced with a redirection message in the email system in step . From step , flow can proceed to step  where the email conversion handler can continue to monitor the email threads of the email system.
