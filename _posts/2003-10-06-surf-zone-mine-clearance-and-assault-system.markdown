{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for Governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","(1) Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a system attachable to a vehicle for clearing mines and other obstacles.","(2) Description of the Prior Art","Some military operations require a system to clear mines and obstacles in shallow waters, a surf zone, and a craft landing zone. In addition, a requirement exists for mine hunting and clearance in deep waters (over 40 feet in depth).","A number of mine clearing systems are known in the prior art. These include the systems disclosed in Turner (U.S. Pat. No. 5,448,936); Jarman (U.S. Pat. No. 4,903,246); and Posseme et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 5,844,159). These systems and other available mine clearing systems have not fully met the needs of the military services.","Also known in the prior art are systems for protecting marine vessels from torpedo attack. One such system is disclosed in Wallin (U.S. Pat. No. 6,305,263). Still further, systems have been developed for protecting vessels against covert swimmers. One such system is disclosed in Burt (U.S. Pat. No. 5,267,220).","A replacement for existing mine clearing systems, which will operate in very shallow waters through the beach zone, is optimally maneuverable from the ship to the objective. In addition, the replacement for existing mine clearing systems optimally will not place personnel in the line of fire, will not require carrier battle group support, will not require allocation of lift capabilities, and will operate from over-the-horizon.","Accordingly, it is a general purpose and primary object of the present invention to provide a system attachable to a vehicle which adequately clears mines in a surf-zone and varying water-depth.","To attain the object described, there is provided a system attachable to a vehicle for clearing mines and other unwanted obstacles. The system is attachable to a vehicle which operates in the surf zone of a beach as well as in deeper waters with the system including means for detecting mines and other obstacles, and means for destroying the mines and the other obstacles.","In a preferred embodiment, the detecting means comprises a sonar targeting system mounted within a pod which can be focused in multiple directions and the destroying means comprises an underwater gun system also mounted within a pod which can target in multiple directions. The underwater gun system preferably fires underwater munitions to destroy the mines and\/or other obstacles.","Other details of the surf zone mine clearance and assault system of the present invention, as well as other objects and advantages attendant thereto, are set forth in the following detailed description and the accompanying drawings wherein like reference numerals refer to like elements. It will be understood that the particular devices embodying the invention are shown by way of illustration only and not as limitations of the invention. The principles and features of the present invention may be employed in various and numerous embodiments without departing from the scope of the invention.","Referring now to , the system  of the present invention generally comprises a vehicle  supporting a medium-caliber submersible gun  capable of firing supercavitating undersea munitions (not shown) with the gun targeting by the use of an advanced active sonar system . The vehicle  may be a landing craft such as an LCU (landing craft utility), a remotely piloted, underwater, unmanned vehicle (UUV), a submersible AAAV(advanced amphibious assault vehicle) or any other known vehicle suitable for the operation of the gun  and the sonar system .","The complete system  includes the latest advancements in mine-hunting sonar, underwater gun technologies, supercavitating underwater munitions, and amphibious\/undersea capabilities to create a weapon capable of destroying underwater mines and other obstacles from waters of varying depths and to further include the surf-zone.","If the sonar targeting system  fails to function adequately, the system  includes other options to destroy mines and other obstacles such as optical sighting for targeting and saturation of a target area with projectiles where no targeting system is otherwise effective. Once ashore, the system  can support other landing operation functions such as beach mine clearance, obstacle removal, and light fire support.","In , the vehicle  is illustrated as a landing craft utility (LCU), which is a standard vehicle used in beach assault operations. The gun  of the vehicle  includes one or more barrels  depending on the requirements for targeting underwater munitions. The gun  is properly sealed to function underwater and, if required, includes sabot stripping and muzzle gas management systems. The pod , for mounting the gun , includes suitable means known in the art for allowing the pod  to be moved in multiple targeting directions.","The gun  is directed by readings taken from the underwater sonar targeting system  when activated. The sonar targeting system  is of the type of any suitable sonar targeting system known in the art and is mounted in a pod  which is similar to the pod  and movable in multiple targeting directions. During a clearing operation, the locations of mines detected by the sonar targeting system  are fed to an onboard targeting computer  (see ) with the targeting computer used to properly direct the gun .","The vehicle  can be provided with an underwater stabilization system . The underwater stabilization system  comprises a two-component positioning system known in the art. The underwater stabilization system  allows the gun  and the sonar targeting system  to point in multiple targeting directions despite undulations of the vehicle .","Both the sonar targeting system  and the underwater gun are supported by one or more deployment arms . The deployment arms  allow the pods  and  to be rigidly held in the water. The deployment arms  are preferably large and rigid enough to prevent relative motion of the gun and sonar pods  and . If desired, the arms  can be fully retracted into the vehicle  to enable rapid transit and vehicle stowage. Any suitable means known in the art may be used to allow the arms  to move from a first position where the pods  and  are deployed to the fully retracted position.","The deployment arms  may be joined to at least one large structure  on the assault vehicle platform deck. Contained within the structure(s)  is powering equipment for the gun  and the deployment arms , as well as, a magazine  (see ) for the gun . A feed system  is provided to carry munitions from the magazine , through the deployment arms  to the gun  in the pod . Each structure  can be rigidly mounted to the vehicle  or mounted to a wheeled vehicle (not shown) that can be deployed from the vehicle  to the beach.","In operation, the structure  of the system  is placed aboard the vehicle . The vehicle  then transits from the beach assault staging area to the mine field. The deployment arms  lower the pod  and the pod  into the water over the sides of the vehicle . The sonar targeting system  in the pod  scans using acoustic energy, the area in front of the vehicle  for underwater mines and other unwanted obstacles. When a mine or other target is detected, the pod  with the gun is pointed at the mine or target and a burst of mine piercing underwater projectiles is fired from the gun. The kinetic and explosive energy in the projectiles causes a mine or other target to explode. This is repeated as the vehicle  advances toward the beach.","In areas where the sonar targeting system  in the pod  cannot target mines, such as an area with breaking waves, a saturation technique is implemented, sending enough projectiles into the area from the gun  to significantly ensure that any mines or unwanted targets in the area would be impacted. Once at or near the beach, the pod  with the gun  and the pod  with the sonar targeting system  is moved from a deployed underwater position to a retracted position where the pod  and the pod  are located above the waterline such that the gun  is used to fire at on-shore targets. If the system  is attached to a wheeled vehicle, the vehicle can be driven onto the beach where it can continue to saturate areas where mines and other undesirable obstacles might be found.","The system  of the present invention produces rapid clearance of surf-zone mines. An advantage of the system  is that the system is much more rapid than existing surf-zone mine clearance systems and that it has multiple utilities (can be used for land strike once ashore).","The deployment arms  are either hard mounted to the vehicle  or attached to a wheeled vehicle that rolls on and rolls off the vehicle .","If required by an anticipated operation, the pods ,  can be mounted to a single deployment arm .","If required by an anticipated military operation, the pods ,  may be mounted to a dedicated surface or snorkeling vehicle such as an advanced amphibious assault vehicle or power boat.","It is apparent that there is provided in accordance with the present invention a surf zone mine clearance assault vehicle which fully satisfies the objects, means,.and advantages set forth hereinbefore. While the present invention has been described in the context of specific embodiments thereof, other alternatives, modifications, and variations will become apparent to those skilled in the art having read the foregoing description. Accordingly, it is intended to embrace those alternatives, modifications, and variations as fall within the broad scope of the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["A more complete understanding of the invention and many of the attendant advantages thereto will be readily appreciated as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00015","num":"00015"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00016","num":"00016"},"figref":"FIG. 2"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
