title: Pressure indicator gel system and method therefore
abstract: A novel system for discerning pressure points in mouthpieces, namely orthodontic aligners. The system includes the steps of applying a colored gel to a light transmissive or clear mouthpiece-type aligner, mounting the aligner to the upper and/or lower teeth of the patient, and observing through the mouthpiece color variations generated by variations in gel density, wherein pressure points are indicated as lighter colors due to less gel density and spaces are indicated as deeper color, due to higher density of the colored gel. In an alternative embodiment a second gel incorporating rupturable spheres incorporating a second composition is utilized in the present system such that pressure upon the gel releases the second composition, which would be formulated to combine with the first gel and result in a color change, either due to a chemical reaction, or due to a mixing of two colors to produce an identifying color.

The paste is opaque and generally white in color, and is applied to the denture or appliance where it contacts the patient, which is then applied to the patient, then removed. One then views the paste on the denture or appliance, as well as the patient's teeth to discern impressions in the paste indicating high spots, pressure areas, contact areas, and other disturbances.","Orthodontic aligner mouthpieces have been utilized for years as an alternative to traditional braces to correct misalignment in teeth. These aligner mouthpieces are often fabricated of clear plastic or the like, thermoformed or otherwise manipulated to effect alignment of the wearer's teeth, and applied over the teeth as one would wear a mouth guard. The clear plastic and generally form fitting configuration can make it difficult for a casual observer to notice the aligner.","During an alignment procedure, the aligner is cast about a model of the patient's teeth. The aligner is then manipulated to apply pressure to select portions of the teeth which need alignment. This can be done by observing the teeth which need alignment, approximating the degree, position, and amount of pressure to be applied (which can be accomplished via \u201cbumps\u201d or the like formed on the aligner with special pliers or the like.","However, it can be difficult to judge pressure points, degree, and orientation of the teeth when viewed through the aligner. Further, it can be difficult to judge degree of movement of an aligned tooth or teeth through an aligner during treatment.","U.S. Pat. No. 4,198,243 issued 1980 teaches a liquid glycol colored composition for marking contact points on the occlusal surface of restorative dental or natural teeth.","U.S. Pat. No. 3,707,771 teaches a spray-on composition for detecting dental occlusions by providing a film on the teeth which is ruptured where pressure is applied.","U.S. Pat. No. 4,512,741 teaches \u201cDental indicating Paste and Method of Use\u201d for fitting dentures or the like.","U.S. Pat. No. 3,992,515 issued 1976 teaches a \u201cComposition for indicating and method of Removing Dental Undercuts and the Like\u201d utilizing a colored composition applied to the teeth. See particularly Column 3, lines 14\u201336, wherein the composition of the present invention may be applied to a occlusal surface of a restoration and \u201chaving the patient bite into centric occlusion and follow with lateral and protrusive movements . . . \u201d so as to \u201cpressure trace the dental indicator composition and indicate where to correct any imbalance of tooth movement excursion\u201d","U.S. Pat. No. 3,028,338 use of fluorescent dye for detecting surface discontinuities.","Regarding the alternative embodiment of the present invention incorporating the utilization of rupturable spheres, U.S. Pat. No. 3,918,160 issued 1975 and teaches the use of pressure sensitive coatings comprising \u201cdispersed cells\u201d applied to teeth, wherein the cells would rupture due to occlusal pressure, producing colored indicia.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,395,239 an \u201cOcclusion Pressure Detecting Sheet\u201d incorporating color containing capsules (14).","U.S. Pat. No. 3,469,439 entitled \u201cMeans for Measuring Distributed Forces using Micro capsules\u201d teaches the concept of utilizing rupturable cells to indicate pressure points.","Thus, while the prior art teaches various marking compositions for dental applications, none apparently provide a system utilizing the viscosity and\/or light transmissivity properties of a colored gel for suitably discerning orientation, degree, and shape of pressure points, high points, occlusions, spaces, and the like through a transparent or translucent aligner mouthpiece.","The present invention provides a system for discerning the orientation, degree, and shape of pressure points, high points, occlusions, spaces, and the like through a transparent or translucent mouthpiece-type aligner in a relatively low cost and reliable manner.","In the present invention, a viscous, colored gel material such as, for example, CREST brand gel toothpaste is placed in a mouthpiece-type aligner, and the aligner mounted about the teeth of the patent. The user is then able to view through the mouthpiece the enveloped teeth with the gel dispersed therebetween.","The viscosity and light transmissivity of the gel provides a means to discern space between the teeth and the inner wall of the mouthpiece, both on the labial and lingual sides. Where teeth directly contact the inner wall of the aligner, the color from the gel is lighter or otherwise minimal, and the more space separating the teeth and inner wall of the aligner, the darker the color observed.","It is therefore possible for the user to observe pressure points, and further observe the configuration of the pressure points, degree of pressure, and orientation or occlusion of the teeth forming those pressure points vis a vis the aligner, as these features are highlighted due to their contact with the inner wall of the aligner.","With this information, the user is able to diagnose progress on an aligner in use, including whether a tooth is responding to bias associated with the aligner and, if so, the degree of that response, or if there has been over-correction, under-correction, or mal-correction.","Further, the present technique is easily photographable, providing a means of preserving a record of the position of the patient's teeth during the treatment protocol, for archival and treatment purposes.","It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a pressure indicator system for use with transparent or translucent mouthpiece-type aligners.","It is another object of the present invention to provide a system for diagnosing progress of response in teeth during correction utilizing mouthpiece-type aligners.","It is another object of the present invention to provide a method of aligning teeth utilizing a mouthpiece-type aligner and a pressure indicator gel.","It is another object of the present invention to provide a pressure indicator paste formulated to provide optimal pressure indication when used in conjunction with a light transmissive, mouthpiece-type aligner.","It is still another object of the present invention to provide a means of indicating the position of a patient's teeth vis-\u00e0-vis an aligner during an orthodontic treatment, which is photographable and easily discerned via photographic evidence.","Lastly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a method and system for diagnosing fit of a light transmissive dental appliance utilizing a pressure indicator gel composition.","Continuing with , , and  of the drawings, the system of the present invention is intended to be utilized with a clear or translucent mouthpiece aligner a, which may be custom configured to the patent's mouth for an orthodontic straightening of the teeth or other procedure.","As shown, an aligner a typically may include front  and rear  walls each having interior , \u2032 and exterior sides , \u2032, the walls having a space therebetween forming a cavity .","A gel G solution is applied  via a tube  or other means to the cavity  of the aligner in an amount sufficient to fill the space  between each tooth and aligner in the area to be observed. In this regard, the gel may be applied to an interior side of the front and\/or rear walls at a particular area to be observed, or may be uniformly applied to the bottom of the cavity in an amount sufficient to engage the interior walls of the aligner once it is applied to the teeth of the patient.","Preferably, the gel G of the present system is colored, having a light transmissivity similar to other gel toothpastes such as, for example, CREST brand gel toothpaste or CREST FOR KIDS brand gel toothpaste (the specifications of which are incorporated herein by reference), and a viscosity range of about between, for example, 20,000\u201380,000 centipoise, and an exemplary viscosity in the preferred embodiment of about 37,000 centipoise, +\/\u22122000 centipoise. The viscosity is important as it allows the gel to remain in place, while easily being displaced with appropriate pressure.","The light transmissivity can also be a factor as a thin layer of gel will have a lesser color density compared to a thicker layer of gel, resulting in an appearance of a lighter color compared to a darker color, respectively.","Ideally, the color of the gel is a darker one such as navy blue, dark green or other dark color, which appears to provide better contrast when viewed through the clear mouthpiece with the teeth of the patient (which typically is of a lighter color) providing the reflective background.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["9","10","13","13","12","11","14"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["15","16","17"]},"Continuing with , the aligner A, having had gel G dispensed therein, is applied to the teeth of the wearer, revealing a generally uniform color for most of the teeth, yet also revealing an mis-aligned incisor tooth  via pressure point  visually indicated as a light color area , indicating forward protrusion on one frontal side edge of the tooth, as well as a dark colored area  indicating an opposing rearward protrusion (in the form of a gap or spacing between said area and the aligner) on the distal side edge of the tooth. Thus, the user may discern that the tooth is in need of an axial correction. Further, the user may utilize this information to approximate the extent of correction required, as well as monitoring progress of said correction.","Utilizing this information, the user may remove the aligner A, and utilize pliers or other tool to form , \u2032 pressure deformations , \u2032 in the aligner a to selectively apply pressure to the opposing sides , \u2032 and edges of the tooth, so as to urge the tooth in axial correction , until there is provided a straightened tooth  having desired, generally uniform spacing  in relation to the aligner.","Further, during this procedure, the user may monitor the degree of axial rotation or other correction utilizing the pressure deformations via the application of gel to the aligner being utilized and applying the mouthpiece with gel to the user. The user may then observe color differentials of the gel through the aligner, thereby indicating differences in spacing of the teeth from the mouthpiece, indicating pressure points and gaps, and allowing the user to estimate the degree of same and overall progress and\/or further required corrections.","It is anticipated that, during application of the pressure deformations to the indicated pressure points on the mis-aligned tooth, the indicated light colored area on the aligner will decrease in size and area as the tooth corrects in response to the pressure deformations application of pressure, until such point as the mis-aligned tooth becomes aligned, at which point there should be nominal color differential in the area of the tooth when compared to the other, aligned teeth.","Exemplary specifications for the gel utilized in this procedure are as follows: Viscosity (centipoise) 37000 +\/\u22122000 cP at a shear rate of 30 sec-1, although it is anticipated that the present system could work with a gel having a range of between about 20,000\u201380,000 centipoise.","Referring to , a patient has applied thereto a clear aligner A having gel G applied therein, which, when observed, shows a contact area in the form of a clearly discernable lightened area designating contact of the upper right, right central incisor with the interior of the aligner.
