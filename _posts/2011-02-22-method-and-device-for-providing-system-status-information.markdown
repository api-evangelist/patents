No. 61\/387,513 filed on Sep. 29, 2010 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The present disclosure relates generally to application managers and, more particularly to methods and systems for providing system status information for communication devices.","Communication devices and other electronic devices may occasionally exhibit poor operating performance. The operating performance of such devices may, for example, be affected by the system status of the device, such as, for example, the memory usage of applications or processes currently running on the device, etc. In other circumstances, the operating performance of such devices may be affected by manufacturing or software defects on the device.","When electronic devices experience degraded performance, it may be difficult for a user to troubleshoot in order to resolve the problem.","Like reference numerals are used in the drawings to denote like elements and features.","In one aspect, the present application provides a method comprising: receiving, from an input mechanism associated with a communication device, a request to share system status information; and in response to receiving the request to share the system status information: (i) obtaining system status information associated with the communication device; and (ii) automatically populating one or more portions of an electronic message based on the system status information. The system status information comprises processor usage information.","In another aspect, the present application provides a communication device comprising at least one processor and at least one memory storing computer executable instructions. The computer executable instructions are configured to cause the at least one processor to: receive, from an input mechanism associated with a communication device, a request to share system status information; and in response to receiving the request to share the system status information: (i) obtain system status information associated with the communication device; and (ii) automatically populate one or more portions of an electronic message based on the system status information. Other aspects of the present application will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art from a review of the following detailed description in conjunction with the drawings. The system status information comprises processor usage information.","Embodiments of the present application are not limited to any particular operating system, mobile device architecture, server architecture, or computer programming language.","The present application describes, among other things, an electronic device having a system status information module which allows a user of the device to share system status information regarding the electronic device via an electronic message.","The electronic device may, in some embodiments, be a mobile wireless device having mobile communication capabilities such as, for example, data communication capabilities. However, depending on the functionality of the device, in various embodiments, the device may be a mobile wireless device, a data communication device, a multiple-mode communication device configured for both data and voice communication, a smartphone, a mobile telephone or a PDA (personal digital assistant) enabled for wireless communication, or a computer system with a wireless modem. In embodiments in which the electronic device is enabled for communication, the device may be referred to as a communication device.","Accordingly, the device  () may, in various instances throughout this disclosure, be referred to as a mobile device , a communication device , a mobile communication device , or an electronic device .","System Overview","In order to facilitate an understanding of one possible environment in which example embodiments described herein can operate, reference is first made to  which shows in block diagram form a communication system  in which example embodiments of the present disclosure can be applied. The communication system  includes a number of mobile communication devices  which may be connected to the remainder of the system  in any of several different ways. Accordingly, several instances of mobile communication devices  are depicted in  employing different example ways of connecting to the system . Mobile communication devices  are connected to a wireless network  which may include one or more of a Wireless Wide Area Network (WWAN)  and a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)  or other suitable network arrangements. In some example embodiments, the mobile communication devices  are configured to communicate over both the WWAN  and WLAN , and to roam between these networks. In some example embodiments, the wireless network  may include multiple WWANs  and WLANs .","The WWAN  may be implemented as any suitable wireless access network technology. By way of example, but not limitation, the WWAN  may be implemented as a wireless network that includes a number of transceiver base stations  (one of which is shown in ) where each of the base stations  provides wireless Radio Frequency (RF) coverage to a corresponding area or cell. The WWAN  is typically operated by a mobile network service provider that provides subscription packages to users of the mobile communication devices . In some example embodiments, the WWAN  conforms to one or more of the following wireless network types: Mobitex Radio Network, DataTAC, GSM (Global System for Mobile Communication), GPRS (General Packet Radio System), TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access), CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access), CDPD (Cellular Digital Packet Data), iDEN (integrated Digital Enhanced Network), EvDO (Evolution-Data Optimized) CDMA1010, EDGE (Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution), UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunication Systems), HSPDA (High-Speed Downlink Packet Access), IEEE 802.16e (also referred to as Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access or \u201cWiMAX), or various other networks. Although WWAN  is described as a \u201cWide-Area\u201d network, that term is intended herein also to incorporate wireless Metropolitan Area Networks (WMAN) and other similar technologies for providing coordinated service wirelessly over an area larger than that covered by typical WLANs.","The WWAN  may further include a wireless network gateway  which connects the mobile communication devices  to transport facilities , and through the transport facilities  to a wireless connector system . Transport facilities may include one or more private networks or lines, the public Internet, a virtual private network, or any other suitable network. The wireless connector system  may be operated, for example, by an organization or enterprise such as a corporation, university, or governmental department, which allows access to a network  such as an internal or enterprise network and its resources, or the wireless connector system  may be operated by a mobile network provider. In some example embodiments, the network  may be realized using the Internet rather than an internal or enterprise network.","The wireless network gateway  provides an interface between the wireless connector system  and the WWAN , which facilitates communication between the mobile communication devices  and other devices (not shown) connected, directly or indirectly, to the WWAN . Accordingly, communications sent via the mobile communication devices  are transported via the WWAN  and the wireless network gateway  through transport facilities  to the wireless connector system . Communications sent from the wireless connector system  are received by the wireless network gateway  and transported via the WWAN  to the mobile communication devices .","The WLAN  includes a wireless network which, in some example embodiments, conforms to IEEE 802.11x standards (sometimes referred to as Wi-Fi) such as, for example, the IEEE 802.11a, 802.11b and\/or 802.11g standard. Other communication protocols may be used for the WLAN  in other example embodiments such as, for example, IEEE 802.11n, IEEE 802.16e (also referred to as Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access or \u201cWiMAX\u201d), or IEEE 802.20 (also referred to as Mobile Wireless Broadband Access). The WLAN  includes one or more wireless RF Access Points (AP)  (one of which is shown in ) that collectively provide a WLAN coverage area.","The WLAN  may be a personal network of the user, an enterprise network, or a hotspot offered by an Internet service provider (ISP), a mobile network provider, or a property owner in a public or semi-public area, for example. The access points  are connected to an access point (AP) interface  which may connect to the wireless connector system  directly (for example, if the access point  is part of an enterprise WLAN  in which the wireless connector system  resides), or indirectly via the transport facilities  if the access point  is a personal Wi-Fi network or Wi-Fi hotspot (in which case a mechanism for securely connecting to the wireless connector system , such as a virtual private network (VPN), may be used). The AP interface  provides translation and routing services between the access points  and the wireless connector system  to facilitate communication, directly or indirectly, with the wireless connector system .","The wireless connector system  may be implemented as one or more servers, and is typically located behind a firewall . The wireless connector system  manages communications, including email communications, to and from a set of managed mobile communication devices . The wireless connector system  also provides administrative control and management capabilities over users and mobile communication devices  which may connect to the wireless connector system .","The wireless connector system  allows the mobile communication devices  to access the network  and connected resources and services such as a messaging server  (for example, a Microsoft Exchange\u2122, IBM Lotus Domino\u2122, or Novell GroupWise\u2122 email server), and a content server  for providing content such as Internet content or content from an organization's internal servers, and application servers  for implementing server-based applications such as instant messaging (IM) applications to mobile communication devices .","The wireless connector system  typically provides a secure exchange of data (e.g., email messages, personal information manager (PIM) data, and IM data) with the mobile communication devices . In some example embodiments, communications between the wireless connector system  and the mobile communication devices  are encrypted. In some example embodiments, communications are encrypted using a symmetric encryption key implemented using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) or Triple Data Encryption Standard (Triple DES) encryption. Private encryption keys are generated in a secure, two-way authenticated environment and are used for both encryption and decryption of data. In some example embodiments, the private encryption key is stored only in the user's mailbox on the messaging server  and on the mobile communication device , and can typically be regenerated by the user on mobile communication devices . Data sent to the mobile communication devices  is encrypted by the wireless connector system  using the private encryption key retrieved from the user's mailbox. The encrypted data, when received on the mobile communication devices , is decrypted using the private encryption key stored in memory. Similarly, data sent to the wireless connector system  from the mobile communication devices  is encrypted using the private encryption key stored in the memory of the mobile communication device . The encrypted data, when received on the wireless connector system , is decrypted using the private encryption key retrieved from the user's mailbox.","The wireless network gateway  is adapted to send data packets received from the mobile communication device  over the WWAN  to the wireless connector system . The wireless connector system  then sends the data packets to the appropriate connection point such as the messaging server , content server , or application server . Conversely, the wireless connector system  sends data packets received, for example, from the messaging server , content server , or application server  to the wireless network gateway  which then transmit the data packets to the destination mobile communication device . The AP interfaces  of the WLAN  provide similar sending functions between the mobile communication device , the wireless connector system  and network connection point such as the messaging server , content server , and application server .","The network  may include a private local area network, metropolitan area network, wide area network, the public Internet or combinations thereof and may include virtual networks constructed using any of these, alone, or in combination.","A link  may be provided for exchanging information between the mobile communication device  and a host computer  connected to a network , such as the Internet. The link  may include one or both of a physical interface and short-range wireless communication interface. The physical interface may include one or combinations of an Ethernet connection, Universal Serial Bus (USB) connection, Firewire\u2122 (also known as an IEEE 1394 interface) connection, or other serial data connection, via respective ports or interfaces of the mobile communication device  and host computer . In at least one embodiment, the link  is a USB connection to the mobile communication device .","It will be appreciated that the above-described communication system is provided for the purpose of illustration only, and that the above-described communication system includes one possible communication network configuration of a multitude of possible configurations for use with the mobile communication devices . The teachings of the present disclosure may be employed in connection with other types of networks and associated devices that are effective in implementing or facilitating wireless communication. Suitable variations of the communication system will be understood to a person of skill in the art and are intended to fall within the scope of the present disclosure.","Example Mobile Communication Device","Reference is now made to  which illustrates a block diagram of a mobile device  in which example embodiments described in the present disclosure can be applied. In the embodiment shown, the mobile device  is a two-way mobile communication device having data and possibly also voice communication capabilities, and the capability to communicate with other computer systems, for example, via the Internet. Depending on the functionality provided by the mobile device , in various embodiments the device  may be a data communication device, a multiple-mode communication device configured for both data and voice communication, a smartphone, a mobile telephone or a PDA (personal digital assistant) enabled for wireless communication, or a computer system with a wireless modem. It will be appreciated that, in some embodiments, the systems and methods presented herein may be applied to an electronic device that does not, necessarily, have communication capabilities; such as, for example a PDA or GPS which is not enabled for communication.","The mobile device  includes at least one controller comprising at least one processor  such as a microprocessor which controls the overall operation of the mobile device , and a wireless communication subsystem  for exchanging radio frequency signals with a wireless network . The processor  interacts with the communication subsystem  which performs communication functions. The processor  interacts with additional device subsystems. In some embodiments, the device  may include a touchscreen display  which includes a display (screen) , such as a liquid crystal display (LCD) screen, with a touch-sensitive input surface or overlay  connected to an electronic controller . The touch-sensitive overlay  and the electronic controller  provide a touch-sensitive input device and the processor  interacts with the touch-sensitive overlay  via the electronic controller . The touch-sensitive overlay  acts as an input mechanism , allowing the user of the device  to input commands to the processor .","In some embodiments, the device  may include other input mechanisms  instead of or in addition to the touchscreen. The other input mechanisms  may include, for example, a depressible scroll wheel (which may also be referred to as a trackball), a touch-pad such as an optical touchpad, an optical jog ball, and\/or a physical keyboard.","It will be appreciated that the specific input mechanisms  associated with the device  will vary from device-to-device. That is, some devices  may have a first input mechanism  or first set of input mechanisms , while other devices  may have a second input mechanism  or second set of input mechanisms .","The processor  interacts with additional device subsystems including flash memory , random access memory (RAM) , read only memory (ROM) , auxiliary input\/output (I\/O) subsystems , data port  (which may be a serial data port, such as a Universal Serial Bus (USB) data port), speaker , microphone , input mechanisms , switch , short-range communication subsystem , and other device subsystems generally designated as . Some of the subsystems shown in  perform communication-related functions, whereas other subsystems may provide \u201cresident\u201d or on-device functions.","The communication subsystem  includes a receiver , a transmitter , and associated components, such as one or more antenna elements  and , local oscillators (LOs) , and a processing module such as a digital signal processor (DSP) . The antenna elements  and  may be embedded or internal to the mobile device  and a single antenna may be shared by both receiver and transmitter, as is known in the art. As will be apparent to those skilled in the field of communication, the particular design of the communication subsystem  depends on the wireless network  in which the mobile device  is intended to operate.","The mobile device  may communicate with any one of a plurality of fixed transceiver base stations (not shown) of the wireless network  within its geographic coverage area. The mobile device  may send and receive communication signals over the wireless network  after a network registration or activation procedures have been completed. Signals received by the antenna  through the wireless network  are input to the receiver , which may perform such common receiver functions as signal amplification, frequency down conversion, filtering, channel selection, etc., as well as analog-to-digital (A\/D) conversion. A\/D conversion of a received signal allows more complex communication functions such as demodulation and decoding to be performed in the DSP . In a similar manner, signals to be transmitted are processed, including modulation and encoding, for example, by the DSP . These DSP-processed signals are input to the transmitter  for digital-to-analog (D\/A) conversion, frequency up conversion, filtering, amplification, and transmission to the wireless network  via the antenna . The DSP  not only processes communication signals, but may also provides for receiver and transmitter control. For example, the gains applied to communication signals in the receiver  and the transmitter  may be adaptively controlled through automatic gain control algorithms implemented in the DSP .","The processor  operates under stored program control and executes software modules  stored in memory such as persistent memory; for example, in the flash memory . As illustrated in , the software modules  comprise operating system software  and applications .","The applications  include one or more electronic messaging application  and may also include other applications (not shown). The electronic messaging application  may be an email application. The email application may, in some example embodiments, be referred to as an email client or an email reader. The email application may, in various example embodiments, permit users of the communication device  to view email messages, forward email messages, reply to email messages, compose email messages, and send email messages through the wireless network  to message recipients.","In at least some embodiments, the electronic messaging application  includes an application programming interface (API)  which is configured to allow other applications  to access features of the electronic messaging application . The API  allows the operating system  and\/or other applications  to integrate features provided by the electronic messaging application  into the operating system  and\/or the other applications . The API  is, in at least some embodiments, configured to receive instructions from other applications to populate at least a portion of an electronic message with specified data. For example, in at least some embodiments, the API  may be configured to receive a command from the operating system  or another application  to insert specified data, such as text data into a message body of an email message. The command may specify the data to be inserted. In response to receiving such a command, the API  may cause the specified data to be added to the message body of an email message. That is, the API  may populate the message body with the specified data (such as text data).","The API  may be configured to receive other commands and to execute operations associated with such other commands. For example, the API  may be configured to receive a command from the operating system  and\/or other applications  to populate a subject field of an electronic message with specified text and to, in response, populate the subject field with the specified text. In some embodiments, the API  may be configured to receive a command from the operating system  and\/or other applications  to populate an address field with a specified messaging address.

That is, the system resource usage information quantifies usage of one or more system resources on the communications device. The system resources are a part of the device  which may be used by a computer program, such as an application or process.","The system status information may, in at least some example embodiments, quantify the amount of memory resources (such as the flash memory  (), and\/or RAM  () and\/or ROM  () and\/or storage memory  ()) which is currently used and\/or available. The amount of memory resources used or available may be quantified in absolute or relative terms. For example, in some embodiments, the amount of memory resources may be quantified in terms of the total amount of memory used. For example, the amount of memory used or available may be quantified in terms of bytes used. In some example embodiments, the amount of memory used or available may be quantified in terms of the amount of memory available. For example, the amount of memory available may be quantified in terms of bytes available. In some example embodiments, the amount of memory used may be quantified in terms of the amount of memory available relative to the total amount of memory.

For example, in some embodiments, the system status information module  is a separate stand-alone application . Similarly, while  shows an example embodiment in which the application manager application  is included in the operating system , in other embodiments, the application manager application  may be a separate application , such as a stand-alone application.","It will also be appreciated that the software modules  may include other applications , such as, for example, a mapping or navigation application, an Internet browser application, an address book application, a calendar application, a notepad application, a voice communication application, and\/or a media player application. The software modules  may also include other applications apart from those specifically discussed herein. In some embodiments, the applications  may include layout information defining the placement of particular fields and graphic elements (e.g. text fields, input fields, icons, etc.) in the user interface (i.e. the display device ).","Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the software modules  or parts thereof may be temporarily loaded into volatile memory such as the RAM . The RAM  is used for storing runtime data variables and other types of data or information, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art.

The mobile device  may comprise other wireless communication interfaces for communicating with other types of wireless networks: for example, a wireless network such as an orthogonal frequency division multiplexed (OFDM) network. The auxiliary I\/O subsystems  may comprise a vibrator for providing vibratory notifications in response to various events on the mobile device  such as receipt of a wireless communication or incoming phone call, or for other purposes such as haptic feedback (touch feedback).","The mobile device  also includes a storage memory . The storage memory may, in various example embodiments, be comprised of a removable memory card (typically comprising flash memory), such as, for example, a Secure Digital (SD), mini Secure Digital (miniSD), micro Secure Digital (microSD), or CompactFlash\u2122 card. In some embodiments, the storage memory  may be comprised of an internal (non-removable) memory which is designated by the operating system as storage memory. For example, the storage memory  may be e-MMC\u2122 memory. The storage memory  is inserted in or connected to a storage memory interface  of the mobile device .","The data port  may be used for synchronization with a user's host computer system  (). The data port  enables a user to set preferences through an external device or software application and extends the capabilities of the mobile device  by providing for information or software downloads to the mobile device  other than through the wireless network . The alternate download path may, for example, be used to load an encryption key onto the mobile device  through a direct, reliable and trusted connection to thereby provide secure device communication.","The mobile device  also includes a battery  as a power source, which is typically one or more rechargeable batteries that may be charged, for example, through charging circuitry coupled to a battery interface such as the data port . The battery  provides electrical power to at least some of the electrical circuitry in the mobile device , and a battery interface  provides a mechanical and electrical connection for the battery . The battery interface  is coupled to a regulator (not shown) which provides power V+ to the circuitry of the mobile device .","The short-range communication subsystem  is an additional optional component which provides for communication between the mobile device  and different systems or devices, which need not necessarily be similar devices. For example, the subsystem  may include an infrared device and associated circuits and components, or a wireless bus protocol compliant communication mechanism such as a Bluetooth\u00ae communication module to provide for communication with similarly-enabled systems and devices.","A predetermined set of applications that control basic device operations, including data and possibly voice communication applications will normally be installed on the mobile device  during or after manufacture. Additional applications and\/or upgrades to the operating system  or software applications  may also be loaded onto the mobile device  through the wireless network , the auxiliary I\/O subsystem , the serial port , the short-range communication subsystem , or other suitable subsystem  other wireless communication interfaces. The downloaded programs or code modules may be permanently installed, for example, written into the application memory  (i.e. the flash memory ), or written into and executed from the RAM  for execution by the processor  at runtime.","The mobile device  may, in some example embodiments, provide two principal modes of communication: a data communication mode and a voice communication mode. In the data communication mode, a received data signal such as a text message, an email message, or Web page download will be processed by the communication subsystem  and input to the processor  for further processing. For example, a downloaded Web page may be further processed by a browser application or an email message may be processed by an email message application and output to the display . A user of the mobile device  may also compose data items, such as email messages, for example, using the touch-sensitive overlay  in conjunction with the display device  and possibly the input mechanism  and\/or the auxiliary I\/O subsystems . These composed items may be transmitted through the communication subsystem  over the wireless network .","In the voice communication mode, the mobile device  provides telephony functions and operates as a typical cellular phone. The overall operation is similar, except that the received signals would be output to the speaker  and signals for transmission would be generated by a transducer such as the microphone . The telephony functions are provided by a combination of software\/firmware (i.e., the voice communication module) and hardware (i.e., the microphone , the speaker  and input devices). Alternative voice or audio I\/O subsystems, such as a voice message recording subsystem, may also be implemented on the mobile wireless device . Although voice or audio signal output is typically accomplished primarily through the speaker , the display device  may also be used to provide an indication of the identity of a calling party, duration of a voice call, or other voice call related information.","System Status Information Screen","In at least some embodiments, the system status information module  may be configured to display a system status information screen which identifies system status information and\/or which provides a user selectable interface element, such as an icon or command button, which permits a user to input a request to share system information.","Referring now to , an example system status information screen  is illustrated.
