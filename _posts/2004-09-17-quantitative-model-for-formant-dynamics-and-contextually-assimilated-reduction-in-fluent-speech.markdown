title: Quantitative model for formant dynamics and contextually assimilated reduction in fluent speech
abstract: A method of identifying a sequence of formant trajectory values is provided in which a sequence of target values are identified for a formant as step functions. The target values and the duration for each segment target for the formant are applied to a finite impulse response filter to form a sequence of formant trajectory values. The parameters of this filter, as well as the duration of the targets for each phone, can be modified to produce many kinds of target undershooting effects in a contextually assimilated manner. The procedure for producing the formant trajectory values does not require any acoustic data from speech.

In particular, the present invention relates to formant models of fluent speech.","Human speech contains spectral promanances or formants. These formants carry a significant amount of the information contained in human speech.","In the past, attempts have been made to model the formants associated with particular phonetic units, such as phonemes, using discrete state models such as a Hidden Markov Model. Such models have been less than ideal, however, because they do not perform well when the speaking rate increases or the articulation of the speaker decreases.","Research into the behavior of formants during speech indicates that one possible reason for the failure of HMM based formant systems in handling fluent speech is that during fluent speech the formant values for different classes of phonetic units become very similar as the speaking rate increases or the articulation effort decreases.","Although this phenomenon, known as reduction, has been observed in human speech, an adequate model for predicting such behavior in formant tracks has not been developed. As such, a model is needed that predicts the observed dynamic patterns of the formants based on the interaction between phonetic context, speaking rate, and speaking style.","A method of identifying a sequence of formant trajectory values is provided in which a sequence of target values of formant frequencies and bandwidths are established first, which may or may not be reached by actual formants in the trajectories. The target values for the formant are applied to a finite impulse response filter to form a sequence of formant trajectory values.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","100","100"]},"The invention is operational with numerous other general purpose or special purpose computing system environments or configurations.

In addition, other input\/output devices may be attached to or found with mobile device  within the scope of the present invention.","In the past, the failure of Hidden Markov Models to perform well on speech signals with high speaking rates or with low speaking effort has often been attributed to a lack of training data for these types of speech. The present inventors, however, have discovered that it is likely that even with more training data for these types of speech, Hidden Markov Models will still not be able to recognize speech with the desired amount of accuracy. The reason for this is that at high speaking rates the formant patterns for different vowel sounds begin to converge if only discrete portions of the speech signal are examined when making a recognition decision.","This convergence of the formant values for different vowel sounds is referred to as static confusion.  provides a diagram showing that as the speaking rate increases, formants for two different vowel sounds begin to converge. In particular, in , the speaking rate is shown on horizontal axis  and the frequency of the first and second formants is shown on vertical axis . In  speaking rate increases from left to right and frequency increases from the bottom to the top. The value of the first formant and the second formant for the vowel sound \/a\/ are shown by lines  and , respectively. The values of the first and second formant for the vowel sound \/e\/ are shown by lines  and , respectively.","As can be seen in , the first and second formants for the vowel sounds \/a\/ and \/e\/ are much more separated at lower speaking rates than at higher speaking rates. Because of this, at higher speaking rates, it is more difficult for the speech recognition system to distinguish between the \/a\/ sound and the \/e\/ sound.","The present invention provides a model for formants, which accurately predicts the static confusion represented by the data of . This model is a result of an interaction between phonetic context, speaking rate\/duration, and spectral rate of changes related to the speaking style.","Under the model, a sequence of formant targets, modeled as step functions, are passed through a finite impulse response (FIR) filter to produce a smooth continuous formant pattern.","The FIR filter is characterized by the following non-causal impulse response function:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":["h","s"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"k"}},{"mo":"{","mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":"C","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msubsup":{"mi":"\u03b3","mrow":[{"mi":"s","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"k"}},{"mo":"-","mi":"k"}]}}},{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mo":"-","mi":"D"},"mo":["<","<"],"mi":"k","mn":"0"}}]},{"mtd":[{"mi":"C"},{"mrow":{"mi":"k","mo":"=","mn":"0"}}]},{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":"C","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msubsup":{"mi":["\u03b3","k"],"mrow":{"mi":"s","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"k"}}}}},{"mrow":{"mn":"0","mo":["<","<"],"mi":["k","D"]}}]}]}}],"mo":"\u2062"}},{"mrow":{"mi":"EQ","mo":[".","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mn":"1"}}]}}}},"br":{},"sub":["s(k) ","s(k) "]},"In equation 1, k=0 represents a current time point, k less than zero represents past time points, and k greater than zero represents future time points.","Thus, in the impulse response of Equation 1, it is assumed for simplicity that the impulse response is symmetric such that the extent of coarticulation in the forward direction is equal to the extent of coarticulation in the backward direction.
