No. 11\/421,832 filed Jun. 2, 2006, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.","The present patent document relates generally to an approach to email message creation which is of particular use on a wirelessly connected handheld device.","A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material which is subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by any one of the patent document or patent disclosure, as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.","Handheld devices such as Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), cellular phones, portable computing devices and other two-way data and\/or voice communication devices are increasing in popularity as they have become more feature-rich at an ever decreasing cost to the consumer. In particular, handheld devices that allow both voice and data communication are almost indispensable tools in certain businesses and government agencies. The need to maintain electronic mail communication is one critical factor driving the demand for handheld communication devices. Popular handheld devices include those supplied by Research In Motion Ltd. of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.","Some applications running on handheld devices may be cumbersome to use. This is partly due to the limitations of the hardware although user interface design also plays a part.","Advantageously, a better user interface would make handheld devices more convenient and enjoyable to use.","A handheld device and method for composing an email message to be sent over a wireless network environment is disclosed. In a method of operating a wireless handheld device, upon receipt of a user request to compose an email, an email composition screen is displayed with a field indicating an email service to be used. Then, upon a user request launched from this email composition screen, a list of all available email services is displayed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","200","100","102","104","106","110","200","104","102","114","104","200"]},"A radio frequency (RF) base station  provides a communication link between WAN , which may be the public Internet, and a communications network , which may be a wireless network. Handheld device  accesses data from server  or desktop computer  through the communications network  and WAN . In some network architectures, a firewall may be implemented between WAN  and server computer  to gate access to LAN,  which may be a corporate LAN.","Handheld device  is loaded with email client software that accesses email messages, stored in mail server software such as Microsoft Exchange or Lotus Domino software, running on server . To facilitate data access by handheld device , server  may be loaded with specialized software to provide compression, encryption and a data interface with the mail server software.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","200","214","226","228","214","226","228","226","200","214"]},"The housing may be elongated vertically, or may take on other sizes and shapes (including clamshell housing structures). The keyboard may include a mode selection key, or other hardware or software for switching between text entry and telephony entry.","In addition to the microprocessor , other parts of the handheld device  are shown schematically in . These include: a communications subsystem ; a short-range communications subsystem ; the keyboard  and the display , along with a trackwheel (or trackball)  and other auxiliary input\/output devices , a serial port , a speaker  and a microphone ; as well as memory devices including a flash memory  and a random access memory (RAM) ; and various other device subsystems . As is known, trackwheel  may be rotated to provide scrolling and pressed to allow selection. The handheld device  has a battery  to power the active elements of the handheld device . The handheld device  is preferably a two-way radio frequency (RF) communication device having voice and\/or data communication capabilities. In addition, the handheld device  may have the capability to communicate with other computer systems via the Internet.","Operating system software executed by the microprocessor  is preferably stored in a persistent store, such as the flash memory , but may be stored in other types of memory devices, such as a read only memory (ROM) or similar storage element. In addition, system software, specific device applications, or parts thereof, may be temporarily loaded into a volatile store, such as the RAM . Communication signals received by the handheld device may also be stored to the RAM .","The microprocessor , in addition to its operating system functions, enables execution of software applications on the handheld device . A predetermined set of software applications that control basic device operations, such as a voice communications module A and a data communications module B, are installed on the handheld device  during manufacture. The data communications module B allows the handling of email messages. In addition, a personal information manager (PIM) application module C is also installed on the handheld device  during manufacture. The PIM application is capable of organizing and managing data items, such as e-mail, calendar events, voice mails, appointments, and task items. The PIM application is also capable of sending and receiving data items via wireless network . The data items managed by the PIM application are seamlessly integrated, synchronized and updated via the wireless network with the device user's corresponding data items stored or associated with a host computer system. As well, additional software modules, illustrated as other software modules N, may be installed during manufacture.","Communication functions, including data and voice communications, are performed through the communication subsystem , and possibly through the short-range communications subsystem . The communication subsystem  includes a receiver , a transmitter  and one or more antennas, illustrated as a receive antenna  and a transmit antenna . In addition, the communication subsystem  also includes a processing module, such as a digital signal processor (DSP) , and local oscillators (LOs) . The specific design and implementation of the communication subsystem  is dependent upon the communication network in which the handheld device  is intended to operate. For example, the communication subsystem  of the handheld device  may be designed to operate with the Mobitex\u2122, DataTAC\u2122 or General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) mobile data communication networks and also designed to operate with any of a variety of voice communication networks, such as Advanced Mobile Phone Service (AMPS), Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), Code Division Multiple Access CDMA, Personal Communications Service (PCS), Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), etc. Other types of data and voice networks, both separate and integrated, may also be utilized with the handheld device .","Network access requirements vary depending upon the type of communication system. For example, in the Mobitex\u2122 and DataTAC\u2122 networks, handheld devices are registered on the network using a unique Personal Identification Number (PIN) associated with each device. In GPRS networks, however, network access is associated with a subscriber or user of a device. A GPRS device therefore requires a subscriber identity module, commonly referred to as a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card, in order to operate on a GPRS network.","When required network registration or activation procedures have been completed, the handheld device  may send and receive communication signals over the communication network . Signals received from the communication network  by the receive antenna  are routed to the receiver , which provides for signal amplification, frequency down conversion, filtering, channel selection, etc., and may also provide analog to digital conversion. Analog-to-digital conversion of the received signal allows the DSP  to perform more complex communication functions, such as demodulation and decoding. In a similar manner, signals to be transmitted to the network  are processed (e.g., modulated and encoded) by the DSP  and are then provided to the transmitter  for digital to analog conversion, frequency up conversion, filtering, amplification and transmission to the communication network  (or networks) via the transmit antenna .","In addition to processing communication signals, the DSP  provides for control of the receiver  and the transmitter . For example, gains applied to communication signals in the receiver  and the transmitter  may be adaptively controlled through automatic gain control algorithms implemented in the DSP .","In a data communication mode, a received signal, such as a text message or web page download, is processed by the communication subsystem  and is input to the microprocessor . The received signal is then further processed by the microprocessor  for an output to the display , or alternatively to some other auxiliary I\/O devices . A device user may also compose data items, such as e-mail messages, using the keyboard , a trackwheel  (as for example a thumbwheel) and\/or some other auxiliary I\/O device , such as a touchpad, a rocker switch, or some other type of input device. The composed data items may then be transmitted over the communication network  via the communication subsystem .","In a voice communication mode, overall operation of the device is substantially similar to the data communication mode, except that received signals are output to a speaker , and signals for transmission are generated by a microphone . Alternative voice or audio I\/O subsystems, such as a voice message recording subsystem, may also be implemented on the device . In addition, the display  may also be utilized in voice communication mode, for example, to display the identity of a calling party, the duration of a voice call, or other voice call related information.","The short-range communications subsystem  enables communication between the handheld device  and other proximate systems or devices, which need not necessarily be similar devices. For example, the short-range communications subsystem may include an infrared device and associated circuits and components, or a Bluetooth\u2122 communication module to provide for communication with similarly-enabled systems and devices.","Handheld device , when operating under the control of known software and device code (firmware), may be used to compose an electronic mail message to a recipient in the manner illustrated in . Variations in the sequence of actions, such as the use of keyboard keys instead of the trackwheel , or the optional use of popup menus to alter the sequence of user interface screens, are possible.","With reference to  along with , startup screen  () of a known email application running on the handheld device  includes icons  which are allocated labels, for example, \u2018Messages\u2019, \u2018Address book\u2019, \u2018Calendar\u2019, \u2018Compose\u2019, \u2018Browser\u2019 etc. Each of these icons  typically launches a new, appropriately tailored, user interface screen on the display  when selected by the user by way of the trackwheel  or the keyboard .  depicts an exemplary screenshot of a user interface screen, displayed by a known handheld email client when the \u2018Compose\u2019 icon is selected in . The depicted user interface  includes a label , an input field , a drop down address selection list , headed with a \u2018[Use Once]\u2019 selection . One of the addresses may be highlighted as shown at email address selection . Label  reads \u2018To:\u2019 in an English version of the software. All labels may of course contain translated equivalents of the exemplary English labels illustrated, as needed.","The address selection list is a list of the first entries in the local address book stored in handheld device  headed with a \u2018[Use Once]\u2019 entry. If the address book is empty or the intended recipient's address is not in the address book, only the \u2018[Use Once]\u2019 option and a message line that reads \u2018* No Addresses *\u2019 is displayed indicating that the address book is empty. The message line itself may be selectable and if selected it may prompt for a new address using a new email address entry window (not shown).","If the address book is not empty the user may select the entry  with the name of a recipient in the address list  as shown in . Upon selecting a recipient, a popup menu (not shown) with a pre-selected entry that reads \u201cemail selected_name\u201d may be presented (where selected_name is actually the name of the selected email recipient\u2014e.g. Scotte Zinn). Once the pre-selected (highlighted) popup menu entry is selected, the screenshot  as depicted in  may be launched. Screenshot  includes an un-editable field  containing the selected recipient. A popup menu (not shown in ) may be invoked by way of trackwheel  with entries labeled as \u2018Add To:\u2019, \u2018Add Cc:\u2019, \u2018Add Bcc:\u2019 and \u2018Delete Field\u2019. Screenshot  also typically includes label  which reads \u201cSubject:\u201d and fields  and  which are freeform fields for entering the subject and contents of the email being composed, respectively.","If the \u2018[Use Once]\u2019 entry  () is selected using trackwheel  (or by tapping the \u2018enter\u2019 key on keyboard  while the \u2018[Use Once]\u2019 entry  is highlighted), screenshot  shown in  is displayed. A message label  states \u2018One Time Email\u2019, while label  reads \u201cEmail:\u201d and field  is freeform to allow typing of the recipient. Label  is intended to indicate to the user that the current email is for use on a one-time basis and is not retrieved from the address book. After entering the email address in field  and pressing the enter key (or equivalently, pressing the trackwheel), the screenshot  depicted in  appears.","It can be easily appreciated that the sequence of actions to arrive at screenshot  is not very intuitive or as straightforward as possible. In that regard, new users who have not synchronized their local address book in their handheld device  will have to undertake the steps represented by the sequence of user interfaces shown in  in order to send an e-mail. Furthermore, whether or not the recipient is found in the address book, the steps required to send an email using known email clients is inconsistent with the way email is composed using popular desktop email client applications such as Outlook\u00ae from Microsoft Corp. of Redmond, Wash., USA. For example, it may not be quite clear what \u2018[Use Once]\u2019 (in ) means to one who is not already well versed in the use of the handheld device executing a conventional email client. Also, the number of menu accesses to navigate through to screenshot  can be considerable. It is therefore likely that the user interfaces depicted in  may be sources of confusion and frustration to users, especially novice users.","As mentioned earlier, the sequence of user interaction described thus far results from handheld device  operating with known software. Several variations exist consequent upon different known software loads. However, these variations nonetheless exhibit at least some of the disadvantageous characteristics identified.","Returning to , the microprocessor  in handheld device  may be used to run software applications comprising processor executable instructions. Microprocessor  interacting with RAM  and other device subsystems, may execute operating system software and other application software which may be stored in a persistent store such as flash memory . In addition, applications may be loaded onto handheld device  from an external source accessible through auxiliary I\/O , serial port , short range communications subsystem  or other device subsystems , for execution by microprocessor . As depicted in , software applications  such as an email client, electronic calendar, or appointment organizers may execute inside a virtual machine  running atop an operation system . An exemplary virtual machine may be the K virtual machine (KVM) from Sun Microsystems Inc. of Santa Clara, Calif., USA. The applications  may have the ability to send and\/or receive data, via the network .","Software applications , such as applications according to embodiments of this disclosure may easily be implemented using a standard programming language such as the Java\u2122 programming language, targeting a virtual machine executing in handheld device . To make use of a virtual machine, an application development platform, such as the Java 2 Micro Edition (J2ME), along with a development environment which may be a variant of the Java Development Environment (JDE) from Sun Microsystems Inc., may be used to develop applications. Application developer guides for a specific development platform may be consulted to develop an application with user interfaces as disclosed herein. JDE for a particular handheld device, for example, provides a set of application programming interfaces (API) which provides access to device features including user interface, networking, localization and other capabilities. Thus, using the above resources and related hardware, software and documentation, the descriptions of embodiments of the user interface layouts provided hereinafter and associated features can be implemented in a straightforward manner by those with ordinary skill in the art. Alternately, many other programming approaches, languages and platforms may be used. For instance, the application may target the operating system of device  directly, or another programming language such as C or C++ may be used. The approach outlined above is thus only exemplary and in no way limiting.","A handheld device  operated in exemplary inventive manners may start out by launching a start up screen similar to that in , and displaying icons  which may be labeled as \u2018Messages\u2019, \u2018Address book\u2019, \u2018Calendar\u2019, \u2018Browser\u2019 etc. Icons  allow the user to launch new user interface screen on display  () when selected by trackwheel  or keyboard .","Exemplary screenshots of handheld device  when loaded with software so as to operate in accordance with the present disclosure are depicted in .  depicts a schematic diagram of an exemplary screenshot  of a handheld device  executing a client application launched after a selection is made to compose email. Screenshot  may be launched by selecting a \u2018Compose Email\u2019 option from a pop-up menu available when in a messages application. Alternatively, a \u2018Compose\u2019 icon may be present in the startup screen that launches screenshot  upon selection. Other ways of launching screenshot  starting from the startup screen may also be included.","Screenshot  is an exemplary email composition screen. Screenshot  includes labels ,  and  which read \u201cTo:\u201d, \u201cCc:\u201d and \u201cSubject:\u201d, respectively. Recipient field  is a freeform field in which a recipient may be entered. Field  is a freeform field in which copied recipients are entered. Field  is a free form field in which the subject heading for the email is entered while field  allows the message content of the email to be keyed in.","As the user types text in to field , any matching names may be selected from the address book and displayed in a selection menu  as shown in . Matching names are sought from the name field and from the company field of entries in the address book, and optionally from other fields as well. (For reasons which will be explained, the menu  may be headed with the entries \u2018Email\u2019 and \u2018Lookup\u2019.) The menu may allow a user to move down to one of the listed addresses and select an entry. Selection menu  is dynamically updated upon each keystroke entry of text into recipient field , by displaying in the selection menu  a filtered list of names, so that only names containing the typed text (in field ) are displayed. As shown in  only names matching \u2018An\u2019 are listed in selection menu , as a result of the user typing \u2018An\u2019 into recipient field . Menu  may occupy as much vertical space below the field  as allowable. Moreover, the screen may scroll to allow at least two screens of menu .","As the user types in more letters the list of matching names may become shorter, since names that do not match the typed text are successively removed from selection menu  with each keystroke entry of text into field . If the user selects an entry in selection menu , the selected entry will be inserted into field , field  is changed to become a non-freeform field, and the selection menu  disappears. If the selected entry contains no email address, a warning is displayed indicating that the entry does not contain an email address. Conversely, if the selected entry contains multiple email addresses, a dialog or menu (not shown) is displayed with a list of possible email addresses for the recipient, to allow the user to select one.","In one embodiment, if an escape key is pressed, while the selection menu  has focus, the menu disappears and field  receives focus again. In alternate embodiments the user can close selection menu  by continuing to scroll up after the top item in selection menu  has received focus. In other embodiments, if a user changes a field (e.g. field ) while menu  is not visible, either by keystroke or using the trackwheel, then menu  reappears.","After an address is selected, and inserted into recipient field , a new input field of the same type (\u2018To:\u2019, \u2018Cc:\u2019 or \u2018Bcc:\u2019) appears. For example, as shown in , a new \u2018To:\u2019 label B and a second recipient field B appears after the initial \u2018To:\u2019 recipient field  was populated with the selected recipient. When the email is sent, all blank recipient fields are automatically stripped out. Conversely, a second recipient may then be provided in the new \u2018To:\u2019 field B, in a manner similar to the way of the first recipient is specified. The user may change the focus to any desired input field (e.g. from the recipient field B to the copy recipient field ) using the trackwheel. At any time, the popup selection menu  of  may be invoked (by pressing the trackwheel) to select one of the entries labeled as \u2018Add To:\u2019 , \u2018Add Cc:\u2019 , \u2018Add Bcc:\u2019  or \u2018Delete Field\u2019 . As the labels suggest, new input fields may be added: \u2018Add To:\u2019 entry  is used to add a new email recipient; the \u2018Add Cc:\u2019 entry  is used to add a copy email address; and the \u2018Add Bcc:\u2019 entry  is used to add a blind copy email address. To delete a field, either the delete key may be pressed or the popup menu  may be invoked while focus is on a given input field and the \u2018Delete Field\u2019 entry  selected to remove the unwanted input field.","The possibility exists that the intended e-mail recipient is not in the address book but the user knows the e-mail address of the recipient. To facilitate entry of an e-mail address, as text characters are typed in recipient field  or B (), the contents are translated in a special SMTP (simple mail transfer protocol) Email Translation Field  that appears at the top of the selection menu. This character translation works as follows. Letters and numbers remain unaltered. The first space character is translated into a \u2018@\u2019 symbol and subsequent space characters are translated into periods. For instance the sequence of letters (inside the double quotes) \u201cterry van belle\u201d in this translation scheme, would be translated to \u2018terry@van.belle\u2019 (inside the single quotes) which results after replacing the first space by \u2018@\u2019 and the subsequent space by a period, just as described above. As the first five letters, \u201cterry\u201d are entered, the SMTP email translation field  at the top of selection menu  would read \u201cterry\u201d, while selection menu  also displays address book entries matching the string \u201cterry\u201d, if any. As the first space character is typed in, the SMTP email translation field will now read \u2018terry@\u2019 in accordance with the translation scheme just described. After the second space character is entered (i.e., \u201cterry van\u201d), the SMTP email translation field would read \u2018terry@van.\u2019 and entries in menu  that do not match \u201cterry van\u201d would disappear, although the SMTP email translation field and the \u2018Lookup:\u2019 entry would still be visible (). As the rest of the string characters are keyed in, the translated field would finally read \u2018terry@van.belle\u2019. Alternatively, the translated text could appear in the recipient field , rather than in a separate SMTP translation field. The user may override the translation scheme in either of the following two ways. In the first way, after typing the first space character (such that the SMTP email translation field reads \u2018terry@\u2019), the user may tap the backspace key to delete the space and then tap the space key again. The consequence in the SMTP email translation field is that the \u2018@\u2019 symbol is deleted upon the pressing of the backspace key and a space, rather than a \u2018@\u2019 symbol, is inserted upon the subsequent pressing of the space key. The same sequence may be used to delete subsequent periods in the SMTP email translation field. In the second way, the user may press the shift key along with the space key in order to force insertion of a space, rather than a translated character, in the SMTP email translation field.","The email composition screen as shown in  and  may also allow a lookup in a global address list (GAL). The GAL is a list of recipients that resides in a remote computing device such as server  in . Thus, not all recipient email addresses need be stored in handheld device  as a GAL may be inspected by way of wired and\/or wireless interconnections shown in . Specifically, the top of menu  includes \u2018Lookup:\u2019 entry  () with a label  and a field  mirroring the current contents of field  (except that occurrences of \u2018@\u2019 and \u2018.\u2019 in the text of field  are replaced with spaces). From the menu , a user selects the \u2018Lookup\u2019 entry  to search the GAL residing in a remote server. Thus, although all matching address book entries (i.e., locally stored recipient names) would be listed in menu  as the user types text into field , the user may select, \u2018Lookup:\u2019 entry , to trigger a global address lookup. The string in field  is then sent over network  to a server computer  using the communications subsystem  (), over network  as shown in . In server , recipients that match the received string are selected from the global address list and transmitted back to the device , where they are received, processed and presented to the user as shown in . If the string is not found in the GAL, the list  should not appear but instead the field reads \u2018Lookup Failed: [keywords]\u2019, where [keywords] represents the contents of field .","An exemplary result of a remote or global address lookup is displayed in screenshot  in . The title label  reads \u201cLookup: keywords (n matches)\u201d or its equivalent, where n stands for the number of matches found in a remote address lookup. The title label thus indicates how many matches were found. If the search returns only one address, then in one embodiment, the returned address is automatically filled in to the appropriate recipient field without displaying screenshot . In one embodiment, the lookup screen  is not automatically displayed. Instead the input field reads \u2018Lookup: keywords (n matches)\u2019. If the menu  is invoked while focus is in such a field, the menu contains a \u2018View Lookup\u2019 entry. Selecting \u2018View Lookup\u2019 then invokes screenshot . Once an entry is selected, screenshot  disappears and the email composition screen appears.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 3A"],"b":["600","602","604","606","608","614","636","608","610","616","612","640","626","618","620","628","638","622","624","630","642","632","608","636","626","620","628","624","632"]},"A detailed, step-by-step, example of using one embodiment of a user interface for composing and sending an email message is described below with reference to .","Turning to , a block diagram of an empty email composition screen  is depicted. Screen  is similar to the screenshot depicted in  but additionally shows a \u2018Send Using\u2019 label  and associated \u2018Send Using\u2019 field . By default, when a new e-mail composition screen is opened, as shown, the \u2018Send Using\u2019 field is set to the option of \u2018Default\u2019. Email composition screen  also has a \u2018To:\u2019 label  and associated (empty) \u2018To:\u2019 field ; a \u2018Cc:\u2019 label  and associated (empty) \u2018Cc:\u2019 field ; and a \u2018Subject:\u2019 label  and associated (empty) \u2018Subject:\u2019 field . Additionally, the screen has an empty message body field .","While focus is on the \u2018Send Using\u2019 field , the user may press trackwheel  to obtain pop-up menu  (). The user may then select the \u2018Change Option\u2019 entry  in pop-up menu . This results in the pop-up of a selection menu  which is overlaid on the email composition screen, as shown in . Menu  lists all possible services available in order to send the email message. In this way, the user may select which email service to use and, in consequence, the contents of the \u2018From:\u2019 field in the e-mail message which is sent. As shown, the user has the option of choosing an enterprise service labeled \u2018Desktop\u2019  or another internet service, Rogers, which is labeled with the actual address  which will appear in the \u2018From\u2019 field of the e-mail message if this service is chosen.","For example, if a user changes the option to the \u2018Desktop\u2019 entry (representing the enterprise email service) then, as shown in , \u2018Desktop\u2019 is thereafter displayed in the \u2018Send Using\u2019 field .","Returning to , the default entry  in menu  is associated with one of the listed services (i.e., one of the services indicated by labels  and ). The user may separately set which service is to be considered the default service so that the user will know which service he is using when the default service is selected. More specifically, in the start up screen, the user may select an options icon to obtain a menu of options, one of which is \u201cAdvanced Options\u201d. Selection of \u201cAdvanced Options\u201d results in a further menu of choices, one of which is \u201cMessage Services\u201d. Selection of the \u201cMessage Services\u201d option results in the display of screen  of . Turning to , screen  has a Default email service field  and an associated label \u2018Messaging (CMIME)\u2019 . As illustrated in , the current default email service is the service labeled \u2018Desktop\u2019.

Accordingly in , only names matching the text \u2018jaco\u2019 are listed in menu .","If the user focuses on the recipient represented by entry  in menu , as shown in , and selects this recipient, since this selected recipient has more than one email address in the address book, as seen in , another pop-up menu  is displayed to facilitate selection of the email address to use. Specifically, menu  lists all email addresses in the address book that are associated with the selected recipient. The user highlights and selects one of the email addresses using trackwheel  (as shown in , the address jsauer@rim.net).","Upon the user selecting a particular email address, as seen in , the selected recipient is displayed in recipient field  and the selected email address is internally stored for use when actually sending the completed email message. Notably, if the user had not changed the email service indicated by the \u2018Send Using\u2019 field from its initial \u2018Default\u2019 setting, upon selection of the recipient, the \u2018Default\u2019 indicator in this field is replaced with the label for the actual service which is associated with the \u2018Default\u2019 indicator (for example, the \u2018Desktop\u2019 label). Moreover, upon selection of a recipient's email address, a new \u201cTo:\u201d label  and an associated recipient field  are displayed to facilitate accepting an additional email recipient.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":["FIG. 16","FIG. 11","FIG. 2","FIG. 17","FIG. 17","FIG. 18","FIG. 18","FIG. 13"],"b":["1612","1108","1612","228","1120","1120","1120","1120","206","1120","1612","1120","1120","1612","1120","1612","1836","1834","1320"]},"Trackwheel  may be used to invoke pop-up menu  () in order to select the addition of a blind carbon copy (by selecting the \u201cAdd Bcc\u201d entry of the menu). Upon such selection, as seen in , a \u2018Bcc\u2019 label  and an associated field  are added to the composition screen. The specification of a Bcc recipient in field  proceeds in the same manner to the above described procedure specifying the Cc recipient in field  (). Specifically, as shown in , once the user has typed \u201ckris\u201d into the Bcc recipient field , the menu of matching names will be filtered to include only address book entries matching this text string.","Upon selection of a Bcc recipient\u2014as shown in , the recipient \u201cKrishna Pathiyal\u201d\u2014this recipient is displayed in Bcc recipient field  and a new Bcc recipient field  is added along with a corresponding label . The new field may be populated as described above, or ignored by the user.","If the intended recipient is not in the address book, as depicted in , selection menu  may only include the \u2018Email\u2019 and \u2018Lookup\u2019 entries. As shown in , this has resulted from the user populating the second Cc recipient field  with the text \u201cbalsil\u201d. Further, this figure shows the user has focused on the \u2018Lookup\u2019 entry on selection menu . If the user selects this entry to lookup or inspect a global address list that resides in a corporate mail server accessible via corporate mail service, the microprocessor  () is prompted to query the corporate mail server  () at which the global address list resides. Matching names retrieved from the global address list are displayed, as shown in  in menu . Menu  may be headed with an indication of how many matches were found. Thus, in , the heading text  \u201cLookup: balsil (2 matches)\u201d indicates that two matches were found in the global address list. The user may then select a desired recipient by focusing an indicator on this recipient and pressing the enter key from keyboard  () or using trackwheel  to bring up a pop-up menu  () and select the \u2018Continue\u2019 option . Upon selection of a recipient, the recipient name populates the second Cc recipient field and a new, third, Cc recipient field  with an associated \u201cCc:\u201d label , is then added to the composition screen as shown in .","The user may also enter the recipient address directly into the recipient field (which is useful if the recipient address is neither in the address book nor in the global address list). For example, if the user wants to send an email to batman@rimcom, the user can type \u201cbatman@rimcom\u201d or \u201cbatman rim com\u201d into the second recipient field  (). In the latter case, as noted earlier, a character translation is used in which letters and numbers remain unaltered while the first space character is translated into the \u2018@\u2019 symbol and subsequent space characters are translated into periods. Further, once the user has looked up a text string in the global address list\u2014in the present example the string \u201cbalsil\u201d\u2014and selected one of the returned names, the selected name and associated e-mail address is cached locally and will appear in each future appearance of selection menu . For this reason, name specific look-up field  appears at the head of selection menu  in . This has the advantageous result that an entry not in the local address book but previously obtained from the global address list (here [James Balsillie]) can be added to an e-mail message without inspecting the global address list again. Cached address entries may be retained until the entry is added to the local address book or deleted.","Once the recipient is specified in the second recipient field , a third recipient field  and associated label  are added to the email composition screen as shown in . In general, a new recipient field with an associated label are added to the email composition screen after a recipient has been selected and filled into the last available recipient field. This new field is of the same type as the most recently populated recipient field. Thus, if the most recently populated field is a \u2018To:\u2019 field, a new \u2018To:\u2019 field (and associated label) is added; if the most recently populated field is a \u2018Cc:\u2019 field, a new \u2018Cc:\u2019 field (and associated label) is added; and if the most recently populated field is a \u2018Bcc:\u2019 field, a new \u2018Bcc:\u2019 field (and associated label) is added.","It may be that a user, after typing a text string into one of the recipient fields, such as \u201clazaridis\u201d, inadvertently selects the option \u201cEmail lazaridis\u201d from the selection menu  (). In consequence, the name \u201clazaridis\u201d: will appear in the \u201cTo:\u201d field. In this case, the user may scroll to this \u201cTo:\u201d field and click the trackwheel  to obtain a context specific pop-up menu  (). This menu  will include an entry  \u201cLookup: lazaridis\u201d, the selection of which will cause the microprocessor  to retrieve matching names from the global address list and display these.","The process of matching the typed text in a recipient field to entries in the address book is done by comparing the typed text to both the name of a recipient in an address book entry and also other attributes in the address book entry such as company names. Accordingly, with reference to , when \u201cj\u201d is typed into the recipient field , then recipient \u201cDavid Shepherd, Janna Systems\u201d is listed in selection menu , although the letter \u201cj\u201d does not appear anywhere in the name \u201cDavid Shepherd\u201d: The match is due to the company name \u201cJanna Systems\u201d associated with recipient \u201cDavid Shepherd\u201d.","In an alternate embodiment illustrated in , the selection menu  lists not only recipients previously looked up and selected from the global address list but also the results of look-up searches of the global address list, such as search .","The described approach and user interfaces may also be used with messaging services other than e-mail such as a Personal Identification Number (PIN) based addressing service, a short messaging service (SMS), a multimedia messaging service (MMS) or an instant messaging (IM) service. Where handheld device  may operate using one or more of these services, the user may select a particular service to use.","For example, a handheld device  may have a personal identification number (PIN) associated with it and a service may exist to allow addressing messages with a PIN. When two such devices communicate using a PIN-based addressing service, one device may send a message using a recipient's PIN (instead of an email address). Using handheld device  operating according to an embodiment of the present disclosure, a user may arrive at a screen similar to screenshot  () by selecting the \u2018Messages\u2019 icon (), invoking a popup selection menu (not shown), and selecting a \u2018Compose PIN\u2019 entry. The handheld device may now be said to be in \u2018PIN mode\u2019. As described for email composition, when a user types in text to an input field such as field , matching name entries from the address book appear in a selection menu such as selection menu . After the user selects a name, the selected entry is displayed in the input field. If the selected recipient in selection menu does not have a PIN address, a message indicating this may be displayed to the user. It is also possible that the intended recipient is not in the address book but the user knows the PIN of the recipient. To facilitate entry of the PIN, as text characters are entered, the client software may perform validation of the characters entered into a PIN input field and eliminate invalid PIN characters. For example, valid PIN characters in one embodiment may only include numeric characters 0-9 and letters a-f and A-F.","A step-by-step, example of using one embodiment of the user interface for composing and sending a PIN message is described below with reference to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0074"},"figref":["FIG. 30","FIG. 3A"],"b":["3000","300","3000","3020","3020"]},"An exemplary PIN composition window is shown in . The PIN composition window is similar to the email composition window of  but does not include the \u2018Send Using\u2019 field and label. The user can type text into recipient (\u201cTo:\u201d) field  whereupon the microprocessor  () accesses the address book in local memory to find any matching names. These matching names are displayed in a selection menu , as shown in . The user can move an indicator down menu  to focus on one of the listed addresses and select a recipient. If the number of entries is too numerous to show on the display, the user may also scroll down menu  using trackwheel  to see additional entries. Menu  may contain all matching entries, or the menu may be capped at a pre-determined number of entries.","Selection menu  is dynamically updated upon each keystroke entry of text into PIN recipient field , by displaying in the selection menu  a filtered list of names containing the typed text. Thus, as a result of the user typing \u2018jac\u2019 into the recipient field  in , only names containing the text \u2018jac\u2019 are listed in selection menu . Additionally, as illustrated, the results of earlier global address list searches are shown.","As is the case with other input fields discussed above, upon selection of a PIN recipient as shown in , the recipient is displayed in PIN recipient field  and a new PIN recipient field  is added along with a corresponding label . The new field may be populated in the manner described above, or ignored by the user. If the selected recipient did not have an associated PIN address, a warning to the user is generated.","In an alternate embodiment, keyboard  () may be a \u201creduced keyboard\u201d in which multiple letters, symbols, and\/or digits, and the like, are assigned to any given key. For example, in U.S. Pat. No. 7,091,885 to Fux et al., the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference, multiple letters arrayed in a QWERTY arrangement are represented by a single key. Thus, the upper left key represents the letters \u2018q\u2019 and \u2018w\u2019, the next key, the letters \u2018e\u2019 and \u2018r\u2019, and so on. Other known reduced keyboards have included other arrangements of keys, letters, symbols, digits, and the like. Since a single actuation of such a key potentially could be intended by the user to refer to any of the represented letters, the input generally is an ambiguous input and is in need of some type of disambiguation in order to be useful for text entry purposes.","To enable a user to make use of the multiple letters, digits, and the like on any given key, various keystroke interpretation systems have been provided. For instance, a \u201cmulti-tap\u201d system allows a user to substantially unambiguously specify a particular character on a key by pressing the same key a number of times equivalent to the position of the desired character on the key.","In another keystroke interpretation system, a user presses keys to which the desired characters, amongst others, have been assigned, generally pressing each key one time for each desired letter, and disambiguation software attempts to predict the intended input.","Accordingly, in one embodiment, multiple characters appear on each key of the keyboard of the handheld and the user interface software includes disambiguation software that predicts the intended input of the user from a potentially ambiguous input. A step-by-step example of email composition using one embodiment employing a disambiguation engine is depicted in .","In , to enter text to the recipient filed  of an empty e-mail composition screen, the user presses a key representative of the letters \u2018e\u2019 and \u2018r\u2019. This results in the first of these letters (i.e., the letter \u2018e\u2019) being displayed in the recipient field and in the appearance of selection menu  populated with address book names containing either the letter \u2018e\u2019 or the letter \u2018r\u2019.","In , the user inputs an additional ambiguous letter into recipient field  by pressing a key which signifies both the letters \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018s\u2019. In this instance, the recipient field displays the letter \u2018s\u2019 as this is considered the more likely letter to follow the supposed initial \u2018e\u2019. Selection menu  is also updated to display all address book entries that contain \u2018ra\u2019, \u2018ea\u2019, \u2018es\u2019, or \u2018rs\u2019. In other words, all address book entries that may match all possible interpretations of the input text are displayed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0085","num":"0084"},"figref":"FIG. 36","b":["1108","1120"]},"In another embodiment, short messaging service (SMS) may be used to send a text message to a recipient. Here, instead of an email address or a PIN, a phone number is used to specify recipients. A phone number associated with an SMS-enabled device may be specified as a recipient directly or through selection of a name in the address book associated with a phone number. Again, using handheld device , a user may arrive at an SMS composition screen by selecting the \u2018Messages\u2019 icon (), invoking a popup selection menu (not shown), and selecting a \u2018Compose SMS\u2019 entry. Of course, in an SMS composition screen, only the \u2018To:\u2019 label and corresponding field is displayed, since \u2018Cc:\u2019 and \u2018Bcc:\u2019 labels or associated input fields are not supported by SMS. If the intended recipient is not in the address book, or no phone number is associated with the recipient, but the user knows the phone number of the recipient, the user may enter the phone number into the input field. As the user keys in a phone number, the client software may assist the user by performing validation as characters are entered into a phone number input field and eliminating invalid characters. For example, valid phone number characters in one embodiment include only numeric characters 0-9.","In yet another embodiment, multimedia messaging service (MMS) may be used to send a text message and multimedia attachments to a recipient. Here, either a phone number or an email address is used to specify recipients. A phone number associated with an MMS-enabled device may be specified as a recipient. Using handheld device  a user may arrive at an MMS composition screen by selecting the \u2018Messages\u2019 icon (), invoking a popup selection menu (not shown), and selecting a \u2018Compose MMS\u2019 entry. As is the case for SMS, in an MMS composition screen, only the \u2018To:\u2019 label and corresponding field are displayed, since \u2018Cc:\u2019 and \u2018Bcc:\u2019 labels or associated input fields are not supported by MMS. If the intended recipient is not in the address book the user may enter the phone number of the recipient directly into the input field. The client software may assist the user by performing validation as characters are entered into a phone number input field, and eliminating invalid characters. Similar to the case for SMS, valid phone number characters in one embodiment are restricted to numeric characters 0-9.","In yet another embodiment, instant messaging (IM) may be used to send and receive text messages to a recipient in real time. Here, a buddy name is used to specify recipients and a buddy name from a contact list associated with an instant messaging service is used to select a recipient. Using an instant messaging client on handheld device  a user arrives at an instant messaging screen. Instant messaging requires the user to log into an IM server. Once logged in, the user may initiate two-way communication with another user (a buddy) who is also logged in to the IM server. Similar to what was described for email composition, when a user types in text to the input field, matching buddy name entries from the list of contacts that are online (buddy names), may appear in a selection menu similar to selection menu  allowing the user to select one. After the user selects a name, the selected entry is displayed in a field, such as field , and the user may then send and receive messages in real time. Rather than selecting a name from a contact list (buddy list), the user has the option of keying in a known buddy name.","In alternate implementations of instant messaging, a buddy name may be associated with address book entries. Using an instant messaging client on handheld device  a user may arrive at an instant messaging screen. As described for email composition, when a user types in text to the input field , matching recipient names from the address book are displayed in selection menu  allowing the user to select one. After the user selects a name, the selected entry may be displayed in a field, such as field , and the user may send and receive messages in real time. However, if the selected entry does not have an associated buddy name, the user is warned. Once again, the user may have the option of keying in a known buddy name into a recipient input field.","As may be appreciated by an ordinary user of popular desktop applications, the layout of screenshot  shown in  is substantially the same as user interface layouts commonly used in popular desktop email clients. In particular, field  corresponding to label  (which reads \u201cTo:\u201d) and field  corresponding to label  (which reads \u201cCc:\u201d), are now very intuitive to use, even for novice users working with a handheld device with no address book entries. Users may now simply type the address of the recipient in to the field  (or field ) without first going through menu driven input sequences such as the dropdown list similar to  (in ). As a further advantage, the often confusing \u2018[Use Once]\u2019 selection  (shown in ) is conveniently avoided altogether. The improved user interface thus allows for a more enjoyable user experience and a reduced learning curve for new users, which in turn may help drive demand for wireless communication devices and related services.","The text \u201cDefault\u201d in field  () could be replaced with any other text or symbol indicating that a default email service will be used. Also, in a modification, rather than displaying a default indicator in field , this field could simply display the label for the email service that is currently selected as the default email service.","Of course, the above described embodiments are intended to be illustrative only and in no way limiting. The described embodiments are susceptible to many modifications of form, arrangement of parts, details and order of operation. The disclosed embodiments are rather intended to encompass all such modification within the scope, as defined by the claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Aspects and features of the disclosed device and method will become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art upon review of the following description of specific embodiments in conjunction with the accompanying figures.
