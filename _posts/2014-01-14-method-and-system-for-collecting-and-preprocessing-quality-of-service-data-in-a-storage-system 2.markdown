{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present disclosure relates to collecting and pre-processing quality of service (QOS) data in a storage system.","Various forms of storage systems are used today. These forms include direct attached storage (DAS) network attached storage (NAS) systems, storage area networks (SANs), and others. Network storage systems are commonly used for a variety of purposes, such as providing multiple clients with access to shared data, backing up data and others.","A storage system typically includes at least a computing system executing a storage operating system for storing and retrieving data on behalf of one or more client computing systems (may just be referred to as \u201cclient\u201d or \u201cclients\u201d). The storage operating system stores and manages shared data containers in a set of mass storage devices.","Quality of Service (QOS) is used in a storage environment to provide certain throughput in processing input\/output (I\/O) requests, as well as a response time (i.e. latency) within, which I\/O requests are processed. QOS may also include processing certain number of I\/O requests per second (IOPS), which is associated with throughput. Throughput means an average rate at which data is transferred for I\/O requests. Different QOS levels may be provided to different clients depending on client service levels.","To process an I\/O request to read and\/or write data, various resources are typically used within a storage system, for example, network resources, processors, storage devices and others. The different resources perform various functions for reading and writing information. The use of resources impact QOS for clients. For example, if a client  overuses a certain resource then it may delay I\/O processing for a client , which may lower the QOS for client .","As storage systems continue to expand in size and operating speeds, it is desirable to efficiently monitor resource usage within the storage system and analyze QOS data so that any incidents based on abnormal QOS data can be identified and handled appropriately. The storage operating system typically maintains QOS data regarding various storage volumes that use the resources of the storage system. Continuous efforts are being made to efficiently collect and pre-process QOS data so that the data can be efficiently analyzed for identifying abnormal incidents that may impact overall I\/O processing in compliance with QOS policies.","As a preliminary note, the terms \u201ccomponent\u201d, \u201cmodule\u201d, \u201csystem,\u201d and the like as used herein are intended to refer to a computer-related entity, either software-executing general purpose processor, hardware, firmware and a combination thereof. For example, a component may be, but is not limited to being, a process running on a hardware processor, a hardware based processor, an object, an executable, a thread of execution, a program, and\/or a computer.","By way of illustration, both an application running on a server and the server can be a component. One or more components may reside within a process and\/or thread of execution, and a component may be localized on one computer and\/or distributed between two or more computers. Also, these components can execute from various computer readable media having various data structures stored thereon. The components may communicate via local and\/or remote processes such as in accordance with a signal having one or more data packets (e.g., data from one component interacting with another component in a local system, distributed system, and\/or across a network such as the Internet with other systems via the signal).","Computer executable components can be stored, for example, at non-transitory, computer readable media including, but not limited to, an ASIC (application specific integrated circuit), CD (compact disc), DVD (digital video disk), ROM (read only memory), floppy disk, hard disk, EEPROM (electrically erasable programmable read only memory), memory stick or any other storage device, in accordance with the claimed subject matter.","In one aspect, a performance manager module is provided for analyzing quality of service (QOS) data maintained by a storage operating system for processing input\/output (I\/O) requests for writing and reading data to and from storage devices. The storage system uses various resources to process the I\/O requests. The QOS data may include a throughput rate, average number of IOPS that are processed by the storage operating system, average response time, a service time, a wait time, a visit time and a number of visits at each of the resources for processing the I\/O requests. The performance manager uses the QOS data to predict an expected range (or threshold value) for future QOS data. Future QOS data can be compared with the expected range to detect abnormal behavior.","The performance manager needs QOS data for specific times or time intervals for predicting the expected range. In one aspect, a collection module is provided that interfaces with the storage operating system and polls the storage operating system for the QOS data for time intervals requested by the performance manager. The actual data however is received after a polling interval has begun. For example, if polling starts at time t0, then certain QOS data may not be received until time t1, where t1>to. In one aspect, as described below in detail, the collection module uses the data received at t1 to provide an estimate of what the data would have been at t0. Thus the performance manager receives the estimated data for the specific polling interval. This allows the performance manager to efficiently perform its analysis without having to pre-process the QOS data.","System :",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","131","107","108","131","121"]},"QOS provides a certain throughput, latency and an average number of IOPS (I\/O requests processed in a second) for clients A-N. The I\/O operations may be read and\/or write requests for reading and\/or writing data at storage devices. Throughput means average amount of data transferred within certain duration, for example, a second. Latency means a delay in processing an I\/O request and may be measured by an average response time in processing client I\/O requests.","Collection module  interfaces with the storage operating system  for receiving QOS data. The QOS data may include throughput information, an average response time, service time, wait time, and a number of visits at a plurality of storage system  resources used for processing I\/O requests; or any other QOS data type. The QOS data is pre-processed and provided to the performance manager  that stores the pre-processed QOS data at a local data structure . The performance manager  then analyzes the QOS data for predicting abnormal behavior.","The storage operating system  maintains a large amount of QOS data for various storage volumes (defined below) and their associated clients. The collection module  starts the collection process based on a polling interval that is specified by the performance manager . However, the data that is received from the storage operating system  does not exactly match the time and the polling interval. The collection module  receives the QOS data and as described below in detail, estimates (i.e. pre-processes or transforms) what the data would have been if it was received at the time requested by the performance manager . This allows the performance manager  to simply take the pre-processed QOS data from the collection module  and perform its analysis to ensure that abnormal incidents are being addressed.","In one aspect, the storage system  has access to a set of mass storage devices A-N (may be referred to as storage devices  or simply as storage device ) within at least one storage subsystem . The storage devices  may include writable storage device media such as magnetic disks, video tape, optical, DVD, magnetic tape, non-volatile memory devices for example, solid state drives (SSDs) including self-encrypting drives, flash memory devices and any other similar media adapted to store information. The storage devices  may be organized as one or more groups of Redundant Array of Independent (or Inexpensive) Disks (RAID). The various aspects disclosed are not limited to any particular storage device type or storage device configuration.","In one aspect, the storage system  provides a set of logical storage volumes (may be interchangeably referred to as volume or storage volume) for providing physical storage space to clients A-N (or virtual machines A-N). A storage volume is a logical storage object and typically includes a file system in a NAS environment or a logical unit number (LUN) in a SAN environment.","Each storage volume may be configured to store data files (or data containers or data objects), scripts, word processing documents, executable programs, and any other type of structured or unstructured data. From the perspective of one of the client systems, each storage volume can appear to be a single drive. However, each storage volume can represent storage space in at one storage device, an aggregate of some or all of the storage space in multiple storage devices, a RAID group, or any other suitable set of storage space.","When a storage volume is created, a QOS policy may be associated with the storage volume such that requests associated with the storage volume can be managed appropriately. The QOS policy may be a part of a QOS policy group (referred to as \u201cPolicy Group\u201d and shown as QOS data structure ) that is used to manage QOS for different storage volumes. QOS at the storage system level may be implemented by a QOS module  that maintains the QOS data structure . QOS module  maintains various QOS data types that are provided to the collection module , as described below.","The storage operating system  organizes physical storage space at storage devices  as one or more \u201caggregate\u201d, where each aggregate is a logical grouping of physical storage identified by a unique identifier and a location. The aggregate includes a certain amount of storage space that can be expanded. Within each aggregate, one or more storage volumes are created whose size can be varied. A qtree, sub-volume unit may also be created within the storage volumes. For QOS management, each aggregate and the storage devices within the aggregates are considered as resources that are used by storage volumes.","The storage system  may be used to store and manage information at storage devices  based on an I\/O request. The request may be based on file-based access protocols, for example, the Common Internet File System (CIFS) protocol or Network File System (NFS) protocol, over the Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol (TCP\/IP). Alternatively, the request may use block-based access protocols, for example, the Small Computer Systems Interface (SCSI) protocol encapsulated over TCP (iSCSI) and SCSI encapsulated over Fibre Channel (FCP).","In a typical mode of operation, a client (or a virtual machine) transmits one or more I\/O request, such as a CFS or NFS read or write request, over connection system  to the storage system . Storage operating system  receives the request, issues one or more I\/O commands to storage devices  to read or write the data on behalf of the client system, and issues a CIFS or NFS response containing the requested data over the network  to the respective client system.","Although storage system  is shown as a stand-alone system, i.e. a non-cluster based system, in another aspect, storage system  may have a distributed architecture; for example, a cluster based system that is described below in detail with respect to .","System  may include a virtual machine environment where a physical resource is time-shared among a plurality of independently operating processor executable virtual machines (VMs). Each VM may function as a self-contained platform, running its own operating system (OS) and computer executable, application software. The computer executable instructions running in a VM may be collectively referred to herein as \u201cguest software.\u201d In addition, resources available within the VM may be referred to herein as \u201cguest resources.\u201d","The guest software expects to operate as if it were running on a dedicated computer rather than in a VM. That is, the guest software expects to control various events and have access to hardware resources on a physical computing system (may also be referred to as a host platform or host system) which maybe referred to herein as \u201chost hardware resources\u201d. The host hardware resource may include one or more processors, resources resident on the processors (e.g., control registers, caches and others), memory (instructions residing in memory, e.g., descriptor tables), and other resources (e.g., input\/output devices, host attached storage, network attached storage or other like storage) that reside in a physical machine or are coupled to the host system.","In one aspect, system  may include a plurality of computing systems A-N (may also be referred to individually as host platform\/system  or simply as server ) communicably coupled to the storage system  executing the storage operating system  via a connection system  such as a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), the Internet or any other interconnect type. As described herein, the term \u201ccommunicably coupled\u201d may refer to a direct connection, a network connection, a wireless connection or other connections to enable communication between devices.","Host system  includes a processor executable virtual execution environment executing a plurality of VMs A-N that may be presented to client computing devices\/systems A-N. VMs A-N execute a plurality of guest OS A-N (may also be referred to as guest OS ) that share hardware resources . As described above, hardware resources  may include processors, memory, I\/O devices, storage or any other hardware resource.","In one aspect, host system  interfaces with a virtual machine monitor (VMM) , for example, a processor executed Hyper-V layer provided by Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash., a hypervisor layer provided by VMWare Inc., or any other type. VMM  presents and manages the plurality of guest OS A-N executed by the host system . The VMM  may include or interface with a virtualization layer (VIL)  that provides one or more virtualized hardware resource to each OS A-N.","In one aspect, VMM  is executed by host system  with VMs A-N. In another aspect, VMM  may be executed by an independent stand-alone computing system, often referred to as a hypervisor server or VMM server and VMs A-N are presented at one or more computing systems.","It is noteworthy that different vendors provide different virtualization environments, for example, VMware Corporation, Microsoft Corporation and others. The generic virtualization environment described above with respect to  may be customized to implement the aspects of the present disclosure. Furthermore, VMM  (or VIL ) may execute other modules, for example, a storage driver, network interface and others, the details of which are not germane to the aspects described herein and hence have not been described in detail.","System  may also include a management console  that executes a processor executable management application  for managing and configuring various elements of system . Application  may be used to manage and configure VMs as well as configure resources that are used by VMs, according to one aspect. It is noteworthy that although a single management console  is shown in , system  may include other management consoles performing certain functions, for example, managing storage systems, managing network connections and other functions described below.","In one aspect, application  may be used to present storage space that is managed by storage system  to clients' A-N (or VMs A-N). The clients may be grouped into different service levels, where a client with a higher service level may be provided with more storage space than a client with a lower service level. A client at a higher level may also be provided with better QOS vis-\u00e0-vis a client at a lower level.","Before describing the details of process steps executed by the collection module , the following provides a description of a clustered storage system from where QOS data is collected.","Clustered Storage System:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 2A","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","200","204","1","204","116","116","202","131","121","118","206","204","1","204","202"]},"The clustered storage system  includes a plurality of nodes .-., a cluster switching fabric , and a plurality of mass storage devices .-.

Accordingly, each of the plurality of nodes .-. in the clustered storage server arrangement provides the functionality of a storage server.","The M-Modules .-. provide management functions for the clustered storage system . The M-Modules .-. collect storage information regarding storage devices .","Each node may execute or interface with a QOS module, shown as .-. that is similar to the QOS module  of . The QOS module  may be executed for each node or a single QOS module may be used for the entire cluster. The aspects disclosed herein are not limited to the number of instances of QOS module  that may be used in a cluster.","A switched virtualization layer including a plurality of virtual interfaces (VIFs)  is provided to interface between the respective N-modules .-. and the client systems .-.N, allowing storage .-. associated with the nodes .-. to be presented to the client systems .-.N as a single shared storage pool.","The clustered storage system  can be organized into any suitable number of virtual servers (also referred to as \u201cvservers\u201d or storage virtual machines), in which each vserver represents a single storage system namespace with separate network access. Each vserver has a client domain and a security domain that are separate from the client and security domains of other vservers. Moreover, each vserver is associated with one or more VIFs and can span one or more physical nodes, each of which can hold one or more VIFs and storage associated with one or more vservers. Client systems can access the data on a vserver from any node of the clustered system, through the VIFs associated with that vserver. It is noteworthy that the aspects described herein are not limited to the use of vservers.","Each of the nodes .-. is defined as a computing system to provide application services to one or more of the client systems .-.N. The nodes .-. are interconnected by the switching fabric , which, for example, may be embodied as a Gigabit Ethernet switch or any other type of switching\/connecting device.","Although  depicts an equal number (i.e., 3) of the N-modules .-., the D-modules .-., and the M-Modules .-., any other suitable number of N-modules, D-modules, and M-Modules may be provided. There may also be different numbers of N-modules, D-modules, and\/or M-Modules within the clustered storage system . For example, in alternative aspects, the clustered storage system  may include a plurality of N-modules and a plurality of D-modules interconnected in a configuration that does not reflect a one-to-one correspondence between the N-modules and D-modules.","Each client system .-.N may request the services of one of the respective nodes ., ., ., and that node may return the results of the services requested by the client system by exchanging packets over the computer network , which may be wire-based, optical fiber, wireless, or any other suitable combination thereof.","Collection module  interfaces with the various nodes and obtains QOS data that is pre-processed and provided to the performance manager  for analysis.

The various aspects disclosed herein are not limited to any particular interface type.","Collection module  includes one or more acquisition modules  for collecting the QOS data from the clusters. The data is pre-processed by the pre-processing module  and stored as pre-processed QOS data  at a storage device. Pre-processing module  formats the collected QOS data for the performance manager , as described below in detail. Pre-processed QOS data  is then provided to a collection module interface  of the performance manager . QOS data received from collection module  is stored as QOS data  by performance manager  at a storage device (not shown).","Performance manager  includes a plurality of modules, for example, a forecasting module  that predicts an expected range for the pre-processed QOS data, a detection module  that detects an abnormal incident and an incident analysis module  that analyzes the QOS data  for abnormal incidents and reports the incidents to a client system  via a GUI . Performance manager  may also recommend a corrective action plan to client .","Process Flow:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 3A","b":["300","131","302","107","131","131","121","121","121"]},"In block B, the collection module  may initiate QOS data collection for a first poll at time t (poll,).

The actual data for the second poll is received in block B at time t (A,), where again t (A,) is greater than (t (poll,).","In block B, the collection module  estimates the data that would have been received at time t(poll,). In one aspect, the collection module  estimates the data by performing a linear extrapolation operation using the data received at t(A,) and t(A,).","In block B, the collection module  initializes collection for a third poll at time t (poll,).

The collection module  uses linear extrapolation for estimating the data value that would have been received at t(poll,).","Thereafter, in block B, the collection module estimates a data value that would have been received at t(poll,). For example, if throughout is the QOS data that is being collected for performance manager , then the following equation may be used to estimate the reported throughput value at t (poll,):\n\nThroughput ((poll,3)=Estimated Value at (poll,3)\u2212Estimated Value at (poll,2)\/Polling Interval ((poll,3)\u2212(poll,2)\n","Thereafter, in block B, the collection module  reports the estimated value at t(poll,) to the performance manager .","Process  repeats steps B-B, for receiving actual data for next polling intervals (i.e. t(poll,), t(poll,) and so forth) and estimating the data for times that the performance manager  is expecting the data.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0074","num":"0073"},"figref":"FIG. 3B","b":["322","300","1","2","3","1","2","324","326"]},"Process  has advantages because the collection module  collects and pre-processes QOS data for the performance manager  so that the performance manager  can perform its analysis for identifying abnormal incidents without having to collect and pre-processing collected data.","In one aspect, the collection module  maintains a plurality of counters for collecting QOS data from storage operating system . When \u201cnull\u201d data is received from the storage operating system  indicating that there was no change from a previous interval is not reported to the performance manager . This may be referred to as \u201czero suppression\u201d. This is efficient for performance manager  that does not have to store \u201cnull\u201d data. Considering that performance manager  gets a large amount of data for different QOS data types and different storage volumes, zero suppression can result in reduction of significant data processing time.","Performance manager  uses a certain minimal amount of QOS data (for example, QOS data for 3 hours or 30 data samples). Performance manager  measures the performance of different workloads on a cluster based dynamically generated threshold values (or an expected range) based on historical QOS data. Performance manager  compares actual workload QOS data to the expected range for the QOS data. A workload that reaches the threshold value may then trigger an \u201cincident\u201d, which is then analyzed for corrective action.","Various resources are used within a cluster to process I\/O requests. As an example, there are two types of resources, a service center and a delay center. The service center is a resource category that can be represented by a queue with a wait time and a service time (for example, a processor that processes a request out of a queue). The delay center may be represented by a queue that does not include service time and instead only represents wait time. The distinction between the two resource types is that for a service center, the QOS data includes a number of visits, wait time per visit and service time per visit for incident detection and analysis. For the delay center, the number of visits and the wait time per visit at the delay center are used, as described below in detail.","Table I below provides an example of the various service and delay centers whose QOS data is used to track workload performance.

Workloads are defined based on incoming I\/O requests. As an example, a workload may include a plurality of streams. Each stream may have a plurality of requests. The requests may be generated by any entity, for example, an external entity, like a client system and\/or an internal entity, for example, a replication engine that replicates storage volumes at one or more storage location.","A request may have a plurality of attributes, for example, a source, a path, a destination and I\/O properties. The source identifies the source from where a request originates, for example, an internal process, a host or client address, a user application and others.","The path defines the entry path into the storage system. For example, a path may be a logical interface (LIF) or a protocol, such as NFS, CIFS, iSCSI and Fibre Channel protocol.","A destination is the target of a request, for example, storage volumes, LUNs, data containers and others.","I\/O properties include operation type (i.e. read\/write\/other), request size and any other property.","In one aspect, streams may be grouped together based on client needs. For example, if a group of clients make up a department on two different subnets, then two different streams with the \u201csource\u201d restrictions can be defined and grouped within the same workload. Furthermore, requests that fall into a workload are tracked together by performance  for efficiency.
