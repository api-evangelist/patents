abstract: The invention relates to a method for improving the perceptibility of different structures on radiographs by means of an image processing device consisting a) in storing a radiograph in electronic form as a local space-intensity distribution, b) in carrying out a Fourier transformation for determining a frequency-intensity distribution, c) in filtering said frequency-intensity distribution by modifying weighting between the high-frequency and low-frequency image signal components, wherein the fixing of the image signal components to be more intensively weighted is carried out taking into account the mean structure size of said structures whose perceptibility is to be improved, d) in carrying out an inverse Fourier transformation of the filtered frequency-intensity distribution in order to obtain a modified space-intensity distribution in which said structures are more easily perceptible. The image contrast for the hardly perceptible structures may be selectively improved by means of a changed weighting for the high-frequency, relative to the low-frequency, image signal components in the Fourier spectrum because the structures hardly perceptible on the radiographs, for example soft tissue parts having a size quantity and structuring different from easily perceptible structures as bones and implantants.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT INVENTION"],"p":["This application claims the filing benefit of PCT Patent Application PCT\/EP2004\/008370, filed Jul. 27, 2004; the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.","The present invention relates to a method for improving the perceptibility of different structures on radiographs and to an image processing device suitable therefor.","In medical diagnosis, it is very important to evaluate radiographs such as X-ray images. Bones, implants or similar structures generally stand out clearly from the surrounding soft tissue, and are therefore easily perceptible. On the other hand, soft tissue structures such as tendons or blood vessels are generally reproduced only very unclearly on radiographs. In many pathologies, however, it is in fact the perceptibility of the soft tissue structures which is important. Furthermore, it is often difficult to distinguish similar types of tissue from one another. Smaller bones which are imaged over a larger bone on a radiograph, for example, can often scarcely be made out with the naked eye; the same applies for soft tissue structures. In such cases, therefore, doctors can often make no diagnosis or only a very unreliable diagnosis on the basis of the radiographs.","The digitising of radiographs has provided some degree of improvement. Using known methods of image processing, such as contrast enhancement within selected image sections, soft tissue structures can for example sometimes be emphasised clearly. In general, however, a tendon lying over a bone cannot thereby be made perceptible. This is because the smaller fluctuations of the signal level of image signal components which represent the tendon do not stand out significantly from the high background signal level of the bone. Although a monitor used for the display will in the best case still reproduce the small fluctuations of the signal level as intensity fluctuations, these are usually so small that they are scarcely perceptible to the naked eye.","The present invention is directed to resolving these and other matters.","An object of the present invention is to provide a method and a device for improving the perceptibility of different types of structures on radiographs.","This object can be achieved by a method for improving the perceptibility of different structures on radiographs by using an image processing device, comprising the following steps: storing a radiograph provided in electronic form as a position-space intensity distribution; carrying out a Fourier transformation in order to determine a frequency-space intensity distribution; filtering the frequency-space intensity distribution by modifying the weighting between high-frequency and low-frequency image signal components, the image signal components to be weighted more strongly being set by taking into account an average structure size of the structures whose perceptibility is intended to be improved; and, carrying out an inverse Fourier transformation of the filtered frequency-space intensity distribution, so as to obtain a modified position-space intensity distribution in which these structures are more easily perceptible; and\/or by an image processing device for improving the perceptibility of different structures on radiographs, wherein the image processing device comprises a memory (MEM) for storing a radiograph provided in electronic form as a position-space intensity distribution; a Fourier transformation unit (FT) for carrying out a Fourier transformation in order to determine a frequency-space intensity distribution; a filter (FIL) for filtering the frequency-space intensity distribution by modifying the weighting between high-frequency and low-frequency image signal components, the image signal components to be weighted more strongly being set by taking into account an average structure size of the structures whose perceptibility is intended to be improved; and, an inverse Fourier transformation unit (FT) for carrying out an inverse Fourier transformation of the filtered frequency-space intensity distribution, so as to obtain a modified position-space intensity distribution in which these structures are more easily perceptible.","The invention is based on the discovery that in most cases, the structures whose perceptibility is intended to be improved differ more or less significantly in respect of their size and fineness from the other structures imaged on the radiograph. Since smaller and finer structures are manifested by higher frequencies in the Fourier spectrum than large coarse structures are, by modifying the weighting between high-frequency and low-frequency image signal components in the Fourier spectrum it is possible to enhance the image contrast either for small fine structures or for large coarse structures. Depending on whether the poorly perceptible structures are finer or coarser than the easily perceptible structures, the weighting of the image signal components in the frequency space will be modified in favour of either the high-frequency or the low-frequency image signal components.","The structures, which are poorly perceptible at first, are made to stand out clearly in particular when the image signal components to be weighted are set in that the period lengths corresponding to these frequencies are approximately twice as great as the average structure size of the structures whose perceptibility is intended to be improved.","In one particularly simple filtering embodiment of the present invention, e.g., in which the filtered frequency-space intensity distribution F\u2032(f, f) is given by: F\u2032(f, f)=T(f, f)\u00b7F(f, f)\u2014where F(f, f) is the frequency-space intensity distribution for the position-space intensity distribution, f, fare frequencies in the two-dimensional frequency space and T(f, f) is a filter function for the weighting of image signal components\u2014the frequency-space intensity distribution is merely multiplied by a filter function.","By using central frequency values and profile functions for setting the frequency ranges to be weighted, the filtering can be expediently controlled with relatively few parameters in which the filter function is set by at least one central frequency value and at least one profile function, which modifies the weighting of the image signal components as a function of the distance from the central frequency value; or in which the filter function is set by at least one central frequency value and at least one profile function, which modifies the weighting of the image signal components as a function of the distance from the central frequency value.","In another aspect of the present invention, a Gaussian function is particularly suitable as a profile function, since it has the property of remaining a Gaussian function even after the inverse Fourier transformation. The filtering can then be represented in the position space as a convolution of the intensity distribution with a Gaussian function. This prevents the filtering from leading to divergence of positions in the image where the intensity distribution changes abruptly, and which therefore have a particularly high contrast.","The frequencies or frequency ranges, which have their weighting modified, are determined according to the average structure size of the structures whose perceptibility is intended to be improved. The average structure size or corresponding frequency ranges may either be fixed in advance or, freely selectable with the aid of control elements on the image processing device or via a user interface of a superordinate computer. By modifying the crucial filter parameters, a treating doctor can therefore expediently improve the perceptibility of structures in which they are interested on a very wide variety of radiographs.","Furthermore, automatic determination of the frequency ranges via an adaptive method is also feasible wherein after an operator has selected a structure whose perceptibility is intended to be improved on the radiograph, the at least one central frequency value and the at least one profile function are set adaptively so that the contrast of this structure is increased.","The structures whose perceptibility is intended to be improved may, for example, be selected by specifying a point on the boundary of the structure and a direction, along which the contrast is intended to be increased; or by specifying two points within the structure, between which the contrast is intended to be increased.","In a further embodiment of the present invention, additional high-frequency filtering in which the frequency-space intensity distribution F(f, f) is also subjected to high-frequency filtering\u2014for example in which the high-frequency filter is given by a Gaussian filter with the central frequency value 0 leads to an increase in the signal-to-noise ratio since image signal components reflecting image structures become enhanced relative to high-frequency background noise. Such filtering compensates for the fact that the Fourier amplitudes decrease with an increasing frequency f in the images often to be represented in practice.","The advantageous configurations and advantages mentioned above in respect of the method also apply accordingly for the image processing device according to the invention.","Other features and advantages of the invention will be found in the following description of an exemplary embodiment with the aid of the drawing, in which:","While this invention is susceptible of embodiment in many different forms, there is shown in the drawings and will herein be described in detail one or more embodiments with the understanding that the present disclosure is to be considered as an exemplification of the principles of the invention and is not intended to limit the invention to the embodiments illustrated.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","12","14","16","16","14","18","10","16","10"]},"Even when the conventionally recorded X-ray image  is digitised in a scanner and represented on a monitor with high contrast, the soft tissue structures  remain difficult to see. The reason for this is that the image signal components which reflect the finger bones , or other hard tissue of high density, have a very high signal level. Minor fluctuations in the signal level, which represent the soft tissue structures  of interest, scarcely have any impact in relation to the high signal levels of the finger bones . Although a high-quality monitor can sometimes still reproduce minor fluctuations in the signal level as intensity fluctuations, these are nevertheless so small that they are scarcely perceptible to the naked eye. The same moreover applies for PSL image plates (PSL=photostimulatable luminescence) which are not chemically developed, rather in which the X-ray image latently contained therein must be read out via an optomechanical scanning process before observation on a monitor.","In order to improve the perceptibility of the soft tissue structures , the digitised X-ray image  is therefore prepared in an image processing device , the structure of which is shown in . The image processing device  comprises a memory MEM, in which the digital image data generated in a scanner SCAN can be stored. The digital image data give intensities I(x, y) for each image point P=(x, y), each image point P being encodable with 16 bits, for example, so that more than 65,000 brightness values can be distinguished.","The memory MEM is connected to a Fourier transformation unit FT, by which the digital image data read out from the memory MEM can be subjected to a Fourier transformation. The frequency-space intensity distribution F(f, f) generated by the Fourier transformation unit FT is a complex function over the frequency space spanned by the coordinates fand fand, clearly, indicates an amplitude density spectrum.","The image processing device  furthermore comprises a filter unit FIL, by which the frequency-space intensity distribution F(f, f) can be filtered so that the weighting of different frequency ranges is modified. This will be explained in more detail below with reference to .","Lastly, the image processing device  comprises an inverse Fourier transformation unit FT, which transforms the frequency-space intensity distribution F\u2032 (f, f) filtered by the filter unit FIL back into the position space, so that a modified position-space intensity distribution I\u2032(x, y) is obtained. A monitor , on which the modified position-space intensity distribution I\u2032(x, y) can be displayed, may be connected to an output  of the image processing device .","The filtering of the frequency-space intensity distribution F(f, f) in the filter unit will be explained in more detail below with the aid of .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 3","sub":["1 ","2"]},"As can be seen in , against the relatively high signal level of the large-scale intensity distribution associated with the bone, the small-scale intensity distribution associated with the soft tissue structures fades into the background so that the relatively small fluctuations of the small-scale intensity distribution would be scarcely perceptible if the overall intensity distribution I(x) shown in  were to be displayed on a monitor.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"],"sub":["1 ","2","1 ","2 "]},"The filtering of the frequency-space intensity distribution F(f) is now carried out so that the amplitudes of the contributions at the frequency value fare reduced and the amplitudes of the contributions at the frequency value fare increased. This may, for example, be achieved by the following operations:\n\n\u2032()=() and\n\n\u2032()=(),\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nwhere rand rare gain factors with r<1 and r>1. The filtered frequency-space intensity distribution F\u2032(f) obtained by the filtering is shown in . As can be seen from a comparison with , the weighting of the signal components at the frequency fand of the signal components at the frequency fhas been modified in favour of the high-frequency image signal component at the frequency f.\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},"Owing to its restriction to cosinusoidal structures in only one dimension, the example presented above represents a very rough simplification, but one which highlights the essence of the filtering particularly clearly. In real images, however, the imaged structures have within wide limits an arbitrary profile, so that the frequency-space intensity distribution obtained by Fourier transformation represents a continuous function in the frequency. If only the amplitudes of individual frequencies were then to be raised or lowered, as is the case in the example presented above, then this would have only an unnoticeable effect on the resulting filtered image.","For this reason, the weighting of the image signal components is preferably carried out not just for individual discrete frequencies, but for frequency bands. Each frequency band, whose weighting is intended to be modified, is set with the aid of a suitable profile function. A Gaussian function is particularly suitable as a profile function, since it has the property of retaining the shape of a Gaussian function even after the inverse Fourier transformation. Weighting the image signal components by multiplication of the frequency-space intensity distribution with a Gaussian function therefore corresponds in the position space to convolution of the intensity distribution I(x, y) with a Gaussian function. This in turn has the effect that positions where the intensity distribution changes abruptly, and which therefore have a particularly high contrast, do not diverge spatially after the filtering.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 7","sub":["1","2","j","zj","j","z1 ","z2 ","1 ","2 ","1 ","2 ","1","2","1","z1 ","2","z2"],"br":[{},{}],"in-line-formulae":[{},{}],"i":["g","f","f","\u2212f","w"],"sup":["2","2"]},"Specifically, the filtering of the frequency-space intensity distribution F(f) in this case takes place according to the equation\n\n\u2032()=()\u00b7()\u2003\u2003(3)\n\nwhere T(f) is a filter function which is given by\n\n()=(1()(1())\u2003\u2003(4)\n","The gain coefficients rand rin this case indicate how strongly the Fourier amplitudes within the frequency ranges specified by the profile functions are intended to be modified. In the example represented, ris <0 since the Fourier amplitudes around fare to be reduced. For the gain coefficient ron the other hand, ris >0, which leads to an increase in the Fourier amplitudes.","The effects of the filtering represented in  on the frequency-space intensity distribution F(f) are shown in . Fourier amplitudes for frequencies which lie within the filter profiles g(f) and g(f) are respectively lowered and raised by filtering with the filter function T(f). In this way, large-scale structures of the finger bones  stand back from small-scale structures such as the tendons  on the image shown on the monitor , so that the latter are more easily perceptible for a doctor.","It can be seen from Equations (2) to (4) that the filtering of the frequency-space intensity distribution F(f) with the aid of the profile functions in the example presented is determined by the value pairs (f, w). In the example explained above with the aid of , the central values fare then also preferably to be selected so that the half period lengths corresponding to these frequencies fare approximately of the order of the dimensions of those structures which the filtering is intended to emphasise or attenuate in the image. If these typical structure sizes are the same for all conceivable applications, then the central values fas well as the profile widths wmay be set in advance in the image processing device . Preferably, however, these parameters are freely selectable by the doctor with the aid of interface elements ,  provided on the image processing device , in order to improve the perceptibility of the soft tissue structures. Depending on the magnification, the type and arrangement of the bones and the type of soft tissue structures to be studied, on the other hand, the respective characteristic dimensions may be quite different so that adjustment during observation of the monitor  generally leads to the best results.","As an alternative to this, the image signal components whose weighting is to be modified may also be set automatically by the image processing device  via an adaptive method. To this end, a treating doctor needs to establish which soft tissue structures should be represented more perceptibly. For this purpose, the doctor preferably selects an edge region of the relevant soft tissue structure and marks it. A marking denoted by  is shown by way of example in , which the doctor may produce on a monitor being used to display the X-ray image , for example using a cursor, and which in the example presented comprises two points and a line  connecting them.","The image processing device  then carries out the aforementioned filtering for a multiplicity of frequency ranges, and respectively checks the extent to which the contrast is thereby improved along the line  between the points of the marking . The modified intensity distribution then displayed is the one obtained from that filtering with which the highest contrast was obtained.","In the examples described so far, it has been assumed that the Fourier amplitudes are increased by the filtering in only one frequency range and the Fourier amplitudes are reduced in only one frequency range. In order to improve the perceptibility, however, it is only the amplitude ratio which is important, so that in principle one of the said measures may even be sufficient for improving the perceptibility. On the other hand, it may be expedient to modify Fourier amplitudes in more than two frequency ranges, in order to achieve the desired improvement of the representation. For the index j in Equations (2), (3) and (4), this means that it may take not only the values 1 and 2, but also larger values.\n\n()=\u03a0(1\u00b7exp(\u2212(\u2212\u221a{square root over ()})\/2)\u2003\u2003(3)\n\nsuch that it will read, as amended, as follows:\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":["T","F"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":["f","x"]},{"mi":["f","y"]}],"mo":","}}},{"munder":{"mo":"\u220f","mi":"j"},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":{"mo":"(","mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":"+","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["r","j"]},"mo":"\u00b7","mrow":{"mi":"exp","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mo":"-","msup":{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["f","zj"]},"mo":"-","msqrt":{"mrow":{"msubsup":[{"mi":["f","x"],"mn":"2"},{"mi":["f","y"],"mn":"2"}],"mo":"+"}}}},"mn":"2"}},"mo":"\/","mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2062","msubsup":{"mi":["w","j"],"mn":"2"}}}}}}}}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"3"}}]}}}}},"Furthermore, the filter function T(f, f) may also be multiplied by a further profile function in order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. If this profile function is for example a Gaussian function with the central frequency f=0 and a width w, which corresponds to the frequency at which the high-frequency image signal component becomes lost in the noise, then the image signal components will be amplified relative to the background noise. This choice of the profile function compensates for the fact that the Fourier amplitudes decrease with an increasing frequency f in the images often to be represented in practice, so that a constantly present noise signal usually predominates at high frequencies.","It is to be understood that the above comments and explanations of an exemplary embodiment are merely examples, and in particular not restricted to improving the perceptibility of soft tissue structures.
