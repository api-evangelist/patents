{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application entitled \u201cSYSTEM, METHOD AND COMPUTER PROGRAM PRODUCT FOR AN INFORMATION HUB\u201d filed provisionally Apr. 12, 2001 under Ser. No. 60\/283,775. The present application is a continuation-in-part of an application entitled \u201cSYSTEM, METHOD AND ARTICLE OF MANUFACTURE FOR WIRELESS ENABLEMENT OF THE WORLD WIDE WEB USING A WIRELESS GATEWAY,\u201d and filed Jun. 16, 2000 under the Ser. No. 09\/595,781, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,438,575 and which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The present invention relates to user interfaces and more particularly to generating intelligent network-based information hubs.","Information on the web exists in the form of hyperlinks that appear in different web sites. A news site for example may contain headlines that are hyperlinks to their detailed exposition. Custom Internet portals to display web-centric information exist (e.g., myYahoo, myLycos etc.). The level of customization is however, fairly minimal. In typical portals, the user chooses from a pre-determined set of headlines collected from a predetermined set of web-sites. The user has no control over either the web-sites he\/she gets the content from or the headlines that are taken from those web-sites. Further, the user has very little control over how the information is presented.","For example, if the user is interested in Indian politics, Soccer, Cricket, and Semiconductor High Tech companies, myYahoo allows the user to configure Yahoo's news source to filter through news on these topics. However, the user must take all this content strictly from Yahoo-selected content providers. This arrangement prohibits users from choosing not just the type of content but the source of the content as well. While, for example, a user may want to be able to receive world politics news from his two favorite Indian news dailies every morning, get his Hi-Tech news coverabe from Red Herring and Cnet, and get sports news from Cricket.org and dailysoccer.com, access to all these sites through a prior art internet portal would be predicated on the Internet portal offering access to all of the particular site via that particular portal.","What is needed is a method that allows the user to completely configure both the source and content that he\/she wants on his\/her own portal as well as allow others to access the portal. What is further needed is communications between portals of various users.","A system, method and computer program product are provided for network-based information management. A first habitat is initiated. The habitat is a personalized information management system that gathers, stores and displays information of interest to the user. The selection and presentation of the information is customizable by the user. Note that several users can be allowed to customize the same habitat. The information managed in the habitat can be viewed\/accessed by a client device, such as a computer, Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), web phone, wireless telephone, pager, or any other device capable of storing and\/or outputting the information, whether by a direct connection or via wireless transmission.","The first habitat has markers that are utilized for identifying information selected by a user. Such information can include text, graphics, video, audio, database information, outputs of applications, or any other type of content\/information. The markers can be automatically generated upon the user selecting desirable content. The markers can be pointers to the information stored locally as well as links to information stored remotely.","The information associated with the markers is retrieved from the data site, database, etc. and displayed on an information screen (such as a web page) of the first habitat utilizing a network which is preferably the Internet. Multiple users are allowed to view the information screen of the first habitat. Privileges for access can vary, and can be set by the user. The first habitat can access other habitats to retrieve information from them. Other habitats may also be allowed to access the first habitat.","In a preferred embodiment, the first habitat selects portions of the retrieved information for display based on user-input. Note that each of the habitats can have an assigned address such as a web address.","According to one embodiment of the present invention, a point-to-point connection between habitats can be created. Here, the first habitat connects directly to one or more habitats for selecting and retrieving the information from the habitat(s).","A peer to peer model for habitat-to-habitat information retrieval can also be provided. In this model, the first habitat sends out a request for desired information to a plurality of habitats and retrieves the desired information from one or more of the habitats that respond to the request preferably via a point-to-point connection.","According to another embodiment of the present invention, the first habitat is in communication with a plurality of habitats such that a sub-network of habitats is formed. This enables such things as real-time updates of the various habitats when content changes in one of the habitats. Also, a user viewing the information of the first habitat can \u201cjump\u201d to one of the other habitats to view the information available there.","According to yet another embodiment of the present invention, application-habitat communication is enabled. Thus, an application can communicate with the first habitat for retrieving information from the first habitat. Further, the first habitat can interact with the application for performing tasks such as presenting output of the application, for example.","A preferred embodiment of a system in accordance with the present invention is preferably practiced in the context of a personal computer such as an IBM compatible personal computer, Apple Macintosh computer or UNIX based workstation. A representative hardware environment is depicted in , which illustrates a typical hardware configuration of a workstation in accordance with a preferred embodiment having a central processing unit , such as a microprocessor, and a number of other units interconnected via a system bus . The workstation shown in  includes a Random Access Memory (RAM) , Read Only Memory (ROM) , an I\/O adapter  for connecting peripheral devices such as disk storage units  to the bus , a user interface adapter  for connecting a keyboard , a mouse , a speaker , a microphone , and\/or other user interface devices such as a touch screen (not shown) to the bus , communication adapter  for connecting the workstation to a communication network (e.g., a data processing network) and a display adapter  for connecting the bus  to a display device . The workstation typically has resident thereon an operating system such as the Microsoft Windows NT or Windows\/95 Operating System (OS), the IBM OS\/2 operating system, the MAC OS, or UNIX operating system. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the present invention may also be implemented on platforms and operating systems other than those mentioned.","A preferred embodiment is written using JAVA, C, and the C++ language and utilizes object oriented programming methodology. Object oriented programming (OOP) has become increasingly used to develop complex applications. As OOP moves toward the mainstream of software design and development, various software solutions require adaptation to make use of the benefits of OOP. A need exists for these principles of OOP to be applied to a messaging interface of an electronic messaging system such that a set of OOP classes and objects for the messaging interface can be provided.","OOP is a process of developing computer software using objects, including the steps of analyzing the problem, designing the system, and constructing the program. An object is a software package that contains both data and a collection of related structures and procedures. Since it contains both data and a collection of structures and procedures, it can be visualized as a self-sufficient component that does not require other additional structures, procedures or data to perform its specific task. OOP, therefore, views a computer program as a collection of largely autonomous components, called objects, each of which is responsible for a specific task. This concept of packaging data, structures, and procedures together in one component or module is called encapsulation.","In general, OOP components are reusable software modules which present an interface that conforms to an object model and which are accessed at run-time through a component integration architecture. A component integration architecture is a set of architecture mechanisms which allow software modules in different process spaces to utilize each others capabilities or functions. This is generally done by assuming a common component object model on which to build the architecture. It is worthwhile to differentiate between an object and a class of objects at this point. An object is a single instance of the class of objects, which is often just called a class. A class of objects can be viewed as a blueprint, from which many objects can be formed.","OOP allows the programmer to create an object that is a part of another object. For example, the object representing a piston engine is said to have a composition-relationship with the object representing a piston. In reality, a piston engine comprises a piston, valves and many other components; the fact that a piston is an element of a piston engine can be logically and semantically represented in OOP by two objects.","OOP also allows creation of an object that \u201cdepends from\u201d another object. If there are two objects, one representing a piston engine and the other representing a piston engine wherein the piston is made of ceramic, then the relationship between the two objects is not that of composition. A ceramic piston engine does not make up a piston engine. Rather it is merely one kind of piston engine that has one more limitation than the piston engine; its piston is made of ceramic. In this case, the object representing the ceramic piston engine is called a derived object, and it inherits all of the aspects of the object representing the piston engine and adds further limitation or detail to it. The object representing the ceramic piston engine \u201cdepends from\u201d the object representing the piston engine. The relationship between these objects is called inheritance.","When the object or class representing the ceramic piston engine inherits all of the aspects of the objects representing the piston engine, it inherits the thermal characteristics of a standard piston defined in the piston engine class. However, the ceramic piston engine object overrides these ceramic specific thermal characteristics, which are typically different from those associated with a metal piston. It skips over the original and uses new functions related to ceramic pistons. Different kinds of piston engines have different characteristics, but may have the same underlying functions associated with it (e.g., how many pistons in the engine, ignition sequences, lubrication, etc.). To access each of these functions in any piston engine object, a programmer would call the same functions with the same names, but each type of piston engine may have different\/overriding implementations of functions behind the same name. This ability to hide different implementations of a function behind the same name is called polymorphism and it greatly simplifies communication among objects.","With the concepts of composition-relationship, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism, an object can represent just about anything in the real world. In fact, one's logical perception of the reality is the only limit on determining the kinds of things that can become objects in object-oriented software. Some typical categories are as follows:\n\n","With this enormous capability of an object to represent just about any logically separable matters, OOP allows the software developer to design and implement a computer program that is a model of some aspects of reality, whether that reality is a physical entity, a process, a system, or a composition of matter. Since the object can represent anything, the software developer can create an object which can be used as a component in a larger software project in the future.","If 90% of a new OOP software program consists of proven, existing components made from preexisting reusable objects, then only the remaining 10% of the new software project has to be written and tested from scratch. Since 90% already came from an inventory of extensively tested reusable objects, the potential domain from which an error could originate is 10% of the program. As a result, OOP enables software developers to build objects out of other, previously built objects.","This process closely resembles complex machinery being built out of assemblies and sub-assemblies. OOP technology, therefore, makes software engineering more like hardware engineering in that software is built from existing components, which are available to the developer as objects. All this adds up to an improved quality of the software as well as an increased speed of its development.","Programming languages are beginning to fully support the OOP principles, such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and composition-relationship. With the advent of the C++ language, many commercial software developers have embraced OOP. C++ is an OOP language that offers a fast, machine-executable code. Furthermore, C++ is suitable for both commercial-application and systems programming projects. For now, C++ appears to be the most popular choice among many OOP programmers, but there is a host of other OOP languages, such as Smalltalk, Common Lisp Object System (CLOS), and Eiffel. Additionally, OOP capabilities are being added to more traditional popular computer programming languages such as Pascal.","The benefits of object classes can be summarized, as follows:\n\n","Class libraries are very flexible. As programs grow more complex, more programmers are forced to reinvent basic solutions to basic problems over and over again. A relatively new extension of the class library concept is to have a framework of class libraries. This framework is more complex and consists of significant collections of collaborating classes that capture both the small scale patterns and major mechanisms that implement the common requirements and design in a specific application domain. They were first developed to free application programmers from the chores involved in displaying menus, windows, dialog boxes, and other standard user interface elements for personal computers.","Frameworks also represent a change in the way programmers think about the interaction between the code they write and code written by others. In the early days of procedural programming, the programmer called libraries provided by the operating system to perform certain tasks, but basically the program executed down the page from start to finish, and the programmer was solely responsible for the flow of control. This was appropriate for printing out paychecks, calculating a mathematical table, or solving other problems with a program that executed in just one way.","The development of graphical user interfaces began to turn this procedural programming arrangement inside out. These interfaces allow the user, rather than program logic, to drive the program and decide when certain actions should be performed. Today, most personal computer software accomplishes this by means of an event loop which monitors the mouse, keyboard, and other sources of external events and calls the appropriate parts of the programmer's code according to actions that the user performs. The programmer no longer determines the order in which events occur. Instead, a program is divided into separate pieces that are called at unpredictable times and in an unpredictable order. By relinquishing control in this way to users, the developer creates a program that is much easier to use. Nevertheless, individual pieces of the program written by the developer still call libraries provided by the operating system to accomplish certain tasks, and the programmer must still determine the flow of control within each piece after it's called by the event loop. Application code still \u201csits on top of\u201d the system.","Even event loop programs require programmers to write a lot of code that should not need to be written separately for every application. The concept of an application framework carries the event loop concept further. Instead of dealing with all the nuts and bolts of constructing basic menus, windows, and dialog boxes and then making these things all work together, programmers using application frameworks start with working application code and basic user interface elements in place. Subsequently, they build from there by replacing some of the generic capabilities of the framework with the specific capabilities of the intended application.","Application frameworks reduce the total amount of code that a programmer has to write from scratch. However, because the framework is really a generic application that displays windows, supports copy and paste, and so on, the programmer can also relinquish control to a greater degree than event loop programs permit. The framework code takes care of almost all event handling and flow of control, and the programmer's code is called only when the framework needs it (e.g., to create or manipulate a proprietary data structure).","A programmer writing a framework program not only relinquishes control to the user (as is also true for event loop programs), but also relinquishes the detailed flow of control within the program to the framework. This approach allows the creation of more complex systems that work together in interesting ways, as opposed to isolated programs, having custom code, being created over and over again for similar problems.","Thus, as is explained above, a framework basically is a collection of cooperating classes that make up a reusable design solution for a given problem domain. It typically includes objects that provide default behavior (e.g., for menus and windows), and programmers use it by inheriting some of that default behavior and overriding other behavior so that the framework calls application code at the appropriate times.","There are three main differences between frameworks and class libraries:\n\n","Thus, through the development of frameworks for solutions to various problems and programming tasks, significant reductions in the design and development effort for software can be achieved. A preferred embodiment of the invention utilizes HyperText Markup Language (HTML) to implement documents on the Internet together with a general-purpose secure communication protocol for a transport medium between the client and the Newco. HTTP or other protocols could be readily substituted for HTML without undue experimentation. Information on these products is available in T. Bemers-Lee, D. Connoly, \u201cRFC 1866: Hypertext Markup Language-2.0\u201d (Nov. 1995); and R. Fielding, H, Frystyk, T. Berners-Lee, J. Gettys and J. C. Mogul, \u201cHypertext Transfer Protocol\u2014HTTP\/1.1:HTTP Working Group Internet Draft\u201d (May 2, 1996). HTML is a simple data format used to create hypertext documents that are portable from one platform to another. HTML documents are SGML documents with generic semantics that are appropriate for representing information from a wide range of domains. HTML has been in use by the World-Wide Web global information initiative since 1990. HTML is an application of ISO Standard 8879; 1986 Information Processing Text and Office Systems; Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML).","To date, Web development tools have been limited in their ability to create dynamic Web applications which span from client to server and interoperate with existing computing resources. Until recently, HTML has been the dominant technology used in development of Web-based solutions. However, HTML has proven to be inadequate in the following areas:\n\n","Sun Microsystem's Java language solves many of the client-side problems by:\n\n","With Java, developers can create robust User Interface (UI) components. Custom \u201cwidgets\u201d (e.g., real-time stock tickers, animated icons, etc.) can be created, and clientside performance is improved. Unlike HTML, Java supports the notion of client-side validation, offloading appropriate processing onto the client for improved performance. Dynamic, real-time Web pages can be created. Using the above-mentioned custom UI components, dynamic Web pages can also be created.","Sun's Java language has emerged as an industry-recognized language for \u201cprogramming the Internet.\u201d Sun defines Java as: \u201ca simple, object-oriented, distributed, interpreted, robust, secure, architecture-neutral, portable, high-performance, multithreaded, dynamic, buzzword-compliant, general-purpose programming language. Java supports programming for the Internet in the form of platform-independent Java applets.\u201d Java applets are small, specialized applications that comply with Sun's Java Application Programming Interface (API) allowing developers to add \u201cinteractive content\u201d to Web documents (e.g., simple animations, page adornments, basic games, etc.). Applets execute within a Java-compatible browser (e.g., Netscape Navigator) by copying code from the server to client. From a language standpoint, Java's core feature set is based on C++. Sun's Java literature states that Java is basically, \u201cC++ with extensions from Objective C for more dynamic method resolution.\u201d","Another technology that provides similar function to JAVA is provided by Microsoft and ActiveX Technologies, to give developers and Web designers wherewithal to build dynamic content for the Internet and personal computers. ActiveX includes tools for developing animation, 3-D virtual reality, video and other multimedia content. The tools use Internet standards, work on multiple platforms, and are being supported by over 100 companies. The group's building blocks are called ActiveX Controls, small, fast components that enable developers to embed parts of software in hypertext markup language (HTML) pages. ActiveX Controls work with a variety of programming languages including Microsoft Visual C++, Borland Delphi, Microsoft Visual Basic programming system and, in the future, Microsoft's development tool for Java, code named \u201cJakarta.\u201d ActiveX Technologies also includes ActiveX Server Framework, allowing developers to create server applications. One of ordinary skill in the art readily recognizes that ActiveX could be substituted for JAVA without undue experimentation to practice the invention.","Information Portal","The present invention allows a user to create an information portal whose source and content is completely customizable. Information on the web exists in the form of hyperlinks that appear in different web sites. A news site for example may contain headlines that are hyperlinks to their detailed exposition. In typical portals, the user chooses from a pre-determined set of headlines collected from a pre-determined set of web-sites. The user has no control over either the web-sites he\/she gets the content from or the headlines that are taken from those web-sites. The present invention allows the user to completely configure both the source and content that he\/she wants on his\/her own portal.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0078"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","202","204","206","208","210","212","214"]},"In one embodiment of the present invention, the information screen may include a plurality of different views. Each view may contain at least one window for displaying the marked information. Further, the user may be allowed to select, maximize, minimize, refresh and edit the content of the window.","In another embodiment of the present invention, the user may be allowed to share the views with other users such as via electronic mail or by permitting access to the views. As an option, the marked information may be presented on the information screen over a configurable number of days in the past. Further, the user may be allowed to drag and drop the information from the customizing interface to the information screen. The information may also be marked upon dropping the information in the information screen.","In still yet another embodiment, the step of marking the selected information may include determining an address of the selected information and a table, row, column, and\/or cell of the selected information. Further, the step of checking for change of the marked information may include the steps of determining whether the content of the marked information has changed and determining whether the format of the marked information has changed. As yet another option, the step of checking for change of the marked information may be performed at predetermined intervals.","According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the user is presented with a page that contains the user's information of choice from an arbitrary number of different sources and presented in a completely customizable format. The page consists of different \u201cviews\u201d where each view in turn contains multiple windows. The number of views and the number of windows in each view can be configured.","Each particular window contains hyperlinks that have been selected by the user from web-sites of his\/her choice. A window may for instance be dedicated for international news and could contain hyperlinks selected by the user from any number of web-sites of his\/her choice. The user has complete freedom in selecting the source of his\/her content (i.e. the web-site) and the content from that source (i.e. the hyperlinks).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0084"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","302","304","306","308","310"]},"Another embodiment of the present invention includes the following parts: (a) An interface that displays the user customized information, (b) an interface that allows the user to select and manage the information of choice, (c) a mechanism for marking selected information contained in a web-page (d) a method for communicating that information to the backend servers that process and store that information, (e) a mechanism for the storage of the selected information (f) a mechanism for regularly retrieving selected information and (g) a mechanism for checking for change in the content or the format of the selected sources of information.","The User Interface to Display Preferred Content.","The user interface comprises \u201cviews\u201d, each of which contain multiple windows. The number of windows in a view is completely configurable. The user may create or delete as many views as he\/she may desire. This user interface allows a user to cleanly categorize related information within individual windows and views. This provides a user one place to access all of his\/her favorite information and content from the web. This content includes (but is not limited to) (a) News and Information headlines (of all sorts) (b) Information about email, bank and other accounts (c) Information about shopping and comparison of rates and prices (d) Graphs, Images, Sounds or any other media.","This content is presented to the user with an ability to edit and manage it intuitively and interactively. Some of the features of the management process include (a) a presentation of the user's selected information over a configurable number of days in the past (b) an ability to select, maximize, minimize, refresh or edit the content of individual windows (c) to \u201cpublish\u201d user's views into a directory of views and (d) to share these views with other people by emailing them the views.","The Interface for Selection and Management of Preferred Content.","The interface that allows the user to create his\/her customized portal is based on an intuitive drag and drop capability. The user simply selects the sources or headlines of choice and drags and drops them into windows and views of choice. The drag and drop feature also makes customization very easy for the user, allowing quick compilation and management of their preferred content. There are two levels of selection and management provided, default and advanced.","Referring to , in a default mode process  for allowing selection and management of preferred content according to one embodiment of the present invention, a user is presented with a set of web-sites or other sources of content in operation . In operation , the user is allowed to select a site and then drag and drop it into a window of choice. Once that is done, pre-selected content from that source is automatically added to the window in operation .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0090"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","502","504","506"]},"The Mechanism for Tagging Selected Information Contained in a Web-Page.","Web-pages are created using HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language). The content in a web-page is formatted using a tabular format where each table is composed of individual cells distributed into a number of rows and columns. A table may contain other tables within its individual cells. The tagging of selected information within a web-page hinges upon assigning an address to each item of content within the webpage. The addressing scheme takes into account the table(s), row(s), column(s) and cell(s) an item of content belongs to. An item of content can be identified by its address within a web-page and (ii) all the addressing schemes that take into account the table(s), row(s), column(s) and cell(s) an item of content belongs to. The addressing scheme works as follows:","The page is viewed to be composed of tables that may themselves contain other tables. The tables that are not contained in any other table (highest-level tables) are assigned identifying numbers starting from 1. Tables contained within the highest-level tables are assigned numbers that take into account the tables that contain them. If a table is not contained in any other table, then it may be assigned a number, say 3. If table number  contains two tables, then they will be assigned numbers 3-1 and 3-2 respectively. Each table is composed of a unique number of rows and columns. Each item of content resides within a cell that belongs to a specific row and column of a table. The complete address of an item of content is then the unique identifier of the table that contains it and the position of that item of content within that table.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0093"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","602","604","606","608"]},"This mechanism also allows a capture of configurable sections of a web-page, including individual words, lines, paragraphs.","In the case of secure information like email or bank accounts, the mechanism followed is shown in , which is a flow diagram of a process  for tagging secure information contained in a web-page. First, in operation , forms are created to allow a user to log into their accounts. These forms consist of (a) Dynamic information (like the user name and password) which is captured during the session (b) Static information that is required by the remote account server which is stored in a database and retrieved when an account is selected. Using the dynamic and static information, the server logs into the remote server in operation . The account information is retrieved in operation  and, in operation , the account information is presented in a suitable and configurable format.","The Mechanism for Local Storage or Caching of Selected Content.","The selected information is cached or stored locally to enable a faster access. Once a web site is selected by a user, a copy of the site, including text and images, is kept locally in the servers. When any user requests a page that has been requested before, the cached copy is presented if the content of the site has not changed since the time the page was cached. The process is broken down into two: Simple and Customized addition of content:","Addition of Default Content","The addition of default content proceeds as follows:\n\n","In the case of addition of customized content, the process is as follows:\n\n","Once a hyperlink is dropped into a window, information is passed by the window to the backend servers. This information includes the address of the hyperlink, as defined above. In addition, the information about the window and the view containing that window is also sent to the server. This information is then used by scripts to generate the front page in HTML.","The Mechanism for Regular Retrieval of Preferred Content from Selected Sites.","The power of the current invention is that refreshed content is retrieved from the selected sources of information as they are updated. The sources of information, or web sites, selected by users are cached locally. The web pages stored locally are categorized according to the number of times they are requested. High request sites are retrieved once every few hours, for example.","The Mechanism to Check for a Change of Content or Format in the Selected Sources of Information.","Once a page has been requested by a user, it is retrieved on a regular basis. There are two checks performed to find out a change in the information in the page. The first involves a change in the content of the page and the second a change in the format in which the content is presented.","Change in a Page's Content:","Every time a page is retrieved, a copy is kept locally on servers. Once a page is automatically retrieved, the content from the newly retrieved version of the page is compared to the content from a previous version of the page. If there is a change in the content, then the updated content is retrieved.","A Change in the Format of the Content:","The formatting of the content in a page is stored in terms of a complete addressing scheme for the page, which specifies the breakdown of the page into its sub-sections. Once there is a change in the formatting of the page, then the relations of different subsections of the page to their parent sections change. A mechanism is implemented that keeps track of the number of differences between the format of a previously stored version of the page and the newly retrieved version. An alert is sent to the users if the number of differences is greater than a configurable number.","Habitat",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0081","num":"0112"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["800","802","804","806","808","810","812"]},"Information on the web exists in the form of hyperlinks that appear in different web sites.

The first habitat is allowed to access other habitats in operation  for retrieving information from the other habitats.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, other habitats retrieve information from the first habitat and\/or other habitats. In an example of use, a first user has similar interests in investing as a second user, but the first user is not as adept at finding investment news.

The first habitat would then perform an analysis on the information in the second habitat either prior to or after retrieval to select only the information pertinent to the Nasdaq for display. Such analysis can include a key word search, such as a search for \u201cNasdaq\u201d or the symbol of a particular stock known to be listed on the Nasdaq. Note that each of the habitats can have an assigned address such as a web address.","According to one embodiment of the present invention, a point-to-point connection between habitats can be created. Here, the first habitat connects directly to one or more habitats for selecting and retrieving the information from the habitat(s).","A peer to peer model for habitat-to-habitat information retrieval can also be provided. In this model, the first habitat sends out a request for desired information to a plurality of habitats and retrieves the desired information from one or more of the habitats that respond to the request preferably via a point-to-point connection.","According to another embodiment of the present invention, the first habitat is in communication with a plurality of habitats such that a sub-network of habitats is formed. This enables such things as real-time updates of the various habitats when content changes in one of the habitats. Also, a user viewing the information of the first habitat can \u201cjump\u201d to one of the other habitats to view the information available there.","According to yet another embodiment of the present invention, application-habitat communication is enabled. Thus, an application can communicate with the first habitat for retrieving information from the first habitat. Further, the first habitat can interact with the application for performing tasks such as presenting output of the application, for example.","A customizable information retrieval engine has thus been described that allows users to aggregate content of their choice from any web-site in existence. The content may include, but is not restricted to: text (i.e. news headlines, hyperlinks in web-pages), secure account information (i.e. email, bank accounts, utilities, and stock portfolios), services (i.e. maps, directions, weather, web searches), financial transactions (i.e. online shopping, buying, selling, trading, auctions, barters, comparisons) and other dynamic tasks that involve interaction of the users with other web-based (client and server side) services. The aggregated content may be displayed in a customized web-based habitat, which is amenable to presentation and content customization through an intuitive interface.","Gateway",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0093","num":"0124"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["1002","1004","1006"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0094","num":"0125"},"figref":"FIG. 11","b":["1100","1102","1104","1106","1108","1110","1112"]},"Again, such data can be text, secure account information, services, output of an application, financial transactions, etc. In an embodiment of the present invention, the data may be aggregated on a portal page of the habitat, where the portal page is unique to the user.","According to one embodiment of the present invention, the function is for manipulating the data for output on a particular type of client device. For example, the data in the habitat can be wireless enabled by applying a wireless function to the data to format the data for output on a wireless device, as set forth above with reference to . Preferably, the application of the function to the aggregated data in the habitat includes identifying a client device of the user to which the aggregated data is to be sent, determining a communications protocol compatible with the client device, and formatting the aggregated data at the network server utilizing the communications protocol for output to the client device.","In another embodiment of the present invention, the function is for voice enabling the aggregated data such as converting textual content into audible synthesized speech. Such voice enablement can also include speech recognition technology to convert spoken user input into commands for accessing and\/or manipulating the data. A variety of commercial quality, speech recognition engines are readily available on the market, as practitioners will know. For example, Nuance Communications offers a suite of speech recognition engines, including Nuance , its current flagship product, and Nuance Express, a lower cost package for entry-level applications. As one other example, IBM offers the ViaVoice speech recognition engine, including a low-cost shrink-wrapped version available through popular consumer distribution channels. Basically, a speech recognition engine processes acoustic voice data and attempts to generate a text stream of recognized words.","It should be noted that the above-mentioned functions are set forth by way of example, and that many types of functions can be applied to the data in the habitat in accordance with the present invention.","The retrieved data can be updated form the network after a predetermined amount of time has expired and the process depicted in  repeated. The user can also be allowed to interact with the data.","Preferably, an alert is sent to the client device upon occurrence of a prespecified condition such as an update of the data, etc. As stated in more detail above, the client device can be a personal digital assistant (PDA), a personal (including laptop) computer, a handheld computer, a wireless or hardwired telephone, a device connected to a wireless modem, a pager, etc.","While various embodiments have been described above, it should be understood that they have been presented by way of example only, and not limitation. Thus, the breadth and scope of a preferred embodiment should not be limited by any of the above described exemplary embodiments, but should be defined only in accordance with the following claims and their equivalents."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The invention will be better understood when consideration is given to the following detailed description thereof Such description makes reference to the annexed drawings wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 11"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
