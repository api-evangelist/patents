title: Simplified etching technique for producing multiple undercut profiles
abstract: A process for producing multiple undercut profiles in a single material. A resist pattern is applied over a work piece and a wet etch is performed to produce an undercut in the material. This first wet etch is followed by a polymerizing dry etch that produces a polymer film in the undercut created by the first wet etch. The polymer film prevents further etching of the undercut portion during a second wet etch. Thus, an undercut profile can be obtained having a larger undercut in an underlying portion of the work piece, utilizing only a single resist application step. The work piece may be a multi-layer work piece having different layers formed of the same material, or it may be a single layer of material.

No. 6,514,422, issued on Feb. 4, 2003, which is a divisional of application Ser. No. 09\/249,787, filed Feb. 16, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,235,638, issued on May 22, 2001, the entire content of which is hereby incorporated by reference in this application.","This invention was made with United States Government support under Contract Nos. DABT63-93-C-0025 and MDA972-92-C-0054 awarded by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA). The United States Government has certain rights in this invention.","The present invention relates to a semiconductor manufacturing technique that reduces the cost and complexity of producing multiple undercut profiles in the same material. For example, the present invention provides a simplified etch process capable of generating two different undercut profiles in the same material, such as silicon dioxide or the like, using a single lithographic step during the manufacture of flat-panel field emission display (FED) devices.","Conventional semiconductor techniques commonly utilize lithographic techniques to selectively place a pattern on a work piece during manufacture. For example, lithography may be used to apply a resist pattern over a layer of material such as silicon dioxide. An etching process then removes portions of the silicon dioxide that remain exposed after the photoresist pattern is printed over the silicon dioxide layer. Such an etching process allows a manufacturer to obtain a desired structure in the underlying material. The photoresist pattern is typically removed after etching and the work piece may be processed further by the deposition of additional material layers and further selective etchings. Mechanical operations such as chemical-mechanical planarization (CMP) and other processes may also be used in the manufacturing process.","One difficulty that has been encountered in prior manufacturing techniques is based on the requirement that the various layers of the semiconductor device be aligned with a relatively high degree of alignment accuracy. Unfortunately, lithographic printing techniques may be somewhat limited in alignment accuracy and resolution. For example, one resist pattern may be slightly offset relative to the underlying work piece. If a subsequent resist layer is also offset, possibly in a direction different from the first offset direction then a defect may result, lowering the effective yield of the manufacturing process. Similarly, the resolution of the printing process might not allow for fine detail that would permit certain structures to be obtained. Thus, it may be necessary to introduce a relatively large \u201cmargin of error\u201d into the manufacturing process by producing features that are large enough to accommodate misalignments. Of course, this limits the degree of miniaturization that may be achieved in the manufacturing operation.","Each photolithographic\/etching step entails the expenditure of time and resources, adding to the costs of manufacture. Moreover, each photolithographic\/etching step carries with it the possibility of errors or defects and, consequently, potentially reduced yields. Thus, from the standpoint of size, cost and yield, it is desirable to minimize the number of photolithographic steps performed during the manufacturing operation.","It is a primary objective of the present invention to provide a simplified etch process that avoids difficulties encountered in prior art manufacturing techniques, and is capable of producing two different undercut profiles in a work piece using a single lithographic step. The present invention may find application, for example, in the manufacture of flat-panel field emission displays (FEDs). However, the invention is not limited to FEDs and may be used in connection with manufacturing processes for other devices such as micromachines that may require undercut structures within a base material.","In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, a method for producing an undercut profile in a work piece includes forming a resist pattern on a top surface of the work piece. Apertures in the resist pattern expose portions of the work piece where an undercut profile is to be created. A first etch is performed on the portions of the work piece exposed by the resist pattern to remove material from the work piece and to create a selected undercut in the work piece. A second etch is then performed on the work piece to remove additional material from the work piece and to produce a polymer film that at least partially fills the selected undercut created by the first etch. A third etch removes yet more material from the work piece and creates an additional selected undercut in the work piece. Finally, the resist pattern is stripped and the polymer film is removed.","The first etch and the third etch may each be a wet etch process, and the second etch may be a polymerizing dry etch process. The work piece may be a single layer of material or may include a plurality of material layers wherein at least two of the material layers are formed of the same material.","In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, a simplified etch process capable of generating selected undercut profiles in a work piece performs a first wet etch of portions of the work piece to create a first undercut in the work piece. A polymer film is then formed over side surfaces of the first undercut to inhibit further etching of the first undercut during subsequent etching operations. Then, a second wet etch of portions of the work piece is performed to create a second undercut in the work piece. In a preferred implementation the polymer film is formed by a polymerizing dry etch. The etching steps may be controlled by a resist pattern formed on the work piece prior to etching. The resist pattern and the polymer film are then removed following the final etching step.","In accordance with yet another aspect of the present invention, a method used in the manufacture of a flat-panel field emission display forms a resist pattern over a field emission display base structure which includes a plurality of material layers arranged on a substrate, with at least a first material layer and a second material layer being formed of the same material. The resist pattern has a plurality of apertures that define portions of the base structure that are to be etched. The first material layer is etched at the defined portions with an etching process that creates an undercut in the first material layer. The defined portions of the base structure are etched with a polymerizing etch process to form a polymer film at the undercut made in the first material layer. The second material layer is then etched at the defined portions with an etching process that creates an undercut in the second material layer. After the second material layer is etched, the polymer film and the resist pattern are removed.","In one implementation, the first material layer and the second material layer are insulation layers formed of silicon dioxide. In that case, the steps of etching the first and second material layers are each wet etch processes utilizing hydrogen fluoride. Moreover, the base structure may include a top passivation layer of silicon nitride. In that case, a dry etch of the silicon nitride layer is performed at the portions of the base structure defined by the apertures in the resist pattern prior to etching the first layer.","In accordance with yet another aspect of the present invention, a non-horizontal surface of a first material is defined within a semiconductor device. The semiconductor device is exposed to a first material-etching substance and the non-horizontal surface is protected from the material-etching substance. For example, the non-horizontal surface may be protected by forming a polymer on the surface.","A further aspect of the invention provides a method for profiling a semiconductor device by providing a patterned mask over the semiconductor material, performing a first etch of the material while guiding the first etch with the mask, adding a polymer to an etched portion of the material, and performing a second etch of the material while guiding the second etch with the mask and the polymer. Additionally, in one aspect of the present invention, a method is provided for producing multiple undercut profiles within a semiconductor device. A plurality of levels is defined within the semiconductor device using a plurality of etches. A polymer is generated on a side of at least one of the levels after at least one etch of the plurality of etches, and at least one etch of the plurality of etches is performed after the polymer is generated. As an example, the plurality of layers in the semiconductor device may be a plurality of layers within an insulator.","These and other aspects of the present invention are set forth in greater detail below and in the appended claims. It should be noted that the foregoing description of the various aspects of the invention is not exhaustive and should not be considered to limit the present invention. Instead, the invention is intended to cover various modifications and equivalent arrangements included within the scope of the claims.","The present invention is described in the context of exemplary embodiments. However, the scope of the invention is not limited to the particular embodiments described in the application. Rather, the description merely reflects what are currently considered to be the most practical and preferred embodiments, and serves to illustrate the principles and characteristics of the present invention. Those skilled in the art will recognize that various modifications and refinements may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.","It is known that certain dry etch processes produce a carbonaceous polymer film on the work piece being etched. Such a polymer film can reduce the effectiveness of further etching and is ordinarily viewed as a problem or nuisance that should be minimized or removed during the etching process. See, e.g., S. Wolf and R. N Tauber, Silicon Processing for the VLSI Era, Vol. 1\u2014Process Technology, Lattice Press, 1986, pp. 547\u2013555. However, in accordance with one aspect of the present invention, a carbonaceous polymer film is purposely produced and allowed to remain on the work piece during further etching processes. The polymer film is then utilized in a way that permits a simplified etch process to produce a structure having multiple undercut profiles.","The formation of a carbonaceous polymer film on a work piece is described briefly in connection with ) and (). It should be appreciated that this description is merely for the background purpose of illustrating the formation of a polymer film during etching. Workers in the field will recognize various alternative arrangements to which the principles of the present invention may be applied. Referring now to ), a work piece  includes a quartz substrate  material having a horizontal surface  on which a conductive layer , such as chrome, is arranged. A resist pattern  is printed with a lithographic technique or otherwise formed on the work piece to act as an etch-guiding layer during subsequent etching. Other techniques for applying the resist pattern are known in the art and would include, for example, coating the work piece  with a photoresist material, exposing the photoresist to a light pattern to cure the photoresist, and removing the uncured portions of the photoresist.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 1(","FIG. 1("],"i":["b","b"],"b":["4","4","10","12","8"]},"In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, a polymer film may be utilized to selectively shield materials from further etching and thereby allow selected degrees of undercut structures to be produced in the end product. In other words, the polymer may be purposely used as an etch-guiding liner to protect a non-horizontal surface from further etching. A non-limiting exemplary process in accordance with this aspect of the invention is described in connection with ) through ().",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 2(","i":"a","b":["11","13","14","13","16","18","14","16","18","14","18"],"sub":"2"},"It should be noted that various available techniques for forming a work piece structure such as is illustrated in ) are well known in the art. Accordingly, the specific processes that may be used in forming such a work piece need not be described here.","With reference to ), a wet etch process utilizing, for example, a hydrofluoric acid or hydrogen fluoride (HF) ambient may be used to etch the silicon dioxide material layer  at the location exposed by the resist pattern . As shown, the HF wet etch creates an undercut in the silicon dioxide material layer  beneath the resist pattern . Thus, the resist pattern  acts as a mask having openings through which the etchant creates a first perimeter in the underlying material. The etch time and operating parameters depend upon the desired degree of undercut, the etchant being used, the material being etched, and other factors, as is well understood in the art. A detailed discussion of the specific parameters of a wet etch process that may be utilized in connection with ) is therefore not provided herein.","Following the wet etch operation, a polymerizing dry etch process is applied to the silicon dioxide material layer . A number of well-known polymerizing dry etch processes using various ambients and operating parameters are available. The particular dry etch technique utilized will depend on the particular application, and an appropriate technique may be readily selected and applied by workers ordinarily skilled in etching. However, in the disclosed exemplary embodiment, a dry etch which produces little undercut in the etched material is used. Depending on the particular application, it may also be possible to utilize a dry etch process that does create a degree of undercut in the etched material.","As shown in ), the dry etch process fills the undercut portion of the silicon dioxide material layer  with a polymer film \u201cplug\u201d  which lines the exposed vertical surface of material layer . Compared to a wet etch, the dry etch used in this example has a reduced likelihood of producing a significant undercut in the etched material. Thus, although a slight undercut of silicon dioxide material layer  is shown in ), the etched portion substantially underlies the area exposed by the resist pattern . It should be noted that ) shows the silicon dioxide material layer  completely etched through. However, particularly because the work piece will be exposed to further wet etching, it is not necessary for the silicon dioxide material layer  to be completely etched at this time.","After the dry etch, the work piece is again subjected to a wet etch process to establish an undercut in the silicon dioxide material layer , as illustrated in ). Again, the degree of undercut is determined by the etching time and operating parameters employed in the wet etch. Undesired further etching of the silicon dioxide material layer  is prevented by the presence of the polymer film plugs . Thus, the material layer  may have a larger undercut than the overlying material layer . As a result, a second perimeter is etched in the semiconductor material while the first perimeter is generally retained by virtue of the protective polymer lining of film plug . Finally, the resist pattern  is stripped from the work piece and the polymer film plug  is removed. The resulting structure is illustrated in ).","The foregoing technique for producing multiple undercut profiles requires only a single lithographic step. This provides significant benefits over prior techniques that would require multiple lithographic steps, and may find application in many technical areas. One such area is the manufacture of flat-panel field emission displays (FEDs), as described below. However, it should be understood that the broadest aspects of the present invention are not limited to the manufacture of FEDs.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["30","32","34","36","34","34"]},"Conical micro-cathode field emitter tips  are constructed over the base  at the field emission cathode site. A base electrode resistive layer (not shown in ) may be provided between the conductive material layer  and the field emitter tips . The resistive layer may be formed, for example, from silicon that has been doped to provide an appropriate degree of resistance. A low potential anode gate structure or conductive grid  formed, for example, of doped polycrystalline silicon is arranged adjacent the field emitters . An insulating layer  separates the grid  from the base electrode conductive material layer . The insulating layer  may be formed, for example, from silicon dioxide.","Proper functioning of the emitter tips requires operation in a vacuum. Thus, a plurality of columnar supports or spacers  is provided over the base assembly  to support a display screen  against atmospheric pressure. The spacers  may be formed in a number of conventional ways. Appropriate techniques for forming the spacers  are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,205,770 issued Apr. 27, 1993 to Lowrey et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,232,549 issued Aug. 3, 1993 to Cathey at al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,484,314 issued Jan. 16, 1996 to Farnworth, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,486,126 issued Jan. 23, 1996.","In operation, the display screen  acts as an anode so that field emissions from the emitter tips , represented by arrows , strike phosphor coating  on the screen . The field emissions excite the phosphor coatings  to generate light. A field emission is produced from an emitter tip when a voltage controller  establishes a voltage differential between the emitter tip and the anode structures.","Various techniques are known in the art for selectively activating a display segment. For example, the grid  and screen  could be held at a constant voltage potential and emitter tips selectively switched through column and row signals. In such an arrangement, the patterned conductive material layer  that forms the cathode base electrodes is arranged as a matrix that is addressable through column and row control signals. Alternatively, the base electrode conductors could be arranged in rows and the grid  arranged in columns perpendicular to the rows of cathode base electrodes. Row control address signals to the cathode base electrodes and column control address signals to the grid column segments selectably activate display segments. Finally, the cathodes could be held at a constant voltage potential and a switched anode scheme utilized for the display screen .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIGS. 4("],"i":["a","f"],"b":"4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 4(","i":"a","b":["60","62","64","60","64","66","68","70","72","74","76","74"],"sub":["3","4"]},"Turning now to ), the silicon nitride layer  is selectively etched by a dry etch process. As a result, an opening is established in the silicon nitride layer  over the cathode emitter tip . Because the particular dry etchant utilized is chosen to etch the nitride layer , there is no significant etching of the underlying silicon dioxide layer .","A first wet etch of the silicon dioxide layer  is performed next, as shown in ). The wet etch creates an undercut or recession in the silicon dioxide layer  under the end portions of the underlying silicon nitride layer . Although the wet etch may remove a portion of the silicon dioxide layer , it is not necessary that this layer be completely etched at this point.","With reference to ), the first silicon dioxide wet etch is followed by a dry etch of the silicon dioxide layer . The dry etch causes a polymer film  to build up in the undercut or recessed portion of the silicon dioxide layer . The polymer film  protects the silicon dioxide layer  during later wet etching. Because the silicon dioxide layer  will be subsequently subjected to a further wet etch, it is not necessary that the dry etch expose the cathode emitter tip . Instead, the operating parameters of the dry etch should be selected to optimize creation of the polymer film .","The silicon dioxide dry etch is then followed by a second silicon dioxide wet etch. The second silicon dioxide wet etch removes the portion of the silicon dioxide layer  remaining around the cathode emitter tip  and establishes a desired degree of undercut or recession in the silicon dioxide layer , as illustrated in ). Upon completion of the second wet etch, the resist pattern  is stripped and the polymer film  is removed using, for example, an oxygen plasma. The resultant structure is shown in ).","In summary, the base structure of ) may be processed in accordance with one aspect of the present invention to provide a resultant structure useful in manufacturing an FED. Specifically, in the example process discussed above, the base structure is subjected to a dry etch of the silicon nitride layer  to expose the underlying silicon dioxide layer . A wet etch of the silicon dioxide layer  establishes an undercut that is then covered by a protective polymer film  during a polymerizing dry etch of the silicon dioxide. A second wet etch of the silicon dioxide is then performed to remove a portion of the silicon dioxide layer  and expose the emitter tip . Finally, the resist pattern  is stripped and the polymer film  is removed to obtain the resultant structure shown in ). This resultant structure may then be subjected to further manufacturing steps to add spacers (see spacers  of  and a display screen.","The present invention is not limited to operation on multi-layer work pieces. Indeed, the principles of the present invention may be utilized in a single layer material to create desired custom cross-sectional profiles. Referring to ), a material layer  of, for example, silicon dioxide is provided with a resist pattern .","A first wet etch of the silicon dioxide material  is performed to produce the undercut portions  shown in ). A dry etch then generates a protective polymer film  in the undercut portion and removes additional silicon dioxide from the area  of ). Next, a second wet etch produces the structure shown in ), including further undercut portions . Following stripping of the resist material  and removal of the polymer film , the resultant structure of ) is obtained.","One possible use of the structure illustrated in ) is in connection with micromachines. In particular, the enlarged area defined by the undercut portions  can provide space for rotating members of a micromachine and the opening established by the smaller undercut portion  can permit a drive shaft or the like to extend beyond the top surface of the silicon dioxide layer .","Shapes other than that illustrated in ) are also possible. For example, certain etching processes are known to follow the lines of the crystal being etched. Such an etching process could be used to produce a profile such as is illustrated in .","It is also possible to repeat the process described in connection with ) through () to produce undercut profiles having a number of \u201csteps,\u201d as shown, for example, in . Specifically, the profile of  could be produced by performing an additional dry etch following the second wet etch ()). A third wet etch would follow the additional dry etch to produce a profile such as the profile shown in .","The structures and profiles produced in the manner described above are examples of may that may be produced in accordance with the features and principles of the present invention.
