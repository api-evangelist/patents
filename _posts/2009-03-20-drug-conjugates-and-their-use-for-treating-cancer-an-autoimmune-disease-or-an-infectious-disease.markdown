No. 10\/522,911, filed Jul. 7, 2005 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,659,241, which was filed under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7371 as a national stage application of International Application No. PCT\/US2003\/24209, filed Jul. 31, 2003; which further claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119(e) of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60\/400,403, filed Jul. 31, 2002. The disclosures of each of the foregoing applications are hereby incorporated herein by reference.","The present invention is directed to Drug-Linker-Ligand Conjugates and to Drug-Linker Compounds, to compositions comprising a Drug-Linker-Ligand Conjugate or a Drug-Linker Compound, and to methods for using the same to treat cancer, an autoimmune disease or an infectious disease.","Several short peptidic compounds have been isolated from natural sources and found to have biological activity. Analogs of these compounds have also been prepared, and some were found to have biological activity. For example, Auristatin E (U.S. Pat. No. 5,635,483 to Pettit et al.) is a synthetic analogue of the marine natural product Dolastatin 10, an agent that inhibits tubulin polymerization by binding to the same site on tubulin as the anticancer drug vincristine (G. R. Pettit, 70:1-79 (1997)). Dolastatin 10, auristatin PE, and auristatin E are linear peptides having four amino acids, three of which are unique to the dolastatin class of compounds. Both dolastatin 10 and auristatin PE are presently being used in human clinical trials to treat cancer. The structural differences between dolastatin 10 and auristatin E reside in the C-terminal residue, in which the thiazolephenethyl amine group of dolastatin 10 is replaced by a norephedrine unit in auristatin E.","The following references disclose dolastatin and auristatin compounds and analogs thereof, and their use for treating cancer:\n\n","Despite in vitro data for compounds of the dolastatin class and its analogs, significant general toxicities at doses required for achieving a therapeutic effect compromise their efficacy in clinical studies. Accordingly, there is a clear need in the art for dolastatin derivatives having significantly lower toxicity, yet useful therapeutic efficiency, compared to current dolastatin drug therapies.","The recitation of any reference in Section 2 of this application is not an admission that the reference is prior art to this application.","In one aspect, the present invention provides compounds of general Formula Ia:\n\nLA-W\u2014Y-D)\u2003\u2003Ia\n","and pharmaceutically acceptable salts and solvates thereof","wherein,","L- is a Ligand unit;","-A- is a Stretcher unit;","a is 0 or 1;","each

A Ligand unit can form a bond to a Linker unit via a heteroatom of the Ligand.

The corresponding aldehyde can form a bond with a Reactive Site on a Stretcher. Reactive sites on a Stretcher that can react with a carbonyl group on a Ligand include, but are not limited to, hydrazine and hydroxylamine.","Useful non-immunoreactive protein, polypeptide, or peptide Ligands include, but are not limited to, transferrin, epidermal growth factors (\u201cEGF\u201d), bombesin, gastrin, gastrin-releasing peptide, platelet-derived growth factor, IL-2, IL-6, transforming growth factors (\u201cTGF\u201d), such as TGF-\u03b1 and TGF-\u03b2, vaccinia growth factor (\u201cVGF\u201d), insulin and insulin-like growth factors I and II, lectins and apoprotein from low density lipoprotein.","Useful Polyclonal antibody Ligands are heterogeneous populations of antibody molecules derived from the sera of immunized animals. Various procedures well known in the art may be used for the production of polyclonal antibodies to an antigen-of-interest. For example, for the production of polyclonal antibodies, various host animals can be immunized by injection with an antigen of interest or derivative thereof, including but not limited to rabbits, mice, rats, and guinea pigs. Various adjuvants may be used to increase the immunological response, depending on the host species, and including but not limited to Freund's (complete and incomplete), mineral gels such as aluminum hydroxide, surface active substances such as lysolecithin, pluronic polyols, polyanions, peptides, oil emulsions, keyhole limpet hemocyanins, dinitrophenol, and potentially useful human adjuvants such as BCG (bacille Calmette-Guerin) and . Such adjuvants are also well known in the art.","Useful monoclonal antibody Ligands are homogeneous populations of antibodies to a particular antigen (e.g., a cancer cell antigen, a viral antigen, a microbial antigen covalently linked to a second molecule). A monoclonal antibody (mAb) to an antigen-of-interest can be prepared by using any technique known in the art which provides for the production of antibody molecules by continuous cell lines in culture. These include, but are not limited to, the hybridoma technique originally described by Kohler and Milstein (1975256, 495-497), the human B cell hybridoma technique (Kozbor et al., 1983, 4: 72), and the EBV-hybridoma technique (Cole et al., 1985, , Alan R. Liss, Inc., pp. 77-96). Such antibodies may be of any immunoglobulin class including IgG, IgM, IgE, IgA, and IgD and any subclass thereof. The hybridoma producing the mAbs of use in this invention may be cultivated in vitro or in vivo.","Useful monoclonal antibody Ligands include, but are not limited to, human monoclonal antibodies or chimeric human-mouse (or other species) monoclonal antibodies. Human monoclonal antibodies may be made by any of numerous techniques known in the art (e.g., Teng et al., 198380, 7308-7312; Kozbor et al., 19834, 72-79; and Olsson et al., 198292, 3-16).","The Ligand can also be a bispecific antibody. Methods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. Traditional production of full-length bispecific antibodies is based on the coexpression of two immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pairs, where the two chains have different specificities (Milstein et al., 1983305:537-539). Because of the random assortment of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains, these hybridomas (quadromas) produce a potential mixture of 10 different antibody molecules, of which only one has the correct bispecific structure. Purification of the correct molecule, which is usually performed using affinity chromatography steps, is rather cumbersome, and the product yields are low. Similar procedures are disclosed in International Publication No. WO 93\/08829, and in Traunecker et al., 10:3655-3659 (1991).","According to a different and more preferred approach, antibody variable domains with the desired binding specificities (antibody-antigen combining sites) are fused to immunoglobulin constant domain sequences. The fusion preferably is with an immunoglobulin heavy chain constant domain, comprising at least part of the hinge, CH2, and CH3 regions. It is preferred to have the first heavy-chain constant region (CH1) containing the site necessary for light chain binding, present in at least one of the fusions. DNAs encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain fusions and, if desired, the immunoglobulin light chain, are inserted into separate expression vectors, and are co-transfected into a suitable host organism. This provides for great flexibility in adjusting the mutual proportions of the three polypeptide fragments in embodiments when unequal ratios of the three polypeptide chains used in the construction provide the optimum yields. It is, however, possible to insert the coding sequences for two or all three polypeptide chains in one expression vector when the expression of at least two polypeptide chains in equal ratios results in high yields or when the ratios are of no particular significance.","In a preferred embodiment of this approach, the bispecific antibodies have a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain with a first binding specificity in one arm, and a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pair (providing a second binding specificity) in the other arm. This asymmetric structure facilitates the separation of the desired bispecific compound from unwanted immunoglobulin chain combinations, as the presence of an immunoglobulin light chain in only one half of the bispecific molecule provides for a facile way of separation (International Publication No. WO 94\/04690) which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","For further details for generating bispecific antibodies see, for example, Suresh et al., 1986, 121:210. Using such techniques, bispecific antibody Ligands can be prepared for use in the treatment or prevention of disease as defined herein.","Bifunctional antibodies are also described, in European Patent Publication No. EPA 0 105 360. As disclosed in this reference, hybrid or bifunctional antibodies can be derived either biologically, i.e., by cell fusion techniques, or chemically, especially with cross-linking agents or disulfide-bridge forming reagents, and may comprise whole antibodies or fragments thereof. Methods for obtaining such hybrid antibodies are disclosed for example, in International Publication WO 83\/03679, and European Patent Publication No. EPA 0 217 577, both of which are incorporated herein by reference.","The Ligand can be a functionally active fragment, derivative or analog of an antibody that immunospecifically binds to cancer cell antigens, viral antigens, or microbial antigens. In this regard, \u201cFunctionally active\u201d means that the fragment, derivative or analog is able to elicit anti-anti-idiotype antibodies that recognize the same antigen that the antibody from which the fragment, derivative or analog is derived recognized. Specifically, in a preferred embodiment the antigenicity of the idiotype of the immunoglobulin molecule can be enhanced by deletion of framework and CDR sequences that are C-terminal to the CDR sequence that specifically recognizes the antigen. To determine which CDR sequences bind the antigen, synthetic peptides containing the CDR sequences can be used in binding assays with the antigen by any binding assay method known in the art (e.g., the BIA core assay)","Other useful Ligands include fragments of antibodies such as, but not limited to, F(ab\u2032)2 fragments, which contain the variable region, the light chain constant region and the CH1 domain of the heavy chain can be produced by pepsin digestion of the antibody molecule, and Fab fragments, which can be generated by reducing the disulfide bridges of the F(ab\u2032)2 fragments. Other useful Ligands are heavy chain and light chain dimers of antibodies, or any minimal fragment thereof such as Fvs or single chain antibodies (SCAs) (e.g., as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,946,778; Bird, 1988, 242:423-42; Huston et al., 198885:5879-5883; and Ward et al., 1989, 334:544-54), or any other molecule with the same specificity as the antibody.","Additionally, recombinant antibodies, such as chimeric and humanized monoclonal antibodies, comprising both human and non-human portions, which can be made using standard recombinant DNA techniques, are useful Ligands. A chimeric antibody is a molecule in which different portions are derived from different animal species, such as those having a variable region derived from a murine monoclonal and a human immunoglobulin constant region. (See, e.g., Cabilly et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; and Boss et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,397, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.) Humanized antibodies are antibody molecules from non-human species having one or more complementarity determining regions (CDRs) from the non-human species and a framework region from a human immunoglobulin molecule. (See, e.g., Queen, U.S. Pat. No. 5,585,089, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.) Such chimeric and humanized monoclonal antibodies can be produced by recombinant DNA techniques known in the art, for example using methods described in International Publication No. WO 87\/02671; European Patent Publication No. 184,187; European Patent Publication No. 171,496; European Patent Publication No. 173,494; International Publication No. WO 86\/01533; U.S. Pat.

Such antibodies can be produced using transgenic mice that are incapable of expressing endogenous immunoglobulin heavy and light chains genes, but which can express human heavy and light chain genes. The transgenic mice are immunized in the normal fashion with a selected antigen, e.g., all or a portion of a polypeptide of the invention. Monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen can be obtained using conventional hybridoma technology. The human immunoglobulin transgenes harbored by the transgenic mice rearrange during B cell differentiation, and subsequently undergo class switching and somatic mutation. Thus, using such a technique, it is possible to produce therapeutically useful IgG, IgA, IgM and IgE antibodies. For an overview of this technology for producing human antibodies, see Lonberg and Huszar (199513:65-93). For a detailed discussion of this technology for producing human antibodies and human monoclonal antibodies and protocols for producing such antibodies, see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,625,126; U.S. Pat. No. 5,633,425; U.S. Pat. No. 5,569,825; U.S. Pat. No. 5,661,016; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,545,806; each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Other human antibodies can be obtained commercially from, for example, Abgenix, Inc. (Freemont, Calif.) and Genpharm (San Jose, Calif.).","Completely human antibodies that recognize a selected epitope can be generated using a technique referred to as \u201cguided selection.\u201d In this approach a selected non-human monoclonal antibody, e.g., a mouse antibody, is used to guide the selection of a completely human antibody recognizing the same epitope. (Jespers et al. (1994) 12:899-903).","In other embodiments, the Ligand is a fusion protein of an antibody, or a functionally active fragment thereof, for example in which the antibody is fused via a covalent bond (e.g., a peptide bond), at either the N-terminus or the C-terminus to an amino acid sequence of another protein (or portion thereof, preferably at least 10, 20 or 50 amino acid portion of the protein) that is not the antibody. Preferably, the antibody or fragment thereof is covalently linked to the other protein at the N-terminus of the constant domain.","The Ligand antibodies include analogs and derivatives that are either modified, i.e, by the covalent attachment of any type of molecule as long as such covalent attachment permits the antibody to retain its antigen binding immunospecificity. For example, but not by way of limitation, the derivatives and analogs of the antibodies include those that have been further modified, e.g., by glycosylation, acetylation, pegylation, phosphylation, amidation, derivatization by known protecting\/blocking groups, proteolytic cleavage, linkage to a cellular Ligand unit or other protein, etc. Any of numerous chemical modifications can be carried out by known techniques, including, but not limited to specific chemical cleavage, acetylation, formylation, metabolic synthesis of tunicamycin, etc. Additionally, the analog or derivative can contain one or more unnaturalamino acids.","The Ligand antibodies include antibodies having modifications (e.g., substitutions, deletions or additions) in amino acid residues that interact with Fc receptors. In particular, the Ligand antibodies include antibodies having modifications in amino acid residues identified as involved in the interaction between the Fc domain and the FcRn receptor (see, e.g., International Publication No. WO 97\/34631, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety).

Non-limiting examples of suitable lectins are C-type, S-type, and I-type lectin.","In one embodiment, the Ligand is an antibody that binds to an activated lymphocyte that is associated with an autoimmune disease.","In another specific embodiment, useful Ligand antibodies that are immunospecific for a viral or a microbial antigen are monoclonal antibodies. Preferably, Ligand antibodies that are immunospecific for a viral antigen or microbial antigen are humanized or human monoclonal antibodies. As used herein, the term \u201cviral antigen\u201d includes, but is not limited to, any viral peptide, polypeptide protein (e.g., HIV gp120, HIV nef, RSV F glycoprotein, influenza virus neuraminidase, influenza virus hemagglutinin, HTLV tax, herpes simplex virus glycoprotein (e.g., gB, gC, gD, and gE) and hepatitis B surface antigen) that is capable of eliciting an immune response. As used herein, the term \u201cmicrobial antigen\u201d includes, but is not limited to, any microbial peptide, polypeptide, protein, saccharide, polysaccharide, or lipid molecule (e.g., a bacterial, fungi, pathogenic protozoa, or yeast polypeptide including, e.g., LPS and capsular polysaccharide \u215d) that is capable of eliciting an immune response.","Antibodies immunospecific for a viral or microbial antigen can be obtained commercially, for example, from Genentech (San Francisco, Calif.) or produced by any method known to one of skill in the art such as, e.g., chemical synthesis or recombinant expression techniques. The nucleotide sequence encoding antibodies that are immunospecific for a viral or microbial antigen can be obtained, e.g., from the GenBank database or a database like it, the literature publications, or by routine cloning and sequencing.","In a specific embodiment, useful Ligand antibodies are those that are useful for the treatment or prevention of viral or microbial infection in accordance with the methods of the invention. Examples of antibodies available useful for the treatment of viral infection or microbial infection include, but are not limited to, S(MedImmune, Inc., MD) which is a humanized anti-respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) monoclonal antibody useful for the treatment of patients with RSV infection; PRO542 (Progenics) which is a CD4 fusion antibody useful for the treatment of HIV infection; O(Protein Design Labs, Inc., CA) which is a human antibody useful for the treatment of hepatitis B virus; P(Protein Design Labs, Inc., CA) which is a humanized IgGantibody useful for the treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV); and anti-LPS antibodies.","Other antibodies useful in the treatment of infectious diseases include, but are not limited to, antibodies against the antigens from pathogenic strains of bacteria (() fetus, spp., spp.); pathogenic fungi (); protozoa (); or Helminiths (, and hookworms).","Other antibodies useful in this invention for treatment of viral disease include, but are not limited to, antibodies against antigens of pathogenic viruses, including as examples and not by limitation: Poxyiridae, Herpesviridae, Herpes Simplex virus 1, Herpes Simplex virus 2, Adenoviridae, Papovaviridae, Enteroviridae, Picornaviridae, Parvoviridae, Reoviridae, Retroviridae, influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses, mumps, measles, respiratory syncytial virus, rubella, Arboviridae, Rhabdoviridae, Arenaviridae, Hepatitis A virus, Hepatitis B virus, Hepatitis C virus, Hepatitis E virus, Non-A\/Non-B Hepatitis virus, Rhinoviridae, Coronaviridae, Rotoviridae, and Human Immunodeficiency Virus.","The antibodies suitable for use in the invention can be produced by any method known in the art for the synthesis of antibodies, in particular, by chemical synthesis or by recombinant expression, and are preferably produced by recombinant expression techniques.","Ligand antibodies of the invention can be produced using any method known in the art to be useful for the synthesis of antibodies, in particular, by chemical synthesis or by recombinant expression, and are preferably produced by recombinant expression techniques.","Recombinant expression of the Ligand antibodies, or fragment, derivative or analog thereof, requires construction of a nucleic acid that encodes the antibody. If the nucleotide sequence of the antibody is known, a nucleic acid encoding the antibody may be assembled from chemically synthesized oligonucleotides (e.g., as described in Kutmeier et al., 1994, 17:242), which involves the synthesis of overlapping oligonucleotides containing portions of the sequence encoding the antibody, annealing and ligation of those oligonucleotides, and then amplification of the ligated oligonucleotides by PCR.","Alternatively, a nucleic acid molecule encoding an antibody can be generated from a suitable source. If a clone containing the nucleic acid encoding the particular antibody is not available, but the sequence of the antibody is known, a nucleic acid encoding the antibody can be obtained from a suitable source (e.g., an antibody cDNA library, or cDNA library generated from any tissue or cells expressing the immunoglobulin) by PCR amplification using synthetic primers hybridizable to the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 ends of the sequence or by cloning using an oligonucleotide probe specific for the particular gene sequence.","If an antibody that specifically recognizes a particular antigen is not commercially available (or a source for a cDNA library for cloning a nucleic acid encoding such an immunoglobulin), antibodies specific for a particular antigen can be generated by any method known in the art, for example, by immunizing an animal, such as a rabbit, to generate polyclonal antibodies or, more preferably, by generating monoclonal antibodies, e.g., as described by Kohler and Milstein (1975, 256:495-497) or, as described by Kozbor et al. (19834:72) or Cole et al. (1985 in , Alan R. Liss, Inc., pp. 77-96). Alternatively, a clone encoding at least the Fab portion of the antibody can be obtained by screening Fab expression libraries (e.g., as described in Huse et al., 1989, 246:1275-1281) for clones of Fab fragments that bind the specific antigen or by screening antibody libraries (See, e.g., Clackson et al., 1991, 352:624; Hane et al., 1997 94:4937).","Once a nucleic acid sequence encoding at least the variable domain of the antibody is obtained, it can be introduced into a vector containing the nucleotide sequence encoding the constant regions of the antibody (see, e.g., International Publication No. WO 86\/05807; International Publication No. WO 89\/01036; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,122,464). Vectors containing the complete light or heavy chain that allow for the expression of a complete antibody molecule are available. Then, the nucleic acid encoding the antibody can be used to introduce the nucleotide substitutions or deletion necessary to substitute (or delete) the one or more variable region cysteine residues participating in an intrachain disulfide bond with an amino acid residue that does not contain a sulfhydryl group. Such modifications can be carried out by any method known in the art for the introduction of specific mutations or deletions in a nucleotide sequence, for example, but not limited to, chemical mutagenesis and in vitro site directed mutagenesis (Hutchinson et al., 1978, 253:6551).","In addition, techniques developed for the production of \u201cchimeric antibodies\u201d (Morrison et al., 198481:851-855; Neuberger et al., 1984, 312:604-608; Takeda et al., 1985, 314:452-454) by splicing genes from a mouse antibody molecule of appropriate antigen specificity together with genes from a human antibody molecule of appropriate biological activity can be used. A chimeric antibody is a molecule in which different portions are derived from different animal species, such as those having a variable region derived from a murine monoclonal antibody and a human immunoglobulin constant region, e.g., humanized antibodies.","Alternatively, techniques described for the production of single chain antibodies (U.S. Pat. No. 4,694,778; Bird, 1988, 242:423-42; Huston et al., 1988, 85:5879-5883; and Ward et al., 1989, 334:544-54) can be adapted to produce single chain antibodies. Single chain antibodies are formed by linking the heavy and light chain fragments of the Fv region via an amino acid bridge, resulting in a single chain polypeptide. Techniques for the assembly of functional Fv fragments in may also be used (Skerra et al., 1988, 242:1038-1041).","Antibody fragments that recognize specific epitopes can be generated by known techniques. For example, such fragments include, but are not limited to, the F(ab\u2032)2 fragments that can be produced by pepsin digestion of the antibody molecule and the Fab fragments that can be generated by reducing the disulfide bridges of the F(ab\u2032)2 fragments.","Once a nucleic acid sequence encoding a Ligand antibody has been obtained, the vector for the production of the antibody can be produced by recombinant DNA technology using techniques well known in the art. Methods that are well known to those skilled in the art can be used to construct expression vectors containing the antibody coding sequences and appropriate transcriptional and translational control signals. These methods include, for example, in vitro recombinant DNA techniques, synthetic techniques, and in vivo genetic recombination. See, for example, the techniques described in Sambrook et al. (19902Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.) and Ausubel et al. (eds., 1998, , John Wiley & Sons, NY).","An expression vector comprising the nucleotide sequence of an antibody or the nucleotide sequence of an antibody can be transferred to a host cell by conventional techniques (e.g., electroporation, liposomal transfection, and calcium phosphate precipitation), and the transfected cells are then cultured by conventional techniques to produce the antibody. In specific embodiments, the expression of the antibody is regulated by a constitutive, an inducible or a tissue, specific promoter.","The host cells used to express the recombinant Ligand antibody can be either bacterial cells such as , or, preferably, eukaryotic cells, especially for the expression of whole recombinant immunoglobulin molecule. In particular, mammalian cells such as Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO), in conjunction with a vector such as the major intermediate early gene promoter element from human cytomegalovirus is an effective expression system for immunoglobulins (Foecking et al., 19845:101; Cockett et al., 1990, 8:2).","A variety of host-expression vector systems can be utilized to express the immunoglobulin Ligands. Such host-expression systems represent vehicles by which the coding sequences of the antibody can be produced and subsequently purified, but also represent cells that can, when transformed or transfected with the appropriate nucleotide coding sequences, express a Ligand immunoglobulin molecule in situ. These include, but are not limited to, microorganisms such as bacteria (e.g., and ) transformed with recombinant bacteriophage DNA, plasmid DNA or cosmid DNA expression vectors containing immunoglobulin coding sequences; yeast (e.g., ) transformed with recombinant yeast expression vectors containing immunoglobulin coding sequences; insect cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors (e.g., baculovirus) containing the immunoglobulin coding sequences; plant cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors (e.g., cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) and tobacco mosaic virus (TMV)) or transformed with recombinant plasmid expression vectors (e.g., Ti plasmid) containing immunoglobulin coding sequences; or mammalian cell systems (e.g., COS, CHO, BH, 293, 293T, 3T3 cells) harboring recombinant expression constructs containing promoters derived from the genome of mammalian cells (e.g., metallothionein promoter) or from mammalian viruses (e.g., the adenovirus late promoter; the vaccinia virus 7.5K promoter).","In bacterial systems, a number of expression vectors can be advantageously selected depending upon the use intended for the antibody being expressed. For example, when a large quantity of such a protein is to be produced, vectors that direct the expression of high levels of fusion protein products that are readily purified might be desirable. Such vectors include, but are not limited, to the expression vector pUR278 (Ruther et al., 1983, 2:1791), in which the antibody coding sequence may be ligated individually into the vector in frame with the lac Z coding region so that a fusion protein is produced; pIN vectors (Inouye & Inouye, 1985, 13:3101-3109; Van Heeke & Schuster, 198924:5503-5509); and the like. pGEX vectors can also be used to express foreign polypeptides as fusion proteins with glutathione S-transferase (GST). In general, such fusion proteins are soluble and can easily be purified from lysed cells by adsorption and binding to a matrix glutathione-agarose beads followed by elution in the presence of free glutathione. The pGEX vectors are designed to include thrombin or factor Xa protease cleavage sites so that the cloned target gene product can be released from the GST moiety.","In an insect system, nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV) or the analogous virus from is used as a vector to express foreign genes. The virus grows in cells. The antibody coding sequence can be cloned individually into non-essential regions (for example the polyhedrin gene) of the virus and placed under control of an AcNPV promoter (for example the polyhedrin promoter).","In mammalian host cells, a number of viral-based expression systems can be utilized. In cases where an adenovirus is used as an expression vector, the antibody coding sequence of interest can be ligated to an adenovirus transcription\/translation control complex, e.g., the late promoter and tripartite leader sequence. This chimeric gene can then be inserted in the adenovirus genome by in vitro or in vivo recombination. Insertion in a non-essential region of the viral genome (e.g., region E1 or E3) results in a recombinant virus that is viable and capable of expressing the immunoglobulin molecule in infected hosts. (e.g., see Logan & Shenk, 198481:355-359). Specific initiation signals can also be required for efficient translation of inserted antibody coding sequences. These signals include the ATG initiation codon and adjacent sequences. Furthermore, the initiation codon must be in phase with the reading frame of the desired coding sequence to ensure translation of the entire insert. These exogenous translational control signals and initiation codons can be of a variety of origins, both natural and synthetic. The efficiency of expression can be enhanced by the inclusion of appropriate transcription enhancer elements, transcription terminators, etc. (see Bittner et al., 1987153:51-544).","In addition, a host cell strain can be chosen to modulate the expression of the inserted sequences, or modifies and processes the gene product in the specific fashion desired. Such modifications (e.g., glycosylation) and processing (e.g., cleavage) of protein products can be important for the function of the protein. Different host cells have characteristic and specific mechanisms for the post-translational processing and modification of proteins and gene products. Appropriate cell lines or host systems can be chosen to ensure the correct modification and processing of the foreign protein expressed. To this end, eukaryotic host cells that possess the cellular machinery for proper processing of the primary transcript, glycosylation, and phosphorylation of the gene product can be used. Such mammalian host cells include, but are not limited to, CHO, VERY, BH, Hela, COS, MDCK, 293, 293T, 3T3, W138, BT483, Hs578T, HTB2, BT20 and T47D, CRL7030 and Hs578Bst.","For long-term, high-yield production of recombinant proteins, stable expression is preferred. For example, cell lines that stably express an antibody can be engineered. Rather than using expression vectors that contain viral origins of replication, host cells can be transformed with DNA controlled by appropriate expression control elements (e.g., promoter, enhancer, sequences, transcription terminators, polyadenylation sites, etc.), and a selectable marker. Following the introduction of the foreign DNA, engineered cells can be allowed to grow for 1-2 days in an enriched media, and then are switched to a selective media. The selectable marker in the recombinant plasmid confers resistance to the selection and allows cells to stably integrate the plasmid into their chromosomes and grow to form foci that in turn can be cloned and expanded into cell lines. This method can advantageously be used to engineer cell lines which express the antibody Such engineered cell lines can be particularly useful in screening and evaluation of tumor antigens that interact directly or indirectly with the antibody Ligand.","A number of selection systems can be used, including but not limited to the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (Wigler et al., 1977, 11:223), hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (Szybalska & Szybalski, 19248:202), and adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (Lowy et al., 1980, 22:817) genes can be employed in tk-, hgprt- or aprt-cells, respectively. Also, antimetabolite resistance can be used as the basis of selection for the following genes: dhfr, which confers resistance to methotrexate (Wigler et al., 198077:357; O'Hare et al., 198178:1527); gpt, which confers resistance to mycophenolic acid (Mulligan & Berg, 198178:2072); neo, which confers resistance to the aminoglycoside G-418 (12:488-505; Wu and Wu, 1991, 3:87-95; Tolstoshev, 1993, 32:573-596; Mulligan, 1993, 260:926-932; and Morgan and Anderson, 1993, 62:191-217; May, 1993, 11(5):155-215) and hygro, which confers resistance to hygromycin (Santerre et al., 198430:147). Methods commonly known in the art of recombinant DNA technology which can be used are described in Ausubel et al. (eds., 1993, , John Wiley & Sons, NY; Kriegler, 1990, Stockton Press, NY; and in Chapters 12 and 13, Dracopoli et al. (eds), 1994, , John Wiley & Sons, NY.; Colberre-Garapin et al., 1981150:1).","The expression levels of an antibody can be increased by vector amplification (for a review, see Bebbington and Hentschel, , Vol. 3. (Academic Press, New York, 1987)). When a marker in the vector system expressing an antibody is amplifiable, an increase in the level of inhibitor present in culture of host cell will increase the number of copies of the marker gene. Since the amplified region is associated with the nucleotide sequence of the antibody, production of the antibody will also increase (Crouse et al., 19833:257).","The host cell can be co-transfected with two expression vectors of the invention, the first vector encoding a heavy chain derived polypeptide and the second vector encoding a light chain derived polypeptide. The two vectors can contain identical selectable markers that enable equal expression of heavy and light chain polypeptides. Alternatively, a single vector can be used to encode both heavy and light chain polypeptides. In such situations, the light chain should be placed before the heavy chain to avoid an excess of toxic free heavy chain (Proudfoot, 1986, 322:52; Kohler, 1980, 77:2197). The coding sequences for the heavy and light chains can comprise cDNA or genomic DNA.","Once the antibody has been recombinantly expressed, it can be purified using any method known in the art for purification of an antibody, for example, by chromatography (e.g., ion exchange, affinity, particularly by affinity for the specific antigen after Protein A, and sizing column chromatography), centrifugation, differential solubility, or by any other standard technique for the purification of proteins.","In a preferred embodiment, the Ligand is an antibody.","In a more preferred embodiment, the Ligand is a monoclonal antibody.","In any case, the hybrid antibodies have a dual specificity, preferably with one or more binding sites specific for the hapten of choice or one or more binding sites specific for a target antigen, for example, an antigen associated with a tumor, an autoimmune disease, an infectious organism, or other disease state.","As described in more detail below, the Compounds of the Invention are conveniently prepared using a Linker having two or more Reactive Sites for binding to the Drug and Ligand. In one aspect of the invention, a Linker has a Reactive site which has an electrophilic group that is reactive to a nucleophilic group present on a Ligand. Useful nucleophilic groups on a Ligand include but are not limited to, sulfhydryl, hydroxyl and amino groups. The heteroatom of the nucleophilic group of a Ligand is reactive to an electrophilic group on a Linker and forms a covalent bond to a Linker unit. Useful electrophilic groups include, but are not limited to, maleimide and haloacetamide groups. The electrophilic group provides a convenient site for Ligand attachment.","In another embodiment, a Linker has a Reactive site which has a nucleophilic group that is reactive to an electrophilic group present on a Ligand. Useful electrophilic groups on a Ligand include, but are not limited to, aldehyde and ketone carbonyl groups. The heteroatom of a nucleophilic group of a Linker can react with an electrophilic group on a Ligand and form a covalent bond to a Ligand unit. Useful nucleophilic groups on a Linker include, but are not limited to, hydrazide, oxime, amino, hydrazine, thiosemicarbazone, hydrazine carboxylate, and arylhydrazide. The electrophilic group on a Ligand provides a convenient site for attachment to a Linker.","Carboxylic acid functional groups and chloroformate functional groups are also useful reactive sites for a Linker because they can react with primary or secondary amino groups of a Drug to form an amide linkage. Also useful as a reactive site is a carbonate functional group on a Linker which can react with an amino group or hydroxyl group of a Drug to form a carbamate linkage or carbonate linkage, respectively. Similarly, a Drug's phenol moiety can react with the Linker, existing as an alcohol, under Mitsunobu conditions.","Typically, peptide-based Drugs can be prepared by forming a peptide bond between two or more amino acids and\/or peptide fragments. Such peptide bonds can be prepared, for example, according to the liquid phase synthesis method (see E. Schr\u00f6der and K. L\u00fcbke, \u201cThe Peptides\u201d, volume 1, pp 76-136, 1965, Academic Press) that is well known in the field of peptide chemistry.","In one embodiment, a Drug is prepared by combining about a stoichiometric equivalent of a dipeptide and a tripeptide, preferably in a one-pot reaction under suitable condensation conditions. This approach is illustrated in the following Schemes 5-7. Thus, the tripeptide 6 can be prepared as shown in Scheme 5, and the dipeptide 9 can be prepared as shown in Scheme 6. The two fragments 6 and 9 can be condensed to provide a Drug 10 as shown in Scheme 7.","The synthesis of an illustrative Stretcher having an electrophilic maleimide group is illustrated in Schemes 8-9. General synthetic methods useful for the synthesis of a Linker are described in Scheme 10. Scheme 11 shows the construction of a Linker unit having a val-cit group, an electrophilic maleimide group and a PAB self-immolative Spacer group. Scheme 12 depicts the synthesis of a Linker having a phe-lys group, an electrophilic maleimide group, with and without the PAB self-immolative Spacer group. Scheme 13 presents a general outline for the synthesis of a Drug-Linker Compound, while Scheme 14 presents an alternate route for preparing a Drug-Linker Compound. Scheme 15 depicts the synthesis of a branched linker containing a BHMS group.

Preferred protected amino acids 1 are PG-Ile and, particularly, PG-Val, while other suitable protected amino acids include, without limitation: PG-cyclohexylglycine, PG-cyclohexylalanine, PG-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid, PG-aminoisobutyric acid, PG-phenylalanine, PG-phenylglycine, and PG-tert-butylglycine. Z is a preferred protecting group. Fmoc is another preferred protecting group.

Illustrative methodology for the deprotection of a Z-protected amine via catalytic hydrogenation is outlined below in General Procedure C.","General Procedure A: Peptide synthesis using DEPC. The N-protected or N,N-disubstituted amino acid or peptide 4 (1.0 eq.) and an amine 5 (1.1 eq.) are diluted with an aprotic organic solvent, such as dichloromethane (0.1 to 0.5 M). An organic base such as triethylamine or diisopropylethylamine (1.5 eq.) is then added, followed by DEPC (1.1 eq.). The resulting solution is stirred, preferably under argon, for up to 12 hours while being monitored by HPLC or TLC. The solvent is removed in vacuo at room temperature, and the crude product is purified using, for example, HPLC or flash column chromatography (silica gel column). Relevant fractions are combined and concentrated in vacuo to afford tripeptide 6 which is dried under vacuum overnight.","General procedure B: Peptide synthesis using PyBrop. The amino acid 2 (1.0 eq.), optionally having a carboxyl protecting group, is diluted with an aprotic organic solvent such as dichloromethane or DME to provide a solution of a concentration between 0.5 and 1.0 mM, then diisopropylethylamine (1.5 eq.) is added. Fmoc-, or Z-protected amino acid 1 (1.1 eq.) is added as a solid in one portion, then PyBrop (1.2 eq.) is added to the resulting mixture. The reaction is monitored by TLC or HPLC , followed by a workup procedure similar to that described in General Procedure A.","General procedure C: Z-removal via catalytic hydrogenation. Z-protected amino acid or peptide 3 is diluted with ethanol to provide a solution of a concentration between 0.5 and 1.0 mM in a suitable vessel, such as a thick-walled round bottom flask. 10% palladium on carbon is added (5-10% w\/w) and the reaction mixture is placed under a hydrogen atmosphere. Reaction progress is monitored using HPLC and is generally complete within 1-2 h. The reaction mixture is filtered through a pre-washed pad of celite and the celite is again washed with a polar organic solvent, such as methanol after filtration. The eluent solution is concentrated in vacuo to afford a residue which is diluted with an organic solvent, preferably toluene. The organic solvent is then removed in vacuo to afford the deprotected amine 4.","Table 1 lists representative examples of tripeptide intermediates (compounds 39-43) that were prepared according to Scheme 5.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1080","num":"1090"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00004","num":"00004"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":{"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00110","num":"00110"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00110","he":"25.15mm","wi":"54.19mm","file":"US07829531-20101109-C00110.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"table","img-format":"tif"}}}}},{"entry":{}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"77pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"91pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Compound","X","X"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["39","Fmoc-N-Me-L-val","L-val"]},{"entry":["40","Fmoc-N-Me-L-val","L-ile"]},{"entry":["41","Fmoc-N-Me-gly","L-ile"]},{"entry":["42","dov","L-val"]},{"entry":["43","dov","L-ile"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"left","id":"FOO-00001"},"sup":"a"}}]}}]}}},"The dipeptide 9 can be readily prepared by condensation of the modified amino acid Boc-Dolaproine 7 (see, for example, Pettit, G.

All reaction steps are typically carried out at 4\u00b0 C. Where the Ligand is a monoclonal antibody having one or more disulfide bonds, solutions of the monoclonal antibody (5-20 mg\/mL) in phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.2, are reduced with dithiothreitol (10 mM final) at 37\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes (See General Procedure M) and separation of low molecular weight agents is achieved by size exclusion chromatography on Sephadex G25 columns in PBS containing 1 mM diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid.","The sulfhydryl content in the Ligand can be determined using 5,5\u2032-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) as described in General Procedure M (see Riddles, P. W., Blakeley, R. L., and Zerner, B. (1979) Anal. Biochem. 94, 75-81). To a PBS solution of Ligand reduced according to General Procedure L, a Drug-Linker Compound in MeCN is added so that the solution is 20% MeCN\/PBS (vol\/vol). The amount of Drug-Linker Compound is approximately 10% more than the total number of sulfhydryl groups on a Ligand. After 60 min at 4\u00b0 C., cysteine is added (20-fold excess over concentration of the Drug-Linker Compound), the solution is concentrated by ultrafiltration, and any low molecular weight agents are removed by gel filtration. The number of Drug-Linker Compounds per antibody is determined by uv\/vis spectroscopy using formulas derived from the relative extinction coefficients of the Ligands and Drug-Linker Compounds as described in General Procedure O. The amount of quenched Drug-Linker Compound is then determined as described in General Procedure P using reverse-phase HPLC. The aggregation state of the Ligand Antibodies of the Drug-Linker-Ligand Conjugates can be determined using size-exclusion HPLC as described in General Procedure R. The Drug-Linker-Ligand Conjugates can be used without further purification.","General Procedure M: Reduction of the interchain disulfide bonds of an Antibody. To a solution of 24 mg of an antibody (2.4 mL of 10 mg\/mL solution) in suitable buffer is added 300 \u03bcL of Borate buffer (500 mM sodium borate\/500 mM sodium chloride, pH 8.0) followed by 300 \u03bcL of Dithiothreitol (DTT, 100 mM solution in HO). The reaction mixture is stirred using a vortex instrument and incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 30 min. Three PD10 columns are equilibrated with PBS containing 1 mM DTPA (in PBS) and the reduced antibody is eluted through the three PD10 columns and collected in 4.2 mL PBS\/DTPA solution (1.4 mL per column). The reduced antibody is then stored on ice. The number of thiols per antibody and the antibody concentration are determined according to General Procedure N.","General Procedure N: Determination of number of thiols per Ligand.","A reference sample of a Ligand or a sample of an antibody reduced according to General Procedure L is diluted to about 1:40 (w\/w) in PBS, and the uv absorbance of the solution is measured at 280 nm using standard uv spectroscopic methods.","Preferably, the ratio of Ligand:PBS in the solution is such that the uv absorbance ranges from about 0.13-0.2 AU (absorbance units).","A test sample of a Ligand or a test sample of an antibody reduced according to General Procedure L is diluted to about 1:20 with a PBS solution containing about 15 \u03bcL DTNB stock solution\/mL PBS. A blank sample containing DTNB at the same concentration as the test solution (i.e., 15 \u03bcL DTNB stock\/mL PBS) is then prepared. The spectrophotometer is referenced at zero nm with the blank sample, then the absorbance of the test sample is measured at 412 nm.","The molar concentration of the antibody is then determined using the formula: [Ligand]=(OD\/2.24e)\u00d7dilution factor.","The molar concentration of thiol is then determined using the formula: [\u2014SH]=(OD\/1.415e)\u00d7dilution factor.","The [SH]\/[Ligand] ratio is then calculated. A reduced monoclonal antibody Ligand can have from 1 to about 20 sulfhydryl groups, but typically has between about 6 to about 9 sulfhydryl groups. In a preferred embodiment, the [SH]\/[Ligand] ratio range is from about 7 to about 9.","It is understood that the [SH]\/[Ligand] ratio is the average number of -A-W\u2014Y-D units per Ligand unit.","General Procedure O: Determination of the number of Drug molecules per Antibody in a Drug-Linker-Antibody Conjugate. The Drug:Antibody ratio for a Drug-Linker-Antibody Conjugate is determined by measuring the number of Dithiothreitol (DTT) reducible thiols that remain after conjugation, using the following method: A 200 mL sample of a Drug-Linker-Antibody conjugate is treated with DTT (100 mM solution in water) to bring the concentration to 10 mM DTT. The resulting solution is incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 30 min, then eluted through a PD10 column using PBS\/DTPA as the eluent. The ODof the reduced conjugate is then measured and the molar concentration is measured according to General Procedure Q.","The molar concentration of thiol is determined using DTNB as described in General Procedure M. The ratio of thiol concentration to antibody concentration is then calculated and the Drug:Ligand ratio is the difference between the Thiol:Antibody ratio (determined using General Procedure N) and the Drug:Antibody ratio as determined in the previous paragraph.","General Procedure P: Determination of the amount of quenched Drug-Linker compound in a Drug-Linker-Antibody Conjugate. This assay provides a quantitative determination of the Drug-Linker in the Drug-Linker-Antibody conjugate that is not covalently bound to Antibody. Assuming that all maleimide groups of Drug-Linker in the reaction mixture have been quenched with Cysteine, the unbound drug is the Cysteine quenched adduct of the Drug-Linker Compound, i.e. Drug-Linker-Cys. The proteinaceous Drug-Linker-Antibody Conjugate is denatured, precipitated, and isolated by centrifugation under conditions in which the Drug-Linker-Cys is soluble. The unbound Drug-Linker-Cys is detected quantitatively by HPLC, and the resulting chromatogram is compared to a standard curve to determine the concentration of unbound Drug-Linker-Cys in the sample. This concentration is divided by the total concentration of Drug in the conjugate as determined using General Procedure O and General Procedure Q.","Specifically, 100 mL of a 100 \u03bcM Drug-Linker-Cys adduct \u201cworking solution\u201d is prepared by adding 1 \u03bcL of 100 mM Cysteine in PBS\/DTPA and an appropriate volume of stock solution of a Drug-Linker compound to 98 \u03bcL of 50% methanol\/PBS. The \u201cappropriate volume\u201d in liters is calculated using the formula: V=1e-8\/[Drug-Linker]. Six tubes are then labelled as follows: \u201c0\u201d, \u201c0.5\u201d, \u201c1\u201d, \u201c2\u201d, \u201c3\u201d, and \u201c5\u201d, and appropriate amounts of working solution are placed in each tube and diluted with 50% methanol\/PBS to give a total volume of 100 mL in each tube. The labels indicate the \u03bcM concentration of the standards.","A 50 \u03bcL solution of a Drug-Linker-Antibody Conjugate and a 50 \u03bcL solution of the Cysteine quenched reaction mixture (\u201cqrm\u201d) are collected in separate test tubes and are each diluted with 50 \u03bcL of methanol that has been cooled to \u221220\u00b0 C. The samples are then cooled to \u221220\u00b0 C. over 10 min.","The samples are then centrifuged at 13000 rpm in a desktop centrifuge for 10 min. The supernatants are transferred to HPLC vials, and 90 \u03bcL aliquots of each sample are separately analyzed using HPLC(C12 RP column (Phenomenex); monitored at the absorbance maximum of the Drug-Linker Compound using a flow rate of 1.0 mL\/min. The eluent used is a linear gradient of MeCN ranging from 10 to 90% in aqueous 5 mM ammonium phosphate, pH 7.4, over 10 min; then 90% MeCN over 5 min.; then returning to initial conditions). The Drug-Linker-Cys adduct typically elutes between about 7 and about 10 minutes.","A standard curve is then prepared by plotting the Peak Area of the standards vs. their concentration (in \u03bcM). Linear regression analysis is performed to determine the equation and correlation coefficient of the standard curve. Rvalues are typically >0.99. From the regression equation is determined the concentration of the Drug-Linker-Cys adduct in the HPLC sample and in the conjugate, using the formulas:\n\n[Drug-Linker-Cys]=(Peak area\u2212intercept)\/slope;\n\n[Drug-Linker-Cys]=2\u00d7[Drug-Linker-Cys]\n","The percent of Drug-Linker-Cys adduct present can be determined using the formula:\n\n% Drug-Linker-Cys=100\u00d7[Drug-Linker-Cys]\/[drug]\n\n","General Procedure Q: Determination of Drug-Linker-Antibody Conjugate concentration for drug linkers with minimal uv absorbance at 280 nm. The concentration of Drug-Linker-Antibody conjugate can be determined in the same manner for the concentration of the parent antibody, by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm of an appropriate dilution, using the following formula:\n\n[Conjugate](mg\/mL)=(OD\u00d7dilution factor\/1.4)\u00d70.9\n","Determination of Drug-Linker-Antibody Conjugate concentration for drug linkers with substantial uv absorbance at 280 nm (e.g. Compounds 68 and 69). Because the absorbances of Compounds 68 and 69 overlap with the absorbances of an antibody, spectrophotometric determination of the conjugate concentration is most useful when the measurement is performed using the absorbances at both 270 nm and 280 nm. Using this data, the molar concentration of Drug-Linker-Ligand conjugate is given by the following formula:\n\n[Conjugate]=(OD\u00d71.23\u2212OD\u00d79.35)\u00d7dilution factor\n\n","General Procedure R: Determination of the aggregation state of The Antibody in a Drug-Linker-Antibody Conjugate. A suitable quantity (\u02dc10 \u03bcg) of a Drug-Linker-Antibody Conjugate is eluted through a size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) column (Tosoh Biosep SW3000 4.6 mm\u00d730 cm eluted at 0.35 mL\/min. with PBS) under standard conditions. Chromatograms are obtained at 220 nm and 280 nm and the OD\/ODratio is calculated. The corresponding aggregate typically has a retention time of between about 5.5 and about 7 min, and has about the same OD\/ODratio as the monomeric Drug-Linker-Antibody Conjugate.","In other aspects, the present invention provides a composition comprising an effective amount of a Compound of the Invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or vehicle.

Moreover, where in tablet or pill form, the compositions can be coated to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract thereby providing a sustained action over an extended period of time. Selectively permeable membranes surrounding an osmotically active driving compound are also suitable for orally administered compounds. In these later platforms, fluid from the environment surrounding the capsule is imbibed by the driving compound, which swells to displace the agent or agent composition through an aperture. These delivery platforms can provide an essentially zero order delivery profile as opposed to the spiked profiles of immediate release formulations.

For example, the composition can include materials that form a coating shell around the active ingredients. The materials that form the coating shell are typically inert, and can be selected from, for example, sugar, shellac, and other enteric coating agents. Alternatively, the active ingredients can be encased in a gelatin capsule.","The compositions can consist of gaseous dosage units, e.g., it can be in the form of an aerosol.

Delivery can be by a liquefied or compressed gas or by a suitable pump system that dispenses the active ingredients. Aerosols of Compounds of the Invention can be delivered in single phase, bi-phasic, or tri-phasic systems in order to deliver the Compound(s) of the Invention. Delivery of the aerosol includes the necessary container, activators, valves, subcontainers, Spacers and the like, which together can form a kit.

Surfactants are compounds that non-covalently interact with a Compound of the Invention so as to facilitate dissolution or homogeneous suspension of the active compound in the aqueous delivery system.","The Compounds of the Invention are useful for treating cancer, an autoimmune disease or an infectious disease in an animal.","The Compounds of the Invention are useful for inhibiting the multiplication of a tumor cell or cancer cell, or for treating cancer in an animal. The Compounds of the Invention can be used accordingly in a variety of settings for the treatment of animal cancers. The Drug-Linker-Ligand Conjugates can be used to deliver a Drug or Drug unit to a tumor cell or cancer cell. Without being bound by theory, in one embodiment, the Ligand unit of a Compound of the Invention binds to or associates with a cancer-cell or a tumor-cell-associated antigen, and the Compound of the Invention can be taken up inside a tumor cell or cancer cell through receptor-mediated endocytosis. The antigen can be attached to a tumor cell or cancer cell or can be an extracellular matrix protein associated with the tumor cell or cancer cell. Once inside the cell, one or more specific peptide sequences within the Linker unit are hydrolytically cleaved by one or more tumor-cell or cancer-cell-associated proteases, resulting in release of a Drug or a Drug-Linker Compound. The released Drug or Drug-Linker Compound is then free to migrate in the cytosol and induce cytotoxic activities.
