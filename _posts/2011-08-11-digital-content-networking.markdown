In an embodiment, the personal mobile device  located in the vehicle  receives cellular communications services from the cellular service provider system  and\/or from the computer  via the WiFi system . The personal mobile device , which may be a cellular telephone or smart phone, is operated by an occupant of the vehicle . Communications between a short-range wireless antenna  and the personal mobile device  may be implemented using BlueTooth\u2122 protocols or similar types of communications technologies.","The cellular service provider system  may also provide cellular communications services directly to the vehicle  via the communications tower  and a cellular antenna  resident on the vehicle . The cellular communications are received at, and transmitted by, the wireless device  through the cellular antenna  and\/or through a short-range wireless antenna  disposed on the wireless device . For example, the vehicle  may be equipped with cellular communications components that enable cellular communications to be conducted between the cellular network  and the vehicle  (via the wireless device , short-range wireless antenna , and personal mobile device ), as well as between the cellular network  and the personal mobile device .","In an embodiment, the vehicle  uses signals received from satellites, such as satellite  via a global positioning system (GPS) antenna  disposed on the vehicle . The location information may be received in the form of latitude and longitude coordinates and is used by the wireless device  to process the vehicle's location. Additionally, or alternatively, the location information may be tracked via the cellular network, the cellular service provider system , and the cellular antenna  or the personal mobile device  using, e.g., a specialized application running on the vehicle  or the personal mobile device .","In an embodiment, the wireless device  communicates over the vehicle communication bus  with the DTV\/IPTV module , as well as one or more vehicle modules . In an embodiment, the DTV\/IPTV module  is configured to scan programming signals in communication range of the vehicle  and to monitor the signal strength of these signals. The DTV\/IPTV module  may also include logic for performing the mobile networking services, as described herein.

In yet another embodiment, the modules  may include a tutorial that provides assistance to vehicle occupants for using the mobile networking services, and other vehicle components or features, as well as providing useful suggestions, as will be described further herein. A firewall  may be established between the communication bus  and the wireless device  in order to prevent unauthorized attempts to access or modify user-configured mobile networking services settings.","In an embodiment, the wireless device  presents content to vehicle occupants. The wireless device  may include an audio system (e.g., digital radio) or an audio\/video system, such as a television. The wireless device  may include a display screen, speakers, channel controls, signal receivers, and related components for receiving and providing content to the occupants. In an embodiment, the wireless device  includes a computer processor for communicating with the communication bus , as well as other communications devices, such as the personal mobile device . In an embodiment, the wireless device  may also include a recording component for recording content presented on the wireless device . In addition to presenting programming content via the wireless device , the mobile networking services may be configured to present tutorials on the wireless device  via one of the modules .","As indicated above, the mobile networking services enhance a vehicle occupant's infotainment experience by monitoring signals of content active on the infotainment system. The mobile networking services monitor signal strength for a content channel presented in a vehicle, and enable an end user of the mobile networking services to configure vehicle components to provide continued, uninterrupted presentation of the content based on the signal strength identified through the monitoring. The mobile networking services are configured to recognize if the desired digital content is no longer available within a predetermined distance, and provide notification to the end user. The notification may be a message indicating a weakened signal or instructions on how to navigate the vehicle to continue presentation of the content without disruption. In addition, the mobile networking services may track other vehicle conditions and notify the user when signal strength of the content is weakening, in conjunction with a recommendation for vehicle service or maintenance in the region based on the tracked vehicle conditions, such that the end user can continue to enjoy the content during the vehicle servicing and while the signal is still acceptable.","In an embodiment, the mobile networking services may be configured to enable an end user who is receiving content in one location, e.g., via one of the computer , television , and personal mobile device , to continue to receive the content upon transitioning to the vehicle  for travel.","Turning now to , a detailed description of the DTV\/IPTV module , wireless device , and mobile networking services will now be described in an embodiment. DTV\/IPTV components are implemented, in part, by a dual tuner module  and a program finder and database . The dual tuner module  includes a first tuner that provides the current viewing at the vehicle  and a second tuner that monitors the signal strength of the programming signal.","A location module  and a cellular module  communicate with the program finder and database . Location information is provided by the location module  (e.g., via a GPS receiver  and communication bus ) and the cellular module  (e.g., via a cellular telephone  and communication bus ) to the program finder and database . The program finder and database  contains a database of broadcast stations (e.g., through communications towers, such as communications tower . The database includes the latitude and longitude of the stations, as well as the broadcast coverage radius of these stations. Based on the inputs (e.g., latitude and longitude) received from the location module , the program finder and database  performs calculations to determine the vehicle's location relative to the broadcast station in combination with the signal strength to make a decision whether to switch from one source of signals to another (e.g., from communications tower  to communications tower ). The ability to switch between sources of signals enhances the reliability of the signal levels to provide continuous reception with minimal impacts on route, distance, and time.","Turning now to , a process for implementing the mobile networking services will now be described in an embodiment. As indicated above, the mobile networking services enhance the infotainment experience of vehicle occupants by tracking signal strengths for an active channel (e.g., a channel currently presented on the wireless device ) and performing one or more actions based on the results of the tracking.","At step , the DTV\/IPTV module  identifies a content channel selection on the wireless device  (e.g., a channel tuned in on the wireless device ). At step , the DTV\/IPTV module  receives location information tracked via the GPS antenna  or the cellular antenna  to determine a current location of the vehicle . At step , the DTV\/IPTV module  scans for signals in range of the vehicle  and determines a signal strength of the content channel on the wireless device , as well as a signal strength trend, i.e., whether the signal strength is strengthening, weakening, or remaining the same over time. The DTV\/IPTV module  may be configured to take action upon the occurrence of a condition that is defined by the signal strength or signal strength trending (e.g., if the signal weakens to a specific level or decreases at a specified rate).","At step , the DTV\/IPTV module  determines whether the condition has occurred. If not, the process returns to step  whereby the DTV\/IPTV module  continues to monitor channel selection (e.g., in the event the occupant switches channels). Otherwise, if the condition has occurred, the DTV\/IPTV module  determines an action to be taken at step , and performs the action at step . The process returns to step .","The action taken may be configured by the end user of the mobile networking services via, e.g., the DTV\/IPTV module  and input controls of the wireless device . For example, the action taken may be a notification generated and transmitted that informs the occupants of the vehicle of the weakening signal. The notification may be presented on a display of the wireless device , output by an audio component of the vehicle , or may be transmitted to the personal mobile device  via the short-range wireless antenna .","In another embodiment, the mobile networking services may be configured to utilize the vehicle navigation system (e.g., one of the modules ) to provide alternative routes of travel in which the signal is expected to be stronger than the tracked signal. For example, the DTV\/IPTV module  may receive location information via the GPS antenna  or cellular antenna , determine locations near the mapped route for which a signal is expected to be stronger, and re-configure the route based on these signals. As indicated above, information from the program finder and database  may be used to analyze latitude and longitude data of the stations, as well as the broadcast coverage radius of these stations, in conjunction with the vehicle's current location to anticipate signal strength as the vehicle moves from one location to the next. Based on this information, the DTV\/IPTV module  may notify the navigation module to provide the alternate route to the vehicle occupants either through the navigation system components, the wireless device , or the personal mobile device .","In yet a further embodiment, the mobile networking services may be configured to utilize other vehicle modules  in determining a particular action to be taken. For example, the vehicle  control system may provide fuel or temperature gauge data, or other vehicle component information through one or more vehicle modules  to the DTV\/IPTV module , which uses this information in conjunction with the monitored signal strength information and the location information to recommend a stopping location for servicing the vehicle . That is, the DTV\/IPTV module  may generate and present a notification of a weakening signal and a need for service so that the vehicle operator can decide whether to stop the vehicle  while the signal strength is acceptable or continue on (e.g., when the programming is nearing completion or the vehicle  is close to home).","In still a further embodiment, the mobile networking services may be configured to enable a user who is receiving content in one location to transition the content over to the vehicle  without missing any of the content. For example, a user of the personal mobile device  may be configured with logic to communicate requests for content selection and recording to the cellular antenna  and wireless device , which in turn begins to record a selected channel of content and stores a buffer of the content, such that the user can rewind the content upon entering the vehicle .","As indicated above, the mobile networking services may include a tutorial for using the mobile networking services, as well as other vehicle features, which tutorial is presented on the wireless device . In one embodiment, the tutorial is implemented as one of the vehicle modules  and is configured to monitor driver or occupant activities in the vehicle, assess when the operator or occupant are unsuccessful in these activities, and suggest the tutorial on that particular activity to the operator or occupant. In another embodiment, the tutorial may be offered independent of any activity conducted by the operator or occupant.","Technical effects include enhancing the infotainment experience of occupants of a vehicle by monitoring signal strength for a content channel presented in the vehicle, and enables an end user of the mobile networking services to configure vehicle components to provide continued, uninterrupted presentation of the content based on the signal strength identified through the monitoring.","As described above, the invention may be embodied in the form of computer implemented processes and apparatuses for practicing those processes. Embodiments of the invention may also be embodied in the form of computer program code containing instructions embodied in tangible media, such as floppy diskettes, CD-ROMs, hard drives, or any other computer readable storage medium, wherein, when the computer program code is loaded into and executed by a computer, the computer becomes an apparatus for practicing the invention. An embodiment of the invention can also be embodied in the form of computer program code, for example, whether stored in a storage medium, loaded into and\/or executed by a computer, or transmitted over some transmission medium, such as over electrical wiring or cabling, through fiber optics, or via electromagnetic radiation, wherein, when the computer program code is loaded into and executed by a computer, the computer becomes an apparatus for practicing the invention. When implemented on a general-purpose microprocessor, the computer program code segments configure the microprocessor to create specific logic circuits.","While the invention has been described with reference to exemplary embodiments, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes may be made and equivalents may be substituted for elements thereof without departing from the scope of the invention. In addition, many modifications may be made to adapt a particular situation or material to the teachings of the invention without departing from the essential scope thereof.
