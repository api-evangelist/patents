However, although an oil solution having a high viscosity may provide a good existing feel of the cosmetic upon application to the skin, such an oil solution has problems of becoming greasy easily and being difficult to spread. Meanwhile, an oil solution having a low viscosity has a poor existing feel, and not only can not retain the smooth feel but also easily loses the good existing feel of the cosmetic upon application to the skin. Those problems are particularly remarkable in a lip cosmetic preparation.","It has been known that a smooth feel can be imparted by blending an aqueous polymer having a large molecular weight in water-based cosmetic preparations such as face lotions, o\/w type milky lotions, and massage agents. Likewise in the oil-based cosmetic preparation, it has been attempted that the oil-based cosmetic preparation is modified by using a polymer compound having a large molecular weight (cellulose derivatives and the like) (e.g., Patent Documents 1 and 2). However in Patent Documents 1 and 2, inhibition of secondary adherence of the oil-based cosmetic preparation is disclosed, but modification of the pleasant feel upon application to the skin is not disclosed.","On the other hand, it is possible to enhance the smooth feel by using polyisoprene and polyether (e.g., Patent Document 3). However, a strong stringy property occurs upon the application of the oil-based cosmetic preparation when such a polymer compound is used.","Further, Patent Document 4 discloses oil-soluble polysaccharide palmitate, and describes that the oil-soluble polysaccharide palmitate may also be used as an oil-based thickener for cosmetics.\n\n","The present invention provides an oil-based cosmetic preparation including the following components (A), (B), and (C):","(A) a cellulose derivative having a cellulose skeleton in a main chain, in which 67 mol % or more in total hydroxyl groups are substituted with a group \u2014O-M-R, wherein M represents CHor a carbonyl group C\u2550O, and R represents a straight or branched alkyl or alkenyl group having 3 to 40 carbon atoms;","(B) an ester oil which is liquid at 25\u00b0 C.; and","(C) a hydrocarbon oil which is liquid at 25\u00b0 C., in which a weight ratio (B)\/(C) of the component (B) to the component (C) is 8\/1 to 1\/4.","The present invention provides an oil-based cosmetic preparation which provides and retains a smooth feel.","The inventors of the present invention have found that an oil-based cosmetic preparation which provides and retains a smooth feel by using a particular cellulose derivative in combination with a liquid ester oil and a liquid hydrocarbon oil at a particular ratio.","The oil-based cosmetic preparation of the present invention especially spreads well and feels and fits comfortably upon application to the skin, which is different from a simple smoothness of an oil solution, and retains a unique smooth feel to the skin. Anon-sticky feeling and pleasant feel upon application to the skin are also retained. \u201cA comfortable feel and fit upon application to the skin\u201d is here in also referred to as \u201ccompatibility upon application\u201d. \u201cA pleasant feel upon application to the skin\u201d is herein also referred to as \u201capplication feeling\u201d.","The above-mentioned Patent Document 4 has disclosed only an extremely broad range of 0.5 to 50.0 of an infrared absorption ratio (ratio of a peak at 1,734 cmto a peak at 3,470 cm) as a preferred degree of esterification. In Patent Document 4, only an intended use as a thickener is also shown, and it is not disclosed at all that the smooth feel is obtained by using the cellulose derivative having a particular structure together with the ester oil and the hydrocarbon oil at a particular ratio as disclosed in the subject application.","The cellulose derivative containing as the component (A) to be used in the present invention is not limited as long as the cellulose derivative has a cellulose skeleton in its main chain.

The normal stress is a stress which occurs in a direction perpendicular to a shear face and acts to press and extend the face when a shear is given to a material. Specifically, the cosmetic preparation is mashed in a glass petri dish using a spatula and kneaded until lumps disappear. Subsequently, using a rotary mode viscoelasticity measurement apparatus (e.g., MCR-301 manufactured by Anton Paar GmbH), the viscoelasticity of the cosmetic preparation is measured in a cone plate (CP25-2) having a diameter of 25 mm at 30\u00b0 C. at shear rates between 0.001 sand 1,000 s. When the shear rates between 0.001 sand 1,000 sare divided equally into 19 points on a logarithmic axis and the viscoelasticity is measured from a low shear rate side, a first normal stress difference Ni of 10 Pa or more is observed until the shear rate is 1,000 s.

The onset temperature of exothermic peak during cooling was designated as the crystallization temperature.","(Component)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0123","num":"0126"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00004","num":"00004"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"168pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["(1) Cellulosederivative1 (ProductionExample1)","3.0 (weight %)"]},{"entry":["(2) Microcrystalline wax (Multiwax W-445,","3.0"]},{"entry":"manufactured by SONNEBORN INC.)"},{"entry":["(3) Paraffin (HNP-9, manufactured by NIPPON SEIRO","5.0"]},{"entry":"CO., LTD.)"},{"entry":["(4) Ceresin (Ceresin #810, (manufactured by NIKKO","4.0"]},{"entry":"RICA CORPORATION)"},{"entry":["(5) Isotridecyl isononanoate","10.0"]},{"entry":["(6) Neopentylglycol dicaprate","20.0"]},{"entry":["(7) Diisostearyl malate","10.0"]},{"entry":["(8) Jojoba oil","10.0"]},{"entry":["(9) Squalane","6.0"]},{"entry":["(10) Hydrogenated polydecene (SILKFLO 364NF,","6.0"]},{"entry":"(manufactured by LIPO CHEMICALS INC.)"},{"entry":["(11) Hydrogenated polyisobutene (number average","5.0"]},{"entry":"molecular weight; 1,350) (PARLEAM 24, manufactured"},{"entry":"by NOF Corp.)"},{"entry":["(12) Octyldodecanol","5.0"]},{"entry":["(13) Titanium oxide","1.0"]},{"entry":["(14) Iron oxide","0.3"]},{"entry":["(15) Red No. 201","0.2"]},{"entry":["(16) Red No. 202","0.4"]},{"entry":["(17) Blue No. 1 Al","0.1"]},{"entry":["(18) Yellow No. 4 Al","1.0"]},{"entry":["(19) Dimer dilinoleic acid dimer dilinoleyl bis(behenyl\/","10.0"]},{"entry":"isostearyl\/phytosteryl) (Plandool-G, manufactured by"},{"entry":"NIPPON FINE CHEMICAL CO., LTD., crystallization"},{"entry":"temperature: 28.6\u00b0 C.)"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"(Production Method)","Base materials (other than a color material) were melted with heating at 90\u00b0 C. and mixed uniformly.
