title: Security key management based on service packaging
abstract: A device receives application information associated with applications provided by a network, and determines service package identifiers for one or more applications identified in the application information. The device also receives information associated with devices and subscribers of the network, and determines security key parameters based on the information associated with the devices and the subscribers of the network. The device further generates, based on the security key parameters, a security key for each of the service package identifiers.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["A service provider is an entity (e.g., a business or an organization) that sells bandwidth of or access to a network (e.g., the Internet, a data network, a telecommunication network, etc.) associated with the service provider. Service providers may include telecommunications companies, data carriers, wireless communications providers, Internet service providers, cable television operators offering high-speed Internet access, etc. Service provider networks enable third party application developers to create applications that use network resources, such as location systems that determine locations of mobile communication devices. These applications make requests to a network device, such as a gateway. The network device processes the requests and sends the requests to service provider systems that provide services, such as determining the locations of mobile communication devices, messaging, and\/or other services. Such service provider systems may be referred to as enablers.","The service provider network defines application programming interfaces (APIs) for third party application developers to access the capabilities of enablers in the service provider network. A third party application often needs to authenticate a person (i.e., an end user) using the third party application, and often provides some form of authentication of the end user. However, in many cases, it is preferable to have the service provider network perform this function on behalf of the third party application. For example, if a developer would like the service provider to bill for an end user's use of the developer's application, the service provider network needs to authenticate the end user of the application. The third party application not only needs to identify the end user, but also needs to receive a level of assurance for that identification.","The generic bootstrapping architecture (GBA) is a technology that enables authentication of a user, of a mobile communication device, for using third party applications and\/or network resources. In the GBA, user authentication is instantiated via a security key (e.g., a GBA key) that may be provided in a Universal Integrated Circuit Card (UICC) of the mobile communication device and in another network device, such as a network application function (NAF). The GBA may authenticate the user, for using an application, by requesting the security key from the UICC and from the NAF, and by verifying that the security keys match each other.","Security keys may be generated for each third party application, and may be based on a variety of parameters. For example, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Technical Specification (TS) 33.110 specifies that the GBA Ks_local key generation may depend on the following parameters: an Integrated Circuit Card Identification (ICCID); a Bootstrapping Transaction Identifier (B-TID); a random (RAND) challenge generated by a Home Location Register (HLR); a user equipment (UE) identifier (e.g., a mobile equipment identifier (MEID), an International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI), etc.); a UE application identifier; a UE UICC identifier; a counter limit; etc. The GBA key may be customized to a specific application, for a specific UE, for a specific UICC, for a specific Long Term Evolution (LTE) session, using a specific network challenge value, etc. However, security key customization and proliferation makes security key management complex, difficult, and expensive for service providers since an overwhelming number security keys are generated for applications.","The following detailed description refers to the accompanying drawings. The same reference numbers in different drawings may identify the same or similar elements.","Systems and\/or methods described herein may simplify management of security keys (e.g., GBA keys) used for a variety of applications and\/or services provided by a variety of networks (e.g., LTE networks, High Rate Packet Data (HRPD) networks, enhanced HRPD (eHRPD) networks, Evolution Data Optimized (1xEV-DO) networks, etc.). In one example implementation, the systems and\/or methods may simplify management of security keys by grouping one or more applications into a specific service package, and generating a security key for the specific service package rather than for each application. For example, the systems and\/or methods may group certain applications offered to subscribers (e.g., voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) applications) into a service package, and may group other applications (e.g., messaging applications, video applications, gaming applications, music applications, network offload applications, etc.) into corresponding service packages. Alternatively, or additionally, the systems and\/or methods may group one or more different applications (e.g., VoIP applications and gaming applications) into a single service package. The systems and\/or methods may generate a security key for each of the generated service packages.","The term \u201ccomponent,\u201d as used herein, is intended to be broadly construed to include hardware (e.g., a processor, a microprocessor, an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), a chip, a memory device (e.g., a read only memory (ROM), a random access memory (RAM), etc.), etc.) or a combination of hardware and software (e.g., a processor, microprocessor, ASIC, etc. executing software contained in a memory device).","As used herein, the terms \u201cuser\u201d and \u201csubscriber\u201d may be used interchangeably. Also, the terms \u201cuser\u201d and \u201csubscriber\u201d are intended to be broadly interpreted to include a user device or a user of a user equipment (UE).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","110","115","120","130","140","150","160","100","110","115","120","130","140","150","160","110","115","120","130","140","150","160"]},"UE  may include any device that is capable of communicating with NAF , BSF , application servers , and\/or HSS  via network .

Alternatively, UICC  may be replaced with an external storage device, such as a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card, an external hard drive, a flash memory data storage device, etc. UICC  may incorporate GBA functions needed for generation and\/or storage of application session security keys through bootstrapping procedures.","NAF  may include one or more server devices, or other types of computation and\/or communication devices, that gather, process, search, and\/or provide information in a manner described herein. In an example implementation, NAF  may refer an unknown UE  to BSF  when the unknown UE  is attempting access to an application or service provided by application server . UE  and BSF  may agree on a session key to be used for encrypted data exchange with NAF . When UE  re-connects to BSF , NAF  may obtain the session key as well as user specific data from BSF  and may begin data exchange with UE  using the related session keys for encryption.","BSF  may include one or more server devices, or other types of computation and\/or communication devices, that gather, process, search, and\/or provide information in a manner described herein. In one example, BSF  may provide application independent functions for mutual authentication of UE  and other devices unknown to each other and for bootstrapping an exchange of secret session keys.","In one example implementation, NAF  and\/or BSF  may receive information associated with applications provided by network  (e.g., via application servers ), and may determine service package identifiers for portions of the applications identified in the applications information. NAF \/BSF  may receive information associated with other devices (e.g., other UEs ) and\/or subscribers of network , and may determine other security key parameters based on the devices\/subscribers information. NAF \/BSF  may generate a security key for each service package identifier based on the other security key parameters, and may store the generated security keys in a storage device associated with NAF \/BSF . NAF \/BSF  may provide particular security keys to particular UEs .","Application server  may include one or more server devices, or other types of computation or communication devices, that gather, process, search, and\/or provide information in a manner described herein. In an example implementation, application server  may store one or more third party applications that use resources provided by a service provider network, which may include NAF , BSF , and\/or HSS . The third party applications may include applications that determine locations of mobile communication devices (e.g., UE ), applications that connect calls between UE  and other UEs , voicemail applications, messaging applications, video applications, etc. The third party applications, via application server , may provide services to users associated with UE , may make authentication requests to BSF , and may make requests for other services to other devices associated with the service provider network. The third party applications, via application server , may receive responses to such requests from BSF . Alternatively, or additionally, one or more of the third party applications may be permanently stored on UE  or may be retrieved from application server  and temporarily stored on UE .","HSS  may include one or more server devices, or other types of computation and\/or communication devices, that gather, process, search, and\/or provide information in a manner described herein. In an example implementation, HSS  may include one or more user databases that support network entities that handle calls. The one or more databases of HSS  may include subscription-related information (e.g., subscriber profiles). HSS  may perform authentication and authorization of a user, and may provide information about the user's (e.g., UE's ) profile and subscriptions.","Network  may include a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), a metropolitan area network (MAN), a telephone network, such as the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), an intranet, the Internet, an optical fiber or fiber optic-based network, or a combination of networks.

As further shown in , application servers  may provide applications information  to BSF , and BSF  may receive applications information . Applications information  may include information associated with applications that determine locations of mobile communication devices (e.g., UE ), applications that connect calls between UE  and other UEs , voicemail applications, messaging applications, video applications, and\/or any other applications, services, and\/or network resources provided by a service provider for one or more networks.","BSF  may group one or more applications, identified in applications information , into a service package to be provided to one or more users (e.g., UEs ). For example, BSF  may group a voicemail application, a messaging application, a calling plan, and billing resources for a particular user into a service package for the particular user. In another example, BSF  may group television services, on-demand services, and Internet services for another user into a service package for the other user. BSF  may associate an identifier (e.g., referred to herein as a service package identifier (ID)) with each service package created by BSF  for one or more applications. The service package IDs of the service packages may be used as security key parameters for a Key Derivation Function (KDF) of BSF  when generating security keys (e.g., GBA keys) for the service packages.","Alternatively, or additionally, BSF  may define service sub-packages for one or more service packages. A service sub-package may include some of the applications defined in a service package. Using the example above, the service package that includes the voicemail application, the messaging application, the calling plan, and the billing resources may be divided in a first service sub-package that includes the voicemail application and the messaging application. The service package may be further divided into a second service sub-package that includes the calling plan and the billing resources. BSF  may associate a service sub-package ID with each service sub-package created by BSF . The service sub-package IDs of the service sub-packages may be used as security key parameters for the KDF of BSF  when generating security keys (e.g., GBA keys) for the service sub-packages.","Alternatively, or additionally, BSF  may designate certain applications as special applications that are not grouped into a service package or a service sub-package. For example, BSF  may designate a secure voice over LTE (VoLTE) application as a special application that is to be authenticated and\/or authorized alone rather than via a service package or service sub-package. BSF  may associate a special application ID with each special application designated by BSF . The special application IDs for the special applications may be used as security key parameters for the KDF of BSF  when generating security keys (e.g., GBA keys) for the special applications.","BSF  may determine other security key parameters for the KDF based on subscriber information , UE information , and\/or other subscribers\/UEs information . For example, BSF  may utilize a UE identifier as a security key parameter that causes BSF  to create a security key that is valid for a specific UE . Such a security key may become invalid when a subscriber switches UICC  to a UE (e.g., with a different MEID or IMEI) other than the specific UE .","BSF  may generate a security key (e.g., a GBA key) for each service package ID based on the determined other security key parameters. In one example implementation, BSF  may generate a security key for a service package associated with UICC  of UE , and may provide the security key to UICC , as indicated by reference number . Alternatively, or additionally, BSF  may generate security keys for each of the special applications designated by BSF , and may provide the security keys for the special applications to NAF , as indicated by reference number .

Although not shown in , BSF  and\/or NAF  may provide one or more of security keys - to one or more UICCs  associated with one or more UEs .","The arrangement depicted in  may vastly reduce the number of security keys (e.g., GBA keys) required to be generated, stored, tracked, and\/or managed across network  and network  elements. The arrangement depicted in  may also facilitate management of provisioning and\/or billing requirements across network  and network  elements. Furthermore, the arrangement depicted in  may simplify application or service authorization and authentication using the GBA since a single security key may used to authenticate and authorize multiple applications grouped in a service package.","Although  shows example components of network portion , in other implementations, network portion  may include fewer components, different components, differently arranged components, or additional components than depicted in .

Security key generator  may utilize one or more of service package IDs , service sub-package IDs , special applications IDs , and other key parameters  to generate security keys for authenticating UEs  and\/or UICCs  to utilize one or more applications.","In one example, security key generator  may generate security keys  (e.g., GBA keys) for the special applications defined by BSF , based on special applications IDs  and other security key parameters . For example, if BSF  defined a secure VoLTE application as a special application, security key generator  may generate a security key specifically for the secure VoLTE application.","Alternatively, or additionally, security key generator  may generate security keys  (e.g., GBA keys) for the service packages defined by BSF , based on service package IDs  and other security key parameters . Each security key  may enable authentication and authorization of all applications or services associated with the service package defined by the corresponding service package ID . In one example, each security key  may be all that is needed for generic applications\/services authentication and authorization in a LTE network utilizing UICCs .","Alternatively, or additionally, security key generator  may generate security keys  (e.g., GBA keys) for the service sub-packages defined by BSF , based on service sub-package IDs  and other security key parameters . Each security key  may enable authentication and authorization of all applications or services associated with the service sub-package defined by the corresponding service sub-package ID .","In one example, any of security keys - may be made valid for a specific UE  by incorporating a terminal ID (e.g., a UE  ID) in the parameters considered by security key generator .

However, the particular service package may be enabled for the subscriber's different UE via an activation process.","In another example, if a service provider defines a standard service package with network offload (e.g., an enterprise LAN, a WiFi network, a WiMAX network, a home LAN, etc. with defined network offload triggers using predefined clients), then proper network offload behavior may be enabled for UE  through a new network element (e.g., an Access Network Discovery and Selection Function (ANDSF)). The service provider may generate a security key for a bundled Internet access, telephone, and television service of the home LAN, if so preferred by a subscriber, by modifying service package ID  or by adding a parameter associated with the bundled service.","In still another example, any of security keys - may be made valid for a specific location by incorporating location information in the parameters considered by security key generator . For example, a service provider can make a particular security key  for a particular service package valid only for a particular location. Any movement of UE \/UICC  outside an area defined by the location information may result in a failure of authentication and authorization of the particular service package for UE \/UICC . For example, the particular security key  may authorize a subscriber (e.g., via UE ) to view a live broadcast of a sporting event while the subscriber and UE  are located within the stadium hosting the sporting event. If the subscriber\/UE  leaves the stadium, the particular security key  may become invalid and the subscriber may be unable to view the live broadcast of the sporting event.","In one example implementation, tying a security key to a service package may provide simplicity since the single security key may used to authorize and\/or authenticate UE  for applications and\/or services defined by the service package. Tying the security key to the service package may also provide flexibility since a service provider may easily refine a service package by changing a service package ID. The service provider may provide other variations either by introducing new parameters in the KDF utilized by security key generator  or by creating different service packages, service sub-packages, and\/or special applications. Either way, the number of security keys utilized by a service provider may be minimized.","Although  shows example functional components of BSF , in other implementations, BSF  may include fewer functional components, different functional components, differently arranged functional components, or additional functional components than depicted in .

BSF  may determine other security key parameters for the KDF based on subscriber information , UE information , and\/or other subscribers\/UEs information .","Returning to , process  may include generating a security key for each service package identifier based on the other security key parameters (block ). For example, in an implementation described above in connection with , BSF  may generate a security key (e.g., a GBA key) for each service package ID based on the determined other security key parameters. In one example, BSF  may generate security keys for each of the special applications designated by BSF , and may provide the security keys for the special applications to NAF , as indicated by reference number . BSF  may generate security keys for the service packages defined by BSF , and may provide the security keys for the service packages to NAF , as indicated by reference number . BSF  may generate security keys for the service sub-packages defined by BSF , and may provide the security keys for the service sub-packages to NAF , as indicated by reference number .","As further shown in , process  may include storing the security keys in a storage device (block ), and providing particular security keys to particular user equipment of the network (block ). For example, in an implementation described above in connection with , BSF  may provide security keys  for the special applications, security keys  for the service packages, and security keys  for the service sub-packages to NAF , and NAF  may store security keys - in a storage device (e.g., storage device ) referred to as a NAF Key Center. Alternatively, or additionally, BSF  may store security keys - in a storage device (e.g., storage device ) associated with BSF . BSF  and\/or NAF  may provide one or more of security keys - to one or more UICCs  associated with one or more UEs .","Process block  may include the process blocks depicted in . As shown in , process block  may include receiving information associated with user equipment of the network (block ), receiving information associated with subscribers of the network (block ), receiving information associated with locations of user equipment (block ), and\/or receiving other information associated with the network (block ). For example, in an implementation described above in connection with , subscriber information  may include information associated with a user (e.g., of UE ), such as a subscriber identification, a subscriber name, a subscriber address, subscriber account information, etc. UE information  may include an identifier of UE  (e.g., a MEID, IMEI, etc.); attachment point information (e.g., a connection point of UE  to network ); a geographical location of UE ; a zip code associated with UE ; a type (e.g., a brand, a manufacturer, etc.) of UE ; UE  capabilities (e.g., a screen size of UE , whether UE  can display high definition (HD) or three-dimensional (3D) content, etc.); etc. Other subscribers\/UEs information  may include information about other UEs , users of other UEs , connection points of other UEs  (e.g., to network ), etc. Location information  may include information associated with physical locations (e.g., GPS locations) of one or more UEs . Other information  may include information obtained from accounting systems, billing systems, marketing systems, etc. associated with network . BSF may receive subscriber information , UE information , other subscribers\/UEs information , location information , and\/or other information .","Process block  may include the process blocks depicted in . As shown in , process block  may include generating a single security key for a particular application based on the other security key parameters (block ), and generating security keys for portions of the service packages based on the other security key parameters (block ). For example, in an implementation described above in connection with , BSF  may generate security keys for each of the special applications designated by BSF , and may provide the security keys for the special applications to NAF , as indicated by reference number . Alternatively, or additionally, BSF  may generate security keys for the service sub-packages defined by BSF , and may provide the security keys for the service sub-packages to NAF , as indicated by reference number .","Systems and\/or methods described herein may simplify management of security keys (e.g., GBA keys) used for a variety of applications and\/or services provided by a variety of networks (e.g., LTE networks, HRPD networks, eHRPD networks, 1xEV-DO networks, etc.). In one example implementation, the systems and\/or methods may simplify management of security keys by grouping one or more applications into a specific service package, and generating a security key for the specific service package rather than for each application. For example, the systems and\/or methods may group certain applications offered to subscribers (e.g., VoIP applications) into a service package, and may group other applications (e.g., messaging applications, video applications, gaming applications, music applications, network offload applications, etc.) into corresponding service packages. Alternatively, or additionally, the systems and\/or methods may group one or more different applications (e.g., VoIP applications and gaming applications) into a single service package. The systems and\/or methods may generate a security key for each of the generated service packages.","The foregoing description of implementations provides illustration and description, but is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed.
