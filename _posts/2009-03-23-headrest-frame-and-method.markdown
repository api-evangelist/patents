{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/038,490, filed on Mar. 21, 2008, entitled HEADREST FRAME AND METHOD, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.","Tubular members may be utilized to support headrests, armrests, or other components of a vehicle seat, and such tubes may include notches that are engaged by a device to prevent or otherwise control movement of the headrest or other seat component relative to the other seat components. Various machines and methods have been developed for forming notches in metal bars and tubes used in this and other applications. However, known tooling and processes for forming notches may suffer from various drawbacks.","For purposes of description herein, the terms \u201cupper,\u201d \u201clower,\u201d \u201cright,\u201d \u201cleft,\u201d \u201crear,\u201d \u201cfront,\u201d \u201cvertical,\u201d \u201chorizontal,\u201d and derivatives thereof shall relate to the invention as oriented in . However, it is to be understood that the invention may assume various alternative orientations and step sequences, except where expressly specified to the contrary. It is also to be understood that the specific devices and processes illustrated in the attached drawings and described in the following specification are simply exemplary embodiments of the inventive concepts defined in the appended claims. Hence, specific dimensions and other physical characteristics relating to the embodiments disclosed herein are not to be considered as limiting, unless the claims expressly state otherwise.","A vehicle seat  includes seat back , a headrest , and tubular supports  and . A plurality of notches  in the tubular supports  and  provide for height adjustment of the headrest  relative to the seatback  via a device  (see also ) that engages the notches . In general, the device  permits the headrest  to be moved vertically and selectively retains the headrest  at a desired vertical position. Various devices have been developed for engaging the notches , such that the device  will not be described in detail herein.","Referring again to , the tubes  and  have a sidewall having a thickness \u201cT\u201d as required for a particular application. In the illustrated example, the tubes  and  are made of steel or other metal material having the desired strength and other engineering properties. However, other deformable materials may also be utilized for the tubes  and . Tubes  and  typically have an outside diameter of about 10-14 mm, and a wall thickness in the range of about 0.75 mm to about 2.60 mm. However, it will be understood that tubes for other applications such as shelving racks, etc. may be formed according to the present invention, and the tubes utilized for such applications may have diameters and wall thicknesses that are much larger or smaller than the typical ranges noted above. Also, according to another aspect of the present invention, notches may be formed in tubes having oval, square, or other non-circular cross sectional shapes. Still further, according to yet another aspect of the present invention, the tubing could have a non-uniform wall thickness, or the material being formed could comprise a solid bar or the like rather than a tube.","In the example illustrated in , the tubes  and  may include one or more detent-forming of grooves or V-shaped notches , one or more U-shaped two-way locking notches  (see also ), and one or more one-way locking notches  (see also ). In the illustrated example, tubes  and  include a plurality of one-way notches . Tube  includes a single U-shaped two-way locking notch , and tube  includes a single V-shaped detent notch . The notches  are substantially V-shaped, with generally flat surfaces that intersect to form a root portion . Root  may be sharp, or it may have a radius, depending upon the requirements for a particular application. Notch  is substantially U-shaped, with generally parallel sidewalls  and  and a smoothly radiused base surface . The one-way locking groove or notch  has a first surface  that is generally transverse or perpendicular to the center line \u201cC\u201d of the tubes  and . The notch  also includes an angled surface  that extends at an acute angle relative to the center line C of tubes  and . The machine and method described in more detail below may be utilized to form notches or grooves having various shapes and sizes, with flat and\/or curved surfaces. It will be understood that the various notches shown in  are examples of notches that may be formed according to the present invention, but a wide range of notch sizes and shapes may be formed according to other aspects of the present invention.","Notch  comprises a locking notch that is engaged by a first device A to prevent vertical movement of tube  when headrest  is in the uppermost position unless the device A is manually disengaged by a user. A second device B engages V-notch  to provide a detent when first device A is locked in notch . Notches  provide a one-way locking function that prevents movement of the headrest  in a first direction (e.g. downwardly) unless devices A and B are manually disengaged by a user, but permits movement of headrest  in the opposite direction (e.g. upwardly) regardless of whether or not devices A and B are manually disengaged. Because various shapes and sizes for notches , , and  are known in the art, the notches , , and  will not be described in further detail herein. Also, a variety of devices A, B are known, and the specific shape, size, and location of the notches , , and\/or  may be configured to be compatible with a specific device . The tubes  and  may include only V-shaped notches , only U-shaped notches , or only one-way locking notches . Alternately, the tubes  and  may include a combination of notches , , and\/or , depending on the requirements for a particular application.","With further reference to , a machine or device  for forming the notches , , and\/or  includes a support structure , and a first component  that is pivotably mounted to the support structure  at a shaft or pivot  utilizing bearings or other suitable structure and pivots relative to the support structure  as indicated by the arrow \u201cR\u201d. Support structure  may comprise one or more plates, tubes or other suitable structure. A forming member such as roller  is rotatably mounted to a plate or other suitable structure . Forming member or roller  may be made from hardened tool steel, ceramic, or other suitable wear-resistant material.","The size and shape of roller  is selected to provide the desired notch shape, and the outer peripheral portion  () of roller  has a cross-sectional surface contour corresponding to the shape of a notch formed by the roller . For example, outer portion  of roller  may have a symmetrical V-shape to form a notch  (), a U-shape to form a two-way locking notch  (see also ), or it may have a non-symmetrical V-shape to form a one-way locking notch  (see also ). The diameter of roller  may vary depending upon the requirements of a particular application. In general, roller  typically has an outer diameter that is about the same as the outer diameter of the tube being formed, or somewhat larger than the outer diameter of the tube being formed. However, the roller  could have a diameter that is smaller than the diameter of the tube.","Referring again to , the plate  is mounted to the first component  by a linear guide , such that roller  and plate  are constrained to move in a linear path indicated by the arrow \u201cB\u201d relative to the first component . Linear guide  may comprise one or more commercially available assemblies having one or more rods, tracks, or the like, with linear bearings that engage the rods or tracks. An eccentric assembly  provides for powered reciprocating motion of roller  in the direction of the arrow \u201cB\u201d relative to the first component . The eccentric assembly  includes an outer member  and a circular inner member  that is slidably\/rotatably received within outer member . Inner member  is fixed to a shaft  at an off-center location, and shaft  is rotatably mounted to the support structure . As discussed in more detail below, shaft  is operably connected to an electric motor  or other powered actuator to provide powered rotation of shaft . An arm  is pivotably connected to the plate  at pivot , such that powered rotation of shaft  causes inner member  to rotate, resulting in linear reciprocating motion of forming roller  and plate  relative to the first component . It will be understood that other arrangements such as a crank arm or other powered mechanisms such as linear actuators may also be utilized to provide reciprocating motion of roller , and the illustrated eccentric is but one example of a suitable mechanism.","With further reference to , an oscillating mechanism  according to another aspect of the present invention may be utilized instead of the eccentric assembly . The oscillating assembly  provides for more complex back and forth motion of plate A and roller  if required for a particular application. Oscillating assembly  includes an inner cam member  and outer cam member , both of which are mounted to a shaft  for rotation as indicated by the arrow \u201cR\u201d. A rotatable follower  is positioned in a space or channel  between inner cam member  and outer cam member  to provide reciprocating motion of plate A and roller  as shown by arrow \u201cB\u201d upon rotation of cam members  and . Plate A is slidably supported on first component  by a pair of bearing plates  and  or other suitable linear bearing arrangement such that plate A and roller  can only move in a linear reciprocating manner. In the illustrated example, shaft  is rotatably mounted to support structure . Thus, channel  is shaped to account for movement of first component  relative to support structure . It will be understood that various linear bearings or the like could be utilized to support plate A for linear movement relative to first component . Also, plate A is shown as being a one-piece member, with roller  and follower  being mounted to plate A. Plate A could comprise an elongated arm that is similar to arm  (), and plate A could be rigidly or pivotably connected to the arm.","A space or channel  is defined between inner surface  of outer cam member  and outer surface  of cam , such that follower  is constrained, and follows a path \u201cC\u201d. The inner cam member  and outer cam member  may comprise a single piece of steel or other suitable material, and the space or channel  may comprise a machined channel in the single piece of material. In general, the width of the space or channel  is slightly greater than the diameter of the follower , such that the follower  is free to rotate upon contact with either the outer surface  of cam , or inner surface  of outer cam member . Because the follower  is constrained by the cams  and , the cam surfaces  and  can be relatively complex to provide for complex reciprocating motion. In this way, the oscillating mechanism  can provide for relatively complex motion of roller . Electric motor  or other powered actuator may be operably connected to the cams  and  by a belt or chain A, gears, shafts, or other suitable mechanism to provide for powered rotation of the cams  and . In the illustrated example, cam member  has four lobes A, B, C, and D. In general, if the cam members  and  rotate at the same rate as second cam , cam member  will have the same number of lobes  as lobes  of second cam . Each lobe  may have a unique shape if required to provide proper movement of roller . Cam members  and  may alternately be driven at a different rotational rate than second cam . For example, if cam members  and  are driven at twice the rotational rate of second cam , cam member  may have one-half the number of lobes  as second cam . Thus, the oscillating mechanism  in combination with the cam lobes  provide for complex motions of roller  to form a variety of paths for roller  as described in more detail below.","A second component  is pivotably mounted to the support structure  at a pin or shaft . A follower or roller  is mounted to second component , and follower  engages a first cam  such that rotation of first cam  causes second component  to pivot about shaft  relative to support structure . A tube  to be formed\/notched and held in place in machine  by first and second clamp members  and . In the illustrated example clamp member  is fixed to structure , and clamp member  is fixed to second component  such that clamp member  moves relative to clamp member  upon rotation of first cam . First cam  is configured to tightly clamp tube  except for during a relatively small portion of the rotation of first cam . Various types of tube clamping\/holding arrangements have been developed, and it will be understood that the clamp members  and  could be configured in a variety of different ways. As discussed in more detail below, first cam  and a second cam  are both fixed to a shaft  and rotate at the same angular rate during operation. Second cam  engages a follower or roller  on first member , and causes first member  to pivot about shaft  to thereby move roller  towards and away from tube , and first cam  clamps tube  during the forming process. First cam  includes a lobe A that causes tube  to be clamped during forming by roller , and a recessed region B that causes tube  to be unclamped during a few degrees of rotation at the start and the end of the forming process to permit removal of a formed tube , followed by placement of an unformed tube  in machine . In the illustrated example, the tube  is clamped during about 260\u00b0 of a 360\u00b0 cycle, and is unclamped for about 100\u00b0 of the 360\u00b0 cycle. Clamp members  and  include cylindrical surfaces that clamp tightly about tube . Alternately, a collet-type clamp (not shown) could also be utilized to clamp tube  in place during forming operations. Clamps  and  are substantially similar to known clamps utilized to secure tubes during forming operations, and the details of the clamp will therefore not be described in detail.","The second cam  includes a plurality of lobes A-F, such that each rotation of second cam  causes multiple rotating movements of first component  about shaft . In general, the eccentric assembly  reciprocates the plate  and forming roller  multiple times for each revolution of second cam . Eccentric assembly  and cams  and  may be interconnected by a mechanical drive system such as a timing chain  that is connected to a fixed sprocket  on shaft  and a second sprocket  mounted to shaft . A third sprocket  is mounted to the rotating output shaft  of an electric motor , and a fourth sprocket  is mounted to shaft . A drive member\/timing chain  wraps around third sprocket  and fourth sprocket , such that actuation of the electric motor  causes simultaneous reciprocating motion of plate  (and roller ) and rotation of cams  and . It will be understood that various gears, drive shafts, or other mechanical drive components may be utilized to operably interconnect the electric motor  with the various moving components. Also, although use of a single electric motor  or other powered actuator ensures that the various components move relative to one another at the correct velocity and relative position, multiple electric motors or other suitable powered actuators may be utilized.","Electric motor  may be operably connected to a controller  that may be programmed to operate the machine  utilizing a user input . Controller  may provide, for example, adjustment of the r.p.m. of electric motor  as required for a particular application. Electronic motor  may rotate at a constant r.p.m. that is adjusted for a particular application, or the r.p.m. may be varied during each cycle if required. User input  may comprise one or more switches or buttons providing user input\/control, and it may also include a display screen and\/or indicator lights providing information to the user concerning the operation of machine . The lights (or screen) may indicate, for example, if a part  is present in the clamp, the rpm of electric motor , and\/or the position of one or more moving components. User input  may be on controller  (e.g. on a housing controller ), or it may comprise a separate unit such as a laptop computer that is operably connected to controller . The machine or device  may include one or more sensors (not shown) that are operably connected to controller  to provide for controlled operation of the machine . For example, one or more sensors (not shown) may be utilized to determine if a part  is present in clamp , and one or more additional sensors (also not shown) may be utilized to determine the position and\/or velocity of one or more of the movable components. Controller  may be configured to stop electric motor  if part  is not properly positioned in clamp  during the portions of a cycle when a part  would normally be clamped in place if the machine is operating properly. The mechanical drive system ensures that the reciprocating motion of plate  and rotation of cams  and  are properly synchronized relative to one another. It will be understood that other powered drive arrangements such as servo motors and the like could also be utilized. Also, hydraulic or pneumatic actuators could be utilized to provide for powered operation of the various components.","In the illustrated example, second cam  includes six lobes A-F, and eccentric assembly  shifts plate  and roller  such that roller  moves across tube  six times for each revolution of second cam . Each cam lobe A-F has a unique shape to provide for incremental forming of tube  upon each pass of roller  across tube . In general, if second cam  rotates in a counter clockwise direction (), roller  will move towards tube  as follower  moves along a first surface portion A of lobe A, and roller  will momentarily change direction of movement as follower  moves across peak A of lobe A. Roller  will then move away from tube  as follower  moves along second surface portion A of lobe A. Roller  will move in a somewhat similar manner as follower  moves along surfaces B-F, peaks B-F, and surfaces B-F of lobes B-F, respectively. However, as discussed in more detail below, each lobe A-F may have a unique shape that is configured to provide a specific movement of roller  as required to form tube  during each pass of roller  across tube . First cam  is configured to clamp tube  when it is being formed by roller , and to unclamp\/release tube  after the last forming pass of roller  corresponding to lobe F. As follower  contacts surface portion  of second cam  between lobes A and F (i.e. after the last forming pass of roller  is completed), follower  contacts a surface portion B of first cam  that unclamps tube  to permit removal of a fully-formed tube , followed by insertion of an unformed tube . Although the lobes A-F of cam  are shown as being spaced at equal angular increments, it will be understood that the spacing between lobes A and F could be increased relative to the spacing between the other lobes to provide for an increased time period\/angular rotation of cams  and  during which tube  is unclamped to facilitate removal and insertion of tubes .","With further reference to , in the illustrated example, roller  is initially at a position A and the outer edge surface  of roller  travels along a path \u201cP\u201d during a first forming pass as the roller  moves from the starting position A to the end position B relative to part . The roller  initially travels along a substantially linear path segment P, then changes direction at point \u201cD\u201d to travel along a path segment P. In the illustrated example, the path segment P forms an angle \u03b8 that is about 35 degrees relative to a line \u201cL\u201d extending through path segment P. However, angle \u03b8 may be in the range of about 30-40 degrees, or it may be as small as 5 degrees, 10 degrees, or 20 degrees, or it may be as large as 50 degrees, 60 degrees or even 90 degrees. In general, angle \u03b8 may comprise an angle between 0 degrees and 180 degrees. Also, as described in more detail below, path segments P and P may be partially or completely curved or nonlinear. The movement of roller  illustrated in  is a result of the combined effects of the linear movement of plate  relative to first component , and the rotational movement of component  about shaft  as follower  moves along cam lobe A.","In the illustrated example, an axis of rotation  of roller  travels along a line or path  having first segment  and a second segment  between a first position A and a second position B. In the illustrated example, the path of the roller  changes directions at a point \u201cD\u201d. The point D is chosen such that a significant portion of the partial groove  includes a linear or straight surface , and a relatively small radiused or angled end portion  is formed as the roller  changes directions at the point D. The point at which the change in direction occurs (i.e. position of point D) may be varied as required for a particular application, depending upon the material from which tube or other part  is formed, the diameter of the tube , and the wall thickness \u201cT\u201d of the tube . Also, although the path  is shown as having straight segments  and  that intersect at point D, it will be understood that the segments  and  may be joined by a smooth radius, rather than a \u201csharp\u201d corner represented by the point D. For example, the segments  and  may be joined by a curved path segment having a radius of about 0.375 inches at point D. Also, the segments  and  of path  could be curved, and these path segments need not be straight or linear as illustrated in .","With further reference to , the roller  initially forms a partial notch or groove  having a base surface portion  that is substantially linear. However, because the roller  changes directions, an end portion  of partial groove  is curved upwardly adjacent outer surface  of tube . If roller  were to continue along a straight path, some of the material forming tube  would be pushed outwardly, thereby forming a bulge in the outer surface  of tube  in the vicinity of the partial groove . However, because the direction of roller  changes to provide a component of motion that is away from tube , the formation of such bulges and the like is substantially reduced or eliminated. As roller  forms groove , some of the material of tube  is deformed inwardly at  into cavity  of tube .","With further reference to , after a first pass () of roller , roller  moves from position B () to the position A () due to motion of plate  and rotation of component  due to second cam . Roller  then moves back across the tube  in a second pass along a path having first and second segments P and P forming an angle \u03b8. It will be understood that the angle \u03b8 may change. This motion results from linear motion of plate , relative to first component  and rotational movement of component  as follower  contacts second lobe B. Lobe B is configured to move roller  towards tube  for the first portion of the second pass corresponding to segment P, such that the distance \u201cD\u201d () between the edge  of roller  and a center axis  of tube  is less than distance \u201cD\u201d () during the first pass of roller . After the second pass of roller  (), the partial groove  becomes deeper with a base surface portion  that is substantially linear, and an end portion  that extends upwardly. As discussed above in connection with , the change in direction of the roller of  reduces or eliminates the formation of a bulge in outer surface  of tube  in vicinity of the partial groove . The second pass of roller  also eliminates the non-linear end portion  () of groove .","In the illustrated example, the tube  has a wall thickness \u201cT\u201d of about 0.08 inches, and a diameter of about 0.50 inches. However, tube  may have different diameters (e.g. one inch) and wall thicknesses depending upon the requirements for a particular application. Also, in the illustrated example, the tube  is made of a high-tensile steel material. In this example, once the first pass of roller  () is completed, the roller  is shifted a distance (D-D) about 0.010 inches closer to the tube  for the second forming pass illustrated in . However, the incremental shift of roller  closer to tube  may vary depending upon the thickness of the wall of the tubing , the material from which the tube  is made, and other variables. Also, the distance roller  is shifted may vary from one pass to the next for a given tube. As illustrated in , the roller  is moved back and forth across the tube , and the roller  is moved closer to the tube  for each successive pass of the forming roller . In the illustrated example, the movement of roller  in  corresponds to lobes C and D, respectively () of second cam . In general, the number of passes will vary depending upon the size and shape of the notch being formed, the material, size, and shape of part , and other process variables. The number, size, shape, and positions of cam lobes of second cam  may be changed as required to provide the proper number of passes, path direction, etc. for a particular application.","With further reference to , after the partial groove  has been formed to a depth that is equal to, or close to, the final depth of the notch, the roller  is moved across the tube  in a substantially straight path to flatten the end portion  () and end portion  () to thereby form a linear or straight bottom surface . The linear motion of roller  illustrated in  corresponds to lobes E and F, respectively of second cam  (). In this way, a groove having a profile as illustrated by the notches , , and  () can be formed. It will be understood that the roller  has a surface contour adjacent the outer edge surface A of roller  that is configured to provide the proper groove shape for a particular application.","In addition to the forming paths discussed above in connection with , the roller  may also be configured to travel along a plurality of paths as illustrated in .  show various roller motions or paths that may be utilized to perform the initial forming operations on a tube ;  shows various forming paths that may be utilized for one or more intermediate passes; and  illustrates one or more paths for forming passes that may be utilized to finish the forming operation.","With reference to , one or more initial grooves or indentations  and\/or  may be formed by moving roller  along a path indicated by the arrow \u201cA\u201d or the path indicated by the arrow \u201cA\u201d, respectively. The paths A and A may be curved, or they may include substantially straight segments as shown in, for example, . Alternately, indentations  and\/or  may be formed by movement of roller  as shown by the arrows \u201cA\u201d and \u201cA\u201d, respectively. The roller  moves in a direction that is substantially perpendicular to the surface  of tube  when moving along the paths shown by the arrows A and A. A single initial indentation  may also be formed by moving roller  in the direction of the arrow \u201cA\u201d, which is substantially perpendicular to the outer surface  of tube .","With further reference to , after forming initial indentations  and\/or  or , one or more forming passes may be utilized to form an enlarged indentation or groove  having non-linear end portions  and . Roller  may travel along a path shown by the arrow \u201cA\u201d, followed by movement as shown by the arrow \u201cA\u201d, followed by movement shown by the arrow \u201cA\u201d. The roller  may travel in either direction along the path segments shown by the arrows A, A, and A, such that each pass is generally U-shaped. The path segment A forms an angle \u03b8relative to path segment A, and path segment A forms an angle \u03b8relative to path segment A. The angles \u03b8and \u03b8may be about 90\u00b0 or a few degrees less than 90\u00b0. In general, angles \u03b8and \u03b8may be in a range of about 70\u00b0 to about 90\u00b0, and the angles \u03b8and \u03b8are preferably about 80\u00b0 according to one aspect of the present invention. Alternately, the angles \u03b8and \u03b8may be about 90\u00b0, such that the roller  travels along the path segments A, A, and A. The center path segment A has a length \u201cL\u201d. The length L may increase during successive passes to thereby successively increase the length of the base  of groove . The angle \u03b8may be equal to the angle \u03b8, such that the path of the roller  is symmetrical. However, the angle \u03b8does not need to be equal to the angle \u03b8, and the path traveled by the roller  may therefore be asymmetrical. Also, the path is shown as abruptly changing direction at the points \u201cB\u201d and \u201cB\u201d. However, the path may include a curved transition between straight path portions A, A, and A (or path sections A, A and A). Alternately, the path sections may all be curved, such that the roller travels along a curved path that is somewhat similar to the paths \u201cA\u201d and \u201cA\u201d of .","With further reference to , after the roller  travels along one or more paths as illustrated in , one or more finishing passes may be made to reduce or eliminate the non-linear end portions  and  of the partially-formed groove. The roller may travel along a path defined by the segments \u201cA\u201d, \u201cA\u201d, and \u201cA\u201d. The angles \u03b8and \u03b8for the finishing passes shown in  are typically substantially smaller than the angles \u03b8and \u03b8of the intermediate forming passes shown in . The angles \u03b8and \u03b8for the finishing passes may be in a range of about 0\u00b0 to about 30\u00b0, and more preferably are in a range of about 5\u00b0 to about 10\u00b0. Length \u201cL\u201d of the center path section A is typically somewhat longer than the dimension \u201cL\u201d of the intermediate passes (). In the illustrated example, the dimension \u201cL\u201d () is the distance between the points \u201cB\u201d and \u201cB\u201d defining the intersection between the path sections A and A, and A and A, respectively. The path sections A, A and A may be joined by a curved transition portion rather than the points B and B, or the path sections A, A, and A may be curved to form paths that are somewhat similar to paths A and A (). However, in a preferred embodiment the path section A is straight to thereby form a straight indentation  along the base of the notch or groove. Also, the end portions  and  are quite small, and the dimension L is therefore typically almost as great as the distance of a line extending along the straight portion  of the groove where the line would intersect the outer surface  of the tube . The angles \u03b8and \u03b8may be reduced to zero for one or more final finishing passes to eliminate end portions  and  and thereby produce a notch having a linear vertex.","As discussed above, the reciprocating component of the motion of roller  results from the eccentric assembly  (), and the component of motion of roller  away from tube  is due to the rotation of first component  about shaft  due to second cam . The configuration of the eccentric  and the lobes - of second cam  are selected to provide the desired path of the roller  as shown in , , , , , and . However, other mechanical devices, actuators, and the like could also be utilized to provide the desired path of movement of the roller . For example, pneumatic, hydraulic, electrical, or other powered actuators (not shown) could be operably connected to controller , and one or more sensors (also not shown) could be operably connected to controller  to provide controller  with information concerning the position and\/or velocity of one or more movable components such as roller . Controller  may be programmed to provide the required motion of roller  along one or more paths during a series of forming passes as described above in connection with .","In the illustrated example of , six forming passes corresponding to lobes A-F of second cam  are utilized to form the notches, and a notch is fully formed in a tube  for each revolution of second cam . However, it will be understood that a greater or fewer number of passes may be required for different notch shapes\/sizes. For example, as few as two passes may be utilized to form tube , or ten or more passes may be utilized. If the forming passes of  are utilized, a total of about 8-16 passes (and\/or linear motions A, A, A) are typically utilized. Also, a plurality of cams  having different numbers of lobes and\/or sizes\/shapes of lobes may be fabricated, and the machine  may be configured to form different notch shapes\/sizes by changing second cam  to a cam having a different profile. Also, the roller(s)  may also be changed as required to provide for different notch shapes, and the clamp members  and  may also be changed to accommodate tubes of different sizes.","As discussed above, the path of the roller while it is in contact with the tube  may have a variety of shapes, and may include straight or curved portions. In general, the path of the roller is non-linear and includes a component of motion away from the part at or near the end of the contact with the part to reduce or eliminate bulging or other deformation adjacent the notch or groove. Prior to the finishing passes of the roller, the groove will typically have one or two end portions (e.g. end portions , , ) and a deeper center portion to thereby reduce bulging. Also, although the part  is moved in an arc about shaft  while roller  moves linearly in the illustrated example, it will be understood that other arrangements could be utilized to provide the proper relative motion of part . For example, either roller  or part  could be fixed\/stationary relative to support structure , and the other of the roller  or part  could move along a nonlinear path to provide the desired relative motion of roller  relative to part .","During operation, the rotation of cams  and  may be stopped when follower  is adjacent surface portion  of second cam  () to permit insertion\/removal of tubes . Alternately, cams  and  may be rotated continuously without stopping to load\/unload tubes . Also, a mechanical device (not shown) may be utilized to automatically load and unload tubes  without stopping the rotation of cams  and . Tubes  may be cut to length prior to loading tubes  into machine , or longer tube sections may be fed into machine , followed by cutting of the tube into shorter sections to form individual tubes.","If a plurality of grooves are to be formed on a tube, the device  may include a plurality of rollers  mounted on plate , such that a plurality of grooves are simultaneously formed in a tube . Alternately, the machine or device  may include a single roller , and the tube  may be unclamped and moved to a new location relative to the clamps  and  for forming of additional notches. Also, although the forming tool or member  preferably comprises a roller having a uniform circular shape, other forming members (e.g. non-rotatable forming members) may also be utilized to form the notches. It will be recognized that oil or other lubricants may be utilized in conjunction with rollers or other forming members if required for a particular application. Also, tube  may comprise a U-shaped part having a pair of generally parallel notched sections such as the supports  and  (), and a transverse section (not shown) extending between the parallel sections. Machine  may include a pair of rollers  operably connected to second cam  that simultaneously form notches in the parallel sections of the tube.","Also, machine  may include a plurality of rollers , each of which moves along the same path, with part  being moved to a new position following each pass such that the notch is successively formed by different rollers. For example, a first roller  may be configured to move along the path shown in , a second roller may be configured to move along the path shown in , a third roller may be configured to move along the path shown in , a fourth roller may be configured to move along the path shown in , a fifth roller may be configured to move along the path shown in , and a sixth roller may be configured to move along the path shown in , with the part  and\/or rollers being shifted relative to one another between forming passes to align the partially-formed notch with the next roller in the sequence. If required, the rollers may have different sizes and\/or shapes to provide forming of the notch in a controlled\/required manner.","The forming machine or device  and method of the present invention provide a way to form notches in tubes in a manner that alleviates the drawbacks associated with prior forming techniques and machines. For example, because material is not removed to form the notches, the tube  is not weakened due to the substantially reduced wall thickness resulting from removal of material. Specifically, referring to , material  of tube  is deformed towards the central cavity  of tube  due to the action of roller . With further reference to , once the notches are fully formed, tube  has a wall thickness \u201cT\u201d at the notch , , or . The thickness T is generally about the same as the wall thickness T of tube  away from the notches. Also, the forming roller  may be configured as such that the notches , , and  have substantially smooth outer surfaces. Still further, the forming process discussed in more detail above substantially eliminates the formation of burrs, bulges, or other visual imperfections in the vicinity of the notches.","With further reference to , two-way locking notch  includes opposing side surfaces  and , and a base or root surface . Corners  and  formed at the inner section of base surface  and sidewall surfaces  and , respectively, may be relatively sharp, or they may have a relatively large radius. The side wall surfaces  and  are preferably perpendicular to the outer surface  of the tubes  and , or the side wall surfaces  and  may taper inward towards each other slightly, such that the angle defined between the side wall surfaces  and  and the outer surface  of the tubes  and  may be in the range of 90\u00b0, or slightly greater than 90\u00b0. The inner section of the side wall surfaces  and  with the outer surface  of the tubes  and  form outer corners or edges  and , respectively. The present invention provides a way to form the two-way locking notch  such that the outer corners or edges  and  are quite sharp, with a very small radius. The ability to form relatively flat side wall surfaces  and  that are 90\u00b0, or close to 90\u00b0 relative to the outer surface  of the tubes  and , along with the formation of sharp points or edges  and  provides for improved engagement of the device  (see also ), thereby ensuring the headrest  and tubes  and  remain at the selected height when the device  engages two-way locking notch . Also, as discussed above, because material is not removed to form two-way locking notch , the side wall thickness \u201cT\u201d is substantially uniform in the region of the notch , such that the strength of the tubes  and  is not reduced to the same degree as is would be if material had been cut out or otherwise removed to form the two-way notch .","With further reference to , a one-way locking notch  includes a tapered or angled surface , and a first surface  that intersects with the surface  at a root or base . The surface  is perpendicular, or close to perpendicular to the outer surface  of tubes  and , and forms a sharp outer corner . As discussed above in connection with the two-way locking notch  of , this ensures that the device  engages one-way locking mesh  to prevent upward movement of the tubes  and . Also, as discussed above in connection with , the side wall thickness \u201cT\u201d is approximately constant throughout the area of the one-way locking notch , such that the strength of the tubes  and  is not reduced to the extent it would be if material were removed to form the one-way locking notch .","With further reference to , the lobes of second cam  may be configured such that roller  travels along a path defined by the arrows A, A, and A. The arrow A forms an angle \u03b8with the arrow A, and the arrow  forms an angle \u03b8relative to the arrow A. Arrows A and A intersect at the point B, and the arrows A and A intersect at the point B. The angles \u03b8and \u03b8may be equal to one another, or they may be different. In general, the angles \u03b8and \u03b8are between about zero degrees and 90 degrees. In a preferred embodiment, the angle \u03b8is smaller than angle \u03b8. For example, the angle \u03b8may be less than 45 degrees in a range of about 10 degrees to about 30 degrees, and preferably about 20 degrees. The angle \u03b8may be greater than 45 degrees, in a range of about 80 degrees to about 90 degrees. In general, the angle \u03b8may be close to, but slightly less than 40 degrees. It will be understood that the path sections shown by the arrows A, A, and A may be curved, or they may be straight. The roller path illustrated in  forms a partial notch  having a base or vertex  having a first portion , a central portion , and an end portion . Because the path of the roller is asymmetrical, and somewhat S-shaped, the base or vertex  of the notch or groove  is non-linear, with a convex portion adjacent the first portion , and a concave portion adjacent the end portion .","Referring to , a subsequent roller path may include sections shown by the arrows A, A, and A. The path section shown by the arrow A forms an angle \u03b8with the path section shown by the arrow A, and the path section shown by the arrow A forms an angle \u03b8with the path section shown by the arrow A. The path sections A and A intersect at the point B, and the path sections shown by the arrows A and A intersect at the point B. The angle \u03b8may be substantially similar to the magnitudes of the angle \u03b8() described above, and the magnitude of angle \u03b8may be substantially similar to the angle \u03b8. A series of back-and-forth passes as shown in  may be provided to form a notch  (FIG. ) having a base or vertex  with a center portion  and first and second end portions  and . It will be understood that the roller  will typically be brought closer to the tube  for each successive path, and the shape of successive paths need not be identical. For example, the initial forming passes could have one of the shapes shown in , and finishing passes as shown in  could be utilized for form a convex notch as shown in . In general, the passes shown in  produce a final notch shape having a base or vertex  having a convex, curved shape in cross-section as shown in .","Referring again to , the notch  may comprise a V-shaped notch , a two-way locking notch , or it may comprise a one-way locking notch . Because the tube sections  and  may not be aligned precisely with the height-retaining members or devices A and B, if the notches , , and  have a straight or linear vertex, the devices A and B may not properly engage the notches. However, the convex notch shape  () permits some misalignment of the tube sections  and  relative to the mechanisms A and B, while still providing for proper height adjustment of the headrest . For example, if one or both of the tube sections  and  are rotated somewhat about their respective centerlines \u201cC\u201d, the convex notch shape  () will still permit the devices A and B to securely engage the notches.","Although the tube  in the illustrated example is utilized to form tubular supports  and  () for a headrest , the machine and method of the present invention may be utilized to form notches in tubes or solid bars for a variety of applications.","In the foregoing description, it will be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art that modifications may be made to the invention without departing from the concepts disclosed herein. Such modifications are to be considered as included in the following claims, unless these claims by their language expressly state otherwise."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0004","num":"0003"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0005","num":"0004"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 3A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 6"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 8"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 18"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 19"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 20"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 21"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
