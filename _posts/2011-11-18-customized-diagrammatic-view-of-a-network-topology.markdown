The developers may incorporate the customized diagrammatic view and develop application logic based on the customized diagrammatic view and particular applications.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","140","130","102","120","100"]},"The configuration of components of network  illustrated in  is for illustrative purposes. Although not shown, network  may also include other components of a network, such as security devices, etc. Other configurations may be implemented. Therefore, network  may include additional, fewer and\/or different components than those depicted in . Also, in some instances, one or more of the components of network  may perform one or more functions described as being performed by another one or more of the components of network .","Network  may include one or more wired and\/or wireless networks that are capable of receiving and transmitting data, voice and\/or video signals, including multimedia signals that include voice, data and video information. Network  may include one or more wireless\/mobile networks and\/or a public switched telephone network (PSTN). Network  may include one or more packet switched networks, such as an Internet protocol (IP) based network, a LAN, a wide area network (WAN), a personal area network (PAN), an intranet, the Internet, or another type of network that is capable of transmitting data. Network  may include one or more high-speed data networks, such as a very high performance backbone network services (vBNS) network. Also as shown, network  may also include topology extractor , which is described below in greater detail.","Topology domain  may include network topologies for one or more networks. Topology domain  may be a service or circuit that includes a network environment. The network topology for each network may include a collection of interconnected network elements (e.g., nodes or electronic components). The network elements may be connected by communication channels, links, etc. Communication channels in particular networks may be identified based on sending and receiving network elements that may be associated with particular applications.","Topology domain  may also provide an interface via which commands may be executed for particular network elements. For example, topology domain  may receive commands from topology management system  for network elements in a particular network, such as a re-boot command for an optical network terminal (ONT) in a customer premises network.","As shown, topology domain  may include network topology information for networks in one or more domains -, such as a customer premises domain , a provider domain , or a distributor domain , etc. Domains -are subdomains of topology domain  and may contain networks implemented for particular circuits and\/or services.

Topology management system  may be a centralized system that provides network topologies for a variety of applications and users. Topology management system  may create a variety of visual representations for the same network topology in different information technology (IT) applications or systems. Topology management system  may be applied at a single point to determine and display a common (or overlapping) network topology instead of having multiple systems determine network topologies independently for particular applications. Topology management system  may be based on a web based platform or framework, such as Java\/Java 2 platform, enterprise edition (J2EE), active server pages (ASP)\/.NET, ColdFusion, Perl\/Unix, etc.","Topology management system  may extract network topology information from topology domain  using a topology extractor , for instance via network . Topology extractor  may be a point of entry into topology domain  through which network topology information may be extracted for a particular network or circuit. The network topology information may include an inventory of network elements in each network  and interconnections between the network elements. The network topology information may also include physical topology information, such as a physical location of each element in network  and\/or logical topology information, such as a direction of data flow in network .","Topology extractor  may provide a web service that gathers network topology information from topology domain  for identified networks.

For example, processing module  may display network elements in a sequence based on different attributes of input to (and output from) the network elements. Processing module  may identify different connections between network elements in a same domain. Processing module  may also identify connections by ports at the networks elements.","Processing module  may render a diagrammatic view of the network topology based on relevant network elements and connection types for a particular application or end user.

Element control module  may store the customized diagrammatic view of the network topology, for instance in a common rendering server. Developers and other end users may access the customized diagrammatic view of the network topology to represent the network topology in their respective graphical user interfaces (GUIs).","Element control module  may customize commands for each network element. For example, element control module  may allow customization of commands for a network element based on input by a developer, such as business logic applicable to a customized diagrammatic view of the network topology and a particular application or system. Element control module  may provide developers with tools and capabilities to develop customized business logic based on each network element.","Element control module  may determine parameters and authorizations for implementation of the commands. Element control module  may customize privilege levels required to execute and\/or see particular commands based on the commands and different privilege levels of users.

The suspended status of ONT  is No (e.g., service for ONT  is active and not suspended).","A visibility setting for each attribute is also shown. The visibility status for all attributes as shown in  is 1. The attribute may be visible for different levels of users of the network topology. The different levels may include an administrative level (7), a developer level (6), and various user levels (5, 4, 3, 2, 1), with lower numbers indicating reduced privileges and capabilities with respect to a diagrammatic view of the network. For example, all attributes of the network element may be visible to an administrative level user (level 7 user).
