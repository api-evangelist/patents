title: Method of assembling a wrist rest
abstract: A wrist rest assembly for use along the front edge of a device to be operated by a person's hands or fingers, such as in front of a computer keyboard, including an elongate base on which is supported an elongate pad comprising a layer of gel within the covering. The pad has sufficient thickness between its top and bottom surfaces and width between its edges to afford supporting a users wrists on said top surface with a portion of the layer of gel beneath and conforming to the supported wrists and to afford significant motion of the top surface of the pad with the supported wrists relative to the bottom surface in a plane generally parallel to the upper surface of the base. The base has a top portion supporting the pad, a bottom portion adapted to be supported on a horizontal surface; and structure that allows the top portion to be supported on the bottom portion with the top surface of the pad at a predetermined one of several different distances above that horizontal surface.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application is a division of Ser. No. 09\/494,665, filed Jan. 31, 2000, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,626,403 which is a continuation of Ser. No. 09\/016,996, filed Feb. 2, 1998, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,494,418, issued Dec. 17, 2002, which is a continuation of Ser. No. 08\/597,323, filed Feb. 6, 1996, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,713,544, issued Feb. 3, 1998, which is a continuation of Ser. No. 08\/253,510, filed Jun. 3, 1994, now abandoned.","The present invention relates to wrist rest assemblies for use along the front edges of devices to be operated by a person's hands or fingers, such as in front of a computer keyboard, computer mouse or other input device.","Wrist rest assemblies are known for use along the front edge of a device to be operated by a person's hands or fingers, such as in front of a computer key board, computer mouse or other input device. It has been suggested that the use of such wrist rest assemblies can restrict damage to wrists from prolonged use of such devices. Heretofore, however, known wrist rest assemblies have been formed with layers of cushioning material that do not provide the quality of support for the wrists that may be desired.","The present invention provides a wrist rest assembly for use along the front edge of a device to be operated by a person's hands or fingers, such as in front of a computer key board, computer mouse or other input device, which wrist rest assembly provides a layer of cushioning material that can provide better support for the wrists than has heretofore been provided, and further affords a degree of movement of the supported wrist relative to the surface on which the wrist rest is supported that has not been provided by known prior art wrist rest assemblies.","According to the present invention there is provided a wrist rest assembly comprising (1) a base having an upper pad support surface, which base has a bottom or supported surface adapted to be supported on a horizontal surface along the front edge of the device; and (2) a pad comprising a layer of gel. A bottom surface of the elongate pad is supported on the upper pad support surface of the base, and the pad has a sufficient width between its edges and thickness between its top and bottom surfaces (e.g., a thickness in the range of about \u215b inch to 5 inches and a width in the range of about \u00bd to 10 inches with the larger widths providing both wrist and fore arm support) to afford supporting a users wrists on the top surface to help keep the wrists in a neutral position with a portion of the layer of gel beneath and conforming to the supported wrists to distribute the weight of the wrists over a wide area and affording significant motion of the top surface of the pad with the supported wrists relative to the bottom surface in a plane generally parallel to the upper surface of the base.","Preferably the gel is a stable elastomeric block polymer similar to the gel described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,676,387, where the gels are polymer-oil combinations. These polymers are the A-B-A configurations wherein each block A is a glassy or resinous non-elastomeric thermoplastic polymer block with a glass transition temperature above room temperature, i.e., 25\u00b0 C. having an average molecular weight of between about 2,000 and 100,000 and which is relatively incompatible with the elastomeric polymer block B. B is an elastomeric polymer block of a conjugated diene, the average molecular weight being between about 15,000 and 1,000,000 (preferably 15,000 to 250,000) and having a class transition temperature considerably below that of blocks A. This difference in glass transition temperatures may be as small as 15\u00b0 C. but it is preferably at least 100\u00b0 C. and more preferably at least about 125\u00b0 C. The end blocks A of the block copolymer should constitute approximately 10 to 50 percent of the total polymer weight. Such block polymers and a method for their formation, are described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,265,765 (Holden et al.) issued Aug. 9, 1966. and, in general, these are quite suitable in the practice of the present invention.","Elastomeric block polymers of the type useful in the practice of this invention have been combined with oils to make oil extended rubbers and adhesives. In the formation of adhesives, the amount of oil is generally greater than in oil extended rubbers. The formation of adhesive compositions containing such block polymer tackifying resin and oil is described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,239,478 (Harlan, Jr.) issued Mar. 8. 1966. However, in none of the rubbers or adhesives just described does the amount of oil (compatible plasticizing oil) used constitute ordinarily even as much as 67 percent of the total composition, in as much as extension beyond this point will result in an adhesive with little or no cohesive strength. Further the oils recommended in Harlan are at least partially aromatic and such aromaticity results in a soft flowable material where larger percentages of oil are used for the plasticizing effect. The use of a compatible oil is nonacceptable for purposes of the non-acceptable invention.","When an elastomeric block copolymer of the kind noted herein is combined with a non-aromatic paraffinic oil of low volatility with a flash point above about 350\u00b0 F. and below about 500\u00b0 F, wherein the oil constitutes at least about 70 percent of the total weight of the block polymer-oil elastoplastic mixture, an extremely highly elastic material is obtained which is not only useful as such but which is capable of being melted upon heating for casting in the formation of molded and other articles at room temperatures. Stable elastoplastic materials can be formed where the oil constitutes as much as 95 percent of the combined weight of the oil and elastomeric block polymer. When the amount of the oil is less than about 70 percent the melt viscosity becomes excessive for convenient casting from a hot melt system. When the amount of the oil is greater than about 95 percent, a thixotropic liquid results.","Paraffinic oils, which are normally considered incompatible with block polymers or other rubbers, and thus, not considered extender oils, are somewhat compatible with block copolymers at elevated temperatures (i.e., about 300\u00b0 F.) to the extent that the oil and the block copolymer form a mixture which when cooled, exhibits a novel structure which is neither gel nor extended polymer, but is rather a continuous web of one-dimensional polymer strands intermingled with a continuous chase of non-compatible oil. Microscopic examination of the oil polymer mixture reveals a sponge-like construction having voids therein filled with oil. The oil may be removed by mechanical means such as pressing, filtering, etc.","The oil used must be incompatible (non-solvent) with the non-elastomeric thermoplastic polymer block A, should be of low volatility and should have a boiling point in excess of the melting temperature of the polymer-oil combination. For this purpose, ordinary paraffin-based petroleum oils such as mineral oil, petrolatum and other paraffin liquid petroleum products within the viscosity range of products commonly called oils are suitable in the practice of this invention.","Preferably, the gel is the gel described in Example No. II of British Patent No. GB 1,268,431 (which states \u201cA mixture of 5 parts \u201cNujol\u201d (Registered Trade Mark) brand U.S.P. mineral oil and one part styrene-isoprene-styrene block copolymer (\u201cKraton 107\u201d) was heated to approximately 149\u00b0 C. and agitated vigorously until the polymer appeared visually dissolved. Empty pint bottles were dipped into this hot sol so that a layer approximately 1.59 mm thick was deposited on the bottom rim. These bottles could be filled with water and dropped repeatedly onto concrete floor or steel plates without breakage.\u201d) except that the ratio of oil to block copolymer is in the range of 4 to 1 to 10 to 1 rather than being 5 to 1 as is described in that Example No. II. That gel is quite similar to the gel in the pad commercially available from Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company, St. Paul, Minn., under the trade designation \u201cRESTON (T.M.) Flotation Pad\u201d, which pad for many years has been used in beds, wheel chairs and the like to prevent pressure points. Also, preferably the gel has a covering comprising an elongate tubular layer of flexible polymeric material (e.g., polyurethane) around the gel, which tubular layer has sealed ends to retain the gel and provides a flexible barrier to the escape of mineral oil from within the gel. The pad assembly can further include an outer layer over the top surface of the pad of a soft conformable material adapted for comfortable contact with a user's wrists.","Preferably the base comprises a top portion having the upper pad support surface supporting the bottom surface of the elongate pad; a bottom portion having the bottom supported surface adapted to be supported on a horizontal surface; and means for supporting the top portion on the bottom portion with the elongate pad at a predetermined one of several different distances above the supported surface. That means is provided by the top portion of the base comprising longitudinally extending rails projecting outwardly in opposite directions generally parallel to its upper pad support surface, and the bottom portion including generally parallel spaced vertically upwardly projecting support portions having opposed surfaces defining sets of grooves parallel to the supported surface and vertically spaced along the support portions, each of which sets of grooves is adapted to receive the rails to support the top portion with the top surface of the elongate pad at a different distance above the supported surface depending on which set of grooves the rails are engaged in.","While there might be advantages for some applications in allowing the top portion to reciprocate along the grooves of the bottom portion, thereby affording large transverse movements of the wrists with the top portion without relocating the wrists along the top surface of the pad; as illustrated the assembly includes means for releasably fixing the top portion relative to the bottom portions with corresponding ends of the top and bottom portions generally in alignment.","While the wrist rest assembly including its base is very useful, the base is not a necessity to using the pad. Thus generally the method according to the present invention for supporting the wrists of a person operating a device such as a computer keyboard, computer mouse or other input device comprises: (1) providing a pad comprising a layer of gel, which pad has opposite top and bottom surfaces, and opposite longitudinally extending edges; (2) supporting the pad along the front edge of the device; and (3) supporting the users wrists along the top surface of pad; the pad having a sufficient thickness between the top and bottom surfaces and width between the edges to have a portion of the layer of gel beneath and conforming to the supported wrists and to afford significant notion of the top surface of the pad with the supported wrists relative to the bottom surface in a horizontal plane.","Referring now to  of the drawing there is illustrated a wrist rest assembly according to the present invention, generally designated by the reference numeral . The wrist rest assembly  is adapted for use along the front edge of a device to be operated by a person's hands or fingers, such as in front of a computer keyboard  as is illustrated in  or in front of a computer mouse  as is illustrated in  with a shortened version thereof, or in front of a computer keyboard  and mouse  as is illustrated in  with an extended version thereof, to provide support for the wrists of a person using the keyboard  and\/or mouse .","Generally, the wrist rest assembly  comprises (1) an elongate base  having an elongate upper pad support surface  (see FIG. ), which base  has a bottom supported surface  generally parallel to its upper pad support surface  adapted to be supported on a horizontal surface along the front edge of the device  or ; and (2) an elongate pad  comprising a covering  and a layer of gel  within the covering . The pad , which is shown separated from the base  in , has opposite top and bottom surfaces  and , opposite longitudinally extending edges , and opposite ends . The bottom surface  of the elongate pad  is supported on and can be adhered to the upper pad support surface  of the base , and the pad  has a sufficient thickness between its top and bottom surfaces  and  and sufficient width between its edges  to afford supporting a users wrists along its top surface  with a portion of the layer of gel  beneath and conforming to the supported wrists and affording significant motion of the top surface  of the pad with the supported wrists relative to its bottom surface  in a plane generally parallel to the upper surface  of the base . As an example, when the gel  is that gel described in Example No. II in British Patent No. GB 1,268,431 except that the ratio of oil to block copolymer is 6 to 1 rather than being 5 to 1 as is described in that Example No. 3; the layer of that gel  has a thickness of about \u215c inch and a width between the edges of the pad  of about 2.9 inches; and the covering  is of 0.002 inch thick polyurethane; that motion of the top surface  of the pad with a supported wrist relative to its bottom surface  in a plane generally parallel to the supported surface  of the base  allows the supported wrist and the users hand to move in any direction in a generally circular area having a diameter of about one inch. The area of such movement could be made larger or smaller by using different gel compositions, but for most embodiments of the wrist rest should be a circular area having a diameter of at least \u00bd inch.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00022","num":"00022"},"figref":"FIGS. 1 through 4","b":"10"},"The covering  of the pad , best seen in , is an elongate tubular layer of a flexible polymeric material (e.g., 0.001 to 0.003 inch thick polyurethane) around the gel  which is sealed at the ends  of the pad  (e.g., by heat sealing) to retain the gel  within the tubular layer and provide a flexible barrier to the escape of mineral oil or other liquids from within the gel .","As is illustrated in , the assembly  further includes an outer layer  over the top surface  of the pad  adapted for comfortable contact with a users wrists. That outer layer  can, for example, be made of a soft conformable non-woven polyurethane material, or of other materials such as leather, vinyl, or the material commercially designated \u201cDacron\u201d(T.M.) sold by DuPont, Wilmington, Del., or the material commercially designated \u201cUltrilure\u201d (R.T.M.).","The wrist rest assembly  tensions the outer layer  over the top surface  of the pad . As is best seen in , the base  includes an elongate support plate  (e.g., an extrusion of rigid polyvinyl chloride or polystyrene) including a generally plate-like top portion  having opposite sides , opposite ends , the generally planer upper pad support surface , and an opposite bottom surface . The support plate  also includes plate like side portions  along the opposite sides of the top portion  and extending away from the bottom surface  of the top portion  to form with the top portion  an elongate recess . The pad  is supported along the upper pad support surface  of the support plate ; and the outer layer  is in the form of a elongate sleeve having opposite end portions  and extends around the elongate support plate  and the elongate pad  (see ) with its end portions  extending past their ends. The base  further includes an elongate retaining member  (e.g., also an extrusion of rigid polyvinyl chloride or polystyrene) comprising a tensioning portion  within and extending along the elongate recess  with a portion of the outer layer  between the tensioning portion  and the support plate  (see ) to tension the outer layer  across the top surface  of the pad . Means (not shown) in the form of a layer of adhesive impregnating and on both sides of the outer layer , or ultrasonic welding, or screws, or rivets, or pins, or a friction fit between the tensioning portion  and the support plate  are provided for retaining the tensioning portion  within the elongate recess .","Means are also provided for retaining the end portions  of the sleeve or outer layer  around the ends  of the pad  (see FIG. ). The retaining member  has opposite ends  at the ends  of the pad  and openings  into those ends . The end portions  of the sleeve of outer layer  that extend beyond the ends  of the pad  are positioned in the openings . The assembly  includes end caps  attached at the opposite ends  of the retaining member  by two self taping screws  extending through the end caps  and engaging openings  in the retaining member . The end caps  include projections  projecting into the openings  in the retaining member  that engage the end portions  of the outer layer  sleeve to provide the means for retaining those end portions  around the ends  of the pad .","The support plate  and the retaining member  together provide a top portion  for the base  that has the upper pad support surface  supporting he bottom surface  of the elongate pad . The base  also includes a bottom portion  having the bottom supported surface  adapted to be supported on a horizontal surface; and, as is best seen in , means are provided for supporting the top portion  on the bottom portion  with the top surface  of the elongate pad  at a desired predetermined one of several different distances above the bottom surface . Those means are provided in that the top portion  of the base  comprises longitudinally extending rails  on the retaining member  projecting outwardly in opposite directions generally parallel to its upper surface ; and the bottom portion  of the base  includes generally parallel spaced vertically upwardly projecting support portions  having opposed surfaces defining sets of horizontal grooves , and vertically spaced along the support portions . Each of the sets of grooves , or is adapted to slidably receive the rails  to support the top surface  of the pad  on the top portion  at a different distance above the bottom supported surface . Thus, the top portion  of the base  can be slid longitudinally of its bottom portion  to disengage the rails  from one set of the grooves , or with which they are engaged, and subsequently engaged with a different set of the grooves , or to change the distance between the supported surface  and the top surface  of the pad as may be desirable to properly support a users wrists.","As can be seen in , the top and bottom portions  and  are both of about the same length, and the assembly  further includes means for releasably retaining the top portion  in the bottom portion  with the corresponding ends of the top and bottom portions  and  generally in alignment. That means comprises removable end covers  each adapted for engagement with an end of the top portion  and extending across and around the adjacent end of the bottom portion  so that the end of the top portion  with which the end cover  is engaged can not move further into the bottom portion . Engagement between each end cover  and an end of the top portion  is provided in that the end caps  have opposite outwardly projecting vertically extending tabs  () at their ends adjacent the support portions , and the end covers  have opposed inwardly projecting vertically extending tabs  () adapted to engage between the tabs  on the end caps  and the ends  of the retaining member  when the end cover  is slid vertically toward the supported surface  to the position illustrated in FIG. . With both end covers  engaged with the ends of the top and bottom portion  and  the top portion  cannot move in the bottom portion  in either direction, and thus is releasably retained in the bottom portion  with the corresponding ends of the top and bottom portions  and  generally in alignment.","With either or both of the end covers  removed, the top portion  can reciprocate along the bottom portion  by sliding movement of the rails  in the surfaces defining the grooves , or with which they are engaged which affords removing the top portion  from the bottom portion  and re-engaging it with the rails  in a different set of grooves , or to change the distance between the top surface  of the pad and the supported surface . Such reciprocation afforded by removing one or both of the end covers  might also provide advantages for some uses of the assembly  to affording large transverse movements of the wrists with the top portion  without relocating the wrists along the top surface  of the pad  (e.g., to move one hand from the typing keys to the numerical pad of a computer keyboard without lifting the wrists from the pad ).","The present invention has now been described with reference to one embodiment thereof. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that many changes can be made in the embodiment described without departing from the scope of the present invention. For example: the wrist rest assembly can be made any length; the pad support surface of the base could have shapes other than generally planar such as being arcuate around a longitudinal axis to make it, for example, cylindrically convex or concave, or could have transverse recesses below where a users wrists would normally be supported; the bottom portion  of the base could have more or less than three sets of grooves to provide larger or smaller ranges of adjustment; and the wrist rest assembly could further include a base plate attached along and having a portion projecting from the supported surface  of base, which projecting portion is adapted to support the device, such as those base plates ,  or  illustrated in ,  and . Thus, the scope of the present invention should not be limited to the structure described in this application, but only by the structure described by the language of the claims and the equivalents thereof."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND ART","DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The present invention will be further described with reference to the accompanying drawing wherein like reference numerals refer to like parts in the several views, and wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00017","num":"00017"},"figref":"FIGS. 1 through 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00018","num":"00018"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 5"],"b":["6","6"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00019","num":"00019"},"figref":["FIGS. 7","FIG. 1"],"b":["8","9"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
