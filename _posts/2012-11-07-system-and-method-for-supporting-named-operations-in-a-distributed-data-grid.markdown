Lee, Gene Gleyzer, Charlie Helin, Mark Falco, Ballav Bihani and Jason Howes, filed Oct. 15, 2012, which application is herein incorporated by reference.","A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material which is subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure, as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.","The present invention is generally related to computer systems, and is particularly related to a distributed data grid.","Modern computing systems, particularly those employed by larger organizations and enterprises, continue to increase in size and complexity. Particularly, in areas such as Internet applications, there is an expectation that millions of users should be able to simultaneously access that application, which effectively leads to an exponential increase in the amount of content generated and consumed by users, and transactions involving that content. Such activity also results in a corresponding increase in the number of transaction calls to databases and metadata stores, which have a limited capacity to accommodate that demand.","This is the general area that embodiments of the invention are intended to address.","Described herein is a system and method that can support one or more named operations in a distributed data grid. The distributed data grid includes one or more cluster nodes that can provide the one or more named operations associated with one or more resources in the distributed data grid. The distributed data grid can publish the one or more named operations to a client. Furthermore, the distributed data grid can perform the one or more named operations in the distributed data grid upon receiving a request from a client.","Described herein is a system and method that can support one or more named operations in a distributed data grid.","In accordance with an embodiment, as referred to herein a \u201cdistributed data grid\u201d, \u201cdata grid cluster\u201d, or \u201cdata grid\u201d, is a system comprising a plurality of computer servers which work together to manage information and related operations, such as computations, within a distributed or clustered environment. The data grid cluster can be used to manage application objects and data that are shared across the servers. Preferably, a data grid cluster should have low response time, high throughput, predictable scalability, continuous availability and information reliability. As a result of these capabilities, data grid clusters are well suited for use in computational intensive, stateful middle-tier applications. Some examples of data grid clusters, e.g., the Oracle Coherence data grid cluster, can store the information in-memory to achieve higher performance, and can employ redundancy in keeping copies of that information synchronized across multiple servers, thus ensuring resiliency of the system and the availability of the data in the event of server failure. For example, Coherence provides replicated and distributed (partitioned) data management and caching services on top of a reliable, highly scalable peer-to-peer clustering protocol.","An in-memory data grid can provide the data storage and management capabilities by distributing data over a number of servers working together. The data grid can be middleware that runs in the same tier as an application server or within an application server. It can provide management and processing of data and can also push the processing to where the data is located in the grid. In addition, the in-memory data grid can eliminate single points of failure by automatically and transparently failing over and redistributing its clustered data management services when a server becomes inoperative or is disconnected from the network. When a new server is added, or when a failed server is restarted, it can automatically join the cluster and services can be failed back over to it, transparently redistributing the cluster load. The data grid can also include network-level fault tolerance features and transparent soft re-start capability.","In accordance with an embodiment, the functionality of a data grid cluster is based on using different cluster services. The cluster services can include root cluster services, partitioned cache services, and proxy services. Within the data grid cluster, each cluster node can participate in a number of cluster services, both in terms of providing and consuming the cluster services. Each cluster service has a service name that uniquely identifies the service within the data grid cluster, and a service type, which defines what the cluster service can do. Other than the root cluster service running on each cluster node in the data grid cluster, there may be multiple named instances of each service type. The services can be either configured by the user, or provided by the data grid cluster as a default set of services.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","101","106","111","116","110","100"]},"Named Operations","In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, different named operations can be supported in order to improve performance and ensure security in the distributed data grid. Such named operations can be performed, e.g. using named queries, named entry aggregator, and named entry processors.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["201","211","212"]},"A resource A-B - in the distributed data grid  can be configured for a client  in a client-server environment  to perform one or more data grid operations. These data grid operations can include one or more named operations, e.g. named operations A-C -. For example, resource A  supports a named operation A , while resource B  supports a named operation B  and a named operation C .","Furthermore, a configuration file , e.g. a cache configuration file in XML format, can be used to define each resource A-B - in the distributed data grid . The configuration file  can include definitions of the named operations A-C - for the different resources A-B - in the distributed data grid , and each named operation A-C - can be configured with a unique name.","The distributed data grid  can publish the one or more named operations A-C - to the client , e.g. using Web Application Description Language (WADL) , and allows the client  to request the performance of the available named operations -, e.g. by name.","Additionally, the client  can access the distributed data grid  via a proxy service . The proxy service  can trigger the requested named operations, e.g. named operation A  on resource A  or named operation B  on resource B , on behalf of the client , after receiving a request from the client . Thus the proxy service  can address security concerns and help isolate the distributed data grid  from potentially untrusted clients.","The distributed data grid  can provide a response to the client  after performing the named operations. For example, when the request from the client is a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) request, the distributed data grid  can provide a HTTP response back to the client .","In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, the client  can be a REpresentational State Transfer (REST) client that supports accessing a distributed data grid via a REST API. The REST API can include support for performing GET, PUT, and DELETE operations on a single object in a resource, e.g. a cache, for a REST client. On the other hand, the distributed data grid  can provide a REST service that implements the REST API in order to support the REST clients.","Furthermore, the REST services in the distributed data grid , such as the Coherence REST services, may require metadata about the cache that they expose. The metadata can include the key and value types for each cache entry, in addition to key converters and value marshallers. The distributed data grid  can use built-in converters and marshallers (with both XML and JSON supported) based on the associated key and value types.","For example, in Coherence, a user can edit the coherence-rest-config.xml file to define the key and value types for a cache entry. The user can include the <key-class> and the <value-class> elements within the <resource> element respectively. The following example defines a string key class and a value class for a Person user type:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"189pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"<resources>"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"175pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"<resource>"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"161pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"<cache-name>person<\/cache-name>"]},{"entry":[{},"<key-class>java.lang.String<\/key-class>"]},{"entry":[{},"<value-class>example.Person<value-class>"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"175pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"<\/resource>"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"189pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"<\/resources>"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["302","300","321","311","301","305","311","321","304"]},"In Coherence, the named query  is a query expression that can be configured for a resource in the coherence-rest-config.xml file.

A user can specify type hints as part of a query parameter definition (:paramName; int), in the case when parameter bindings do not have access to type information.","In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, the distributed data grid  allows a client to use direct queries, in addition to the named queries. In Coherence, direct queries are query expressions that can be submitted as the value of the parameter q in a REST URL. The query expression can be specified as a URL-encoded CohQL expression (the predicate part of CohQL). Direct queries, which may be disabled by default as a security measure, can be enabled by adding a <direct-query> element for each resource to be queried and setting the enabled attribute to true in the coherence-rest-config.xml file.","Furthermore, the distributed data grid  can use a query engine  to execute queries for both direct and named queries. This query engine  can be either a default query engine or a custom query engine. In Coherence, a default query engine can execute queries that are expressed using a CohQL syntax (the predicate part of CohQL). Additionally, a custom query engine can be used to perform the named query operation on the distributed data grid .","The custom query engine allows the use of different query expression syntaxes or the ability to execute queries against data source other than Coherence (for example, to query a database for entries that are not present in a cache). Custom query engines can implement a query interface, such as the com.tangosol.coherence.rest.query.QueryEngine and com.tangosol.coherence.rest.query.Query interfaces In Coherence. Additionally, custom implementations can also extend the com.tangosol.coherence.rest.query.AbstractQueryEngine base class, which provides convenient methods for parsing query expression and handling parameter bindings. The base class supports parameter replacement at execution time and type hints that can be submitted as part of the query parameter value. Both parameter names and type hints follow the CohQL specification and can be used for other query engine implementations.","Custom query engines can be enabled in the coherence-rest-config.xml file.
