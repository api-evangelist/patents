title: Solid-state curved focal plane arrays
abstract: The present invention relates to curved focal plane arrays. More specifically, the present invention relates to a system and method for making solid-state curved focal plane arrays from standard and high-purity devices that may be matched to a given optical system. There are two ways to make a curved focal plane arrays starting with the fully fabricated device. One way, is to thin the device and conform it to a curvature. A second way, is to back-illuminate a thick device without making a thinned membrane. The thick device is a special class of devices; for example devices fabricated with high purity silicon. One surface of the device (the non VLSI fabricated surface, also referred to as the back surface) can be polished to form a curved surface.

More specifically, the present invention relates to a system and method for making solid-state curved focal plane detector arrays that may be matched to a given optical system.","(2) Background","Conventional detector arrays are flat; therefore, a matching flat optical focal surface is required in designing optical systems. To meet this requirement, a high price is often paid in terms of size, weight, complexity, cost, and performance. The human eye provides a natural example of an imaging system whose detector (the retina at the back of the eye) is curved to correspond with its focal surface (the lens). The Schmidt camera (an ultra-fast telescope with a film plate holder instead of an eyepiece at its focus) is a classic example of a system which will benefit from a curved focal plane array (CFPA). Other examples of systems which could benefit from curved focal plane arrays include: wide-field rover cameras, star-tracker cameras, and far ultra-violet (UV) instruments.","Curved focal plane detector arrays simplify optical designs by reducing the number of optical elements by up to a factor of four, increasing reliability of the system, and increasing the margins of tolerance in optical design. Therefore, the production of lighter and more efficient optical systems for airborne or space-borne missions is possible. In addition, there are commercial applications in the areas of charged-particle detection systems and miniaturized cameras.","Curved focal plane detector arrays offer other advantages. While other aberrations depend on the stop and conjugate positions within an optical system, field curvature generally depends only on the basic constructional parameters of the system and the throughput. Thus, field curvature is very difficult to change, and can be regarded as intrinsic to an optical system. The designer has more degrees of freedom in controlling other aberrations than in controlling field curvature. Curved focal plane detector arrays offer a way out of this dilemma by permitting the designer to concentrate on the correction of other aberrations rather than having to abandon a certain design approach due to excessive field curvature. By such innovation, for example, an instrument having the capabilities of National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA's) Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) could be miniaturized from the size of an office desk to the size of a suitcase. One method of improving optical systems is using fiber-optic faceplates for matching a curved focal surface to a flat detector. Inherent limitations of this approach include: mismatch of fiber-optic faceplate and detector resolution; limited transmission wavelengths of fiber (e.g., opaqueness at UV wavelengths); and alignment complexities.","Many NASA missions rely on imaging and spectroscopy instruments. The NASA vision of smaller, lower cost, and more frequent missions mandates the miniaturization of instruments. For optical systems, the designer generally must introduce one or several additional optical elements to flatten the inherently curved focal surface. This complication and its corresponding penalty in mass, performance, and cost can be avoided if the detector itself is made to conform to the naturally-curved focal surface of a much simpler optical design.","In practice, micro-channel plates (MCPs) have been made in curved configurations, making the NASA's Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) and the Alice instrument in the European Space Agency's Rosetta mission possible. However, in addition to the difficulties and cost associated with fabrication of these especially-curved MCPs, these instruments come with the higher mass and power overhead of MCPs.","Both the FUSE and Rosetta missions benefit from curved detector technology. These missions are designed to perform detailed UV spectroscopy by collecting photons diffracted from curved gratings with detectors of matched curvature. For these missions MCPs with the needed curvature were provided. In FUSE, the MCP detectors are curved and positioned to match the Rowland circle of the gratings. The Alice instrument (an ultraviolet imaging spectrometer) in the Rosetta mission is similar in concept and smaller in size. The very light-weight Alice instrument, approximately 2.2 kilograms (kg), credits its reduced mass and cost to the innovations of this mechanical design, wherein the input surface of its MCP has been made curved to match the 150 millimeter (mm) diameter Rowland circle for optimum focus.","Development of simple and low-cost technologies for fabricating curved solid-state detector arrays, whose curvature can be matched to the requirements of a specific system enables significant advances. Re-tooling the very-large-scale-integration (VLSI) industry from today's flat planar substrates to new production in curved space is a major challenge. Fabrication of CFPAs on individually curved substrates using e-beam lithography followed by processing, while an effective option, is very costly.","One example of a flat focal plane arrays is a charge-coupled device (CCD). CCDs are the detectors of choice for many NASA applications because back-illuminated CCDs potentially have the highest quantum efficiency in the ultraviolet and visible parts of the spectrum. However, CCDs require removal of the silicon substrate, i.e., thinning, and a surface treatment of the backside of the CCD to allow detection of UV photons.","Back-illuminated standard CCDs must be thinned to a thickness of approximately 10 to 20 \u03bcm corresponding to the epitaxially grown silicon layer (referred to as the epilayer), a property of the original CCD design. A natural consequence of having such a thin structure laced with electronic circuitry is that it will wrinkle with a height variation of 30 to 50 micrometers (\u03bcm). This is undesirable for astronomy applications which require focal plane flatness within fractions of a micron. Furthermore, such a membrane is fragile and prone to fracture when subjected to repeated flexing, which is inevitable in the temperature cycling of operational instruments. To obtain a thinned, flat, focal plane array, a rigid support can be attached to the CCD prior to the thinning process or after the thinning process. Attachment of a support substrate to the CCD front-side prior to thinning has been implemented by a number of groups, e.g., \u201cBump Bonded Back Illuminated CCDs\u201d by M. P. Lesser, Ann Bauer, Lee Ulrickson, Proceedings of SPIE, vol. 1695, p. 508 (1992) and \u201cFlat, Thinned Scientific CCDs\u201d by Rusty Winzenread, Proceedings of SPIE, vol. 2198, p. 886 (1994) and \u201cThinned Charge Coupled Devices with Flat Focal Planes for UV Imaging,\u201d by Todd J.

Following this act, the oxide layer of the silicon surface (formed on the silicon surface as a result of the UV\/ozone clean) is removed by a 5:1 solution of hydorflouric acid in ethanol in a nitrogen glove box while the standard detector  is spinning at 3000 rpm. Then the standard detector  is loaded into a special fixture and is passed directly into the ultra-high vacuum chamber of the molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) system without any exposure to air.

In one embodiment, as shown in , an epitaxial layer  is grown on the surface  of a fully-processed, thinned standard detector  in the MBE system under ultra-high vacuum conditions (i.e. 10torr) using electron-beam evaporation of the elemental silicon and thermal evaporation of elemental boron.","As shown in , the process requires heating the standard detector  to 450 degrees Celsius for a period of a few minutes. A one nanometer p+ silicon layer  is grown first on one surface of the device , followed by an interruption of the silicon flux to deposit a sheet of 2\u00d710boron atoms\/cmapproximately 0.5 nanometers from the surface  of the device. A 1.5 nanometer capping layer of epitaxial silicon is then grown. After removal from the MBE system, approximately 1 nanometer of the silicon capping layer is converted to an oxide to protect the buried delta-doped layer. Since the delta-doped layer  can be placed within nanometers of the silicon surface , it allows the creation of an extremely thin surface electrode.

Forming a Curved Focal Plane Detector Array from a Thin Membrane","In the next act, the thinned membrane  is formed into a curved surface. One skilled in the art will appreciate that there are many different ways that this act could be performed. For example,  depicts several thinned membranes , , and being formed into curved surfaces having various radii of curvature. These thinned membranes , and are supported on their edges by membrane supports . Air pressure is utilized to create the various radii of curvature. In the embodiment depicted in , the membranes , and are illuminated on the surface of the membranes opposite the air pressure.","A 10-\u03bcm thick, 1,000\u00d71,000, 12 \u03bcm pixel CCD was tested while varying the radius of curvature (ROC) from 250-500 mm by applying air pressure as shown in . The results are plotted in . The line representing Air On  (representing when the thin membrane is curved) is right on top of the line representing air off  (representing when the thinned membrane is flat). Thus,  shows that the light sensitivity is independent of the curvature.","In another embodiment, shown in , the thinned membrane  is applied to a curved substrate . The technical hurdles to overcome when bonding a thinned membrane  to a curved substrate  are: 1) eliminating particulates that corrupt the ultimate smoothness of the surface, and 2) potential changes to the electrical properties of the thinned membrane  when it is strained by adapting the curvature of the curved substrate . Careful attention to cleaning and surface preparation may eliminate the particle problem. The effect of induced strain may be investigated by testing the same thinned membrane on a flat substrate and then again on progressively curved substrates. This will provide a limit as to how much strain may be applied before the device experiences operational problems.","In the embodiment shown in , the thinned membrane  is gently pushed (using air pressure) onto the curved substrate . In this embodiment, an optional balloon membrane  is placed between the air pressure and the thinned membrane . Air pressure is applied to the balloon membrane  to press the thinned membrane  into contact with the curved substrate  coated with a layer of bonding material , such as melted wax or epoxy.","In another embodiment, as shown in , the thinned membrane  is pulled (using vacuum) to attach with a curved substrate . In one embodiment, the curved substrate  comprises polished flitted disks. These frits are made of very fine quartz spheres fused together and polished to a very fine surface. Frits are available in various grades of porosity and can be polished to specific shape or curvature. The detector membrane  is pulled via air pressure into contact with the curved substrate  coated with a layer of bonding material , such as melted wax or epoxy.","One skilled in the art will appreciate that the above described process of forming the thinned membrane into a curved thinned membrane may be used to form either convex or concave shapes. Further, in the embodiment shown in , the membrane may be illuminated on either the frontside or the backside. Therefore, either a back-illuminated or front-illuminated thinned membrane focal plane detector array may be formed having either convex or concave radii of curvature.","Further, one skilled in the art will appreciate that the thinned membrane may be bonded to a piezoelectric transducer (PZT) wafer in the flat state. The PZT wafer can then be activated to provide a curvature which may be adjusted over a range according to the applied voltage to the PZT. Further, the thinned membrane may be bonded to a portion of a small volume that may be gently pressurized. In this case, the range of curvature may be achieved by adjusting the pressure.","The limitation on the radius of curvature with thinned membrane depends on curvature shape (e.g., cylindrical or spherical), material (1.0% maximum strain limit for silicon), as well as the size of the array.  shows results of calculation for mapping a square silicon membrane (respecting a 0.2% strain condition) onto a spherical surface. It is shown in the figure that larger arrays can be curved gently (large radius of curvature (ROC)) while small arrays can accommodate more severe curvatures (small ROC). In general, this applies to spherical curvature; cylindrical shapes can be more severely curved.","In one embodiment, a 10 \u03bcm thick, 1,000 K\u00d71,000 K, 12 \u03bcm pixel CCD is curved to an ROC\u02dc200 mm and permanently attached with a curved substrate with an ROC of 200 mm.","The techniques proposed above are not only applicable to silicon detector arrays but can be extended to curved focal plane arrays made from various material systems. For example, gallium nitride and its alloys are of particular interest because they are wide bandgap (3.4 eV to 6.2 eV), with intrinsic far UV response and strong visible rejection ratio (>10). The type III-nitrides possess direct bandgap, and tailored energy cutoff (varying alloy fractions). The III-nitrides are robust, radiation tolerant, and can operate at higher temperatures than silicon photodetector arrays. Further, they are piezoelectric. An approach for fabricating thinned membranes of nitrides has been developed, for which the reader is directed to the paper entitled \u201cFabrication of GaN suspended Microstructures,\u201d R. P. Strittmatter, R. A. Beach, T. C. McGill, Applied Physics Letters, 78, 3226 (2001).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0113","num":"0112"},"figref":"FIG. 11","b":["1100","1100","1104","1102","1100","1106","1102","1102"]},"A curved high-purity detector array comprises a high-purity detector array in which one side has been polished to form a curved surface. The Lawrence Berkeley National Lab (LBNL) (Berkeley, Calif.) is one source of two-dimensional high-purity devices, typically with thicknesses of 400-600 micrometers. To achieve a desired radius of curvature, the back surface  of the substrate layer is polished into a spherical or cylindrical surface. The method of polishing the back surface  of the substrate layer  is similar to that used to form telescopic lenses.","Next, a thin conductive electrode  is incorporated into the back surface  using previously-developed and described delta-doping technology. Finally, the detector array  is electrically tested for its depletion properties, after which it will be ready for optical testing. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the details regarding the delta-doping process are for p\u2212 doped substrates. Modification, for example, in the type of dopant used is required when the substrate is n-doped.","Unlike the curved thinned membrane discussed above, high purity devices do not require removal of the substrate for operation. As the substrate layer can be thick, the layer will not wrinkle under stress, and the thickness of the substrate also provides a longer lifespan than with the curved thinned membrane.","A further advantage of the high-purity detector array is the ability of the surface to be polished into a deep curvature; in some cases removing more than half of the substrate layer from the backside at the center of the detector array. This ability allows separation of the CFPA fabrication process from the very-large scale integration (VLSI) fabrication process, avoiding the difficult and expensive challenges of adapting VLSI processing to curved substrates.  further illustrates how a curved detector array can be depleted without any breakdown at the thinnest point of the detector.","High-purity detector arrays can be fully depleted across the entire thickness of the device using low voltages. In fully-depleted devices, carriers generated throughout the device, even near the back surface, are driven to the front surface for collection under the influence of an electric field. The result of this full depletion is excellent point spread function of the device and elimination of lateral diffusion which would otherwise degrade the image quality.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0119","num":"0118"},"figref":"FIG. 13","b":["1302","1304","1306","1308","1302","1310","1312","1306","1312"]},"The thickness of the surface electrodes still determines the cut-off wavelength of the detector. This is because the electrodes are relatively heavily doped and remain undepleted. There is no electric field to separate electron-hole pairs generated in the electrodes and, with overwhelming probability, the electrons and holes simply recombine without being measured. This is known as a dead layer, and is especially apparent in the blue and ultraviolet regions. Delta-doping effectively removes the dead layer and results in a highly stable, 100 percent internal QE for the detector in the visible, UV, far UV, and extreme UV. Furthermore, the delta-doped layer will also act as the surface electrode for depletion of the thick detectors.","Back-illuminated devices with appropriate back surface treatment provide the highest quantum efficiency in silicon detector arrays. Delta-doping is a technique developed to modify the bandstructure of back-illuminated silicon CCDs. The use of delta-doping increases the internal QE to 100 percent in the entire range from extreme UV, visible, to near IR. \u201cDelta-doping\u201d refers to a strongly-peaked doping profile of high magnitude and thin width, resembling the mathematical \u201cdelta function.\u201d  illustrates how delta-doped CCDs exhibit 100 percent internal QE from extreme UV to the visible."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The objects, features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following detailed descriptions of the preferred aspect of the invention in conjunction with reference to the following drawings, where:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIGS. 2","i":["a","g "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIGS. 4","i":["a","g "],"b":"4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":"502"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 9","i":"a "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 9","i":"b "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 14"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
