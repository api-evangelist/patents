abstract: Sensors and switches for detecting hydrogen include an electrically-insulating support; a first and second electrode; and a palladium structure alone or in combination with an organic insulating film. The palladium structures of the sensors are deposited on and contact a first electrode and a portion of the palladium structure extends to and contacts the second electrode to create a conductive path. The palladium structures of the switches are deposited on and contact a first electrode and a portion of the palladium structures extend to and contact an organic insulating film deposited on the second electrode. Upon exposure of the switch to hydrogen, portions of the palladium structure extend through the film and contact the second electrode to create a conductive path. Methods of detecting hydrogen and methods of fabricating a sensor for detecting an analyte of interest are also provided.

No. 61\/109,812, filed Oct. 30, 2008, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by this reference.","Subject matter described herein was made with U.S. Government support under Grant Number CHE-0518561 awarded by the National Science Foundation. The government has certain rights in the described subject matter.","The presently-disclosed subject matter relates to sensors and switches for detecting hydrogen, as well as methods of making and using the same. In particular, the presently-disclosed subject matter relates to sensors and switches for detecting hydrogen that make use of palladium structures alone or in combination with an organic insulating film. The presently-disclosed subject matter further describes methods of fabricating a sensor for detecting an analyte of interest whereby metal\/organic\/metal junctions are produced.","Hydrogen (H) is a useful energy source that has the potential to reduce the need for fossil fuels in the future, and may someday replace or serve as an important alternative to the current fossil-based transportation fuels [9-11]. Indeed, a great deal of effort has been put forth to develop H-fueled motor vehicles in order to fulfill increasing energy demands for transportation. Also, His present as a common reagent in industry and is used as an Oscavenger in metallurgy, in hydrocracking for refined fuels, and in degradation of synthetic materials. However, utilizing Hcan be dangerous, as Hhas one of the lowest flash points (\u2212253\u00b0 C.) of any energy source, making it highly explosive in air above 4% Hby volume [12]. Accordingly, one of the aims in fuel cell research is to safely store and release Hin a controlled manner. For these reasons, it is important to develop simple, reliable, low-cost sensors for the detection of Hover a range of concentrations.","Previously, arrays of palladium (Pd) mesowires have been synthesized by electrochemical deposition of Pd on the step-edges of highly-oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG), and the resistance change of these arrays in the presence of Hhas been examined after the arrays were transferred to a glass substrate and electrical contacts to the arrays were made [1,2]. In contrast to most Pd-based Hsensing devices, which exhibit an increase in resistance in the presence of Hdue to the formation of the more resistive PdH[3,4], the Pd mesowire arrays exhibited a significant decrease in resistance due to the formation of break junctions within the mesowires upon volume expansion of the PdH[1,2]. These devices quantitatively detected Hfrom 2 to 10% reversibly with 75 ms response times.","Hsensing has also been performed with films of Pd nanoparticles prepared by physical deposition or chemical methods [5,6]. However, these Pd nanoparticle-based sensors also contain nanoscale gaps and operate on similar principles as the mesowire array[1,2]. Other nanoscale materials used for Hsensing include carbon [7] and Pd nanotubes [8], which operate on different principles, but display low detection limits.","In any event, known methods and devices for detecting Hare only capable of detecting Hafter assembling various sensors in a complicated multi-step process involving synthesis, assembly, and contact formation, or are only capable of assembling sensors that are unable to be constructed in a highly parallel fashion or with a near 100% success rate. Furthermore, none of the known methods and devices for detecting Hhave sufficiently provided a sensor whereby metal electrodeposition is used to make direct contract between a deposited metal and one or more electrodes, which is of great importance in eliminating the need for multi-step processes involving synthesis, assembly, and contact formation.","This summary describes several embodiments of the presently-disclosed subject matter, and, in many cases, lists variations and permutations of these embodiments. This summary is merely exemplary of the numerous and varied embodiments. Mention of one or more representative features of a given embodiment is likewise exemplary. Such an embodiment can typically exist with or without the feature(s) mentioned; likewise, those features can be applied to other embodiments of the presently-disclosed subject matter, whether listed in this summary or not. To avoid excessive repetition, this summary does not list or suggest all possible combinations of such features.","The presently-disclosed subject matter includes sensors and switches for detecting hydrogen (H), as well as methods of making and using the same, that make use of palladium (Pd) structures alone or in combination with an organic insulating film.","In some embodiments, a sensor for detecting His provided that includes an electrically-insulating support; a first electrode and a second electrode that are positioned at a distance from one another and affixed to the support; and a Pd structure that is deposited on and contacts the first electrode such that at least a portion of the Pd structure extends to and contacts the second electrode, thus creating a conductive path between the first electrode and the second electrode. In some embodiments, the Pd structure that is deposited on the first electrode is electrochemically deposited on the first electrode.","In some embodiments, the sensors for detecting Hdisclosed herein are used in a method of detecting Hin a gas sample by: providing a sensor in accordance with the presently-disclosed subject matter; applying a voltage potential along the conductive path between the first electrode and the second electrode of the sensor; exposing the sensor to the gas sample; and then detecting any decreases in conductivity along the conductive path between the first electrode and the second electrode to thereby detect Hin the gas sample. In some embodiments of the methods for detecting Hdisclosed herein, an exemplary sensor for detecting His used to detect a concentration of Hin a gas sample of as low as 0.11%.","Further provided, in some embodiments of the presently-disclosed subject matter, are switches for detecting H. In some embodiments, a switch for detecting His provided that includes an electrically-insulating support; a first electrode and a second electrode that are positioned at a distance from one another and affixed to the support; an organic insulating film that is deposited on the second electrode; and a Pd structure that is deposited on and contacts the first electrode such that at least a portion of the Pd structure extends to and contacts the organic insulating film. In some embodiments, upon exposure of an exemplary switch to H, the portion of the Pd structure, which is in contact with the organic insulating film, extends through the organic insulating film and contacts the second electrode to create a conductive path between the first electrode and the second electrode.","In some embodiments, the Pd structure that is deposited on the first electrode of an exemplary switch is electrochemically deposited on the first electrode. Further, in some embodiments, the organic insulating film that is deposited on the second electrode is deposited on the second electrode by electropolymerization. In some embodiments, the organic insulating film of an exemplary switch is comprised of phenol, aniline, pyrole, or combinations thereof. For example, in some embodiments, electropolymerizing phenol on the second electrode of an exemplary switch creates an organic insulating film on the second electrode that is a polyphenol film.","Similar to the sensors for detecting Hdiscussed above, in some embodiments, the switches for detecting Hdisclosed herein can be used in a method of detecting Hin a gas sample. In some embodiments, a method of detecting Hin a sample includes providing a switch for detecting Hin accordance with the presently-disclosed subject matter; applying a voltage potential between the first electrode and the second electrode; exposing the switch to a gas sample; and then detecting a current between the first electrode and the second electrode to thereby detect Hin the gas sample. In some embodiments of the methods for detecting Hdisclosed herein, an exemplary switch for detecting hydrogen can be used to detect a concentration of Hin a gas sample of as low as 1.0%.","With regard to the electrodes of the exemplary sensors and switches for detecting Hdisclosed herein, in some embodiments, the electrodes can include multiple fingers that can be aligned parallel with one another such that the first and second electrode are in an interdigitated configuration. In some embodiments of the presently-disclosed sensors and switches for detecting H, the distance between the first electrode and the second electrode is about 5 micrometers.","Still further provided, in some embodiments of the presently-disclosed subject matter, are methods for fabricating a sensor that is capable of detecting an analyte of interest. In some embodiments, a method of fabricating a sensor for detecting an analyte of interest is provided that comprises positioning a first electrode and a second electrode at a distance from one another on an electrically-insulating support; electropolymerizing a compound capable of producing an organic insulating film on the second electrode attached to the support; and electrodepositing a metal on the first electrode attached to the support such that at least a portion of the metal extends to and contacts the organic insulating film.","In some embodiments of the methods for fabricating a sensor disclosed herein, the metal electrodeposited on the first electrode is selected from silver (Ag), Pd, or combinations thereof. Further, in some embodiments, the compound capable of producing the organic insulating film is selected from phenol, aniline, pyrole, or combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the compound is phenol, such that the organic insulating film that is deposited on the second electrode is a polyphenol film.","In some embodiments of the presently-disclosed methods for fabricating a sensor, a method for fabricating a sensor for detecting an analyte of interest is provided that further comprises the step of varying a thickness of the organic insulating film to change a response and a recovery time of the sensor. In some embodiments, varying the thickness of the organic insulating film is accomplished by varying a number of electropolymerization cycles.","Advantages of the presently-disclosed subject matter will become evident to those of ordinary skill in the art after a study of the description, Figures, and non-limiting Examples in this document.","The details of one or more embodiments of the presently-disclosed subject matter are set forth in this document. Modifications to embodiments described in this document, and other embodiments, will be evident to those of ordinary skill in the art after a study of the information provided in this document. The information provided in this document, and particularly the specific details of the described exemplary embodiments, is provided primarily for clearness of understanding and no unnecessary limitations are to be understood therefrom.","While the following terms are believed to be well understood by one of ordinary skill in the art, definitions are set forth to facilitate explanation of the presently-disclosed subject matter.","Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which the presently-disclosed subject matter belongs. Although any methods, devices, and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the presently-disclosed subject matter, representative methods, devices, and materials are now described.","Following long-standing patent law convention, the terms \u201ca,\u201d \u201can,\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d refer to \u201cone or more\u201d when used in this application, including the claims. Thus, for example, reference to \u201ca sensor\u201d includes a plurality of such sensors, and so forth.","Unless otherwise indicated, all numbers expressing quantities of ingredients, properties such as reaction conditions, and so forth used in the specification and claims are to be understood as being modified in all instances by the term \u201cabout.\u201d Accordingly, unless indicated to the contrary, the numerical parameters set forth in this specification and claims are approximations that can vary depending upon the desired properties sought to be obtained by the presently-disclosed subject matter.","As used herein, the term \u201cabout,\u201d when referring to a value or to an amount of mass, weight, time, volume, concentration or percentage is meant to encompass variations of in some embodiments \u00b120%, in some embodiments \u00b110%, in some embodiments \u00b15%, in some embodiments \u00b11%, in some embodiments \u00b10.5%, and in some embodiments \u00b10.1% from the specified amount, as such variations are appropriate to perform the disclosed methods.","The presently-disclosed subject matter provides sensors and switches for detecting hydrogen (H), as well as methods of making and using the same, whereby palladium (Pd) structures are utilized either alone or in combination with an organic insulating film.","It has been observed that by electrodepositing a metal (e.g., Pd) or by combining electrodeposition of a metal and electropolymerization of an organic compound capable of producing an organic insulating film (e.g., phenol) at micro-gap electrodes, metal-electrode or metal-organic-electrode junctions can be created that advantageously can be used to provide controlled responses to H, such that sensors and switches for detecting Hcan effectively be created that avoid the problems present in prior sensors and switches for detecting H. In particular, the sensors and switches for detecting Hdescribed herein include the benefits of: 1) forming a direct contact between metal structures and electrodes during synthesis, which eliminates the need for multi-step processes involving transfer, assembly, and contact formation that is common in electronic-based micro-\/nano-sensing devices, and which lead to long fabrication times and device failures; 2) providing a simple, fast, highly parallel process with a near 100% success rate; and, 3) providing an approach for fabricating sensors and switches that may be used in fabricating a wide range of metal\/organic\/metal junctions. As such, the presently-disclosed subject matter also provides a method for fabricating a sensor, which may be used to fabricate a variety sensing devices for various applications.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 1A","sub":["2 ","2 "],"b":["10","20","30","20","30","40","40"]},"The first electrode  and the second electrode  of an exemplary sensor  for detecting Hcan be comprised of any electrically-conductive material through which an electric current may enter and leave. Such electrodes are known to those of ordinary skill in the art and include, but are not limited to, silver, gold, platinum, chromium, titanium, palladium, copper, indium-tin-oxide, or conductive carbon electrodes. Further, as will also be recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art, various methods can be used to affix electrodes to a support such as evaporating, sputtering, or electrochemically depositing electrodes on an electrically-insulating support, as well as the utilization of conductive paints or photolithography procedures. For example, in some embodiments of the presently-disclosed subject matter, gold electrodes can be fabricated by photolithography and affixed to a silicon support by sputtering and depositing gold over a suitable adhesion layer such as a titanium adhesion layer.","As noted, an exemplary sensor  for detecting Hof the presently-disclosed subject matter is comprised of at least a first electrode  and a second electrode  that are positioned at a distance from one another. Typically, and as discussed further below with respect to the Pd structures  utilized in conjunction with the presently-disclosed subject matter, a criterion regarding the distance between the two electrodes ,  is that the Pd structures  deposited on the first electrode  are able to extend across the gap between the electrodes ,  and thus contact the second electrode  to create a conductive path between the first electrode  and the second electrode . The ability of a Pd structure to form a connection between two electrodes can occur at distances as long as tens to hundreds of micrometers depending on the length and amount of Pd materials used to make the connection. In some embodiments, however, to allow the Pd structures  to make a connection in a reasonable amount of time (e.g., a few minutes) and provide sufficient conductive path between the two electrodes , , a distance of less than 10 micrometers between the two electrodes ,  is used. In the schematic diagram shown in , the distance between the electrodes ,  is about 5 micrometers.","In some embodiments of the presently-disclosed sensors for detecting H, the electrodes ,  can include one or more fingers such that the first electrode  and the second electrode  can be arranged in an interdigitated configuration. For example, as shown in , in some embodiments, the first electrode  and the second electrode  are each comprised of about 5 to about 7 fingers that are aligned parallel to each other such that that the fingers interlock without touching one another and form an array. By arranging the first electrode  and the second electrode  in such a configuration, an exemplary sensor  for detecting Hcan be provided such that there is a greater likelihood of a conductive path being established between the first electrode  and the second electrode  subsequent to a deposition of Pd structures .","Regardless of the particular configuration of the electrodes on an exemplary sensor for detecting hydrogen, however, and referring again to , once the first electrode  and second electrode  have been positioned at a distance from one another and affixed to the electrically-insulating support , a Pd structure  is then deposited on and contacts the first electrode  with at least a portion of the Pd structure  extending to and contacting the second electrode , thus creating a conductive path between the first electrode  and the second electrode . In some embodiments, the Pd structures  utilized in accordance with the presently-disclosed subject matter can be Pd molecules that are deposited on a first electrode  by electrochemically depositing the Pd on the first electrode . For example, in some embodiments, Pd may be deposited on the first electrode  by electrochemical deposition, wherein an electric current is run through a Pd solution until a sufficient amount of charge passes through the solution. In this regard, Pd deposition can be performed by attaching a wire lead to the first electrode  and to a potentiostat, and then holding the potential at a specified voltage versus a reference electrode.","In such embodiments, the Pd molecules forming the Pd structures  can further form dendritic or flower-like structures (see, e.g., ) that, once deposited on a first electrode , may cross over to a second adjacent electrode  and form a conductive path between the two electrodes , . In these embodiments, the dendritic or flower-like Pd structures  are typically about 1-10 micrometers in length and about 0.5 to about 1.0 micrometer in width, such that, in some embodiments, the Pd structures  are essentially Pd nanostructures that extend from the first electrode  and contact a small area on the second electrode . Based on the conductivity of the exemplary sensors  for detecting Hdisclosed herein, as well as the conductivity of pure Pd (94,800 \u03a9cm), the estimated contact area of the Pd structures  on the second electrode  is about 83 nanometers by about 83 nanometers. As such, it is believed that the connection between the Pd structures  and the second electrode  is not through the larger micron dimensions of the Pd structures , but is instead through one of the smaller dendritic branches that are on the order of about 10 to about 100 nanometers or more. As shown in , scanning electron microscope (SEM) images show that Pd electrodeposits upward and outward on the first electrode , and preferentially at the edges of the first electrode , such that only a small percentage of these Pd structures  grow long enough to make a connection to the second electrode  in the pre-determined time period that is used for an exemplary deposition of Pd on a first electrode . As such, in some embodiments, the number of connections between the electrodes ,  can be between about 1 to about 25 connections per sensor  out of the approximately 100 to 1000 Pd structures  that grow into dendritic or flower-like Pd structures  on the first electrode . Furthermore, by providing a contact area on the second electrode  that is on the order of nanometers, it is thought that the sharper connection points provide more control over an exemplary sensor for detecting Hand also provide a more sensitive sensor that is capable of detecting lower concentrations of Hin a gas sample.","In some embodiments of the presently-disclosed subject matter, the sensors for detecting Hcan thus be used in a method of detecting Hin a gas sample by: providing a sensor in accordance with the presently-disclosed subject matter; applying a voltage potential along the conductive path between the first electrode and the second electrode of the sensor; exposing the sensor to a gas sample; and detecting a decrease in conductivity along the conductive path between the first electrode and the second electrode to thereby detect Hin the gas sample. In some embodiments of the methods for detecting Hin a gas sample, which make use of a sensor of the presently-disclosed subject matter, the His present in the gas sample at a concentration of as low as 0.11%.","It is appreciated that hydrogen spontaneously adsorbs to Pd as atomic hydrogen and diffuses into a Pd lattice to form the more resistive PdH. In this regard, the initial \u03b1-phase Pd becomes \u03b2-phase PdHthrough an \u03b1-\u03b2 phase transition and the Pd lattice spacing changes throughout these phase changes, depending on the hydrogen concentration in the surrounding atmosphere. These phase transitions and changes in lattice spacing lead to measurable changes in the optical properties, resistance, and mass of the Pd, and can thus be utilized as an effective means to detect hydrogen.","For example, in one exemplary implementation of a method for detecting Hin a gas sample using a sensor of the presently-disclosed subject matter, a voltage potential (e.g., \u22120.3 V) can be applied to an exemplary sensor such that current flows along the conductive path between the first electrode and the second electrode that is formed by the Pd structure. When this sensor is subsequently exposed to a certain concentration of H(e.g., a concentration above about 0.11%), the Pd structure of the sensor then transitions into the more resistive PdHand the conductivity along the conductive path between the first and second electrode decreases reversibly such that the decrease in conductivity can then measured by methods known to those of ordinary skill in the art to thereby detect Hin the gas sample.","With further regard to the detection of Hin a gas sample, an exemplary sensor of the presently-disclosed subject matter can be utilized to determine the presence or absence of Hin a sample, but may also be used to measure the amount of Hin a particular gas sample. As such, \u201cdetecting\u201d H, as used herein, can refer to a determination of whether His present or absent in a sample of interest as well as quantifying the amount of Hthat is present in a sample of interest. For example, to quantify the amount of hydrogen present in a sample, a calibration curve can be obtained by measuring the response of a sensor, or the analytical signal, to known Hconcentrations, i.e. standards. In these quantification methods, the analytical signal used for the detection of Hcan be calculated as the percent response as described by the following equation:\n\n% Response=()\/\u00d7100%\n\nwhere iis the initial sensor baseline current in the presence of 100% Nand iis the sensor current in the presence of a H\/Nmixture of a certain standard percent H. A negative value is equal to a decrease in the current upon exposure to Hand vice-versa. The calibration curve is then obtained by plotting Hconcentration (x-axis) versus the percent response (y-axis). From this curve, the concentration of Hin unknown samples can thus be determined.\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIG. 1B","FIG. 1A","FIG. 1A","FIG. 1B"],"b":["110","10","110","140","120","130","140","120","130","110","10","120","110","160","130","160","150","130","150","120","110","150","160","160","130"],"sub":["2 ","2 ","2"]},"In the exemplary implementation shown in , the organic insulating film  is a polyphenol film (i.e., a polymer comprised of monomer phenol molecules that are connected to one another through carbon-oxygen-carbon bonds). Of course, other compounds capable of producing an organic insulating film can also be used without departing from the spirit and scope of the subject matter disclosed herein. For example, in some embodiments, the organic insulating film can be comprised of phenol, aniline, pyrol, or combinations thereof.","As also shown in , in some embodiments, the organic insulating film  is deposited on the second electrode  of the exemplary switch  by an electropolymerization process in which a current is applied through a solution containing one or more monomers of an organic compound that is capable of forming an organic insulating film, such as those described above. For example, in some embodiments, the organic insulating film  can be deposited on the second electrode  of the exemplary switch  by electropolymerizing phenol on the second electrode  by cycling from 0.0 to 1.2V at 100 mV\/s in a 5 mM phenol solution in 0.1 M sulfuric acid (HSO). Of course, to the extent is may be desired, other methods can also be utilized to deposit the organic insulating film  on the second electrode  including methods whereby the films are chemically-assembled and\/or physically deposited onto the second electrode .","In some embodiments of the presently-disclosed subject matter, the switches for detecting Hcan be used in a method of detecting Hin a gas sample. In some embodiments, a method for detecting Hin a gas sample is provided that includes providing a switch in accordance with the presently-disclosed subject matter, applying a voltage potential between the first and second electrode; exposing the switch to a gas sample, and then detecting a current between the first electrode and the second electrode to thereby detect Hin the gas sample.","As noted, in the exemplary switch of the presently-disclosed subject matter, the organic insulating film can act as a resistive barrier that reduces or prevents electrical contact between the Pd structures and the second electrode. When the exemplary switch is exposed to a gas sample containing H, PdHforms and the Pd structures expand in volume allowing the Pd structures to expand through the polyphenol layer and make direct contact with the second electrode. The contact between the two electrodes thus causes an increase in current and forms a \u201cswitch,\u201d wherein current flows between the electrodes in the presence of a particular Hconcentration, but rapidly decreases such that when the Hconcentration drops below a threshold concentration negligible current flows between the two electrodes.","For example, in one exemplary implementation of a method of detecting Hthat makes use of an exemplary switch, a voltage potential (e.g., \u22120.3 V) can be applied to an exemplary switch such that current initially flows along through the first electrode and along the Pd structure, but ceases to flow, or only flows negligibly, once the current reaches the organic insulating film. When this switch is subsequently exposed to H, such as what may be present in a gas sample of interest, the Pd structure then transitions into PdHand expands in volume to extend through the organic insulating layer and contact the second electrode. Once contact is made with the second electrode, the current between the first electrode and the second electrode is then able to increase by 7-8 orders of magnitude such that the current between the electrodes can then be measured by methods known to those of ordinary skill in the art to thereby detect Hin the gas sample. In some embodiments, the methods of detecting Hin a gas sample utilizing a switch of the presently-disclosed subject matter can detect Hthat is present in gas sample at a concentration of as low as 1.0%.","Thus, the sensors, switches, and methods of detecting Hdescribed herein allow for electrodeposition of metals, such as Pd, to produce a sensor for controlled sensing behavior, or a combination of electrodeposition of metals and electropolymerization of one or more compounds capable of producing an organic insulating film, such as phenol, on electrodes in order to produce switches for controlled switching behavior. The sensors, switches, and methods of the presently-disclosed subject matter further allow the direct contact of a metal to the electrodes to be made by metal electrodeposition, thus eliminating the need for multistep processes involving synthesis, assembly, and contact formation which are common in electronic-based sensing devices, but also providing beneficial methods for controlling metal\/organic\/metal junctions in a fast parallel manner that can be used in other sensing or molecular electronics applications.","In this regard, the presently-disclosed subject matter further provides, in some embodiments, methods of fabricating a sensor for detecting an analyte of interest that can be used to fabricate useful sensors that, in some embodiments, can include metal electrode\/metal structure\/organic\/metal electrode junctions. In some embodiments, a method for fabricating a sensor for detecting an analyte of interest is provided that includes positioning a first electrode and a second electrode at a distance from one another on an electrically insulating support; electropolymerizing a compound capable of producing an organic insulating film on the second electrode attached to the support; and electrodepositing a metal on the first electrode attached to the support such that at least a portion of the metal extends to and contacts the organic insulating film.","As one exemplary implementation of a method for fabricating a sensor for detecting an analyte on interest, a sensor for detecting an analyte of interest can be provided where, similar to the exemplary switches for detecting Hdescribed herein above, the metal deposited on the first electrode can be Pd, and, in some embodiments, the organic insulating layer can be produced by a compound capable of producing an organic insulating film, such as phenol, aniline, pyrole, or combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the organic insulating film is a polyphenol film.","In some embodiments of the presently-disclosed methods for fabricating a sensor for detecting an analyte of interest, the thickness of the organic insulating film deposited on the second electrode is varied to change a response and recovery time of an exemplary sensor. In some embodiments, varying the thickness of the organic insulating film comprises varying the number of electropolymerization cycles, which, in some embodiments, can comprise about 4 to about 10 cycles.","For example, in one exemplary implementation of a method for fabricating a sensor for detecting an analyte of interest, where a Pd structure is deposited on the first electrode subsequent to the electropolymerization of phenol on the second electrode such that a portion of the Pd structure on the first electrode contacts the polyphenol film, it has been observed that as the number of phenol electropolymerization cycles increases, an increasingly thicker film of polyphenol is deposited on the second electrode and the response and recovery time, as well as the magnitude of response, decreases. Accordingly, for some applications where faster switching behavior is preferred, it may be desirable to use a thinner polyphenol layer, and vice versa.","Although the exemplary methods for fabricating a sensor for detecting an analyte of interest are described herein with reference to a method where the deposited metal is palladium and the organic insulating layer is comprised of organic compounds such as phenol, aniline, and\/or pyrole, as a further refinement, it is contemplated that the metal deposited on the second electrode can be selected from silver or combinations of silver and palladium and that the organic insulating layer can further be comprised of various other organic molecules. For example, in some embodiments, the deposited metal can comprise a silver nanowire where the silver nanowire itself can change its conductivity in the presence of various molecules (e.g., ammonia) or can be functionalized with further materials to make the silver nanowire respond to analytes that would not typically change the conductivity of silver. As another example, in some embodiments, the organic insulating film itself can change in conductivity by reacting to a particular analyte of interest, such that, upon exposure to the analyte of interest, conductivity is increased between the metal structure contacting the organic insulating film and a change in current can be detected to thereby detect an analyte of interest. In this regard, it is contemplated that polyethylene dioxythiophene: polystyrene sulphonate (PEDOT:PSS) materials can be used to create an organic insulating layer and then used in a sensor to detect nitric oxide, methanol, ethanol, acetone, ammonia, glucose, and\/or calcium ions; polyaniline (PANI) can be used to detect NO, pH, chloroform, methanol, and glucose; sulfonate-functionalized water-soluble conjugated polymers, which contain bipyridine units, can be used to detect transition metal ions; and material-based heterojunctions consisting of hexadecafluorinated nickel pthalocyanine and Nickel pthalocyanine (Au\/Ni(FPc)\/NiPc\/Al) can be used to detect Oand NH.","The above-described sensors, switches, and methods for detecting for H, as well as the methods for fabricating a sensor for detecting an analyte of interest, are important for both producing useful Hsensors and switches that exhibit controlled responses to H, but are also important for developing other sensing, nanoelectronic, and molecular electronics applications in which a metal\/organic\/metal junction may be desirable. Furthermore, by uniquely combining metal electrodeposition and organic compound electropolymerization at microgap electrodes, the methods and devices of the presently-disclosed subject matter provide a unique way of producing metal\/organic\/metal junctions. Thus, the devices and methods of the presently-disclosed subject matter provide convenient alternatives to current fabrication processes, with the added benefit that the presently-disclosed methods eliminate the need for multi-step processes involving transfer, assembly, and contact formation.","The presently-disclosed subject matter is further illustrated by the following specific but non-limiting examples.","Interdigitated gold array electrodes with 10 or 14 fingers separated by a 5 \u03bcm gap were fabricated in a clean room by photolithography on a Si\/Sisubstrate. Briefly, the photolithography procedure followed a positive resist procedure in which good adhesion of the photoresist was ensured by depositing hexamethyldisilazane (HDMS) onto the Si\/SiOsubstrate (\u201cwafer\u201d). A spin coater was then turned on and run at the following settings: a) 500 revolutions per minute (rpm) for 0.2 seconds (s); b) 4000 rpm for 10 s; and, (c) 0 rpm for 0.2 s. A positive resist \u201c1813\u201d solution was then deposited on the wafer and spun at the same settings. After coating the wafer with HDMS and 1813, the wafer was baked at 90\u00b0 C. for 1 min (\u201csoft bake\u201d). A mask and the wafer were placed in an AB-M aligner and exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light for 6.0 s using a contact vacuum. The wafer was then soaked in toluene for 1 min and dried with a nitrogen gun. The solvent was then baked out at 90\u00b0 C. for 15 s.

Titanium targets were used as adhesion layers and Au was then deposited. The Au-coated wafers were immersed in acetone, and ultrasonics and a cotton swab were used for the lift-off procedure. Finally, the wafers are coated with 1813 and dicing was performed to separate the individual devices for further use.","Wire leads were attached to Au contact pads on the devices with Ag epoxy (cured 8-12 h, 80\u00b0 C.), followed by further insulation with an overlayer of Torr seal epoxy (cured 8-12 h, 80\u00b0 C.).

current-time plot for the Hswitch in  is different compared to that of the Hsensor. Instead of exhibiting a decrease in current, the current dramatically increased by 7-8 orders of magnitude above 1.0% H(see  for responses of exemplary Hswitches to 1.0% H). For example, at 3.1% the current increased from 1.0\u00d710A to 1.1\u00d710A. The dramatic increase in current can be due to a connection being made between the electrodeposited Pd and the second electrode (see, e.g., ) as PdHforms and expands in volume and through the approximately 4 to 10 nm thick polyphenol layer, such as the 5.9 nm thick polyphenol layer shown in , leading to direct contact with the second electrode (see, e.g., ).","The mechanism depicted in  is supported by three observances. First, a threshold detection is observed at about 1.0% Hz, which is where the Pd transition from \u03b1-phase to \u03b2-phase occurs. Below this threshold, the volume expansion of PdHis not sufficient to form a direct connection to second electrode. Second, the current of an exemplary Hswitch above 1.0% His on the same order of magnitude as the current (10to 10A) of the directed connected Pd in an exemplary Hsensor (see, , and Tables 4 and 5), which indicates that direct contact is made in the Hswitches. Third, current-voltage curves of the Hswitch in the presence of Hexhibit symmetric, linear curves as does the directly connected Pd depicted in , making it unlikely that Schottky barriers lead to the

However, in those devices fabricated with 4 or 5 cycles of phenol, the response and recovery times were generally shorter than Hswitches fabricated using 10 electrochemical cycles to deposit the polyphenol layer (see, Tables 6 and 7), which was attributed to faster penetration of PdHx through a thinner, more porous polyphenol film.
