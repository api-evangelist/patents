Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a method, system, and program for generating a progress indicator.","2. Description of the Related Art","In network storage systems where multiple host systems access a common storage system on a network, such as a Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID) array, users may query the storage system to determine status information. Notwithstanding that users can access information on the status of the storage system, there is a continual need in the art for improved user interfaces that present information on the status of storage systems in a format that is both ergonomical and accessible to the user.","Provided is a method, system, and program for generating a status page to display on a computer display. A request for status information on a resource is received. A determination is made of an operation being performed with respect to the resource. Data is generated to display a progress bar indicating a percent of the operation that has completed. A first part of the progress bar indicates a percent of the operation that has completed and a second part of the progress bar indicates a percent of the operation that has not completed. A determination is made of an attribute of the operation. Data is then generated to display information with one of the first part or second part of the progress bar indicating the determined attribute of the operation.","In further implementations, the determined attribute is capable of having one of multiple values. The data to display the information indicating the determined attribute further indicates the determined attribute value, wherein different information is displayed for each attribute value.","Still further, displaying the first or second part with information comprises displaying the first or second part of the bar in a manner that conveys the information indicating the determined attribute value of the operation. In certain implementations, the information is conveyed by displaying the first or second part of the bar in a color that is associated with the determined attribute value of the operation, wherein there are different colors associated with different attribute values.","In further implementations, the resource comprises a storage device and the operation comprises a formatting operation performed with respect to the storage device.","Yet further, the storage device may includes multiple interfaces, wherein each interface is capable of engaging one storage unit. Data is generated to display information on the status of each interface with the displayed progress bar. The information is capable of indicating that each interface is empty or includes an available storage unit, wherein the formatting operation is performed with respect to the available storage units engaged with the interfaces.","The described implementations provide an improved technique for displaying status of an operation performed with respect to a resource by displaying additional attribute information on the operation with the progress bar indicating a percent of the operation that has completed.","In the following description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and which illustrate several embodiments of the present invention. It is understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural and operational changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00017","num":"00017"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["2","4","6","2","8","4","16","4","6"]},"The host system  may comprise any computer device known in the art capable of communicating over a network  and rung a web browser program , such as a personal computer, workstation, mainframe, server, telephony device, hand held computer, etc. A display monitor  is attached to the host  and capable of displaying output from the browser program .","In one implementation, the storage system  comprises a RAID storage system including multiple slots on a backplane for interfacing with hard disk drives as known hi the RAID array art. The slots may comprise an Integrated Drive Electronics (IDE) interface, Small Computer System Interface (SCSI), or any other interface known in the art. FIG. I shows one slot , of the array having no attached storage device. The storage system  further includes a RAID  manager including the software and code to manage the hard disk drives , as a RAID array and perform other RAID management operations known in the art. The RAID manager  further includes application programming interfaces (APIs) that are capable of causing the RAID manager  to determine the status of the hard disk drives , including the status of any rebuilding operations, failures, recovery, etc., in a manner known in the art. The RAID manager  would return information to the calling program after executing the APIs.","A status page generator  comprises a program that is capable of calling RAID manager  APIs to determine the status of physical and logical storage devices in the disks and then adding such information to the web page templates . The generated web pages including current status information are returned to the requesting host  through the HTTP server . The status page generator  may comprise a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) program, a Java Servlet, or any other application program capable of calling API methods to access data to add to a web page template ","In alternative implementations, the web pages may comprise programs, such as script programs or Java Applets, that execute on the host . In such implementations, the program executing on the host  may submit the API methods to the storage system  to access the status information from the RAID manager  directly. In implementations where the program executes on the host, the program may execute within the web browser  to display data within the display region of the web browser  in a manner known in the art.","In the described implementations, the RAID manager  would include RAID algorithms to rebuild the RAID storage space or logical drive in response to a reconfiguration of the logical array, such as adding or removing storage space, or in response to a failure. If there is a failure of one or more of the hard disk drives , then the RAID manager  may rebuild the logical storage space using the data and parity information on the surviving disks . In the event of a failure, a new disk may be used in the rebuilding operation. The new disk may comprise a hot spare already engaged with a port , for a new disk substituted for the failed disk. The RAID manager  is further capable of implementing APIs to access information on the current status of physical and logical disk drives in a manner known in the art.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00023","num":"00023"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["30","12","8","20","18","32","14","32","34","14","34","1","34","2","34","16","34","36","36","14","16"],"i":["a, b, c, d, e","a, b, c, d, e, f ","a, b, c, d, e, f","a ","b ","c, d, e, f ","c, d, e","a, b, c, d, e, f ","a, b, c, d, e, f ","a, b, c, d, e, f ","a, b, c, d, e, f ","b, c, d, e, f "]},"The status page  further includes a \u201cLogical Disk\u201d section  providing status information on an operation performed with respect to the disks in an array. The logical disk section  displays a progress indicator , having a moving portion  that moves across a bar  as the operation monitored by the progress indicator  progresses towards completion. The percentage of the job completed would approximate the percentage length the moving portion  extends across the bar . The percent the job remains uncompleted is represented as an uncompleted portion  color displayed to the right of the moving portion  in a different color. The uncompleted portion  would extend a percentage length across the bar that is equivalent to the percentage of the job uncompleted. When the operation completes, the entire bar  will be displayed as the color of the moving portion . In one implementation, the moving portion  may be displayed in one color, indicating a percentage of the array that is rebuilt, and the uncompleted portion  may be displayed in one of multiple other colors. The different colors used to display the uncompleted portion  may convey the reason for the operation being invoked, where different colors may be used to convey different reasons for invoking the operation being monitored by the progress indicator .","For instance, in implementations where the progress indicator  monitors the status of an operation rebuilding a disk array, one color used to display the uncompleted portion  may indicate that the rebuilding operation is being performed to provide a different configuration of the storage space assigned to the logical array, such as adding or removing storage space from the logical array. Another color for the uncompleted portion  may indicate that the rebuilding operation is performed to rebuild the array after a failure of one of the disks ","The logical disk section  further provides textual information on the operation, such as rebuilding, the array, and array size. If the entire logical array is available to users, then the entire bar  would be displayed in a color indicating full availability.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00027","num":"00027"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["20","22","16","100","20","22","4","20","102","18","14","20","18","22","14","36","36"],"i":["a, b . . . n ","a, b, c, d, e, f ","a, b . . . n ","a, b, c, d, e, f ","a, b . . . n ","a, b, d, e, f","a, b, c, d, e, f","a, b, c, d, e, f "]},"The status page generator  then calls (at block ) the RAID manager  with an API to determine the current status of one or more logical disks, e.g., logical arrays or volumes, implemented in the disk drives . If (at block ) the logical disk is involved in a rebuild operation, then the status page generator  calls (at block ) the RAID manager  with an API to determine the amount of disk space rebuilt as a percentage of the total disk space in the logical array. The status page generator  then generates (at block ) data into the page to display the moving portion  extending across a percentage of the bar  equivalent to the percentage of the disk space that has been rebuilt. The status page generator  further calls the RAID manager  with an API to determine whether the rebuild operation was initiated to reconfigure (add or remove) storage space to the logical disk or as part of a failure recovery operation. Data is added to the page to display the moving portion  of the status indicator in the color associated with the cause of the rebuild operation, e.g., one color may be used to indicate rebuilding is performed to modify or reconfigure the amount of space assigned to the logical disk and another color may be used to indicate rebuilding is performed in response to a failure recovery operation. Still further, additional colors may be used to provide further state information. For instance, one color may be used to indicate that the rebuild operation is being performed to add space to the array and another color used to indicate that the rebuild operation is removing space from the array.","If (at block ) the logical disk is not involved in a rebuilding operation, then the status page generator  adds (at block ) data to the page to display the moving portion  in a color indicating that the entire logical array is available for Input\/Output (I\/O) operations. A refresh tag is added (at block ) to the generated page to cause the host browser  to automatically periodically access the status page to obtain more current status and progress indicator  data. The HTTP server  then transmits (at block ) the generated status page to the host web browser  for rendering and display at the host display .","The described implementations provide a technique for displaying information on the status of a storage device, such as a RAID array, that integrates different types of information into the display to allow the user to not only view the operation that is occurring, but to also concurrently view information with the progress indicating reasons for the operation and a state that will exist after the operation completes. For instance, in the described storage array implementation, the progress indicator  provides information that allows the user to determine the state of the storage system  after the operation completes. If the uncompleted portion  is displayed in a color that indicates that the rebuild is performed to reconfigure the logical disk, then the user will know that at the end of the rebuild the logical disk will have a new configuration, e.g., more or less storage space. On the other hand, if the uncompleted portion  is displayed in a color associated with failure recovery operations, then the user will know that an error occurred and that after the rebuild operation completes, the system will have recovered from some failure. Other colors may also be used to indicate additional causes or further detail on the rebuild or other operation being tracked by the progress indicator  that indicates the state that will exist at the storage system  after the rebuild completes. For instance, one color may indicate that the rebuild is being performed to add storage space to the logical disk, and another color may be used to indicate that storage space is being removed.","With the described implementations, the moving portion  is displayed in a color indicating the state of the system that will exist upon the completion of the operation whose progress is represented by the moving portion . In the storage system implementations, the color used to display the moving portion  may indicate that the storage space will be available when the operation completes. The uncompleted portion  is displayed in the color that indicates the reason that triggered the operation, indicating the current state of the uncompleted portion of the array and also conveying information on the state after the rebuild, i.e., a logical disk that has been reconfigured or recovered from a failure.","The preferred embodiments may be implemented as a method, apparatus or article of manufacture using standard programming and\/or engineering techniques to produce software, firmware, hardware, or any combination thereof. The term \u201carticle of manufacture\u201d as used herein refers to code or logic implemented in hardware logic (e.g., an integrated circuit chip, Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), etc.) or a computer readable medium (e.g., magnetic storage medium (e.g., hard disk drives, floppy disks, tape, etc.), optical storage (CD-ROMs, optical disks, etc.), volatile and non-volatile memory devices (e.g., EEPROMs, ROMs, PROMs, RAMs, DRAMs, SRAMs, firmware, programmable logic, etc.). Code in the computer readable medium is accessed and executed by a processor. The code in which preferred embodiments are implemented may further be accessible through a transmission media or from a file server over a network. In such cases, the article of manufacture in which the code is implemented may comprise a transmission media, such as a network transmission line, wireless transmission media, signals propagating through space, radio waves, infrared signals, etc. Of course, those skilled in the art will recognize that many modifications may be made to this configuration without departing from the scope of the present invention, and that the article of manufacture may comprise any information bearing medium known in the art.","In the described implementations, the progress indicator  displays the percentage of a rebuild operation that has completed. The progress indicator  may be used to indicate the percent completed with respect to any other process, where the uncompleted part of the bar  would indicate the current state of the monitored system. The operation represented by the moving portion  may have been invoked in response to the state represented by the color of the uncompleted portion  of the bar .","In the described implementations, the storage system  comprised a RAID array of multiple hard disk drives. In alternative implementations, the storage system may comprise other types of storage systems, such as a Direct Access Storage Device (DASD), Just a Bunch of Disks (JBOD), a tape library having backplane interfaces for multiple tape cartridges, optical disk library, etc.","In the described implementations, the operation monitored by the progress indicator  is a rebuild operation. Additionally, the monitored operation may comprise any formatting operation performed with respect to the storage device(s) in the storage system.","The progress indicator implementation described herein may apply to monitor systems other than storage systems, such as printing systems, application programs, database systems, file systems, and other Input\/Output (I\/O) devices.","The display of  monitored the status of an operation being performed with respect to a single device, i.e., the storage system . Additionally, the progress indicator implementation described herein may monitor the progress of one or more operations on multiple systems.","In the described implementations, the colors of the moving portion  and uncompleted portion  were displayed in a color indicating a state of the storage areas represented by the bar . For instance, the color of the moving portion  indicates that the state of the percent of the storage space rebuilt is available and the color of the uncompleted portion  indicates that the state of the storage space is unavailable due to failure or a reconfiguration of the space. Additionally, the color in which the progress indicator is displayed may indicate any other attribute of the resource associated with the moving or uncompleted portion of the bar. Thus, the area of the bar  occupied by the moving  and uncompleted  portions indicate the resources, or percentage of resources, associated with the bar and the color in which the bar is displayed represents a state or attribute associated with the resource on which the operation is performed.","In the described implementations, the state of the resource associated with the bar portions  and  was represented by displaying the bar portions  and  in different color schemes. Alternatively, different techniques may be used to convey the state or attributes associated with the portions  and , including textual information displayed with the portions  and , different shapes or designs used for the different portions  and , etc.","The logic of  is for illustrative purposes. Additional or alternative steps may be performed in addition to those illustrated in the logic. Further, the order of he steps in the preferred logic may also vary.","The foregoing description of the described implementations of the invention has been presented for the purposes of illustration and description.
