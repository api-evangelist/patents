title: Guided thrust maneuvered shipboard crane
abstract: A floating object is attached to a shipboard hoisting crane through its attachment device under high seawave conditions, by maintaining alignment of the crane attachment device under maneuvering thrust control with a location on the floating object during lowering of the attachment device onto the floating object. Such maneuvering thrust control is established by thrust jets emitted from the attachment device under control of optical scanning detection cells mounted on the attachment device for reception of a reception location indicating beam emitted from the floating object.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.","The present invention relates to establishing and maintaining alignment between a shipboard crane and a floating object under rough seawater conditions for crane retrieval of such floating object from the seawater.","Objects or vehicles floating on seawater, such as small boats, are currently retrieved onto ships by use of a shipboard crane through which a hook or attachment device is lowered into engagement with the floating object under crane operator control. However under rough seawater conditions, such seawater retrieval of the floating object by use of the crane is very difficult and often unsuccessful because of ship motions and the relative motions between the floating object and the ship crane hook under high sea wave and wind conditions. Under such rough seawater conditions, current practice sometimes involves use of personnel to maneuver the floating object such as a small boat in an effort to compensate for its motions relative to the shipboard crane and\/or to manually seize the crane suspended hook and attach it to the small boat to be retrieved. Where the floating object to be retrieved is unmanned, such as a floating buoy or robotic vehicle, it is extremely difficult and time consuming to engage the crane hook with the floating object under high sea states.","It is therefore an important object of the present invention to provide conventional shipboard cranes with facilities which avoid the difficulties and problem heretofore experienced therewith in retrieving unmanned floating objects alongside of a retrieval ship under rough sea conditions.","In accordance with the present invention, a commercially available type of shipboard crane is utilized to position and lower an attachment hook device onto an unmanned object floating on a body of seawater alongside of a retrieval ship for example on which the crane is mounted. Pursuant to the present invention, such attachment hook device suspended by a cable from the crane at a location above the seawater is equipped with pressurized fluid reaction jet thrusters to maneuver it relative to the crane suspension cable so as to maintain it in alignment with the floating object while being lowered into engagement therewith. The thrusters are automatically controlled for such purpose by an optical homing system, involving an array of photoelectric cells through which to track an optical beacon, flashing at a specific frequency from a beacon emitter on the floating object, to thereby provide location indicating signals to be received by the photoelectric cells for control of the thrusters.","According to certain embodiments of the present invention, the crane suspended attachment device will have a spike-shaped projection to be received within a funnel-shaped, self-aligning attachment device on the floating object to maintain latched attachment after insertion of the crane suspended spike projection. The floating object may then be lifted out of the water and deposited on-board the retrieval ship in the same manner associated with conventional shipboard cranes performing such function. As a result of the foregoing referred to features of the present invention, the crane operator may quickly attach and retrieve floating objects under high sea state conditions.","Referring now to the drawing in detail,  illustrates a shipboard crane  of a conventional type generally known in the art, with which the present invention is associated. Such crane  is shown mounted on the deck of a marine vessel  adjacent to its stern end . A load pick-up and delivery end section  of the crane  is shown overlying an object such as a small, unmanned boat  afloat on the seawater  adjacent the stern end  of the vessel . Such end section  of the crane  is lowered and lifted, under selectively powered control, relative to the boat  for load pick-up and delivery as generally known in the art. However pursuant to the present invention, an attachment device  is suspended from the crane end section , above the seawater  for reception within a receptacle formation  on the boat  above the seawater .","As shown in , the crane attachment device  includes a support  suspended from the crane end section  by a hoisting cable . Positioned on top of the support  in 90\u00b0 angular relation to each other are four (4) thrust control valves  to which fluid jet emitting cones  are respectively attached as shown in FIG. . Pressurized fluid such as water or air supplied to the control valves  is discharged as thrust producing jets  from the cones  as shown in FIG. . Such thrust producing jets  will accordingly impart motion to the attachment device  in different directions while it is being lowered by the crane  toward the receptacle  on the boat  for establishing and maintaining alignment between the attachment device  and the receptacle . The pressurized fluid for generating the thrust is supplied to the thrust control valves  through flexible tubing  as shown in .","Projecting centrally from the underside of the support  of the attachment device  as shown in ,  and , is an attachment spike  having engagement latches  projecting laterally therefrom. The spike  will accordingly be received within a reception funnel  formed in the boat receptacle , as shown in , so as to effect attachment therewith when lowered by the crane  into engagement.","Also mounted within the support  of the attachment device  for exposure on its underside as shown in ,  and , are four (4) photoelectric optical detection cells  for tracking beacons  emitted from the receptacle  by beacon emitters  to scan movement of the boat . The receptacle location indicating beacon  from the emitter  when scanned by the cells  will accordingly produce maneuvering signals that are applied to the thruster control valves  as diagrammatically shown in FIG. . The thrust homing control system associated with the attachment device , accordingly includes an electrical power supply  for operationally energizing the scanning cells  through which selected ones of the control valves  are opened and closed to feed pressurized fluid from a pressurized fluid supply  for directionally controlled discharge of the jet  from the maneuvering thruster cones  in order to impart positioning alignment motion to the attachment device .","As a result of the foregoing described thruster guidance, the operator of the shipboard crane  may quickly maneuver the crane end section  for its attachment through the device  to the receptacle  on the boat  floating alongside the ship  under high sea states. The attachment device  is reeled up by the crane  causing the boat  to be pulled up against the end section  of the crane  so as to stabilize the boat  while being brought aboard the vessel . Toward that end, the crane end section attachment device  is provided with the scanning cells  on its support  to track movement of the floating object  and thereby selectively control powering of the thrusters  to synchronize motion of the attachment crane end section  and attachment device  with the seawater imposed motion of the floating object .","Pursuant to the present invention, the directional thrust effected by discharge  from the cones  may be produced by pressured fluids other than those from pressurized air or water supplies, such as propane and rocket thrusters. Also, multiple directed fans or propellers may be utilized as the thrusters. Furthermore, the attachment configuration involving the locations of the spike  and the funnel  respectively on the attachment crane end section  and the boat mounted receptacle  may be reversed.","Obviously, other modifications and variations of the present invention may be possible in light of the foregoing teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING","p":["A more complete appreciation of the invention and many of its attendant advantages will be readily appreciated as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in connection with the accompanying drawing wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":["FIGS. 3 and 4","FIG. 2"],"b":["3","3","4","4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 2"],"b":["5","5"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 5"],"b":["6","6"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIGS. 1-6"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
