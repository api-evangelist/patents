title: Text-based information transmission
abstract: The navigation overhead and/or the content managing/updating overhead is reduced by providing link objects with condition data being associated with the link items of the link objects so that, depending on a check as to whether the condition data is fulfilled or not, an automatic handling of a link object may be performed. For example, the automatic handling may have an automatic appointing an object ID referred to by a link item of the link object that has condition data associated therewith which is fulfilled, as a newly-selected object ID.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This application is a continuation of copending International Application No. PCT\/EP2010\/054728, filed Apr. 9, 2010, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, and additionally claims priority from European Application No. EP 09005331.5, filed Apr. 14, 2009, all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.","The present application relates to text-based information transmission such as, for example, data-carousel text-based information broadcasting an example for which is the XML-based low-profile information service Journaline\u00ae.","Data carousel text-based information broadcasting being representative of a text-based information transmission, enables text-based information to be distributed to a huge amount of users with keeping the technical overhead reasonably low. For example, no uplink or feedback signals from the receivers to the broadcast transmitter is needed. In order to enable the users to individually navigate through the information content provided by the broadcast signal according to their personal preferences, the whole information is divided-up into objects referring to other objects, thereby enabling interactively navigating to the resulting linked arrangement of objects. To be more precise, menu objects enable the user to select, among menu items, in order to proceed from one object to the other.","Although it would be possible to provide each object with a parent object ID in order to enable the user to move from this object to its parent object by pressing, for example, a respective return button, the provision of such a parent link is not provided in any data carousel broadcast system or is not even worthwhile due to fact that more than one menu object may forward-link to an object so that a preset parent object ID pointer would not allow for an intuitive return action. In the NewsService Journaline, the objects are arranged in a hierarchal tree structure with links leading from the route object to any other object extend via link items of objects such as the menu items of menu objects or the interactivity features links of objects, the link item pointing to another such as, for example, hierarchically subordinate, object.","Taking the above properties of data carousel text-based information broadcasting systems into account, it becomes clear that the navigation through the respective tree structure of text-based information objects may be cumbersome for the users, or that an updating of the information content broadcasted by the broadcast signal may be limited. For example, in order to render the information broadcasted available for users of different languages, the text-based information tree structure may be provided in the form of a forest of disjoint rooted trees, with each receiver being configured to start the navigation through the respective rooted tree structure or being configurable to start navigation at a selectable one of these rooted tree structures. New languages may be accommodated by new trees with new tree roots. However, the necessity of configuring the receiver is sometimes unwanted due to the related overhead in providing the user with the ability of configuring the receiver. In auto radios, for example, the number of input switches may be highly restricted so that a configuration of the radio to a new root object ID associated with a newly supported service language would be too cumbersome. Another possibility is to configure all receivers to start navigation at a common root menu object, with this root menu object providing the user with the ability of selecting a language so that each language would correspond to a respective sub-tree of the whole tree and adding a new language would merely necessitate adding a menu item to the root menu object pointing to the new tree of objects concerning the newly supported language. However, even this possibility would necessitate the user having to select the language first in order to navigate through the actual information in his\/her language.","Another problem stemming from the above-mentioned properties of data carousel text-based information broadcasting, which the broadcaster faces, is the broadcaster's necessity of continuously updating the text information objects in order to keep the information contained therein up-to-date. Some information presented in the data carousel is of temporary validity only. In other words, this information should be broadcasted merely for a limited time duration with assigning the object ID to another information content upon expiration of the respective time duration. Even other information, however, is relevant for a longer time in a periodic manner. For example, some object IDs could be reserved for presenting information on birthdays of famous persons to the user and the names of persons for a specific date would get relevant on a year-by-year basis with the information broadcaster having to update the content associated with that object ID each day.","Further, data carousel text-based information broadcasting signals are not restricted to textual information alone. For example, some objects may contain additional data, which is to be disregarded by low-profile receivers, with this additional data being dedicated for high-level receivers capable of handling this additional information such as data pertaining special symbols, graphics, location information or the like. In some cases, it would be a waste of time for a user having a low-level receiver to visit a certain object due to their main content relying on this additional data rather than pure text data. This, in turn, increases the navigation overhead for the user.","According to an embodiment, a receiver for a text-based information signal carrying text-based information content being divided onto information objects, wherein the receiver is a broadcast receiver and the text-based information signal is a data carousel text-based information broadcast signal in which the information objects are broadcasted in a data carousel manner, wherein the receiver may have a user-operable selector; and a processor configured to analyze an information object having a selected object ID among a plurality of unique object IDs, by determining as to whether the information object analyzed is an automatic-handling supporting link object having link items pointing to other object IDs among the plurality of unique object IDs;

For example, the automatic handling may comprise an automatic appointment of an object ID referred to by a link item of the link object that has condition data associated therewith which is fulfilled, as a newly-selected object ID. In this case, the displaying of the link object to the user may even be suppressed. Therefore, the user is not concerned with selecting among link items of link objects, the selection among which would have been clear beforehand. Alternatively, the automatic handling may comprise rendering a presentation to be presented\u2014such as, for example, visually and\/or auditory\u2014to the user, representing the link items of the link object in a way depending on the aforementioned check of the condition data with appointing, then, an object ID referred to by a link item of the link object that is\u2014for example, manually\u2014selected by the user via a user-operable selector, as the newly-selected object ID. According to the dependency on the check result, the link items having condition data associated therewith which is fulfilled, could, for example, be arranged at the beginning of the menu so as to ease the selection of these menu items by the user via the user-operable selector relative to the other ones. The opposite could be true as well. According to another embodiment or for other link objects, the dependency on the check result could be implemented such that the link items having condition data associated therewith which is fulfilled, could, for example, be highlighted with respected to the other link items to be more recognizable by the user, with leaving the order among the link items unchanged. Again, the opposite could be true as well so that these link items would be represented less recognizable. According to even another embodiment or for even other link objects, the dependency on the check result could be implemented such that the link items having condition data associated therewith which is not fulfilled, could, for example, be left away. The menu would, thus, be shortened. Even in this case, the opposite could be true as well so that these link items having condition data associated therewith which is fulfilled, would be deleted from the menu.","The condition data associated with the link items of a link object, could belong to various selection criteria. For example, the condition data could necessitate a comparison with one or more of a language setting of the broadcast receiver, a current date, current time, a current week day, a current position of the receiver, an audio or video channel which the receiver is currently attuned to, the receiver's display capability, the receiver's ability to determine the current position of the receiver, the receiver's ability to perform a navigation, the receiver's ability to access external data networks and the receiver's telecommunication capability. An condition type indication within the automatically-handling supporting link object could be used to identify which of these possible selection criteria the condition data within the link object the condition data refers to.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, the mechanism for automatic-link handling of link objects is applied to Journaline\u00ae receivers in way so that Journaline\u00ae receivers, which do not support the automatic-link handling feature, will display a standard Journaline\u00ae link object to the user for link selection when receiving a automatic handling supporting object. In order to enable older Journaline\u00ae receivers to still handle menu objects supporting automatic handling, the new automatic-handling supporting menu objects still use existing object type IDs in the object header section. The automatic-handling pertaining information is also not introduced into the link objects by use of new JML codes. Rather, the automatic-handling mechanism is built into existing object syntax via escape sequences comprising an escape symbol followed by a length indication specifying the length of the following data section, which is to be disregarded by receivers not being capable of understanding the automatic-handling mechanism.","It is noted that the embodiments outlined below exemplarily relate to data carousel text-based information broadcasting. However, the present invention is neither restricted to carousel based data transmission nor broadcasting. Rather, differing from the below outlined embodiments, the present invention may also be applied to data transmissions where the data objects are transferred on demand. Similarly, differing from the below outlined embodiments, the present invention may also be applied to address-based data transmissions directed to specified addressees which may or may not ordered the transmission by demand, and the below-outlined embodiments may, thus, also be transferred to these applications. The following embodiments, however, will be outlined with respect to a specific possibility, namely, carousel-based broadcasting in order to ease the understanding of the principles of the present invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","12","14","12","10","16","18","16","20","10","20"]},"Further, the broadcast transmission system  comprises a broadcast transmitter . The broadcast transmitter  is configured to broadcast the objects  stored in memory  in the form of a data carousel. That is, the broadcast transmitter  transmits text information objects  of each object ID repeatedly at a repetition rate associated with the respective object ID.","The receivers  receive the data carousel text-based information broadcast signal  and enable a user thereof to navigate through the textual information content of said signal by selecting menu items of menu objects among the information objects .","For example, the receivers  may be radios dedicated for receiving a digital audio broadcast signal into which the data carousel text-based information broadcast signal  is embedded. Alternatively, the receivers may be a televisor or some other multi-media device and the signal  may generally a part of a multi-media, audio, video and\/or data broadcast signal. For illustrative purposes only, in the following description merely the audio alternative is described. However, whenever the audio option is mentioned, the other possibilities are possible alternatives although not specifically mentioned.","As it will be outlined in more detail below, the receivers  may comprise a presentation device such as a graphic or text display, a printer or, additionally or alternatively, a loud speaker for presenting to the user, a presentation representing the textual content of the objects  or at least an output for outputting the presentation to a respective presentation device. Accordingly, the broadcast transmission system  may be part of a digital audio\/video\/data broadcast system. However, the present invention is not restricted to this example of wireless transmission. Rather, any non-directional transmission of signal  to receivers  could be used.","As already outlined above and as will be described in more detail below with respect to , the textual information contained in signal  is divided-up into objects  which, in turn, may be organized in a hierarchic tree structure by means of link objects among objects . In particular, each object  may be of a specific object type. Among the object types, link objects and non-link objects may be distinguished. Link objects comprise link items pointing to other objects and being selectable by users by interacting with the receiver. Link objects may, for example, menu objects or text objects having hot buttons pointing to other objects. For sake of simplicity, in the following description, the link objects are assumed to be menu objects. However, the following embodiments are readably transferable to other object types although not explicitly mentioned.","Menu objects may, for example, result in a menu presented to the user, the menu comprising menu items among which the user may choose, and which refer or point to other objects with another object ID.","Non-link objects which will be referred to as message objects in the following, do not comprise any reference or pointer to any other object ID, but may merely be pointed to by one or more of the menu (or link) objects by use of its unique object ID.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["26","26","26","26","26","26","14","26"],"i":["a ","b","b ","b","b "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["28","28","28","28","28","30","28","32","28","32","28"],"i":["a","b ","c","c ","c ","c "]},"The title section comprises textual information describing the title. Similarly, each menu item section comprises a menu label , i.e. textual information, describing the respective menu item.","Further, although not explicitly mentioned above, message objects  and menu objects  may comprise an object-type identifier enabling distinguishing therebetween to enable identifying a menu object as menu objects and a message object as message objects. Further, besides the object types illustrated in , other object types may be available as well.","The way  exemplify message and menu objects is of illustrative nature only. The data sections shown therein may be sequentially arranged within the object in the order from top to bottom as shown in these Figs., or may be arranged in any other way within the respective object. Moreover, some data sections may be optional such as, for example, the title section or may even be not provided. Further, the data sections to and and may be of a fixed predetermined size or may be of varying size with respective sectioning symbols indicating the boarders between the sections such as, for example, at the beginning of each subsequent section, respectively. Similarly, the pointer , the condition data  and\/or the menu label  do not necessarily have to be included within a respective common even contiguous menu item section to which they belong or which they form. Rather, it is sufficient if the association between pointers , condition data  and menu label  together forming a menu item is derivable at the receiver's side. Further, the difference between menu\/link objects and non-link\/message objects may vanish and the object type indication may thus be obsolete with, then, the difference between these objects merely being the absence or existence of link items wherein the link items may, as outlined above, menu items forming an ordered list of menu options or hot buttons placed anywhere in the presentation of the respective object. Thus,  may also be interpreted as showing an example for a more generic link object by replacing \u201cmenu\u201d by \u201clink\u201d and replacing \u201ctitle\u201d with \u201ctext-based information\u201d. Again, in the following, reference is made to menu objects for illustrative purposes only, and this following description may easily be transferred to any type of link object in the same way, i.e. be replacing the term \u201cmenu\u201d by \u201clink\u201d. Finally, it is noted that in the following description the term \u201cmenu item\u201d is sometimes also used to denote the respective \u201cmenu label\u201d describing the same.","As already noted above, the information content contained in objects  is hierarchically organized by means of the menu objects . To illustrate this, reference is made to .  shows menu objects and message objects arranged in an illustrated tree structure as defined by the pointers of the menu items of the menu objects. In particular, menu objects are illustrated by rectangles  having rounded corners and being marked with \u201cM\u201d and message objects are illustrated by rectangles having right-angled corners and being marked with \u201cT\u201d. As already denoted above, each object  is assigned a unique object ID. In other words, the objects  shown in  each have a unique object ID associated therewith, which is different from the object ID of any other object  shown in , with each of these objects  being repeatedly transmitted via signal  (). Again, the repeated transmission may be left away in other non data-carousel applications and the transmission may even be performed on demand such as via the internet. However, in the following, the specific embodiments are, for illustrative purposes only, described with respect to a data-carousel transmission.","As shown in , one of the menu objects  is associated with a specific object ID, which is, in the case of , exemplarily the object ID x. This object  forms a root of the tree structure  into which the objects  are structured by the pointers . The specific object ID of the root object  may be known to the receivers  and may be initially presented to the user by the receivers upon turning on the receiver. The root object  forms a first hierarchy level of the hierarchical tree structure . The pointers  of the menu items of the root object  point to objects  having different object IDs and forming the second hierarchy level as illustrated by arrows starting from root object  and extending to the objects  of the second hierarchy level. The menu objects of the second hierarchy level, in turn, have menu items with pointers pointing to objects having a respective different object ID.","The \u201chierarchy level\u201d of an object  may be defined as the shortest possible path from the root object  to the respective object. Although the range of hierarchy levels may be unrestricted, according to an embodiment, the number of hierarchy levels may be restricted to some maximum value, such as 20 hierarchy levels. Similarly, the number of menu or link items per menu object  may be unlimited or may be restricted to some maximum value. In the case of , the number of hierarchy levels is exemplarily shown to be restricted to 20 and the number of link or menu items per menu object  is exemplarily shown to be restricted to a maximum of 32.","As is shown in , an object  may be referred to or pointed to by respective menu items of more than one menu object. Further, the pointer of the menu item of a certain menu object  is not restricted to point to an object of the subsequent hierarchy level. Rather, the menu object of a certain hierarchy level may have a menu item pointing to an object having a different object ID within a lower hierarchy level as it is illustrated by dotted lines in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1"],"b":["14","14","40","12","42","44","46","48","50"]},"The antenna  is for receiving signal  and may be replaced by a contact-based receiver input in case of a wired transmission of signal . In particular, the receiver  illustrated in  may be an audio receiver or radio with a processor  being configured to extract an audio channel from an audio broadcast signal received via antenna  and output same to speaker  in order to be presented to the user, wherein the processor  may be responsive to the user operating the user-operable selector  or some other input to change the channel to be extracted from the audio broadcast signal and output to speaker . However, receiver  may, alternatively, be a receiver especially dedicated for extracting the textual information from signal , in which case the loudspeaker  may not be comprised by receiver . Further, the antenna may be external to the receiver. For example, the antenna may be an antenna integrated into the windscreen, rear screen or side windows of a car into which the receiver may be built in.","As will be described in more detail below, the processor  is configured to assist the user in navigating through the tree  (see ) of objects. In particular, processor  is configured to monitor the broadcast signal  or cached parts thereof, to detect an object  having a selected object ID associated therewith and to render a presentation screen representing the content of this information object, provided same is actually to be displayed to the user as will be described below. The processor  outputs the presentation screen to display . If the object currently displayed is a menu object, the user is prompted to select one of the menu items of the menu object. In particular, the user is able to select one of the menu items by use of the user-operable selector .","The selector  may be a toggle switch such as, for example, a four-toggle switch, or a rotating knob or may comprise a touch screen capability, or a combination thereof. Even a speech recognition input capability enabling speech control would be feasible. Depending on the input alternatives supported, the processor may be configured to highlight an actually selectable menu item which is selected upon the user affirming its selection by, for example, pressing some switch or the like.","The processor  is configured to, upon a selection of a certain menu item by the user, appoint the object ID referred to by this menu item as a newly-selected object ID, whereupon processor  monitors the broadcast signal  or a cached part thereof stored in a cache, again in order to detect an object  having this object ID associated therewith, and so on. Processor  may use the memory  in order to keep track of the recently visited object IDs in their visiting order. In other words, processor  may store a path history in memory , the path history comprising a list of traversed object IDs when navigating from the root object  to any other object . The path history stored in memory  may be restricted to a certain number of object IDs, with this number being, for example, equal to the maximum number of hierarchy levels or greater than the latter. Processor  may use the path history in order to obtain the object ID of the menu objects from where the user reached the currently-displayed object upon the user requesting returning to this previous menu by use of, for example, the user-operable selector  or some other input means of receiver  indicating the user's whish to return to the parent menu. The processor  may be configured to shorten the history path in case a newly selected object ID is already present in the path history list stored in memory . Further, the processor  may be configured to remove the oldest or any other object IDs from the path history list upon the number of different object IDs in the path history exceeding the maximum number.","The display may be text or graphic display such as a TFT, LCD or OLED display, for example. Similarly to the antenna, same may be external to receiver. For example, display  may be the display of a car into which the receiver may be built in and which is, for example, also used to display other information such as navigation or video information from other sources.","Before an embodiment of the functionality of receiver is described in more detail below, it is noted that the receiver of  is merely a specific embodiment and that several changes may be made with, nevertheless, achieving the same or similar advantages. For example, although the receiver of  was shown to comprise a display  as a device for presenting the textual content of the information objects to the users, other presentation devices are possible as well such as the loud speaker  in which case the processor would by configured to, in rendering the presentation to be presented to the user, convert textual content of the objects such as the link\/menu labels, into speech, or a printer (not shown) in which case the processor would involve a printer driver in rendering the presentation to be presented to the user. Further, the receiver could be a computer. Even further, in case of the text-based information signal not being a data-carousel broadcast signal, the receiver could be configured to order or pull the object having the currently selected object ID from the transmission site instead of monitoring a data-carousel signal to intercept the object having the selected object ID. However, the following description illustratively concentrates on a data-carousel signal application.","Referring to , the mode of operation of receiver  is described in accordance with an embodiment. When entering the information service represented by the broadcast signal , such as when switching on receiver , the selected or current object ID is initialized in step . For example, the selected object ID may be initialized to the object ID of the root object  () as has already been described above. Thereupon, processor  extracts  a next object  within data carousel broadcast signal  having the selected object ID associated therewith. In addition, prior to the extraction , processor may try to fetch a cached version of an object having the selected object ID from an internal object cache in, for example, memory . If available, processor may use the cached version and may proceed with analyzing the object as described below. Again, in a non data-carousel system, step  may comprise processor  actively requesting an object having the selected ID from a server.","In analyzing this object, processor  determines as to whether the object obtained in step  is a menu object in step . If this is not the case, processor  presents the object content on the display  in step . The user may need some time to read the text contained within the current object having a current\/selected object ID and during this time, processor  cycles though a waiting loop . In particular, processor  checks as to whether the user requests to return to the previous menu object from the aforementioned path history by monitoring, for example, the user-operable selector  or some other input means of the receiver  in step . During that time that this is not the case, processor  monitors the broadcast signal  to determine as to whether the broadcast signal transmits another object with the current\/selected object ID and, if so, as to whether this more-recently transmitted object has been revised relative to the currently-displayed object, wherein processor  may perform this determination based on a revision index comprised by any message object, although not shown in . Optionally, processor  may actualize the presentation screen displayed on display  in step  if a more actual object has been found. Again, in a non data-carousel system, step  could comprise processor  actively and intermittently checking at a server as to whether a newer version object having the selected ID is available and, if yes, updating the presentation screen.","Further, as soon as the user requests returning to the previous main object, processor  appoints the most-recently visited object ID of the path history in memory  as the newly-selected object ID in step , whereupon the operation proceeds with step .","If processor  determines in step  that the object having associated therewith the selected object ID is a menu object, the operation proceeds with a menu object handling  which is described in more detail with respect to .","When handling menu objects, processor  firstly determines in step  as to whether the receiver  itself supports automatic handling or as to whether the automatic handling feature of the receiver is activated by the user. If not, processor  ignores the condition data  (see ) of the menu items and handles the menu object normally. Thus, if the current menu object is an object supporting automatic handling, processor  ignores eventual condition data and handles the menu object normally in step . If, according to the different object types, normal menu objects which do not comprise the condition data  shown in , co-exit with automatic-handling menu objects, processor  handles both types identically in step . That is, processor  cycles through a loop, which is similar to that shown in  in steps  and  with, however, the processor  being responsive to not only the user instructing to return to the previous menu, but also to the user's instruction by use of the user-operable selector  to change to an object having an object ID associated with one of the menu items of the current normal menu object. In other words, in step , processor  displays the menu on display  and if the user selects one of the menu items, processor  changes the current object ID to the object ID to which the pointer  of the selected menu item (see ) refers. Until this time or until the user requesting to return to the previous menu, processor  may actualize the menu if the menu object with a currently displayed object ID and having a different revision index occurs in the broadcast signal.","Again, in a non data-carousel system, processor  could actively and intermittently check at a server as to whether a newer version object having the selected ID is available and, if yes, updating the presentation screen. In performing the determination , processor  checks, for example, a state within memory , which is user-settable according to the user's preferences. If, for example, the user does not wish processor  to automatically handle automatic-handling supporting menu objects, steps  and  will cause these menu objects to be handled like normal menu objects. It is noted, however, that steps  and  could be left out if the receiver  steadily supports automatic handling of automatic-handling supporting menu objects.","However, if the automatic-handling is supported, processor  determines in step  as to whether the current menu object is an object supporting automatic handling. If not, processor  handles the normal menu object as described above with respect to step . It should be noted, however, that it is also possible that the afore-mentioned co-existence of normal menu and automatic-handling supporting menu objects does not exist but that merely the latter ones exist. In this case, steps  and  may be left out.","However, if automatic-handling is supported or active and the current object supports automatic handling, then processor  determines in step  as to whether the selection type associated with the automatic-handling supporting menu object is known to receiver  or not. As will be described in more detail below, it is possible that the broadcast signal  allows the condition data  within an automatic-handling supporting menu object  (see ) to pertain one of a plurality of different types of conditions. That is, the broadcast signal  may comprise automatic-handling supporting menu objects  where the condition type differs from object to object. Further, the condition data within one automatic-handling selection menu object  could optionally be restricted to be directed to one condition type only. Examples for selection\/condition types comprise language, date, time, week day, a geographic region, an audio or video channel which the receiver may be attuned to, a display capability, a hardware capability to determine the current position of the receiver, a hardware capability to perform a navigation, a hardware capability to access external data networks and\/or a hardware capability to allow the user to telecommunicate.","If processor  or receiver  does not know or is not able to handle the selection type of the current menu object, processor  checks the menu items to determine as to whether any of these menu items is to be selected by default in case the condition data is not fulfilled or the condition\/selection type is unknown, or as to whether any of the menu items has associated therewith a default flag being enabled. This check is performed in step . Step  is optional. That is, such default indication capability does not have to be provided within the broadcast signal . If none of the menu items is indicated to be selected by default, processor  handles the current automatic-handling supporting menu object in step  as it was the case in steps  and . That is, the condition data is ignored and the menu object is handled normally.","Then, processor  checks the menu items to determine as to whether more than one of these menu items is to be selected by default and as to whether any of the menu items has associated therewith a default flag being enabled, respectively. If not, i.e. if exactly one of the menu items is indicated to be selected by default, processor  automatically selects in step , the respective link\/menu item and appoints the object ID pointed to by the pointer of said menu item as the newly-selected object ID with the processing then proceeding with step  in . Alternatively, the indication of the menu item by default, merely results in processor  highlighting said link item in the menu when displaying the menu on display , arranging same at the first position or shortening the menu to maintain merely the default menu item in step  with then awaiting the user's input as already outlined above with respect to step . In the latter case, the automatic handling most likely facilitates the selection to be performed manually by the user due to the fact that the default menu item is highlighted within the menu displayed. According to the automatic selection alternative, the user may not even bothered with the menu. That is, processor  may suppress the displaying of the menu to the user so that the navigation of the user through the object tree is likely to be facilitated.","If more than one of the menu items is to be selected by default and has associated therewith a default flag being enabled, respectively, the processor  presents the menu to the user with, however, highlighting said link items in the menu when presenting the menu to the user, arranging same at the first positions o the menu or shortening the menu to maintain merely the default menu items in step .","If the selection type is known, processor  determines in step  as to whether any or at least one menu item exists the condition data of which is fulfilled. If the determination  reveals that there is no menu item with its condition data being fulfilled, the process proceeds at step  where the default indication is checked. However, if there is at least one menu item with its condition data being fulfilled, processor  then determines in step  as to whether there is more than one link\/menu item with its condition data being fulfilled. If this is the case, the processor  displays the menu on display  with, however, highlighting the link\/menu items having its condition data being fulfilled in step , arranging same at the first positions of the menu or shortening the menu to maintain merely the link\/menu items having its condition data being fulfilled. The opposite may also be true, i.e. processor  may displays the menu on display  with, however, rendering the link\/menu items having its condition data being fulfilled less visible, arranging the same at the last positions of the menu or shortening the menu by removing the link\/menu items having its condition data being fulfilled. The selection among these options may be fixed or may depend on the selection type.","If, however, there is merely one link\/menu item, the condition data of which is fulfilled, the process proceeds with step . That is, processor  automatically selects the matching link\/menu item and appoints the object ID pointed to by the pointer of said menu item as the newly-selected object ID with the processing then proceeding with step  in . Alternatively, processor  highlights said link item in the menu when displaying the menu on display , arranges same at the first position or shortens the menu to maintain merely the default menu item in step  with then awaiting the user's input as already outlined above with respect to step . Again, the opposite may also be true, i.e. processor  may displays the menu on display  with, however, rendering the matching link\/menu item having its condition data being fulfilled less visible, arranging the same at the last position of the menu or shortening the menu by removing the matching link\/menu item having its condition data being fulfilled.","The actual processing performed by processor  and determining as to whether condition data is fulfilled or not (steps  and ) depends on the kind of condition data. For example, if the condition data indicates a certain date or a certain time or some weekday, or the like, processor  compares the respective condition data with information on the current date, current time or current weekday with the processor  obtaining the latter information from, for example, an internal clock. If the condition type is the language, processor  compares the condition data, for example, with an internal language setting. For example, this language setting may be fixed from the manufacturer of receiver . Alternatively, the language selection may be user-settable so that the user may change the advantageous language of the textual information he or she is presented with. In case of the condition type indicating the hardware capability of receiver , processor  may, for example, compare the condition data with a version number of receiver  reflecting, for example, how old the receiver is and to what extent the receiver is able to process certain parts of the objects reachable via the respective link item. In other words, processor may compare the condition data with one or more of a language setting of the broadcast receiver, a current date, current time, a current week day, a current position of the receiver, an audio or video channel which the receiver is currently attuned to, the receiver's display capability, the receiver's ability to determine the current position of the receiver, the receiver's ability to perform a navigation, the receiver's ability to access external data networks and the receiver's telecommunication capability.","It should be noted that the presentation of the menu items the condition data if which is fulfilled, may even depend on the condition type itself. For example, while the menu items the condition data if which is fulfilled may be rendered more recognizable for the user when the condition pertains the language, the menu items the condition data if which is fulfilled may even be hidden or rendered less recognizable for the user when the condition pertains a receivers minimum hardware capability in order to prevent the user from, or render more difficult the user selecting menu items pointing to objects the content of which is not useful for the receiver in an sufficient way.","In any case, the automatic-handling performed in steps  and  eases the user's navigation through the information service contained within broadcast signal . For example, the highlighting of links having its condition data being fulfilled or being indicated to be selected by default, renders the selection of the respective menu items easier for the user. By this way, it is possible to ease the selection of menu items for the user, which are more likely to be advantageous for the user than the other menu items. For example, the user may set its language according to his preference so that respective menu items pertaining this language will be highlighted within the menu relative to the other menu items. The object manager (see ), in turn, may provide menu items which, according to their semantic content, are merely interesting during certain dates or daytimes with condition data indicating these dates or daytimes so that during these times, the user's attention is drawn to these menu items.","As indicated above, the highlighting may ease the user's selection of the respective menu items relative to the other menu items. It is even possible to suppress the displaying of menu items having condition data not being fulfilled. Further, highlighting the menu items having its condition data being fulfilled or being indicated to be selected by default may be highlighted by indicating the other menu items in a less-visible sense.","The automatic selection in step , in turn, especially eases the navigation of the user through the object tree. The user does not have to select any of the menu items. Moreover, the selection, which is automatically performed, most likely complies with the preferences of the user due to the above-mentioned setting of the condition data by the broadcast signal's editor or by the user's setting respective settings of its receiver.","After having described embodiments of the present invention with no particular preference to any specific news service, the following description describes an embodiment of automatic-object handling in case of the existing NewsService Journaline\u00ae. In other words, the following description describes supplementing the NewsService Journaline\u00ae with menu objects supporting automatic handling as described above with the supplementing feature being realized such that older receives, which were not built to handle automatic-handling supporting menu objects, are still able to handle these new objects like normal menu objects (compare step ). It is noted, however, that the below outlined embodiment is also transferable to other link objects of the NewsService Journaline\u00ae, such as objects having hot buttons or interactivity features pointing to other object IDs, or future other object types may be extended to support automatic handling as outlined below.","A mechanism for automatic-link selection from a menu by Journaline\u00ae receivers based on language or other preferences is described in the following. Journaline\u00ae receivers, which do not support the automatic-link selection feature, will display a standard Journaline\u00ae menu object to the user for menu selection instead. If a receiver cannot make a choice by itself, because, for example, there is no language set, then the broadcaster can decide whether he wants a default selection or if the user should manually select a link.","In order to enable older Journaline\u00ae receivers to still handle menu objects supporting automatic handling, the new automatic-handling supporting menu objects still use the same object type ID in the object header section than normal menu objects, i.e. object-type ID . The automatic-handling pertaining information is also not introduced into the menu objects by use of any of the JML codes or syntax elements used for dividing-up the JML object's content sections serially into logical blocks of information, such as title, menu item, and so on (compare ). New JML codes would not be interpretable by older receivers. Rather, the automatic-handling mechanism is signaled via the data sections of escape sequences defined in the Standard (ETSI TS 102979 V1.1.1). The escape symbol used in Journaline\u00ae is xA followed by one byte specifying the length of the following data section. The whole data section is to be disregarded by receivers not being capable of understanding the automatic-handling mechanism. Obviously, maximally 256 bytes may be contained within the escape sequence data section. To extend this size, a special escape symbol, namely xB may be used to provide a further data section for accommodating a immediately following part of the automatic handling data such as condition data. The latter symbol is also followed by a byte indicating the length of the data extending section. All data sections of a run of escape sequences\u2014comprising merely one or more escape symbols xB\u2014are then concatenated in order to yield an automatic handling unit such as a condition data or selection marker, or a selection type indication.","The content of each data section starts with a data section (DS) type indication of 8 bits. In order to signal the automatic-handling mechanism, two new Journaline\u00ae data section types are introduced, namely DS \u201cselection object\u201d and DS \u201cselection marker\u201d. The automatic handling is, according to the present embodiment, applied to Journaline\u00ae menu objects although, as indicated above, other possibilities would be available as well. At most, one selection criterion or selection type per menu object may be allowed. Broadcasters may decide to base content selection on several different selection types by cascading menu objects with different selection types in their respective object data section.","The DS selection objects may be signaled by DS type code xC succeeding a respective length indication which, in turn, follows an escape symbol. The DS selection object may be restricted to occur maximally once before the first visual text character within the respective menu object. Moreover, as already indicated above, the DS type symbol xC may be restricted or may be available only for menu objects.","As described in more detail below, the DS type symbol xC signals to the receiver that the current JML menu object supports automatically handling such as automatically selecting one of its link items. Such a menu object is called selection object in the following. The condition for the automatic handling including automatic selection is provided with the selection marker DS (xC ) described in more detail below.","The selection marker could be signaled by use of DS type symbol xC . Again, this symbol would succeed a respective length indication which, in turn, follows an escape symbol. Of course, selection markers are only available for selection objects. Its position within the data sequence of the selection object could be restricted to the position between the pointer or link target of a respective menu item and the first visual text character of said menu item (compare ). The selection marker defines the selection condition(s) for a link item within the selection object. Zero, one or more selection markers shall be defined per link item. The condition for the link item is fulfilled if the condition in at least one of its selection markers is fulfilled. Moreover, the condition of link items having no selection marker may be interpreted as being fulfilled. Alternatively, the condition of link items for which no selection marker is provided may be interpreted as generally not being fulfilled. In the following, the first alternative is assumed to be true. However, it is noted that the fiction regarding the conditions of menu items without selection markers being fulfilled or not, may even depend on the selection type\/criterion contained in the DS selection object.","Both DS type symbols are followed by respective codes describing, for example, the selection\/condition type and the menu item selection condition itself and a default flag, respectively. As far as the selection marker is concerned, it might be that a restriction is posed onto these markers according to which merely one selection marker per selection object may have the default flag enabled. However, as was described above, it is also possible to allow more than one default flag to be enabled.","In order to ease the understanding of the above-outlined DS type symbols and the following description thereof, reference will be made to , which shows a JML selection object. As already outlined above, a JML object comprises a header section  followed by a content section . The header section comprises the object ID (see in ) and the object type symbol which is, as denoted above, for a selection object equal to the object ID of a menu object, i.e. . The content section  is serially divided-up or structured into a sequence of logical blocks. In case of menu objects, this is a title block and one or more link items . The JML codes indicating the beginning of a respective block and are 8 bit codes from x to xF inclusively. In , x signals the beginning of the title block and x indicates the beginning of a link\/menu item . As indicated at the end of the fragment of the object illustrated in , more than one menu item may be concatenated. The receivers may be supposed to or may be configured to adopt the order the menu items are arranged within the menu object when displaying the menu to the user (in the absence of any automatic-handling actions as described with respect to steps  and ).","As is shown in , both blocks and comprise a respective text character portion. In , this portion is indicated by \u201ctitle\u201d in case of the title block and \u201cmenu option \u201d in case of menu item . Additionally, each menu item JML code x is immediately followed by two bytes representing the pointer ( in ), i.e. the object ID to be visited upon selection of the respective menu item by the user. In , the object ID of the target JML object of the menu item exemplarily is xAABB.","However, as the menu object shown in  is a selection object, additional data sections concerning the automatic handling are inserted into the menu object by use of the aforementioned escape sequences xA, namely data sections  and . As already described above, the data sections are embedded in to the object by means of escape symbols, namely an escape symbol xA followed by a length indication of 1 byte, namely x in case of data section  and x in case of data section . Within each data section, the aforementioned DS type symbols xC and xC occur at the beginning with additional data following which is described in more detail below.","The data section \u201cselection object\u201d  has the following structure and content. The presence of a data section  with DS type value xC within a menu object indicates that this menu object supports automatic handling including automatic selection of one of its link items if supported by the receiver. It also defines the selection type, i.e. whether this automatic selection is based on language or any other condition type as already indicated above.","Exactly one selection criterion may be applied to one menu object. The DS data section \u201cselection object\u201d has the following format succeeding its indication symbol 0xC0. In particular, a selection type indicator of 8 bits follows symbol xC. In the exemplarily case of , this is x. In particular, the selection type indicator  of 8 bits defines the type of the selection object and the selection criterion, respectively. For example, the selection type x may describe the selection criterion \u201clanguage\u201d. That is, the menu item of the current menu object is available in multiple languages and the receiver may chose menu items of an advantageous language.","Of course, other values may be used for other selection type definitions.","The data section \u201cselection marker\u201d , namely its structure and content, is described in the following. The data section DS type value xC defines a selection condition for a link item . It permits the selection of link based on a condition value . Receivers that support the automatic handling mechanism are expected to match each condition  of each link item against actual conditions, such as time and date or an own stored data set, such as a language setting and receiver version number, respectively, as described above and as will be exemplified below with respect to language. As also described above, in case of a match, the automatic handling mechanism may cause the selected link item to be selected or handled automatically without presenting the menu object to the user. Optionally, additional bytes may be comprised by the DS selection marker depending on the condition or depending on the condition type.","The DS type \u201cselection marker\u201d  may be restricted to a portion within a link item of a selection object located between the link target definition  and the first visual text character for the link item (see menu option  in ). The selection object carries 0, 1 or multiple selection conditions  per link item.","The DS data section \u201cselection marker\u201d may have the following format. A default flag  of one bit is used for signaling the default selection described with respect to  regarding steps  and . Several bytes or n\u00d78 bits are used to define the selection condition . To obtain byte alignment, 7 bits may be reserved for future application.","The default flag  indicates whether the receiver should select the respective link item if no other condition within the selection object matches or if the receiver does not understand the selection type . If none of the selection markers  within the menu has the default flag set to 1, the receiver cannot not automatically decide which selection to make and, therefore, may present the menu to the user as a regular menu object for manual selection (see step  in ).","If the flag, however, is set to 1, as it is exemplified in , this indicates a default choice for the selection object (compare step  of ). If it is set to 0 for all link items , no default is signaled for the selection object. If it is set to 1 for exactly one link item, the receiver may automatically select same in case no condition data is fulfilled or the selection type is not supported, or may present the menu with individually handling the default link item as described above with respect to . If it is set to 1 for more than one link item, the receiver may, in case no condition data is fulfilled or the selection type is not supported, present the menu with handling the default link items differently from the others as described above with respect to .","With regard to the default flags within one selection object, the number of such selection markers with its default flag set to 1 could be restricted to 1 at maximum within one selection object.","The field  reserved for defining the selection condition could have a length which, in turn, depends on the selection type  of the selection object. For example, the afore-mentioned selection type value x indicating the language as the selection type, could have associated therewith a selection criteria length of 24 bits or 3 bytes, respectively.","The code used to identify the language could be the three-letter ISO language code as defined in ISO 639-2 (codes for the representation of names of languages\u2014Part 2: Alpha-3 code) defined in lowercase characters. If the language code is equal to the receiver's preferences, the condition is fulfilled.","If the receiver detects the selection object data section  and the selection type value  is known, the behavior of a receiver receiving selection object of  could be as follows:\n\n","If the receiver does not support the specific selection type value, the behavior of the receiver could be as follows:\n\n","As a fallback, if a receiver does not support the automatic handling mechanism at all, the menu could be presented as a regular menu to the user as it was outlined before with respect to  (see step ).","The broadcaster may decide whether there should be an automatic handling by assigning a default link item through the default flag. Receivers that can handle automatic handling may not include menu objects where the link has been selected automatically in their history and hide these objects from the user, if possible.","It should be noted that, as already indicated above, the condition type is not restricted to language and also not to the examples indicated above. For example, the condition type could relate to a category of data, which the textual content of the objects referred to by that menu item belong to. For example, an automatically-handling supporting menu object could contain the menu items news, sports and economy. The receiver could have stored the user-settable user preferences indicating user-preferred categories. As to whether a condition data relating to a category is fulfilled or not, is then determined by comparing this condition data with the category preferences stored in the receiver. Moreover, the stored category preferences could not only indicate categories, which the user is interested in or not, but the category preferences could also bring the categories into a preference order by assigning values to the individual category. For example, all categories having associated therewith a value greater than zero in the category preferences could be displayed in step , for example with, however, ordering the menu items according to their preference values, i.e. by listing menu items having condition data referring to higher preference values first and then the menu item having associated therewith condition data indicating categories for which the category preferences indicate a lower value. For example, a user could assign a value of 100 to economy, a value of 50 to news and a value of zero for sports. Thus, the value item \u201csports\u201d would not be displayed and the menu item \u201ceconomy\u201d would be displayed before the menu item \u201cnews\u201d. It is noted that this order is independent from the order at which the menu items occur in the menu object.","Further, it is noted that the procedure according to  and according to the description of  with regard to the automatic handling is only one exemplified possibility. For example, it would be possible for the receiver to choose the target object ID of the menu item, the condition data of which is fulfilled firstly when scanning the menu items in their order in which they are arranged in the menu object.","In addition, as denoted above, it is possible that processor  suppresses entering the object IDs of automatically-handling supporting menu objects into the history path stored in memory  in cases where same have not been displayed by the user, but have been subjected to automatic selection. By this manner, the automatic selection is transparent for the user and the navigation through the object tree and, in particular, the return feature maintains logical for the user.","Further, in the above embodiments, condition data was present in automatic handling supporting objects. Alternatively, merely default functionality is used. Further, the differentiation between one matching or default link item being present or more than one may be omitted. Accordingly, the automatic handling may not comprise the automatic selection but merely the automatic handling type rendering. The opposite may also be true.","Depending on an actual implementation, the inventive broadcast concept can be implemented in hardware or in software. Therefore, the present invention also relates to a computer program, which can be stored on a computer-readable medium such as a CD, a disk, DVD, a memory stick, a memory card or a memory chip.
