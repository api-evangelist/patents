title: Dynamic provisioning of closed captioning to user devices
abstract: A system is configured to receive, from a user device, a request for video content and closed captioning content associated with the video content; obtain, based on the request, device information that identifies a first video format that is supported by the user device; obtain the video content and the closed captioning content, where the video content conforms to a second video format, and where the closed captioning content conforms to a text format; convert the video content from the second video format to the first video format and the closed captioning content from the text format to the first video format; and transmit the converted video content and the converted closed captioning to the user device, where the converted video content and the converted closed captioning content enable the user device to play the converted video content and the converted closed captioning content without modifying the user device.
