{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present invention relates to check certification and more specifically to a system and method of certifying checks.","A certified check is a type of check where a bank verifies and certifies that sufficient funds exist in the account of the payer to cover the amount of the check.","Currently, check certification can only be done at a bank.","Therefore, it would be desirable to provide a system and method of certifying checks from other locations via personal computer, mobile phone, or at an automated teller machine (ATM).","In accordance with the teachings of the present invention, a system and method of certifying checks is provided.","An example method includes receiving by a first computer a request from a second computer to certify a check from a payer to a payee, the check serving to withdraw funds from an account of the payer, receiving by the first computer an image file containing an image of the check from the second computer, obtaining an account number and an amount from the image file by the first computer, determining using the account number whether funds equal to the amount are in the account, and when funds equal to the amount are in the account, putting a hold on the funds equal to the amount and issuing a certification number and a password by the first computer.","An example method of obtaining a certified check includes logging a payer of a check from the payer to a payee into a bank computer, the check serving to withdraw funds from a bank account of the payer, sending a request from the payer to the bank computer to certify the check, sending an image file containing an image of the check to the bank computer, and receiving a certification number and a password from the bank computer following certification by the bank computer.","Turning now to , system  primarily includes computer  and computer . A payer uses computer  to obtain a certified check. A payee uses computer  to accept the certified check.","Computers  and  include a processor, memory, and program and data storage. Computers  and  may execute an operating system such as a Microsoft operating system. Computers  and  execute other computer software that may be stored in a computer readable medium, such as a memory.","Computers  and  further include graphics circuitry for connecting to a display, network circuitry for connecting to network , and other circuitry for connecting to other peripherals, such as a printer, an input device (e.g., a mouse, a keyboard, a touch overlay to the display), a card reader, a biometric reader, such as a fingerprint reader, and\/or a barcode reader. Computer  may use such circuitry to connect image capture device .","Computers  and  may include, but not be limited to, a personal computer, a smart phone or other portable computing device, or a self-service terminal, such as a kiosk or automated teller machine (ATM). Computers  and  may be the same or different computers. Each of computers  and  may include one or more computers in a computer system or network.","Computers  and  may communicate with banking system  over a network connection, such as one which uses the TCP\/IP protocol. Network  may include any combination of wireless or wired networks, including a global communication network, also known as the Internet.","In one example embodiment, computers  and  execute web browser software to allow the payer and the payee to display information in a format established by the World Wide Web (WWW or \u201cweb\u201d). Web browser software may include commercially available web browser software, such as Microsoft\u00ae Internet Explorer web browser software.","Computer  is used by a payer to obtain certification for a check . Computer  captures an image of check  using image capture device  and sends a check image file  to banking system .","Computer  connects to a web server of banking system  which maintains payer bank account  through website . Computer  downloads web pages from website  that allow the payer to login, to upload check image file , to request certification of check , and to complete certification of check . The web pages may also facilitate control of image capture device  in order to capture an image of check .","Computer  may alternatively or in addition download application software to facilitate certification. For example, banking system  may provide check certification request software  for download through website .","In one example embodiment, check certification request software  may be written in a programming language such as the Java programming and be hosted within the browser software.","As another example, check certification request software  may include a script, such as JavaScript, combined with hypertext markup language (HTML) or other suitable web page language.","If computer  is a mobile computing device, such as a smart phone, check certification request software  may include a software applet written to be executed within the operating system of the smart phone.","Check certification request software  may operate image capture device  to facilitate a request for check certification. For example, check certification request software  may communicate directly with a software driver of image capture device .","As another example, check certification request software  may communicate indirectly with a software driver of image capture device  through a protocol or application programming interface (API), such as a TWAIN standard API.","Alternatively, check certification request software  may prompt the payer for a file containing an image  of check  previously captured by the customer using a different software application.","Image capture device  captures an image of check  and stores the image in image file . Image capture device  is coupled to computer  and may include a document scanner or camera.","For example, image capture device  may include a built-in camera within a mobile communication device, such as a smart phone.","As another example, image capture device  may include a document scanner attached to a personal computer via a universal serial bus (USB) or other connection.","As another example, image capture device  may include a check reader module of a kiosk or ATM.","Image file formats may include \u201cTIF\u201d, \u201cGIF\u201d, \u201cJPG\u201d, \u201cBMP\u201d, \u201cPNG\u201d, or any other format as required by banking system . Banking system  may also require that image file  have a predetermined color depth and\/or resolution. The payer must acquire and operate an image capture device  in satisfaction of these requirements.","Check  may include any document which serves as a written order directing a bank where the payer has a checking account to pay money. Check  is filled out and signed by the payer.","The payer maintains a bank account , including a checking account, with banking system . Banking system  maintains customer account information containing records of deposits, withdrawals, check and other transactions involving payer. Banking system  store login credentials for allowing the payer to access the information in payer bank account .","Banking system  executes check certification software , which automates certification after the request from the payer is received. Check certification software  performs optical character recognition (OCR) on check image file  to extract the amount and information identifying account . The information includes at least the account number. The OCR process may also extract the bank routing number and the check number. An example check  includes the bank routing number, the bank account number, and the check number as magnetic ink character (MICR) data.","Assuming that the OCR is successful, check certification software  verifies that funds are available in payer bank account  in the amount of check  and places a \u201chold\u201d on the funds when sufficient funds are available. The \u201chold\u201d ensures that sufficient funds continue to be available as the payer withdraws additional funds or writes other checks from account .","Check certification software  also issues a check certification number and a one-time-use password to the payer.","Banking system  includes a processor, memory, and program and data storage. Banking system  may execute an operating system such as a Microsoft operating system.","Banking system  may include a web server computer connected to the World Wide Web (WWW or \u201cweb\u201d) and provide web content, including web pages with software programs, such as check certification request software  and check certification software .","Web content may include different types of web content for different types of computers . For example, web content may include one type of web content for display screens of mobile devices, such as smart phones, another type of web content for conventional display screens of personal computers, and another type of web content for display screens of self-service terminals, such as kiosks and ATMs. The different types of web content may be accessed by connecting to the same or different web sites.","The payer provides check  to the payee, along with the check certification number and the one-time-use password, using any method or combination of methods of delivery. For example, the payer may use computer  to send the check certification number and the one-time-use password to computer  operated by the payee via an electronic mail (email) message or a simple message service (SMS) message. Alternatively, the payer may provide the payee with the check certification number and the one-time-use password verbally or in writing.","Computer  connects to website  via network  and downloads web pages from website  that allow the payee to login and to accept certification of check . The payee uses the check certification number and the one-time-use password to login. After the payee logs in, website  displays the image of check  with verification that check  has been certified, including payer funds are available in the amount of check . The payee can select to accept check  as certified.","Banking system  updates payer bank account  following cashing of check  by the payee.","Turning now to , an example check certification method is illustrated in detail beginning with step .","In step , banking system  receives a payer request to log in. The payer logs in with pre-established credentials associated with payer bank account .","In one example embodiment, computer  may execute web browser software which connects to website  to download web content, such as web pages. In another example embodiment, computer  may execute check certification request software  to connect to banking system . Combinations of the above two methods are also envisioned.","Banking system  may receive payer login information through a keyboard, touch screen, card reader, a biometric reader, or any combination thereof, depending upon the type of computer  and available peripherals.","For example, if computer  is a mobile communication device, such as a smart phone, the mobile communication device may receive customer login information through a touch or other keypad.","As another example, if computer  is a self-service terminal, such as a kiosk or ATM, the self-service terminal may receive customer login information through a card reader and a keypad.","As another example, if computer  is a personal computer, such as a home personal computer, the personal computer may receive customer login information through a keyboard.","In step , banking system  verifies the payer login information and establishes a secure connection with computer .","In step , banking system  receives a request to certify a check.","A payer can select check certification as option in a web page or by executing check certification request software .","In step , banking system  receives check image file  from computer .","A payer may also make a selection to upload a check image file , capture an image of check  to produce check image file  by operating image capture device , or a combination of both.","In step -, banking system , using check certification software , performs optical character recognition (OCR) on check image file  to extract the amount and information identifying account .","If the OCR process fails to extract the information, banking system  issues an indication to the payer in step . The payer may try to capture another image of check  and upload another check image file . Operation returns to step .","Assuming that the OCR is successful, banking system  issues an indication and verifies that funds are available in payer bank account  in the amount of check  in step -.","If sufficient funds are not available, banking system  issues an indication to the payer in step  and the certification request is denied and operation ends at .","Assuming that sufficient funds are available, banking system  issues an indication and places a hold on the funds in step .","In step , banking system  issues a check certification number to the payer and issues a one-time-use password to the payer.","In step , banking system  may optionally modify check image file  to include a stamp indicating certification. Operation ends at .","The payer sends or gives check  to the payee with the check certification number and the password.","In one example embodiment, the payer may enter information, such as address information, for facilitating sending of the certification number and the password to the payee via electronic mail message or text message. Computer  or banking system  may send the information.","The payee uses computer  to visit website , select a check verification option, and enter the check certification number and password. The payee can login without necessarily have an account managed by banking system . Using the certification number, banking system  identifies the check that was certified and provides an indication that check  was certified following entry of the password by the payee.","Banking system  may provide an image of check  from check image file  with one or more indicia of certification, such as the word \u201ccertified\u201d or equivalent in the form of a message or stamp. Banking system  may modify check image file  to include the indicia. The payee can accept that check  has been certified. The payee may also print the verification of certification from website .","Although the present invention has been described with particular reference to certain preferred embodiments thereof, variations and modifications of the present invention can be effected within the spirit and scope of the following claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 2"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
