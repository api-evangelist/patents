No. 10\/816,032 entitled \u201cHypergolic Bipropellants\u201d by Hawkins et al., filed on 2 Apr. 2004.","This invention relates to bipropellants, particularly hypergolic bipropellants.","A conventional, storable bipropulsion system uses a hydrazine (e.g., monomethylhydrazine) as the fuel component. This fuel affords useful performance characteristics and has a fast ignition with the oxidizer. This fast (hypergolic) ignition provides system reliability for on-demand action of the propulsion system. The conventional, storable bipropulsion system is limited by its inherent energy density that can be traced, in large measure, to the density of the fuel. Also, there are significant costs and operational constraints associated with handling the fuel that derives from the fuel's very toxic vapor.","The challenge is made more difficult since the fuel\/oxidizer combination is desired to be hypergolic. Hypergolicity is defined as self ignition that occurs within milliseconds after contact of fuel with oxidizer, herein \u201cfast ignition\u201d. Hypergolic ignition is valuable because it offers high reliability, eliminates the inert mass of a separate ignition system, and provides an ability to restart for missions that require multipulse operation.","Accordingly, there is need and market for hypergolic bipropellants that overcome the above prior art shortcomings.","There has now been developed ionic hypergolic bipropellant fuels of reduced toxicity, as also described below.","Broadly the present invention provides a hypergolic bipropellant that has","a salt or IL fuel, containing at least one dicyanamide anion and at least one heterocyclic based cation and b) an oxidizer for same. Preferred are oxidizer\/fuel ratios ranging from 1:1 to 7:1 (wt\/wt).","Referring to the present invention in detail advanced bipropellant fuels with fast ignition, upon mixing with storable oxidizer, have been synthesized and demonstrated.","The bipropellant fuels are based upon salts containing the dicyanamide anion (FIG. 1).

To a 100 mL Schlenk flask equipped with a Teflon stir bar and purged with nitrogen the 1-R-3-methyl-imidazolium bromides (or 1-methyl-4-amino-1,2,4-triazolium iodide) were added and dissolved in ca. 30 mL of methanol. In the dark a ca. 5% excess of freshly prepared silver dicyanamide was added to the stirred solution. Stirring was continued over night.

The IL fuel is stored in a propulsion system fuel tank and the oxidizer is stored in a separate tank. When thrust is desired, the fuel and oxidizer are each sprayed through injector elements into a chamber in a rocket and the fuel and oxidizer then come into contact. Ignition immediately ensues and combustion of the fuel by the oxidizer creates pressurized gases that provide thrust as they exit a propulsion nozzle.","Thus advanced bipropellant fuels with fast ignition upon mixing with storable oxidizer have been synthesized and demonstrated per the invention. The bipropellant fuels are based upon salts containing the dicyanamide anion and employ nitrogen-containing, heterocycle-based cations such as the imidazolium, triazolium or tetrazolium cations.","Fast igniting, ionic liquid fuels provide a means to overcome significant limitations of the state-of-the-art, storable bipropulsion system. Such ionic liquid fuels can provide greater than 40% improvement in density over hydrazine fuels. This confers greater energy density to the bipropulsion system. Also, the negligible vapor pressure of ionic liquid fuel provides a means of significantly reducing costs and operational constraints associated with handling the fuel.","Ignition of propellants often constitutes a major hurdle in propellant development. Therefore, discovering an IL which shows hypergolic ignition with common oxidizers represents a major achievement. Compounds 1-3, above, are, in fact, the first ILs demonstrated to be hypergolic.","A preferred embodiment of the invention is the employment of pure dicyanamide-based ionic liquid as a fast-igniting, bipropellant fuel. However, the use of dicyanamide salt molecules as components in fuel mixtures to confer fast-ignition and density is also a viable mode of the invention.","A hypergolic bipropellant based upon ionic liquid fuel (dicyanamide-based IL) and an oxidizer (RFNA) has potential as a replacement for bipropellant currently used in on-orbit spacecraft propulsion. Other application areas include liquid engines for boost and divert propulsion. The high volumetric impulse that is inherent in the new hypergol lends itself to applications that require high performance from volume limited systems. The low vapor toxicity of the ionic liquid fuel is a benefit over toxic hydrazine fuels currently used.","The performance aspects of this new hypergol can find use in commercial applications in satellite deployment and commercial space launch activities."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
