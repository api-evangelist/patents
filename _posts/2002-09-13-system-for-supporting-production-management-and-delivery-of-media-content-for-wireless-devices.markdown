title: System for supporting production, management and delivery of media content for wireless devices
abstract: In a system for providing media content to a communication device, a device capabilities determination is made by a rules engine that compares content attributes with constraints on those attributes for a device. Metadata describing the content is derived and entered into a database. As the specifications of different devices are entered into the system, corresponding constraints are associated with the devices that tell the engine the valid range of values for the content attributes. The engine creates an available content library for each class of devices by excluding all instances of content that have attributes outside the range of values prescribed in the constraints. A similar rule set determines whether the content can be distributed through a particular delivery channel, based on the distribution channel capacity to support a media type. The subset of content that passes both the device capabilities tests and the distribution capability tests is viable for delivery to a device over a particular distribution channel.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The invention relates generally to systems and methods for providing media content for mobile communication devices and, more particularly, to systems and methods for supporting the production, management and delivery of media content for wireless devices.","2. Description of the Related Art","A typical system for distributing media content, such as audio-based ringtones, to mobile communication devices over a communication network includes a library of media content stored in a file server and a means for sending the media content to a device. Each piece of media content is stored in a format compatible with one or more communication devices. For example, an audio file stored in a Nokia proprietary format is considered to be compatible with all models of Nokia telephones. Among the various models of Nokia telephones, however, there may be different types of media capabilities. For example, one telephone model may be capable of playing an audio file such as \u201cringtones\u201d of a certain byte duration and note range while another model has different duration and range capabilities.","Existing media content distribution systems do not account for these differences in device capabilities. Thus, a piece of media content associated with Nokia telephones may be sent to any Nokia telephone regardless of the capabilities of the particular telephone model. If the particular model receiving the content does not have the proper capabilities, the content may not be able to be played or, if it can be played, will be limited by the model capabilities. For example, the duration of the ringtone may be truncated or the note range modified to accommodate the capability of the particular telephone. Thus, the user of the device is not able to hear the \u201ctrue\u201d ringtone.","In view of the foregoing limitations of existing media distribution systems, those skilled in the art have recognized a need for a system that is capable of providing media content to a variety of communication devices operating over various communications networks and with various media content capabilities such that the possibility of providing incompatible media content to an end-user device is substantially eliminated. The invention fulfills these needs and others.","Briefly, and in general terms, the invention is directed to various systems and methods for providing media content for mobile communication devices. The systems and methods take the media content capabilities of the device into consideration when determining which media content is available for a given device. The distribution channel over which a device operates may also be taken into consideration.","In a first aspect, the invention relates to a system for making one or more pieces of media content available for delivery to an end-user device. The system includes a file server with a plurality of media content files stored therein and a database. The database associates content type attributes with each of the media content files and attribute capability constraints with the end-user device. The attribute capability constraints prescribe a range of acceptable values for content type attributes. The system also includes a first rules engine that creates an available library of media content that excludes all media content that have content type attributes outside the range of acceptable values.","In another aspect of the system, the database associates a carrier network with the end-user device. The carrier network, in turn, has an associated delivery channel capacity. The system further includes a second rules engine adapted to refine the available library to exclude all media content not supported by the delivery channel of the end-user device.","A key differentiator between the prior system and the system of the present invention is the capacity for the system to determine whether media content of a particular type is viable for delivery to a given device or class of devices. Existing systems operate on the premise that all content marked as active in a database is viable for the devices it is associated with. In accordance with the system of the present invention, content availability is determined from a combination of rules for device capabilities and rules for distribution capabilities.","The device capabilities determination is made by a rules-based engine that compares content attributes (typically metadata derived by content examination programs) with constraints on those attributes for a device. There are effectively two main steps to this process: firstly, metadata describing the content is derived and entered into the database; secondly, as the specifications of different devices are entered into the system, corresponding constraints are associated with the devices that tell the rules engine what the valid range of values for each content attribute is. As output of this process, the rules engine creates an available content library for each class of devices by excluding all instances of media content that have attributes outside the range of values prescribed in the constraints.","A similar rule set determines whether the content can be distributed through a particular delivery channel, based on factors such as territory-based licensing of content, distribution channel capacity to support the given media type, and business agreements with third-party distributors and networks that would allow or disallow content of that type to be distributed. The subset of content that passes both the device capabilities tests described above and the distribution capability tests can be determined to be viable for delivery to a given end-user device over a particular distribution channel. Thus, the system substantially eliminates the possibility of providing incompatible media content to an end-user device and instead provides only the most viable media content in view of the operating parameters, i.e., content constraints, delivery channel capacity, etc., associated with a given device.","These and other aspects and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following detailed description and the accompanying drawings which illustrate by way of example the features of the invention.","Referring now to the drawings, particularly to , there is shown a block diagram of a communications system configured to deliver media content to an end-user device over a wireless carrier network. \u201cMedia content\u201d, as used herein includes, but is not limited to, ringtones, graphics, photographs, text messages and other audio, video, audiovisual, textual or interactive content as well as actual software applications such as games, alert applications and media players. An \u201cend-user device\u201d includes, but is not limited to, cellular telephone handsets, such as those manufactured by Nokia, Motorola, Sony Ericsson, Samsung and Kyocera. End-user devices may also include personal digital assistants (PDA), pagers, wireless e-mail devices, wireless calenders, GPS enabled devices and wireless game devices.","The system includes an engine  with various database related components and server related components working in conjunction to provide a library of media content. Database related components include a database system  which stores metadata of the media content while the server system includes a file server system  which stores the actual media content. The metadata in the database system  includes a uniform resource locator (URL) to the media content in the file server system . In a preferred configuration of the system, the database system  includes at least two production databases to provide a level of redundancy and an additional replication server database to manage and synchronize the redundant databases. In one configuration, the redundant databases are Sun 420 RS boxes running on the Sun Solaris operating system and the replication server database is a Sun 220 box running Sybase database software. The filer servers  are Intel 2U, 1 GHz dual processor CPUs running the Linux operating system.","The system also includes a client-server interface  for providing communication between the engine  and one or more client servers . The client-server interface  is housed within a triple redundant CPU system comprised of Intel 2U, 1 GHz dual processor CPUs, and interfaces with the client servers  through a network of switches  and routers . The client servers  themselves, interface with one or more end-users through an end-user interface . The end-user interface  may be a browser running on a personal computer or the end-user device itself, e.g., cellular telephone or a client application.","The system or platform is built as a layered multitier server application. The Sybase relational database management system is used for data storage but application code components are implemented in the Java programming language using Java 2 as the platform. A Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) driver provided by the database vendor is used to connect the datastore to the application.","The lowest-level component of the Java core of the application is a toolkit called XORM (an acronym for eXtensible Object-Relational Mapping). XORM is an open source implementation of the Java Data Objects (JDO) specification which allows application developers to work with the relational data in the database as if it were native Java data objects. XORM facilitates the automatic generation of Structure Query Language (SQL) statements and queries in order to perform operations on persistent data.","The central part of the application consists of logic classes that provide shared business logic to the externally facing parts of the system. The logic classes include components to manage the complex relationships between different types of data and are broken down into core divisions based on their responsibilities. One contains functions that enable the available library of content, one provides methods to navigate the complexities of the content to device mapping application (C2DMA), and so on.","The external face of the application is created using the Java Servlet and Java Server Pages application programming interfaces defined by Sun Microsystems. The open source Jakarta Tomcat servlet engine created by the Apache Group is used to host these components. In addition, many of the web-based interfaces in the system rely on the Jakarta Struts template engine, which adds a Model-View-Controller paradigm to the servlet and JSP model. Other components that provide XML (eXtensible Markup Language) output are built similarly but use the open source JDOM API for generating and managing data using the XML document object model.","The external connectivity pieces of the application, including the content distributors and delivery mechanisms, use the core services provided by the business logic classes and database connectivity layers. They also rely on additional proprietary software and components provided by third-party vendors to provide Java code access to complex communication protocols.","With reference to , the system includes various functionally interrelated operating modules and database components, including a media production aspect , a content-to-device-mapping application (C2DMA) module , a media management aspect  and a media delivery aspect . The media production portion  is responsible for the creation and storage of media content. The media management portion  is responsible for the management of content catalogs and associated projects and clients through the client-server interface  (). The media delivery aspect  of the system is responsible for the delivery of content through any available channel to any addressable end-user device. The C2DMA  handles the management and selection of appropriate media content for users based on a variety of factors described in detail below. A detailed description of each portion of the system follows. The operating modules described below are contained within the various redundant processing unit systems shown in . Each of these processing units is an Intel 2U, 1 GHz dual processor CPU. Common numeric identifiers in  show the relationship between the functional modes () and the system hardware ().","Media Production","With the continued reference to , the media production aspect  of the system includes a production tools module  and a master media content library , referred to herein as the \u201cmaster library\u201d. The media production aspect may also include a licensing tools module . With reference to the conceptual model of , the media production aspect  allows for the creation of a piece of content  from an original piece of media . The content  is made by a producer  using production tools . Production tools  include algorithms which are specific for end-user devices. In the case of ringtones, these algorithms manipulate a source file, e.g., MIDI file, of the media  into a piece of content  that is compatible with a particular end-user device. The algorithms used by the producer  are based on the operation attributes of the end-user device and are often provided by the manufacturer of the end-user device. For example, some end-user devices cannot reproduce a musical note above high \u201cC\u201d. The algorithm associated with this end-user device takes this into account when manipulating the source file. A description and example of the major blocks of the media production portion  of the system follows.","Media  is an original work, such as the written music of a song or a piece of art created by an author . A piece of media  may have several performances . An example of a piece of media  is \u201cDock of the Bay\u201d written by Steve Cropper and Otis Redding. A performance  is a unique rendering of a piece of media . Performances  have their own set of attributes such as album name, track length, etc. Thus, for the media \u201cDock of the Bay\u201d, performances might be \u201cDock of the Bay\u201d by Otis Redding and \u201cDock of the Bay\u201d by Glen Campbell. Content  is a generic container of all forms of digital media. For example, a ringtone's original MIDI, its Real Audio preview, its Motorola ringtone string, its WAV preview\u2014are all unique pieces of content  that relate to a performance . Thus, for the performance, \u201cDock of the Bay\u201d by Otis Redding, a piece of content might be \u201cthe Motorola ringtone for the Otis Redding performance of Dock of the Bay.\u201d","Licensing system  refers to the process by which a performance  is associated with specific licensing requirements. For example, a performance  may be limited to use in a specific geographical region. Post production  is performed by someone who has authority to approve content  from the standpoint of quality, licensing, etc. A producer  is someone who manipulates content  into various formats using the production tools . A producer may also create the original performance using standard media production tools.","With reference to , various pieces of information are associated with a particular performance, including media type (audio), performance type (song) and rating filter. Each performance is a record in a performance database file stored in the database (). The pieces of information are fields in the performance record. The rating filter assigns a G, PG, PG-13, R, NC-17 or X content rating to the performance. As described further below, this rating filter may be used to limit access to the performance. Each performance has an associated set of attributes, which may include album, genre, label, year and country information. These attributes are fields in the performance record. The attributes may identify one or more geographical territories (not shown) for licensing purposes. As explained further below, the licensing attribute acts as a filter to limit access to a performance based on licensing criteria such as geographical territories and approved clients. Regarding approved clients, certain clients may have the exclusive rights to certain performances based on distributor agreements. Associated with each performance is one or more pieces of content, as listed under the content tree. The pieces of content are associated with the performance record. Content records contain paths to individual media files stored on the content servers  ().","With reference to , various pieces of information are associated with each piece of content, including content type (audio\/Nokia Proprietary, audio\/Motorola Proprietary) status (active), deliverable (yes), performance (Who Let the Dogs Out) and several content attributes. These pieces of information are fields in the content record. The content attributes relate to the content media file itself and include, for example, the byte count of the content file and the highest and lowest notes within a media file and dimensions and bit depth in the case of graphics. A content file also may include attributes related to territorial licensing. Each content file's associated attributes and information are stored in a content database file in the database (). The actual data is stored on a file server referenced from the database. Additional details on the content field entries are described under the following C2DMA section.","Content-to-Device-Mapping Application (C2DMA)","With reference to , as previously mentioned, the C2DMA  handles the management and selection of appropriate content for users. In general, the system is capable of managing, serving and delivering correctly formatted content to heterogeneous devices over heterogenous networks. To this end, the system supports multiple makes and models of end-user devices. The system also differentiates between differing makes and models of end-user devices; supports differing functional capabilities of end-user devices that may share the same make and model; recognizes and handles carrier networks that may not allow or support the same functionality, even on the same device; defines the set of products available to a given end-user device and the media constraints for a piece of content to qualify as a product for a device; and associates specific users with specific devices which they own and use. With reference to the conceptual model of , the C2DMA maps content to end-users using the following subtasks:","Content Description:","The C2DMA provides a metadata model allowing each unique piece of content  in the system to be described in such a way that it can be reused. A content type  represents a formal declaration of a specific type of content  along with a generic description of its possible attributes. Each of the attributes is defined by an instance of the content type attribute  class. A content type attribute  has a name, a datatype, and a field denoting whether the attribute must be assigned to all content of that type. Note that content type attributes  are not meant to provide metadata for the original media title (such as artist, album, etc.), but instead describe details of the electronic media produced. For example, an MP3 file can be stereo or mono, has a bit rate in Kbps or has a variable bit rate with a maximum. In this case a content type \u201caudio\/mp3\u201d would be created, with content type attributes named \u201cstereo\u201d (type boolean), \u201cbitRateKbps\u201d (type integer), and \u201cvariableBitRate\u201d (type boolean). All three would most likely be marked as required database entries.","As a piece of content  is produced and entered into the system, content attribute value  items are created to describe the values for content type attributes  of its content type . All content type attributes  marked as required must be specified; others are optional. For example, the \u201cWorking in a Coal Mine\u201d MIDI is of type \u201caudio\/midi\u201d. As content attribute values, it specifies that \u201cnumNotes=25\u201d, \u201chighNote=G4\u201d, \u201clowNote=E3\u201d, etc.","User Device Customization:","The C2DMA architecture supports the possibility of unique capabilities for each individual end-user device. A user  owns one or more devices . The user  may know the make  and model  of each device . In the object model, make  and model  are simply entities with a name, where a single make can be associated with many models. For example, end-user Barbara owns a Kyocera 3035. \u201cBarbara\u201d is the name of a user; her device object references a model with the name \u201c3035\u201d which in turn references the \u201cKyocera\u201d make.","A device  is the entity that binds a user  to a model . In some cases, model  may not be known, so the device  to model  mapping is optional. Both models  and devices  can support any number of platforms . A platform  is a semantic grouping of distinct platform product  definitions, as described below. Multiple models  that support the same functionality may be part of the same platform . For example, the Nokia 5125 model and the Nokia 5165 model both reference the \u201cNokia 51 xx\u201d platform.","Platform Product Support:","The C2DMA describes platforms  that support specific media products . A product  is a formal definition of deliverable content that implies both media type and intended use. Two examples of products  are \u201cScreen Saver\u201d and \u201cOperator Logo\u201d. While these products  use the exact same piece of content  defined by the exact same size constraints, i.e., content attribute values , they represent different uses of the media.","A platform product  describes the media type and constraints that specify products  deliverable to the platform . This is done via a set of media capability  objects. The ability for a phone to support ringtones is captured, in the object model, by a platform product  that references the product  named \u201cRingtone\u201d. Other platform products  for the same phone platform may reference \u201cOperator Logo\u201d, \u201cScreen Saver\u201d, etc.","A media capability  references a content type  and capability constraints  for that content type. A capability constraint  specifies the required value or range of acceptable values for a particular content type attribute . For example, the Nokia 3390 can utilize operator logos that are monochrome bitmaps exactly 72 pixels wide by 72 pixels high. Here, the \u201c3390\u201d model is linked to a platform . This platform  references a platform product  entry. The platform product  references the product  named \u201cOperator Logo\u201d and specifies that it is composed of a single media capability  for content type , \u201cimage\/ING\u201d. Attached to the media capability  object are three capability constraints , specifying \u201cwidth=72\u201d, \u201cheight=72\u201d, and \u201ccolor Depth=1\u201d.","Device to Network Mapping:","The C2DMA provides a means of associating specific end-user devices with the carrier networks that service them. A device  is on a network , which is provided by an operator . For example, Steve's Motorola phone (the device) is serviced by Verizon (the operator) on the \u201cVerizon US TDMA\u201d network.","A network  can deliver content  via a set of delivery channels . Delivery channels  define a protocol and means of addressing a device . Examples of delivery channels  include the following:\n\n","The relationship between a specific device  and a delivery channel  is the device's delivery address . The format of a delivery address  may vary based on the delivery channel . For example, the delivery address for the \u201cSMS\u201d delivery channel on Steve's phone contains an address data field with the value \u201c13105551234\u201d.","Network Product Support:","The C2DMA describes the ability for specific media products to be delivered via particular network connections and protocols, both public (the Internet) and proprietary SMSCs). Each delivery channel  can provide delivery of a set of products . For example, the Nokia 51xx line supports delivery of ringtones via SMS.","Associated with each delivery channel  for a network  is one or more acceptable encodings, provided by subtypes of the converter class. For example, for a specific SMS delivery channel, the ringtones must be sent as hexadecimal sequences with colons between each pair of characters and segmented into data packets or \u201cframes\u201d for SMPP delivery. Some examples of encodings are: binary, hexadecimal encoded, hexadecimal encoded escaped, ZIPped and Base64\/UUEncoded.","With reference to , each specific converter  encapsulates business logic for translating raw content  data to the format specified by the encoding, taking into account the details of the end-user device  () and network . The transformed content is an instance of the payload  class. A payload  is the customized version of media content  for a particular end-user device on a particular delivery network.","Media Management","With reference to , the media management aspect  of the system includes an available media content library  which is a subset of the master library . The available media content library is not a physical entity, i.e., its content resides in the master library. As described further below, attributes, such as content type and territory designation, assigned to a piece of content within the master library  determine whether the content may be mapped to a particular available media content library .","The media management portion  of the system provides the tools to create catalogs  of media content using the content stored in the master library . These catalogs  are defined by various parameters, described below, which are stored in system processors (). The media content itself, remains in the file servers . Attributes associated with a piece of content and a catalog are used to map content to a catalog. A conceptual model of this mapping relationship is shown in . As previously mentioned, an available media content library  is derived from the master library. This derivation process involves one or more rules engines which act as filters to exclude certain media content in the master library  from being associated with the available media content library .","In one configuration, a rules engine uses the territory  and country  associated with a particular catalog  to limit the available content for the catalog to those pieces of content having licensing related attributes that match or exceed those of the catalog. For example, if a catalog has North America as a territorial designation, only those pieces of content with a North America territorial designation or greater designation, e.g., worldwide, are mapped to the available media content library  of the catalog . Other licensing-related parameters, such as approved clients, may be used to limit the available content.","The available media content library  may also be refined by another rules engine based on the media capabilities, i.e., platform , make (not shown), model (not shown), associated with the catalog  and the media capabilities associated with the content of the existing available media content library . Thus, the limiting factors in an available media content library  are the end-user devices that are supported by the catalog. For example, if a catalog  has an associated media capability of \u201caudio\/Nokia Proprietary\u201d, only those pieces of content within the existing available media content library  of the catalog having an associated media capability of \u201caudio\/Nokia Proprietary\u201d are mapped to the available media content library  of the catalog.","With reference to , the media management portion  of the system also includes a project configurator  which provides an integrated interface between a project manager (PM) and the master library  through the C2DMA . The project configurator  allows for the creation of client accounts and catalog permissions using standard technologies including Java Server Pages (JSP) and Struts. Data related to the client accounts is stored in system processors (). Various interfaces of the project configurator  and the functions provided thereby are described below, with reference to ","Create New Client:","With reference to , the PM enters client  information which adds a new record to the system database. Client information contains the name of the client and contact  information. The first screen of the graphical user interface (GUI) allows the PM to go to \u201cclient operations.\u201d This screen has a list of current clients. When a new client is created, a form appears for obtaining client information. After filling out the information and selecting \u201cOK,\u201d the previous screen appears and the new client now appears on the client list.","Delete (or Disable) Existing Client:","At the \u201cclient operations\u201d screen, a client is selected on the list and the delete button is selected. After an \u201care you sure?\u201d popup ensures that this is not a mistake, the client is marked as \u201cdeleted,\u201d i.e., is no longer on the list of clients. Client information, however, is not permanently deleted from the system database; it is merely hidden.","Change Client Information:","Basic client information is modified. For example: addresses, contacts, etc. The user navigates to the \u201cclient operations\u201d screen, selects a specific client, and selects the modify button. A screen just like the form for creating a new client appears, but information is already filled in. The PM can change this information and hit \u201cOK.\u201d The fields are then updated in the system database.","Manage Contacts for the Client:","Contact information is added, including names, phone numbers, etc. At the \u201cclient operations\u201d screen, there is a list of contacts , and \u201cadd\u201d, \u201cmodify\u201d, and \u201cremove\u201d buttons. The add and modify buttons navigate to a screen with client contact information. This information can be added or modified. By selecting \u201cOK,\u201d a new database record is created or the existing one is modified.","Create Extranet Logins:","An extranet login  allows a client  to have limited access to the system. At the \u201cclient operations\u201d screen, there is a list of contacts . The PM must choose from this list and select the \u201cCreate Extranet Login\u201d button. This brings up a screen that asks for the username and password. The system knows who the contact  is and what client  he is associated with. When this information is entered, a new record is created which is used to validate client logins and initialize the session.","Manage Catalogs:","With reference to , a client  may want changes made to its catalog . Such changes may involve the name and catalog limit , or even deleting a catalog . The system provides an interface for a PM to manage these changes. When a PM chooses to manage catalogs  for a client , he is presented with a list of catalogs currently defined for the client. Each catalog  in the list has an edit and delete link next to it.","Selecting delete causes the system to disable (not physically remove) the catalog  by marking it as inactive. The PM is returned to the manage catalogs interface with the selected catalog  no longer showing. Selecting edit takes the PM to the change catalog setup details. On the same interface, a button is provided to create new catalogs. When selected, the system presents a create new catalogs screen.","Create New Catalogs:","With reference to , the system provides an interface allowing a PM to create new catalogs  for a client . The catalog  provides the basis for the client's product  offerings to end users. The interface has a text field for entering a name of the catalog  and a drop down box with all currently defined territories  in it.","The interface provides a list of available networks . At least one network must be assigned to the catalog , optionally multiple networks can be assigned. The system responds with an interface providing a list of platforms  supported by the assigned networks , to be assigned to the catalog . At least one platform  must be assigned, optionally multiple platforms can be selected. The system responds with a list of products  to be assigned to the catalog . The list of products available for assignment are those capable of being deployed to the previously assigned platforms .","When the PM assigns a product  to a catalog , a catalog limit  can be specified. If set, the limit sets the maximum amount of the product  the client  can add to his catalog  from the available library for each supported platform . If a limit is not set, no limit is enforced.","The system creates the catalog  with the chosen territory , networks , platforms , and products  associated with it. In addition, a root category is created in the catalog  to store default values for the catalog. A default price code  for \u201cfree\u201d is created. All categories  entered by the client , as explained below, are created under this default root category. After creating the catalog  and default root category, the PM is returned back to the client management page ().","If more than one network  is going to be supported in one catalog , the client  appends the target network when querying for the XML list of available titles , allowing the system to respond with just the titles  available for the selected network . This is because if the catalog  supports multiple networks , it may have selected content  that can be deployed to one network  but not to others. A catalog  may have price codes  in one or more currencies. Different price codes can be associated with different catalog categories.","Change Catalog Setup Details:","The client  may want to change the name of the catalog , adjust the catalog limits  or even change the networks , platforms , and products  associated with a catalog. This interface shows the name of the catalog  in a text box for editing. Below the name a table shows columns containing the supported networks , platforms , and products . At the bottom of each column a link is provided to change the information above the link.","If the PM chooses to change the networks , he is taken to interfaces to select the networks, and must reselect the platforms  and products  since the available platforms and products may have changed when the networks changed. Similarly, if the platforms  are changed, the products  must be reselected.","The interfaces for selecting the networks , platforms , and products  are identical to the interfaces specified in the create new catalog section. If the networks , platforms , and or products  are changed, the system traverses the current selected content  and unselects all content not currently supported by the new configuration. Once the system is updated, the PM is taken back to the manage catalogs interface.","Associate Client Logins with Catalogs:","The PM, having created extranet logins  for contacts  and one or more catalogs  for the clients , now needs to associate which contacts can edit the catalogs in question. The PM is presented with a grid with catalogs  listed across and contacts  with extranet logins  listed down. Each intersection of a contact  and catalog  is represented by a checkbox. The PM can check or uncheck each checkbox; upon this action, the system creates or removes the corresponding mapping from the extranet login  to the catalog .","With reference to , the media management aspect  of the system also includes a catalog designer  which provides an integrated interface between a client user and the available library through the C2DMA . The catalog designer  allows for the creation of catalogs using standard technologies including JSP and Struts. Various interfaces of the catalog designer  and the functions provided thereby are described below. As previously mentioned, data related to catalogs is stored in system processors ().","Client Login\/Logout:","A contact  accesses the system home page, which has a hyperlink to the login page. The login page has text fields for username and password, and a login button. The contact  gives name\/password which is checked against the system database. If correct, a session is created for that contact . The contact  is then able to create and modify catalogs . All pages have a logout button. Also, when the session times out, the contact  is automatically logged out of the system.","Catalog Manager\/Category Manager:","After a contact  has successfully logged into the system, he is taken to the catalog manager (). The contact  is presented with a list of catalogs  that have been defined by the PM for the client . Each catalog  provides a link to a category manager interface, which displays the categories associated with the catalog. (). If the system determines the contact  has authorized access to only one catalog , the contact is immediately presented to the category manager for that catalog.","Create New Category:","From the category manager, the contact  can choose to add new categories  to an existing catalog . In response to a request to create a new category, the system presents an interface screen (), whereby attributes are assigned to the new category. Relevant data about the new category  includes:\n\n","Upon completion of this form, the system creates a new category  object with the appropriate relationships and presents an updated category manager screen with the newly created category (). If the auto-add feature is enabled, the category  is immediately populated with the titles  from the auto-add source category. The category  name does not have to be unique throughout a catalog . Default values for price code, rating filter and seasonal status are inherited from the parent category.","Manage Categories:","Once a contact  has chosen a catalog  to manage, he is taken to the category manager interface (). This interface presents a list of all the subcategories defined under the root category of the catalog. Each category has links next to it to edit, create subcategories, manage content, and delete.","If the contact chooses to edit a category , he is taken to the edit category interface () and presented with all of the category attributes. The category name is displayed in an editable text box through which it can be changed. Under the category name, other category attributes are presented including: default price code, rating filter, start date and end date.","The contact  can save or cancel the changes. If he saves the changes, the system modifies the category  to reflect the new attribute values. If the rating filter has been lowered, the system removes all selected titles  from the category  that no longer meet the rating requirements. In one configuration of the system, the titles are left in place, thus allowing the client to see what titles have been removed. In either case (save or cancel) the contact is returned to the category manager interface ().","If the contact  chooses to manage category or subcategory content, the system presents a manage content interface, which is described below. If he chooses to delete the category , he is given a popup to confirm the action. If he confirms it, the system deletes the category and its dependent objects permanently.","Add Content to Category:","The manage content interface () provides a list of titles currently in the category, and allows for the addition of titles. Selecting the \u201cadd titles\u201d option causes the system to present a title selector interface (). This interface allows the contact  to select a title from the list of available content for the platforms, products and networks associated with this category and catalog. The available list is further restricted based on the rating for the title. The contact can view this available list of titles in a number of ways:\n\n","The contact  can select one or more titles  from this list to import into the category . The system creates a title  instance linked to each chosen title and assigns it the default price code . In addition, subject to catalog limit  constraints, selected content  entries are created for each platform product  () that matches the title with the category's configuration. The performances listed in a category  are unique, i.e., the same item cannot be added twice. As a default function, a single price applies to all selected versions of a title.","Add\/Remove Selected Content by Platform:","A manage catalog interface allows a contact  to look at an existing catalog  and add or remove titles . The contact  goes to this page and sees a list of catalogs. A specific catalog can be selected and the \u201cmodify\u201d button pressed. This brings up a page that displays the titles for that catalog. Specific titles can be selected and deleted.","There may also be titles in this \u201cactive catalog\u201d that are shown, but not selected as active. The contact activates these by selecting the title line item (for a specific device). Also, the contact can go to a screen that shows the entire catalog of available items, select one or more items, and have them added to the active catalog.","Manage Price\/Code Settings for Each Title:","Each title can be given a price code . Also, the price codes  can be modified globally, which automatically changes the price for all items using that code. The active catalog page contains a dropdown combo box for each line item title. The contact  can select from a list of price codes . The current price for that code is also displayed.","To change pricing, the contact  goes to a pricing page and sees a list of all price codes . An individual price code can be selected and modified. Also, existing price codes  can be deleted, and new ones created. If a price code  is deleted, all titles  that are set to that price code revert to the default price code. There is a default price code for the entire catalog . This is selected from a list of available price codes on a \u201cpricing\u201d page.","Manage Price Codes:","When a contact  chooses to manage price codes , he is taken to the manage price codes interface (not shown). The interface presents the contact with a list of all currently defined price codes, in an editable text box, with the set of prices (one price for each currency) to the right of the code in text boxes. The name of the price code can be changed, as can each of the prices.","Below the list of price codes the list continues with several lines of the same text boxes, all of which are blank. The contact can add new price codes by filling in the blank boxes. When the contact selects save, the system renames any price codes, resets any changed prices and adds any new price codes and prices.","Next to each price code in the list is a button to delete the price code. If the contact chooses to delete a price code, a pop-up confirmation is presented. If confirmed, the system checks if any titles are using the price code and returns an error page if the price code is currently in use. Otherwise, the price code and all associated prices are permanently deleted. If the price code being deleted was the default price code of any categories or subcategories, the category is modified to use the default \u201cfree\u201d price code.","With continued reference to , the media management aspect  of the system also includes a Web services application tool  or content export tool which is part of the client-server interface  () and provides an integrated interface between client servers  () and a particular project catalog . The Web services application tool  is built utilizing XML and HTTP protocols and provides XML feeds of catalogs and the previews and content associated with a catalog in response to an HTTP request by a client server.","The following is generally needed to retrieve content information from the system servers: a client account in the system, one or more created catalogs within the system, and an Internet protocol (IP) address from which the client accesses the system. A client requests (via browser manually or server originated request), receives (via browser copy and paste or server catch), parses (to flat file or database importer), and stores (in flat file or database) catalog and content feeds. Using the catalog and content feeds, the client creates an HTML\/Wireless Applications Protocol (WAP) display (flat file served to end-user interface or dynamically displayed from system database) interface (Storefront) for use by end-users.","A client accesses the content of a project catalog  with an XML request via HTTP. Once this is successfully passed into the system server, a response is generated and pushed to the client server  for display to the end user. In other embodiments, the responses may be provided to the client server by WAP pulling and other browser based delivery.","The process is as follows: The client sends a server  XML request via HTTP to the system server  to access its client-specific catalog . The code for an exemplary catalog request and its related schema is shown in . The following fields are in the request:\n\n","The Web services application tool  responds to HTTP POST requests and looks for a parameter with name XML to contain the actual request XML. The Web services application tool  uses a standard approach to error messaging. Since it is built on the top of HTTP, it utilizes the robust and extensible platform of HTTP error messaging. All successful requests return HTTP status code . If an error occurs, the response will have error code 4xx.","If an XML request is detected by the Web services application tool , the catalog request is sent to the system server . The catalog request is handled via the system server  and a catalog response is generated as shown in and . The code for an exemplary catalog response and its related schema is shown in through \n\n","Upon receipt of the catalog response, the client server  unwinds the XML within the response and builds an HTML or WAP storefront. The storefront may be a Web page displaying the content available within the requested catalog and end-user devices compatible with at least one of the displayed content types.","With reference to , the media management aspect  of the system also includes billing interfaces  which provide for the payment of content by the end user. A conceptual model of an exemplary billing interface is shown in . The billing manager  is the central object that reconciles billing reports  generated from a billing channel  with delivery reports generated by a network's  delivery of content  through a delivery path . The billing channel  may include any one of a 900 toll Interactive Voice Response (IVR) , 800 toll free IVR, credit card , carrier direct billing (CDB)  a prepaid card or other billing forms, such as Paypal.","From the billing report  and the network  delivery information, commissions  are calculated for the various entities in the sales pipeline. The sales pipeline is a conceptual model that includes all primary entities involved in the delivery of a particular piece of content , such as distributors, operators, billing partners, etc. The system calculates a commission share for each entity within the sales pipeline. In addition to commissions, royalties  are generated for use of the content  that was delivered. Of note is the price list , generated from a client contract  involving a point of sale (EPOS)  and the system operator. The contract drives which content  is available for sale at an EPOS, and the price that will be charged at the EPOS. Possible EPOSs include the Web, Wireless Applications Protocol (WAP), Mobile Originated Short Message Service (MOSMS), a prepaid card, print, advertising and IVR.","Media Delivery","With reference to , the media delivery aspect  of the system includes a request handler , a broker\/converter , a distributor , monitoring tools  and customer service tools . The request handler  hosts the Web services application  () and receives content requests from a client server.","In one embodiment, the content requests sent to the request handler  by the client server may contain the fields listed below. In other embodiments, less fields may be included. For example, the delivery address, content delivery code Id and operator Id are sufficient to deliver content. The code for an exemplary content request and its related schema is shown in and \n\n","Upon receiving the request, the request handler  repackages the requests into a standard form and forwards it to the broker\/converter . The request handler  also sends a content delivery response to the client-server, which contains the following fields. The code for an exemplary content response and its related schema is shown in .\n\n","With reference to , the broker\/converter  translates the raw content  into a payload , i.e., a format specified by the encoding requirements\/delivery format  used by the delivery channel  of the carrier network identified in the content request. The final payload  is placed in a que in the broker\/converter  before being forwarded to the distributor  for transmission over the carrier's delivery network .","A conceptual model of media distribution is shown in . The following abbreviations are used in the figure:\n\n","Though not shown in the diagram, the system may be used with other delivery networks including the following third generation systems: third generation code division multiple access (3GCDMA), wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA), universal mobile telecommunication system (UMTS) and freedom of mobile multimedia access (FOMMA).","With reference to , the system may also include a customer service (CS) tool  through which it provides various reports to the client and notifications to the end users. A conceptual model of the CS tool  is shown in . An exemplary content delivery\/accounting report  contains the following information:\n\n","A service request  generates a notification , e.g. an email, which is sent to an appropriate notification receiver. The receiver searches for this service request in the CS tool  and resolves it, resulting in a service request resolution  and an associated notification delivery to an appropriate user .","As an additional feature, the request handler  provides an account status service to those clients using a pre-paid or MIN accounting system to bill the end user. To use this feature, the client sends an account status request which includes the following fields. The code for an account status request and its related schema is shown in .\n\n","In response to the account status request, the request handler  generates an account status response which includes the following fields. The code for an account status request and its related schema is shown in .\n\n","While the foregoing description of the system has focused on the provision of audio-based media content, particularly ringtones, to cellular telephones, the system may be used to provide any type of media content including visual-based and audiovisual-based media content to any one of a variety of communication devices, such as those described earlier.","It will be apparent from the foregoing that while particular forms of the invention have been illustrated and described, various modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
