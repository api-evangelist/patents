title: Travelogue-based travel route planning
abstract: A location extraction component analyzes a set of travelogues to identify locations mentioned therein. A co-occurrence extraction component computes co-occurrence values for the identified locations. When a request to generate a travel route from a starting location to an ending location is received, suggested locations on or near the travel route are identified through the use of the co-occurrence values. A suggested travel route is then generated that passes through the starting location, the ending location, and the suggested locations. A map may be displayed showing the starting location, the ending location, the suggested locations, and the suggested travel route.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Travelers frequently utilize World Wide Web (the \u201cWeb\u201d) sites to assist them with travel planning One of the most common uses of such Web sites is in identifying a driving route between a starting location and an ending location. Using such a site, a user provides the identities of the starting and ending locations. In turn, the Web site computes the shortest travel route between the two locations and provides the identified travel route to the user. Alternately, the Web site might compute the fastest travel route between the two locations using criteria such as whether the possible travel routes include highways, the speed limit for the roads on possible routes, and other factors.","Many travelers are only interested in the shortest or fastest travel route between two locations. Some travelers, however, are interested in learning about locations of interest that are on or near the shortest or fastest travel route between two locations. This type of traveler might be interested in learning about an alternative travel route that takes longer to drive than the shortest or fastest travel route if the alternative travel route includes locations of interest. Unfortunately, current Web sites and software-based travel tools do not provide such functionality. As a result, it can be difficult for travelers to identify locations of interest on or near a shortest or fastest travel route between two locations.","It is with respect to these and other considerations that the disclosure made herein is presented.","Concepts and technologies are described herein for travelogue-based travel route planning. Through an implementation of the concepts and technologies presented herein, functionality can be provided for assisting a user in planning a travel route that passes through a starting and ending location, and that also passes through or near popular points of interest. In this way, a traveler can easily and quickly identify a travel route that might be more interesting to travel than the shortest or fastest route.","According to one aspect presented herein, travelogues are utilized to identify locations along a shortest or fastest travel route between two locations that might be of interest to a traveler. Travelogues are textual descriptions of a person's experience with a particular location. For instance, a person might travel to New York City and write a travelogue that describes their travel experience. In addition to a description of the person's travel experience with a particular location, a travelogue might also include a description of the person's experience with other, related locations. As an example, a travelogue regarding New York City might also include information regarding other nearby locations, like Brooklyn. Such a travelogue might also include information regarding tourist attractions, restaurants, shopping destinations, and other locations in or near New York City.","The travelogues are first retrieved from a variety of travelogue sites and stored. For instance, travelogues might be retrieved from Web sites, Web forums, blog sites, social networking sites, and other types of sites. Once the travelogues have been obtained and stored, a location extraction component is executed that analyzes the travelogues to identify locations mentioned therein. The location extraction component might utilize a gazetteer containing location names in order to identify locations mentioned in the set of travelogues. For instance, the gazetteer might be utilized to identify possible name candidates, a classifier might then be utilized to identify location names from the candidates, and ambiguity resolution might then be performed to distinguish between different locations that have the same name.","After the locations mentioned in the set of travelogues have been identified, a co-occurrence extraction component is executed that computes co-occurrence values for the identified locations. Each co-occurrence value is an integer value that specifies the number of times two locations are mentioned in the same travelogue for the entire set of travelogues. Co-occurrence values are, therefore, computed for pairs of identified locations. The co-occurrence values are then stored for use in identifying suggested travel routes.","In one embodiment, a request is received to generate a travel route. For instance, a request may be received to generate a travel route from a starting location to an ending location. In response to receiving such a request, a first travel route is generated between the starting location and the ending location. The first travel route may be generated using a shortest path algorithm, a fastest path algorithm, or using another type of algorithm.","Once the first travel route has been generated, suggested locations on or near the first travel route are identified using the co-occurrence values. In particular, the suggested locations are identified in one embodiment by identifying locations on the first travel route. For each of the locations identified on the first travel route, one or more suggested locations are identified. The suggested locations are those locations having a non-zero co-occurrence value with the locations identified on the first travel route. The suggested locations may be filtered in order to eliminate those suggested locations that are more than a threshold distance away from the first travel route.","Once the suggested locations have been identified, a suggested travel route is computed that passes through the starting location, the ending location, and the suggested locations. In one implementation, the suggested travel route is computed utilizing a traveling salesman algorithm. Other algorithms may be utilized in other embodiments. In one embodiment, a map is displayed to a user that shows the starting location, the ending location, the suggested locations, and the suggested travel route.","It should be appreciated that the above-described subject matter might also be implemented as a computer-controlled apparatus, a computer process, a computing system, or as an article of manufacture such as a computer-readable storage medium.
