title: Method for finding range and bearing to underwater object
abstract: A method for localizing the range and bearing of a distant underwater object includes firing a preselected number of supercavitating projectiles sequentially from a firing location such that each projectile tracks along substantially the same trajectory. Supercavitating pellets are dispersed from a projectile at a pre-selected range. Acoustic signals are sensed to detect acoustic signals caused by supercavitating pellet impact with an object. These signals can be processed to determine the range and bearing to the object. In further steps the range and bearing can be used to aim the projectiles.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application is a divisional of pending prior U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/560,528 filed on 16 Sep. 2009 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,975,614 and claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7121 of the prior application's filing date.","The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","(1) Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a high velocity acoustic shotgun system and more particularly to a method and apparatus for dispersing a plurality of relatively small, supercavitating projectiles in the water over a wide spatial field at long ranges from an underwater gun or surface gun.","(2) Description of the Prior Art","One major technical challenge related to employing supercavitating projectiles against targets is the need to accurately determine the location of a target object when it is positioned at a substantial distance from the launch device. Even small errors in the target bearing solution will result in a miss of the object. To overcome this known problem, multiple rounds of projectiles have usually been fired in bursts. Firing projectiles in bursts, however, necessitates using rapid firing rates and also requires the use of copious amount of ammunition. In addition, the mechanical design of such a gun system becomes much more complex and the utility of the gun system accordingly is more limited.","A second problem common to supercavitating projectiles is the configuration of the projectile itself. The primary design choice involves making tradeoffs between using heavier projectiles which generally result in increased range, or using lighter initially higher velocity projectiles that slow down more rapidly and are thus range limited. For a particular system to be effective a critical projectile speed and mass must be selected in order to neutralize a target at a given range.","In addition to the two projectile related difficulties described above, another obstacle encountered by rapid mine clearance systems is the obtaining of a reliable indication that the mine has in fact been disabled. The existing approach to resolving this quandary requires the use of scuba divers or deployment of a remote camera. In either of these cases the mine disablement confirmation often turns into a tedious, time consuming process.","What is needed is a way to overcome the inherent problems associated with long range gun system accuracy, projectile mass and velocity design choice considerations, and mine system clearance verification difficulties by providing a means for accurately dispersing multiple projectiles at significant range while providing a reliable acoustic means to detect target impacts thereby and either indicate an object's presence in particular volume or lack thereof.","Accordingly, it is a general purpose and object of the present invention to provide a system employing supercavitating projectiles operating so as to allow efficient mine clearance or platform self defense at a great distance from a launch platform.","It is a further object that the above general object is accomplished using a two stage high speed supercavitating projectile with a traditional first stage and a second stage having a plurality of small pellet like projectiles capable of simultaneous dispersal at supercavitation speed when the first stage projectile nears its maximum range.","A still further object is that both the first stage projectile and the plurality of second stage pellets be entrained in vaporous cavities owing to the supercavitation effect of high speed motion.","Still another object is to utilize the distinctive noise signatures produced by suddenly collapsing vaporous cavities about the second stage pellets upon solid object impact in conjunction with an underwater acoustic targeting system to detect and track target objects.","These objects are accomplished with the present invention by providing a high velocity, acoustic signal producing underwater shotgun system that disperses a plurality of relatively small supercavitating projectiles over a wide spatial field at a long distance from the shotgun. The system relies upon the dynamics of cavity collapse for better target localization in underwater mine clearance operations. To reach this objective, a typical single stage supercavitating projectile design is enhanced to produce a two-staged projectile. The first stage of the two stage design allows for the long range firing underwater typical of a supercavitating projectile while the second stage permits the coverage of a wide area with a plurality of small supercavitating projectiles just as the first stage projectile reaches its fixed supercavitation range limit. A distinctive acoustic feature of the radiated noise from a supercavitating projectile impacting a solid object is used in conjunction with the two stage projectile design to provide a system for underwater mine clearance verification. This distinctive noise signal may also be used in conjunction with an underwater targeting system to help identify, localize and track targets as well.","Accordingly, there is described a method for localizing the range and bearing of a distant underwater object includes firing a preselected number of supercavitating projectiles sequentially from a firing location such that each projectile tracks along substantially the same trajectory. Supercavitating pellets are dispersed from a projectile at a pre-selected range. Acoustic signals are sensed to detect acoustic signals caused by supercavitating pellet impact with an object. These signals can be processed to determine the range and bearing to the object. In further steps the range and bearing can be used to aim the projectiles.","Accurate localization of underwater targets is a major technical challenge for a variety of underwater systems. Target identification usually relies on the transmission of an acoustic signal from a fixed location and processing of a return echo at that same location. This invention in its most basic form uses a supercavitating projectile fired from a fixed location to produce a radiated acoustic signal upon impact at the location of the targeted object. The radiated acoustic signal either has greater amplitude or is easier to characterize than would be a signal transmitted from the receiver location. Previous approaches used the noise generated by a prior art projectile supercavity as a traveling noise source. This invention uses the dynamics of cavity collapse to produce a much greater radiated noise signature and in so doing producing much better target localization information.","A series of experiments were performed to quantify the radiated noise signature from underwater projectiles. The experiments showed that cavity collapse dynamics produced unique characteristic signatures. The present invention modifies the basic supercavitating projectile design to greatly enhance the production of those unique characteristics. Having incorporated these features into the projectile design, a \u201cstaged acoustic shotgun tracer bullet\u201d has been created. This projectile may then be used in an existing gun to augment targeting. Thus, as in the case of an in-air tracer bullet, some of the novel projectiles may be used in a rapid-fire gun configuration to localize the proximity of the standard projectile stream on the intended target.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","12","14","14","16","12","18","18","14","12","14","20","14","12","20","12","22","12","22","12","16","12","12"]},"The supercavity so formed terminates in a cavity closure region aft of the projectile. The cavity closure region is usually well defined spatially but is not steady. Quasi-steady rupture of the cavity closure region produces a trail of small water vapor bubbles behind the closure point. The bubbles in the wake ultimately collapse to produce a large amplitude radiated acoustic signature. The entire grouping of cavitator tip , near stable supercavity and trailing collapsing bubble cloud advects through the water at the speed of the cavitator tip. The radiated signal from the supercavitating projectile  is very predictable for a wide range of projectile geometries and subsonic speeds.","A projectile's supercavity tends to be upwards of 20 feet long. The usual major source of noise that the supercavity produces is from the collapsing bubbles in the wake of the supercavity. The supercavity itself acts to baffle noise propagating in the forward direction in the vicinity of the projectile trajectory. This baffling of the forward propagating sound and the time delay associated with the cavity length explains the main features of the typical projectile's radiated noise signature.","When a projectile strikes an object however, the cavity collapse continues to proceed from well aft of the projectile strike toward the impact location. Note that a premature cavity collapse produces acoustic noise that is significantly higher in amplitude than a non-impact collapse. Thus, if a supercavitating projectile strikes an object, a characteristic pulse of approximately 5 ms duration is observed at the impact location. The time delay in when that pulse is observed is a function of supercavity length and projectile speed. Similar signals have been associated with different sized projectiles including small pellet-like projectiles.","The preferred embodiment of the present inventive system, generally identified as , is shown in . System  includes a gun barrel , a propellant charge , a projectile further generally identified as , a pusher  and sabots . Projectile  includes an elongated cylindrical structure  having a concave surface , a combustion chamber  at the forward end of structure  containing a small explosive charge, a cavitator tip  forward of chamber , a convex outer foam cover  extending from the aft end of structure  to the forward end of tip , a core region fuse  passing through a central aperture  in structure  and into chamber , an interior volume  created between the concave surface of structure  and the interior surface of convex cover , and a plurality of pellets  filling interior volume . Core region fuse  is constructed of a flammable material. Fuse  also passes through an aperture  in pusher  and into charge . Upon launch command the flammable propellant charge  in barrel  is ignited. Combustion of the propellant charge  further causes a flame front to move in a timed manner along fuse  from the projectile aft section through aperture  in pusher  and on through aperture  in concave structure  into combustion chamber . As the flame front reaches small combustion chamber  near the end of the projectile's expected travel, a small explosion occurs. The explosion causes cavitator tip  to separate from projectile  and permits the external water flow to contact convex foam cover . Foam cover  is ripped away from the projectile by the water exposing interior volume . Interior volume  contains the large number of shotgun-like pellets , which then disperse over a wide area. These pellets can be similar to conventional shotgun pellets. Due to the high initial pellet velocity at the time of cavitator tip  ejection, a small supercavity will envelop each pellet. The rate of flame front propagation from charge  to combustion chamber  will determine the range from the gun barrel where pellet separation takes place. The overall design of the shotgun projectile is shown to fit substantially within the same gun barrel volume as did the prior art projectile.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["140","142","12","102","144","12","140","146","140","148","150","102","152","154"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"],"b":["160","162"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["200","144","202","200","144","202","204","206","206","204","204","204","208","144","204","210","202","212"],"i":["i","i","i"]},"The primary advantages of the acoustic shotgun system are many and varied including: the ability to produce a pattern of supercavitating projectiles over a wide area from a single round; the ability to control the dispersion area; the ability to control the range over which this dispersion occurs; the ability to accurately determine projectile misses and hits; the means to produce a targeting solution and firing that minimizes the effects of single projectile dispersion; the use of cavity collapse upon impact to produce radiated projectile noise; the ability to operate in an existing gun system; improved ability to cover a larger volume with supercavitating projectiles; improved determination of the track of an underwater object; the ability to detect supercavitating projectile impacts; better resolution of underwater objects and tracks in poor acoustic environments; more efficient mine clearance operation; better ability to engage multiple targets; and, more efficient use of projectile volume and hence improved overall gun system efficiency.","What has thus been described is a system of supercavitating projectiles and operating procedures that enable efficient mine clearance or platform self defense at great distance from a launch platform.
