No. 10\/758,767, filed Jan. 16, 2004.","This application is related to U.S. Pat. No. 7,126,017 issued on Oct. 24, 2006.","Not applicable.","Natural and synthetic retinoid compounds have been used to treat a variety of hyperproliferative skin disorders as well as other skin disorders including, for example, acne, psoriasis, wrinkling, sun-damaged skin, and age spots. (See Fox L P et al., & , Section XIII-Dermatology, 11th Ed.) In many cases, retinoids have been applied topically. Retinoic acid has also been administered orally to treat severe cases of acne. For example, Accutane\u00ae contains 13-cis-retinoic acid, also referred to as isotretinoin, which is related to both retinoic acid and retinol, i.e., vitamin A. (See p. 1288-1289, 21Ed.). Accutane\u00ae has been approved for treating nodular acne by administering oral pharmacologic dosages of 0.5 to 2.0 mg\/kg\/day which inhibits sebaceous gland function and keratinization.","Retinoids are natural and synthetic compounds that are structurally related to vitamin A. All-trans retinol is the major circulating form of vitamin A. It is oxidized in the body: first to all-trans retinaldehyde, and then to all-trans retinoic acid (atRA). (Blomhoff et al., 199212:37-57; and, Moise et al., 200746:4449-4458). atRA is the functional form of the vitamin that regulates growth, cellular differentiation, and embryonic development, whereas all-trans retinaldehyde functions in the visual cycle. (Clagett-Dame et al., 200222:347-381). Because atRA is such a potent regulatory molecule, it is formed in very small amounts, and it is rapidly metabolized such that its half-life is relatively short. (Roberts et al., 1967102:600-605).","Systemic administration of retinoids has also been indicated for diseases such as pityriasis, rubra pilaris, condylomata accuminata, skin cancers, rosacea, hidradenitis, suppurativa, granuloma annular, lupus erythematosus and lichen planus. (Akyol M et al., 20066(3), 175-184).","Topical administration of retinoids has been limited largely due to side effects such as skin irritation (e.g., redness and burning), dryness and photosensitivity reactions. (Akhavan et al., 20034:473-492). Oral administration of retinoids has been even more limited due to more serious side effects such as teratogenicity (e.g., fetal malformation), elevation of triglyceride, cholesterol, and transaminase levels, bone demineralization, and other side effects associated with topical administration (e.g., drying of mucosal membranes and photosensitivity). (Armstrong et al., 1994, pp. 545-572; and, DiGiovanna, 200145:S176-S182). Such numerous and varied sided effects have substantially limited the medical and pharmaceutical use of retinoids, particularly those related to skin therapies.","It is believed that retinoic acid and other synthetic retinoids bind to and regulate the transcriptional activity of a family of nuclear proteins known as the retinoic acid receptors (\u201cRARs\u201d). (Chambon, 199610:940-954; Clagett-Dame et al., 19977:299-342; and, Mark et al., 200646:451-480). All-trans-retinoic acid is the endogenous ligand for the RAR family of receptors. The 13-cis retinoic acid isomer does not bind to the RARs. (Repa J J et al., 199390:7293-7297). The 13-cis retinoic acid isomer must isomerize to all-trans-retinoic acid that is active in terms of receptor binding and activation.","It has been reported that the active hormonal form of vitamin D (i.e., calcitriol) and various synthetic analogs thereof demonstrate differentiative, antiproliferative and immunomodulatory activity. Such compounds have also demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in treating skin disease such as psoriasis. (See Smith E L et al, 198819, 516-528; and Holick, M F, 1989125, 1692-1697). It is also been reported that calcitriol and therapeutic analogs thereof are used to target the nuclear vitamin D receptor. (DeLuca H F, 2004. (Suppl) 1689S-1696S). It is believed that calcitriol and therapeutic analogs thereof may act directly within the epidermis on basal keratinocytes and Langerhans cells as well as on other cells within the immune system. The use of calcitriol and various synthetic analogs at therapeutic dosages is further limited by side effects such as hypercalcemia, hypercalcuria and calcification of soft tissues.","Recently, a new class of vitamin D analogs, referred to as 19-nor vitamin D compounds, has been discovered. 19-Nor vitamin D compounds are characterized by replacement of the A-ring exocyclic methylene group at the 19 carbon (in typical vitamin D molecules) with two hydrogens. Further substitution at the 2-position and\/or modification of the side chain at 17 carbon of the five-membered ring has yielded pharmacologically active compounds that are much less calcemic at physiologically active concentrations as compared to the native hormone. (Plum, L. A. et al., 101(18), 6900-9004 (2004)). Some 19-nor-containing vitamin D analogs have also exhibited enhanced potency and tissue selectivity activities suggesting that such analogs may have important therapeutic advantages over the native vitamin D hormone or other less-selective and\/or non-selective analogs. (See Sicinski R R et al., 1998, 41, 4662-4674; and, Shevde N K et al., 200299(21), 13487-13491).","Acne is a condition of the pilosebaceous unit. Acne involves a spectrum of effects including non-inflammatory comedones, inflammatory papules, pustules and cysts. When administered topically or systemically, retinoids cause epidermal hyperproliferation leading to comedolysis and improvement of the disease. (See Fisher G J et al., 1996, Molecular Mechanisms of Retinoid Actions in the Skin, 10:1002:21013). Although very effective, retinoid therapy is substantially limited by the number and extent of side effects, which are particularly limiting when retinoids are administered orally. (See Fox L P et al., 2006). Thus, there is an important and substantial need for retinoid-containing therapies having reduced side effects to treat various skin disorders such as acne.","One aspect of the invention is a topical dosage form composition comprising a therapeutically effective dose of an active pharmaceutical ingredient containing a 19-nor-containing vitamin D compound, a stereoisomer thereof, a salt thereof or a solute thereof, and, a pharmaceutically suitable topical carrier system.","In an exemplary embodiment of the topical dosage form composition, the 19-nor-containing vitamin D compound is one of the

The synergistic effect is evidenced by a substantial reduction in comedone size as compared to vehicle alone, 2MBisP alone or atRA alone. The synergistic effect is further evidenced by a substantial reduction in comedone size upon administering atRA at a low and previously-ineffective dose. By rendering such a low and previously-ineffective atRA dose now effective, potential side effects caused by administration of atRA can be minimized or avoided.","Animals and dose administration. Rhino mice 6-10 weeks old were dosed via the oral and\/or topical route. In the majority of studies, the mice were dosed daily. In one topical study, the efficacy of daily versus intermittent (Monday\/Wednesday\/Friday) dosing was compared. The mice were weighed three times per week and doses were adjusted weekly based on body weight. The topical formulations were applied to the back of the animal in a maximum volume of 110 \u03bcL. The topical formulations were made by mixing the APIs with a topical carrier comprising 70 vol % propylene glycol and 30 vol % ethanol or 30 vol % propylene glycol and 70 vol % ethanol, as indicated. The topical vehicle control was the vehicle carrier solution matched to the formulation containing API and vehicle carrier.","The oral formulation was made by mixing the APIs with Wesson\u00ae soybean oil or NeoBee\u00ae oil. The oral dose was delivered to the back of the mouth of each mouse. Mice were sacrificed 4 hours after the final oral dose and 72 hours after the final topical dose. At sacrifice, the dorsal skin was collected for histological studies.","Comedolytic effect. The extent of the comedolytic effect (i.e., efficacy) was assessed by measuring the average area of the comedones, whereby the smaller the area, the larger the effect. The comedone area was determined by histological analysis of tissue sections based on a method developed in our lab (see ). Skin was fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 deg. C. with gentle agitation and dehydrated the next day into 100% methanol. Samples were embedded in paraffin and a total of nine 10 micron sections 150 microns apart were prepared from each Rhino mouse. Five of the nine sections were digitally imaged (6\u00d7 magnification) for comedone analysis using Metamorph Imaging Software (trace function). The perimeter of each comedone on the images taken from the 5 sections was then traced using a Wacom Intuos 3 Graphics Tablet interfaced with the software. The number of pixels comprising the area of each individual comedone was obtained and transferred to an Excel spreadsheet, and the mean number of pixels per comedone was obtained for each Rhino mouse. For comedones that were completely healed (area=0) a pixel value approaching 0 (<10) was entered into the spreadsheet. The individual comedone area average for each mouse was then used to calculate the treatment group mean. Results in the figures are expressed in terms of mean\u00b1standard error of the mean.","Preparation of oral dosing solutions containing 2MBisP, CAGE-3, 24R-2MD, VitIII (17-20E) and NEL. Separate concentrated stocks of 2MBisP, CAGE-3, 24R-2MD, VitIII (17-20E) and NEL were obtained in ethanol. The concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using a molar extinction coefficient=42,000 and a \u03bb=252.7. Oral dosing solutions were prepared by adding the appropriate volume of the ethanolic solution to oil (NeoBee\u00ae or Wesson\u00ae) whereby the final concentration of ethanol does not exceed 5 vol %. The final dose was delivered in \u226650 \u03bcL of oil.","Preparation of topical formulations containing 2MBisP, CAGE-3, 24R-2MD, VitIII (17-20E), NEL, VD-03, 2MPregna, 2MP, 20R-2MBisP, 2MTrisP, FF-44, FF-55, and HPBS. Separate concentrated ethanolic stocks of 2MBisP, CAGE-3, 24R-2MD, VitIII (17-20E) and NEL were diluted to a final concentration containing 70 vol % propylene glycol and 30 vol % ethanol or 30 vol % propylene glycol and 70 vol % ethanol as the excipient carrier system. The mixture was thoroughly mixed. The topical dosing formulation delivered the desired dosing amount of drug on a per kilogram body weight basis. A dose ranging from 100-110 \u03bcL in volume was administered to the back of the mouse. An average weight of 24 or 30 g\/mouse was assumed in dose volume calculations. Dosing volumes were adjusted weekly to deliver the desired dosing amount of API based on the body weight of each individual animal.","Preparation of oral atRA dosing formulation. A concentrated stock solution containing atRA was prepared in dichloromethane. The atRA concentrated stock solution was diluted into ethanol. The concentration of atRA in that diluted stock solution was determined spectrophotometrically, whereby the molar extinction coefficient=45,200 and \u03bb=350. The purity of atRA was determined to be >99% by HPLC. The appropriate volume of atRA was added to Wesson\u00ae Oil, the sample was mixed, and the residual dichloromethane was removed by flushing the oil with argon for 3 hours under a vapor hood. The final dose was delivered orally using \u226650 \u03bcL of oil.","Methods. Animals and dose administration. Rhino mice 6-10 weeks old were dosed via the oral route. The mice were dosed daily. The mice were weighed three times per week and doses were adjusted weekly based on body weight. The oral formulation was made by mixing the APIs with Wesson\u00ae soybean oil. The oral dose was delivered to the back of the mouth of each mouse. Mice were sacrificed 4 hours after the final oral dose.
