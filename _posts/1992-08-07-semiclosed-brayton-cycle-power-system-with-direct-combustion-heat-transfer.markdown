title: Semiclosed Brayton cycle power system with direct combustion heat transfer
abstract: A semiclosed diesel fueled Brayton cycle power system is provided using COand steam as the working fluid. Combustion occurs in a combustor between diesel fuel and Owith COpresent as a diluent. During combustion, a heated, high pressure working fluid of COand steam is formed. The heated working fluid is expanded in a turbine and power is withdrawn from the fluid. The fluid is then used in a regenerator to heat cooler, compressed CObefore the compressed COis transferred to the combustor. The expanded working fluid is cooled conventionally by seawater in a cooler, condensing steam in the working fluid to water. The water is separated from the gaseous CO. The gaseous COis recycled, and the water is used to backfill the system's diesel fuel tank.

No. 07\/926,116, filed 7 Aug. 1992, Closed Brayton Cycle Direct Contact Reactor\/Storage Tank with Chemical Scrubber, Ser.

No. 07\/926,199, filed 7 Aug. 1992.","(1) Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a system and a process for providing power using a semiclosed Brayton cycle with direct heat transfer. More particularly the invention relates to a diesel fueled Brayton cycle system and process using COas a major portion of the working fluid. This system is of particular use in torpedo and unmanned underwater vehicle propulsion systems.","(2) Description of the Prior Art","Current underwater propulsion systems are typically closed Rankine cycle power systems utilizing lithium as a fuel, a chlorofluorocarbon as an oxidant, and water as a working fluid. In a Rankine system, the working fluid is compressed, heated until vaporization, and then expanded through a turbine to produce power. Upon exiting the turbine, the low pressure vapor is condensed to a liquid, and the cycle is repeated. In a typical underwater propulsion system the working fluid is heated as it passes through heat transfer tubes that are wrapped to form a cylindrical annulus within the system's heat exchanger. The center of the cylinder contains liquid metal fuel to heat the working fluid carried by the heat transfer tubes. The working fluid, water, and the liquid metal fuel, lithium, react chemically with one another; therefore, a leak in the heat transfer tubes causes a violent reaction which generates a significant amount of heat and gas resulting in failure of the heat exchanger and the underwater device. Furthermore, should a leak occur in a land based system, the system will release a toxic cloud of LiOH into the environment. Other problems associated with the Rankine cycle include noise generation during the phase change of the working fluid, severe stress of the oxidant injectors due to high reaction zone temperatures, and slow start up time.","An alternative to the closed cycle Rankine power system is a closed or semiclosed Brayton cycle system. In a Brayton cycle, there is no phase change and accordingly, no noise associated therewith. The Brayton cycle is also more efficient than the Rankine cycle despite the fact that more energy is required to compress a gas than to pump an equivalent mass of liquid. Underwater propulsion systems cannot use prior art Brayton cycle systems because the components of the Brayton cycle, principally the conventional Brayton heat exchanger, will not fit in the restricted space available in underwater vehicles.","A compact heat exchanger can be made by increasing gas velocity through the heat exchanger to achieve higher heat transfer coefficients; however, this results in greater heat exchanger pressure drop. Increasing gas velocity is used successfully in Rankine cycle systems because pump power is a small fraction of gross power (1\/50) and pump losses are small by comparison. Accordingly, there is no significant reduction in cycle efficiency. In the Brayton cycle, however, compressor power is typically a large part of the gross power (1\/2); therefore, small increases in gas velocity and heater pressure drop reduce the Brayton cycle efficiency below that of the Rankine cycle.","My other listed inventions with which this application is copending relate to direct contact closed Brayton cycle power systems using liquid metal fuel. The size and weight penalty of the Brayton's hot side heat exchanger is eliminated by direct contact heat transfer between the working fluid which is an inert gas such as helium, argon, xenon, or a mixture of inert gases, and a liquid metal bath of a material such as lithium, sodium, potassium, aluminum, magnesium, or an alloy.","Accordingly, it is a general purpose and object of the present invention to provide an improved Brayton cycle power system. A further object of this invention is that the system be compact and capable of higher power densities than the molten metal versions and have the added advantage of burning a hydrocarbon fuel with oxygen.","These and other objects are accomplished with the present invention by providing a semiclosed system utilizing a Brayton cycle. In this invention, combustion occurs in a combustor between diesel fuel and Owith COpresent. During combustion, a heated, high pressure working fluid composed of COand steam is formed. The heated working fluid is expanded in a turbine and then used in a regenerator to heat the cooler, compressed CObefore the COis transferred to the combustor. The expanded working fluid is cooled by a cooler using seawater, condensing steam in the working fluid to water. The gaseous COrecycles to the compressor, and the water is used to backfill the system's diesel fuel tank.","Referring now to  there is shown a semiclosed Brayton cycle power system . System  has a storage tank\/separator  containing COand water . COis separated from the water, compressed in a compressor , and transported to a regenerator  wherein the gas is partially heated. Upon exit from regenerator  the partially heated COis mixed with Ofrom Osource  by mixing valve . The resulting gas mixture is transported to a combustor . Diesel fuel from diesel fuel tank  is also transported to combustor  via fuel control valve . Combustion of diesel fuel and oxygen occurs in combustor  by conventional means. The COmixed with oxygen acts to reduce the combustion temperature and prevent damage to combustor . Combustion results in the formation of a steam and COworking fluid. The steam\/COworking fluid is communicated to a turbine  where the working fluid is expanded, driving output shaft . Output shaft  is mechanically connected to drive compressor  and auxiliary compressor . Shaft extension allows power to be withdrawn from system . The mechanical connection between turbine  and auxiliary compressor  is symbolically shown by dashed line . The steam\/COworking fluid after being expanded in turbine  is routed to regenerator . The expanded working fluid preheats the compressed COin regenerator  as mentioned previously. Regenerator  operates by conventional means. There is no direct contact in regenerator  between the COfrom compressor  and the working fluid mixture of steam and CO. The steam and COworking fluid is then transmitted to a cooler\/condenser  and cooled by large amounts of cold seawater from the environment passing through cooler\/condenser  and thereby causing condensation of steam in the working fluid to water. The seawater passing through cooler\/condenser  is discharged to the environment by overboard discharge . The cooled working fluid consisting of gaseous COwith entrained water droplets then passes to separator\/storage tank  to separate the water from the CO. A backfill pump  pumps water from separator\/storage tank  to diesel fuel tank  to backfill diesel fuel tank . The water is kept separate from the diesel fuel in tank  by a membrane or baffles . The COremaining is routed back to compressor  inlet.","As with any Brayton propulsion system speed and power are regulated by adding or removing mass from the system. Auxiliary compressor  is available to remove compressed COfrom compressor  discharge and forward the COto an accumulator  through an accumulator input valve . Optionally, accumulator  is cooled by exposure to the environment allowing the COto liquefy. The COwithin the system liquefies at 1073 psi and 88\u00b0 F. Periodically, an excess COpump  can discharge excess COfrom accumulator  to the environment via overboard discharge . Accumulator output valve  expands the accumulated COand allows the accumulated COto be added to compressor . For most power levels and depths of operation, neither auxiliary compressor  nor excess COpump  is required.","There has therefore been described a new direct contact Brayton power system that utilizes exhaust COas the working fluid. Because of its use of hydrocarbon fuel, torpedo room refueling of a recovered underwater vehicle is possible. Eliminating the liquid metal fuels of previous designs reduces environmental hazards and increases community acceptance. This approach has the advantage of high power levels because the hot side heat exchanger is eliminated by the use of combustion by-products as the working fluid. The direct contact combustion of diesel fuel and Ois a highly developed low risk technology. Very high temperatures are now easily achieved resulting in improved cycle efficiency.","It will be understood that various changes in the details, materials, steps and arrangement of parts, which have been herein described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention, may be made by those skilled in the art within the principle and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["A more complete understanding of the invention and many of the attendant advantages thereto will be readily appreciated as the invention becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawing wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
