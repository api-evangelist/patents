title: Interactive voice access and retrieval of information
abstract: A system is responsive to voice commands and requests from a user to access and search distributed data resources. The system may include a speech recognition engine configured to receive a spoken command from the user. A processor is configured to identify a service requested by the user from the spoken command. A search engine is configured to associate the user with other services providing offerings available to the user. A speech synthesizer provides an output to the user that conveys the requested information. The processor may be configured to respond to a spoken selection made by the user to selectively provide the requested information and the offerings to the user. The speech synthesizer is responsive to the processor for converting the information retrieved from the selected service in a format that is audible to the user.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/054,460, filed May 19, 2008, entitled \u201cSystem, Method and Computer Program Product for Interactive Voice Access and Retrieval of information,\u201d the disclosure of which is expressly incorporated by reference herein in it's entirety.","The present disclosure relates generally to automatic notification systems, and more particularly to automatic notification systems that provide voice interaction.","Various conventional platforms provide textual interaction with multiple information databanks. However, physical inability and multitasking have increasingly dictated the use of hands-free systems, such as voice response systems. While conventional resources such as the Internet (or World Wide Web) have provided users with a ready access to a wide array of information, accessing such information has conventionally required text-based queries. Similarly, other services accessible either through the Internet or from other sources generally require a user to interface using text based, key-stroke commands. While voice response interfaces are available (e.g., subscriber's voice mail system), robust capabilities for information access is desirable. Furthermore, existing voice response interfaces are limited to a particular function, and are not readily adaptable to a user's information requirements. As society becomes more mobile (i.e., access to wireless communication) and more dependent on instantaneous dissemination of information, notification of important information with the ability to confirm receipt of the information using voice response is desirable.","For example, emergency responders (e.g., firefighters, search-and-rescue teams, or others) need to be contacted immediately to see who is nearby and available. Conventionally, such life-critical dispatching operations are left to human operators. Human operators contact the appropriate person and determine whether that person can respond to the emergency. However, human operators conventionally receive hundreds of phone calls with different emergencies that make it difficult to reach an emergency responder efficiently.","In other instances, conventional notification systems inform a user when an electronic mail (\u201ce-mail\u201d) message was received and allows the user to read the message. Some conventional notification devices provide services that send stock updates, sport scores, weather alerts, traffic updates or other variable information to text-compatible communication devices. However, the message may not arrive to the intended recipient, because people can forget to carry their communication devices with them, or the communication devices can fail for any variety of reasons. Conventional services can determine whether the communication device received the notification, but ensuring that the intended recipient received the notification is desirable.","In still other instances, a recipient can very quickly be inundated with information that the recipient is not interested in. Conventional automated notification systems notify the recipient of all e-mail (e.g., on a store and forward basis) regardless of whether the message is unsolicited (\u201cspam\u201d) or an expected message. Sorting through the unwanted messages with greater efficiency is desirable.","In some conventional approaches of communication, a user carries multiple communication devices. The user communicates with a combination of devices, such as a pager, a mobile telephone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a two-way communication device (e.g., BLACKBERRY\u00ae), or others. However, having multiple communication devices makes it difficult to maintain each device in operating condition and affordable communication service.","In other conventional approaches, text-to-speech (TTS) technology provides users the ability to retrieve e-mail messages over the telephone by reading a text message to the user. However, the user must call in and sift through all the messages in the user's voice mailbox, so informing the user when a message has arrived is desirable.","Thus, what is needed is a solution for using voice-based communication to reduce dependency of text-based communication and increase assurance of information reaching recipients. The solution should permit interactive voice access and retrieval of information without the limitations of conventional techniques.","The present disclosure is directed to interactive voice access and retrieval of information that reduces the dependency of text-based communication. In one embodiment, a method of providing an audible notification to a user is disclosed. The method includes receiving configuration data from the user. The configuration data is then used to define a rule set that specifies the audible notification to be sent to the user. At least one service is identified from the rule set that provides selected information by the user and at least one other service that provides offerings associated with the rule set. The method then monitors a network to sense a change in the selected information. The audible notification is then generated to notify the user about the change in the selected information. Finally, the offerings are announced to the user, which are received from at least one other service.","In another embodiment, a method of interacting with a user using audible notifications is disclosed. The method includes receiving configuration data from the user to establish a rule set that handles the audible notifications to the user. The rule set is then used to identify services that provide access to selected information by the user. An information network is then monitored to access the services identified by the rule set. A trigger is generated to sense a change in the selected information. An audible notification is then generated to inform the user of the change in the selected information. The audible notification is then sent with instructions defined by the rule set. At least one other service connected to the information network is monitored to provide an offering to the user. The user is then provided an option to listen to the offering further. Finally, a verbal response is retrieved from the user to confirm live communication with the user.","In still another embodiment, a method of obtaining information from a user using audible interaction is disclosed. The method includes detecting a voice connection with the user. The user is then prompted to enter configuration data with selected information to be retrieved from at least one service connected to a network. The network is then monitored to sense a change in the selected information. The network is then searched to identify at least one other service that provides an offering to be previewed by the user. The selected information retrieved from the network in a first format is then converted to a second format. The second format is audible to the user. The user is then notified with an audible notification of the change in the selected information. A preview of the offering is then provided in the audible notification that is sent to the user. Finally, the user is then provided an option within the audible notification to choose to listen the change in the selected information and the offering in their entirety.","In yet another embodiment, a system for interacting audibly with a user to provide the user access to information on a network is disclosed. The system includes a speech recognition engine that is configured to receive verbal commands from a user. A search engine is configured to identify a first service having information selected by the user and a second service with content associated with the user. The search engine is further configured to retrieve the information and content in a first format as determined by a verbal selection made by the user. A speech processor is configured to translate the verbal commands into a rule set that determines audible notifications to be sent to the user. The speech processor is responsive to the verbal selection. Finally, a speech synthesizer is coupled to the speech processor to determine an audible announcement defined by the rule set to send to the user notifying about a change in the information selected by the user and about an offering from the second service. The speech synthesizer is further configured to convert the information and the content in the first format to a second format.","The foregoing has outlined rather broadly the features and technical advantages of the present disclosure in order that the detailed description that follows may be better understood. Additional features and advantages will be described hereinafter which form the subject of the claims of the disclosure. It should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the conception and specific embodiments disclosed may be readily utilized as a basis for modifying or designing other structures for carrying out the same purposes of the present disclosure. It should also be realized by those skilled in the art that such equivalent constructions do not depart from the technology of the disclosure as set forth in the appended claims. The novel features which are believed to be characteristic of the disclosure, both as to its organization and method of operation, together with further objects and advantages will be better understood from the following description when considered in connection with the accompanying figures.

In another embodiment, the notifier  can provide notifications or alerts related to scheduled event generators and unscheduled event generators . In still another embodiment, triggers generated by event listener  can also detect calendar events and scheduled broadcasts . In still other embodiments, other triggers can detect a pager alert , e-mail message , stock quotes , traffic alerts , weather alerts , \u201cAmber\u201d alerts , homeland security advisories , voice mail message , fax message , online auction bid alerts , or other unscheduled events.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIGS. 1 and 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 3","FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["110","302","304","300","110","304","108","108","106","106","228","228","110","300","110","110","112","112","110","304","108","214","108","108","110","302","110","108","108","220","104","204","306","302","204","308","308","218","308","308","106","312","312","312"],"i":["a","c","c","h ","a ","b","a ","b ","a ","a","b ","c"]},"In some examples, one of the pollers and can detect activity from event generators  such as receipt of an e-mail message . The poller that detected the received email message updates the event database  with the email notification, which may include storing the email contents as well. The event listener  can compare the e-mail message against the user notification rules  which can be stored in the event database . In other embodiments, the event generators  may be stored remote from the event database , but may be triggered by an external source, such as traffic alerts or a weather alerts . The event database  can store information about the event generators , and the information stored can be searched to find event generators that match the user notification rules . The notifier  can query the event database . For example, when an event generator from event generators  is matched to a rule of the user notification rules , then the notifier  can provide a voice recognition unit  with information of the event. The voice recognition unit  can then call the user  at the number specified by a notification configuration module  or the rule of the user notification rules . In other embodiments, the notification configuration module  can provide direction or control as to how the event may be provided to the user  by phone. Also, the voice recognition unit  can interact with the user  by having the user  respond to a prompt or verbal request to confirm that a person instead of an answering machine has answered the phone call. During the interaction between the voice recognition unit  and the user , the voice recognition unit  may request that the user  authenticate themselves. In another embodiment, a \u201cTuring Test\u201d can be presented to the user  visually or verbally in order to validate that the user  received the event notification first hand. When responses from the user  are deemed satisfactory, the voice recognition unit  can then proceed to transform text into verbal information about a first event intended for the user. The event database  can then be updated to reflect a status showing that the event notification or actual message was delivered to or retrieved by the user . In still other embodiments, interaction with that user  can be extended to include actions by the notification system  where such actions may include inserting bids based on online auction bid alerts , perform stock transactions based on stock quotes ",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIGS. 1 through 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["400","310","402","310","218","104","404","310","110","108","314","316","406","112","310","110","318","408","310","310","410","410","110","218","322","110","412","218","214","110"]},"If user input is detected at block , then the voice recognition unit  may prompt the user  for authentication information in block  such as, including but not limited to, a personal identification number (PIN) typed into the keypad of mobile phone , a spoken word, or spoken phrase identifying the user. If the provided user authentication information is determined to be invalid in block , then the user  can be prompted for the authentication information again in block  by repeating block  through block  until the authentication information is determined to be valid. The call can terminate in block . If the user  is unable to authenticate him or herself, then the voice recognition unit  can hang up the call as depicted in block .","The voice recognition unit  can attempt to reach the user  later for as many times as the user  has configured the notification configuration module  for retries. A failed recognition can be counted as one attempt to notify the user . The notifier  can have the flexibility to provide the user  an option to call back at the phone number  to check in with the system.","When authentication is valid in block , the user  can be informed of the notification event as shown in block . In one embodiment, information about the event including subject matter and sender information at block  can be spoken to the user . In block , the voice recognition unit  can wait for an input from the user . In some embodiments, the user  can interact with the voice recognition unit  by choosing to listen to the event information, skipping the event information, proceeding to the next event information, or hanging up the call. If the user  chooses to listen to information about an event, additional inputs from the user  can be entered at any time during the call. In another embodiment, a call can be managed by call flow manager . For example, the user  can choose an action that saves, replays, deletes, skips, replies, proceeds, or signs off from the system while the event is playing. When user input is detected (or received) in block , the voice recognition unit  can respond appropriately in block  and block  as necessary to speak about additional event information. At the end of the event, the voice recognition unit  can continue to wait for additional user inputs in block  until there are no more events to narrate to the user  as determined in block . When there are no more events, the user  can be signed out in block  and the voice recognition unit  can hang up.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIGS. 1 and 2"],"b":["500","502","502","502","502","502","502","502","502","504","504","222","222","506","506","506","506","506","110","500","110","110","500","228","110","112"],"i":["a","b ","c ","a","b","c ","a","b","c ","a","a ","h "]},"In some embodiments, the notification system  can be configured to dispatch a \u201ccall tree\u201d of emergency responders. For example, homeland security advisories can be provided to all the emergency responders having their methods of contact entered into the user notification rules . In the event of an emergency, the automated system can contact each responder (e.g. user , user , and user ) concurrently, and dispatch instructions for each responder in parallel. The notification system  may require interaction with the user to determine if the appropriate person has received the message. Information about the message delivery can be fed back to a dispatch center, which can then be displayed to a dispatcher. The dispatcher can determine how many responders are available and can stop the notification system  from contacting further responders when an appropriate number have been reached. Automating the dispatching service with parallel notifications to multiple users allows the dispatcher to receive more emergency calls from those in distress and greatly reduce response times. Other examples of the notification system  may include, but is not limited to notifying users and law enforcement officers of when a child has been abducted in their area.","In other embodiments, the notification system  can be configured to manage notifications regarding personal matters. For example, physicians' offices can automatically remind patients of appointments, and can offer the ability to reschedule. Airlines can automatically notify passengers when a flight is delayed or cancelled, and can provide the ability to reschedule. Users of online dating services or any other classified advertising service can be notified when someone responds to their ad and can be provided an opportunity to perform multiple actions such as respond to the response, request additional information, or schedule a meeting with the respondent. In other examples, financial companies can notify their customers when there is a problem with an account, such as an overdraft or unusual activity on the account. Commercial sales can also make use of the notification system . For example, a stock broker can automatically notify a customer when a stock of interest has dropped below a specified price and can allow the customer to purchase the stock. In another example, an on-line auction website can automatically notify a bidder regarding attainment of various bid objectives, such as when a maximum bid has been exceeded, or allow the bidder to increase their bid through the notification system .","The present disclosure can be used in many scenarios where the user  is expecting an event to occur and with the accessibility to a mobile phone (e.g., communication device, a computing device, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a mobile telephone, a multi-function voice enabled device, a voice-over-Internet Protocol (VoIP) device, or other mobile phones) is notified of the event's occurrence. The examples presented here are not meant to limit the implementations of the disclosure in any way but are intended to further illustrate exemplary embodiments according to the present disclosure.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6","FIGS. 1 through 5","FIG. 6"],"b":["600","112","304","204","312","312","312","310","308","308","208","206","502","502","502","222","504","506","506","506","600","600","600","600"],"i":["a","b","c","a ","b","a","b","c","a","b","c"]},"In some embodiments, the computer system  can include an input device such as a mouse or other pointing device of the like (e.g., a digitizer), and a keyboard or other data entry device of the like. The computer system  can implement output devices including, but not limited to, a display , and a display interface . The computer system  can include input\/output (I\/O) devices such as, a communications interface , a cable  and a communications path , which each can be connected to a network interface card, or a modem. The communications interface  allows software and data to be transferred between the computer system  and external devices. Some exemplary devices that are connected to the communications interface  may include a modem, a network interface (e.g., an Ethernet card), a communications port, a Personal Computer Memory Card International Association (PCMCIA) slot and card, or of the like. Software and data transferred via the communications interface  are in the form of signals, which may be electronic, electromagnetic, optical or other type of signal capable of being transferred across the communications interface  using the cable . The cable  links to the communications interface  via the communications path . The communications path  can carry electronic signals via the cable , fiber optics, a telephone line, a radio frequency (RF) link, or other types of communication channels.","In some embodiments, computer programs may include object oriented computer programs, which are stored in either the main memory  or the secondary memory . In other examples, the objected oriented computer programs may also be stored in a removable storage drive , which generally refer to computer program products. Such computer programs, when executed, enable the computer system  to perform features of the present disclosure as discussed herein. In particular, the computer programs, when executed, enable the processor  to perform the features of the present disclosure.","In other embodiments, the disclosure is directed to a computer program product including a computer-readable medium having control logic (\u201ccomputer software\u201d) stored therein. The control logic, when executed by the processor , causes the processor  to perform the functions of the disclosure as described herein. In still other embodiments, the computer software may be stored in a computer program product and loaded into the computer system  using the removable storage drive , hard disk drive  or communications interface . The computer software can run as a standalone application running atop an operating system, or can be integrated into the operating system.","In still other embodiments, the computer system  includes one or more of processor . The processor  is connected to a communication infrastructure  (e.g., a communications bus, cross-over bar, or network). The computer system  can include the display interface  that forwards graphics, text, and other data from the communication infrastructure  (or from a frame buffer, not shown) for presenting on the display . The computer system  can also include a main memory , such as random access memory (RAM), with a secondary memory . The secondary memory  can include either a hard disk drive  or a removable storage drive , which represents a floppy diskette drive, a magnetic tape drive, an optical disk drive, a compact disk drive CD-ROM, or of the like. The removable storage drive  either reads from or writes to a removable storage unit  in a well known manner. The removable storage unit  which can be referred to as a program storage device or a computer program product is accessed for reading and writing by removable storage drive . In some embodiments, the removable storage unit  includes a computer-readable storage medium that stores computer data and instructions.","In yet another embodiment, the secondary memory  may include other similar devices for allowing computer programs or instructions be loaded into the computer system . For example, a removable storage unit  and an interface  may provide an alternative storage capacity. Examples of such may include a program cartridge and cartridge interface (e.g., those found in video game devices), or a removable memory chip (e.g., an erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM), programmable read-only memory (PROM) with associated socket), which allow either data or instructions to be transferred from the removable storage unit  to the computer system . In some examples, hardware components such as application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) or other integrated circuits can implement one or more portions of the computer system  to provide functionality as described herein. In other examples, the computer system  can be implemented in a combination of both hardware and software components.","The disclosure may be used, for example, in conjunction with a product registration system. In one example, a manufacturer may use the notification function of the present disclosure to inform registered customers of new product features, product defects or recalls. Similarly, customers may be notified when the warranty on a registered product is about to expire, with the option to purchase extended warranty coverage.","In another example, the notification function may be integrated into a voice-responsive product registration system. Such a system may allow a product purchaser to call into an automated, voice-responsive system to register the purchased product. The purchaser may be presented with any number of questions about the product purchased, product preferences, personal interests, or of the like. The purchaser's verbal responses may be captured and stored in a database. A response to the questions may trigger an event notification. For example, if the purchaser indicates an interest in a complementary product, a notification may be sent to a sales agent about the complementary product to follow-up with the purchaser. In another example, the purchaser may indicate an interest in features that are not yet available, and a notification may be sent to the purchaser when those features become available.","In other examples, the notification function may be used in conjunction with a broadcast voice notification system that may speed and simplify the notification process. The broadcast voice notification system \u201cpushes\u201d important information or notices to individual recipients with security, delivery authentication, and single-point activation. The broadcast voice notification system's secure voice alert administration is easy and intelligent, and may allow the user to select people to notify and to make choices on-the-fly, even to monitor who has been contacted moment by moment.","The broadcast voice notification system may provide a simple web interface, which may allow a phone list to be instantly created or recalled, a message to be typed (or pasted), and sent to many people simultaneously. The broadcast voice notification system may provide a seamless broadcasting system that gets a message delivered quickly. The broadcast voice notification system may contact all the people on a list at once, and reading the message to them when they answer the phone. The user who originates the message may monitor its broadcast in real-time through a computer-based user interface. The user interface may show if a call attempt fails, and the user may then try again at the appropriate time.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["701","704","704","702","705","703","703","703","703","703","703","704","704","704","705"],"i":["a","b ","b ","b "]},"A monitor mechanism  monitors the location of a calling party, e.g., the user . This allows the system to monitor and access the nature of the message being received and provide appropriate location-sensitive or responsive services such as a \u201c411\u201d system and to look up numbers and provide context relevant notification (e.g., location, time-of-day, user profile related, or others.) during an interactive call with a user. Thus, the system may not require a user to hang up and thereby provide another notification, but instead, while monitoring the persons current session, the system may provide other relevant services. So, for example, if a user is looking-up restaurants, the system can offer them a voice coupon and notify the person that, for example, a particular nearby restaurant is offering a special deal right now and provide an option to connect the user to the establishment and give them the coupon offer. In doing so, the system may also initiate a call to that restaurant, let the restaurant staff know that someone is on the line that is asking for the coupon offer and then connect the call. According to another embodiment, the system may offer a voice coupon, and ask the user to confirm, e.g., \u201cwould you like the coupon?\u201d In response to an affirmative verbal reply, the system may email that coupon to the user or email the user a link to where they can register to receive the coupon. According to another embodiment, the system may take user registration information using a voice-registration functionality to take the person's complete name, address info if necessary, and\/or pull it out of the system (e.g., perform a \u201clook-up\u201d.) The system may further register all of that person's interests and for example, put them on a mailing list, to mail them a free sample of an associated product.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 7"],"b":["800","704","810","811","812","813","814","820","840"]},"Returning to block , the system once again looks at alerts and so again with reference to the instant example and context, a user may be doing a \u201c411\u201d lookup for a particular area, e.g., requesting weather for a particular area, news based on a zip code, or others. Alternatively, if the system knows a person's default area, it may look to see if there is an alert, either based on user preferences or some sort of emergency indicated to be associated with the particular geographical area of the user. If there is an alert, processing may continue at block , where an appropriate voice message may be generated to the user, e.g., \u201cThere is a weather alert for your region, would you like to hear it?\u201d If they say, \u201cNo\u201d, then the system may continue back into the interactive system, allowing the user to continue retrieving news or request new information.
