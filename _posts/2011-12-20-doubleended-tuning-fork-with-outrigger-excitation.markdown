title: Double-ended tuning fork with outrigger excitation
abstract: An accelerometer includes a base, a proof mass flexibly connected to the base, and a double-ended tuning fork (DETF) coupled to the proof mass and the base. The DETF includes a base attached to the accelerometer base, an outrigger that extends from a first side of the base, and two tines that extend from a side of the outrigger that is opposite the first side of the base. The accelerometer also includes a drive mechanism that generates opposing forces in different halves of the outrigger, thereby causing the tines to oscillate. An excitation voltage applied to metallized traces on the outrigger at the base of the DETF cause the tines to resonant. The alternating strains generated at the root of the tines excite the tines themselves at their resonant frequency without the requirement of complex metallization applied to the tines.

The Government may have rights to portions of this invention. The contract is under the program name Strategic Resonating Beam Accelerometer (SRBA).","DETF (double-ended tuning fork) excitation is historically done by means of metallizing a pattern on the tines of the DETF and applying an alternating charge to the surfaces.","This is problematic because the material properties of the metallization are not an ideal match to the properties of the tine and may exhibit hysteresis effects and time dependent drift from the strains applied to the material during the metallization application process.","The present invention excites tines of a double-ended tuning fork (DETF) to vibrate by applying an excitation voltage via metallized traces to the outrigger at the base of the DETF instead of the DETF itself. The alternating strains generated at the root of the tines excite the tines themselves at their resonant frequency without the requirement of complex metallization applied to the tines.","In one aspect of the invention, an accelerometer includes a base, a proof mass flexibly connected to the base, and a double-ended tuning fork (DETF) coupled to the proof mass and the base. The DETF includes a base attached to the accelerometer base, an outrigger that extends from a first side of the base, and two tines that extend from a side of the outrigger that is opposite the first side of the base. The accelerometer also includes a drive mechanism that generates opposing forces in different halves of the outrigger, thereby causing the tines to oscillate.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":["FIGS. 1 and 2","FIGS. 3 and 4"],"b":["18","24","28","26","20","24","26","20","34","26","36","24","38","34","40","36","38","40","30","32","38","40","30","32"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["38","20","38","74","76","80","82","70","72","38","90","92","70","72","74","76","80","82","100","104"]},"An (optional) shielding trace  is located on the top and bottom surfaces between the respective traces. The shielding traces  keeps the electric field caused by the traces , ,  from interfering with the electric field caused by the traces , , . The shielding traces  are connected to a grounding source (not shown).","In one embodiment, a first drive mechanism  drives the metallized traces , , and  to the same first polarity, while a second drive mechanism  drives the metallized traces , , and  to a second polarity that is opposite the first polarity. Depending upon the direction of an electric field that is induced within the outrigger , due to the polarities of the metallized traces, the outrigger , made of a piezoelectric material, such as crystalline quartz or a comparable material, will expand or contract on one side, while an opposing expansion or contraction is induced on the other side (i.e., non-parametric drive). A centerline  that is parallel to the tines ,  is approximately in the center of the outrigger . The sides are on either side of the centerline . The polarity of the metallized traces is then toggled at a certain frequency, thereby causing the outrigger  to move in a manner that will cause the tines ,  to vibrate into oscillation. The induced electric fields produce alternating strains within the outrigger , which generates, at the root of the tines , , a resonant frequency without requiring any metallization applied to the tines , . The frequency at which the polarity is alternated is the same as the resonant frequency of the tines , .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["20","34","38","30","32","34","26","18","30","32","38"]},"In one embodiment, the outrigger does not include any metalized traces. Electric pads\/traces (electrodes) are attached to structures that surround the outrigger. These electrical pads\/traces are positioned near desired locations on the outrigger, such as is shown by the traces , , , , ,  of the DETF  shown in . The electrical pads\/traces are driven in a similar manner as the traces of the DETF  in order to produce similar electric fields through the outrigger to produce the same piezoelectric effect for causing tine resonance.","Static charging can occur on any dielectric surface. The static charge can cause short term instabilities on piezoelectric parts in that an applied voltage results in a displacement and vice-versa. One way to deal with this is to ground the surfaces of the tines so that any surface charges would be evenly distributed or eliminated by grounding. Thus, in one embodiment the tines may be fully metalized with that metallization being tied to ground.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIGS. 5 and 6","FIG. 5"],"b":["112","114","38","110","112","114","112","114","38","30","32","38","30","32","30","32","30","32"]},"As shown in , no metalized traces are present on the outrigger  of a DETF . Structures  and  separate from the outrigger  include metalized pads on the edges adjacent to where they would be if directly deposited to the edges of outrigger . The metalized pads produce electric fields within the outrigger  thereby exciting the outrigger  to resonate. The frequency at which the polarity of the metalized pads on the structures ,  is alternated at two times the resonant frequency of the tines ,  (i.e., parametric drive). Structures above and below the outrigger may also include metalized pads.","While the preferred embodiment of the invention has been illustrated and described, as noted above, many changes can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
