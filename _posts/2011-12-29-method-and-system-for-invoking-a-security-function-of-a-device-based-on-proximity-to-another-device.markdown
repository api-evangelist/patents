title: Method and system for invoking a security function of a device based on proximity to another device
abstract: An approach for enabling a security function of a mobile device to be activated based on a change in proximity of another device is described. A notification service determines whether a proximity threshold between a first device and a second device is satisfied based on pairing information corresponding to a wireless link between the first device and the second device. The notification service also generates a control signal to activate a security function to restrict access on either the first device or the second device based on the determination.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND INFORMATION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["Mobile devices have enabled a variety of sophisticated services and applications. However, because of their portability, these devices can easily be misplaced or stolen, thereby potentially compromising any sensitive data or applications stored on or reachable by the devices. Hence, security can be problematic for such devices. Traditionally, mobile devices are equipped with a password mechanism to prevent access to the device's operational functions. Unfortunately, if the password challenge process is not invoked or triggered at the proper time, the device is vulnerable to security breaches.","Based on the foregoing, there is a need for a more effective security function for use in mobile devices to prevent unauthorized access.","An apparatus, method and software for enabling a security function of a mobile device based on a change in proximity with respect to another device is described. In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It is apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details or with an equivalent arrangement. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present invention.","Although the various embodiments are described with respect to mobile devices pairing with other mobile devices using Bluetooth, it is contemplated that these embodiments have applicability to stationary devices coupled to mobile devices using various near-field technologies.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","103","101","101","105","101","101","105","101","101","103","101","105"],"i":["a","n","a","n ","a","n ","n "]},"As noted, device security and privacy are of critical importance to mobile device users. This is particularly true for users who frequently access applications, private data and other internal resources through intranets, virtual private networking (VPN), or other network access means. Typically, users employ VPNs to establish a reliable connection to internal\/private resources such as a work or business related computer, intranet server, proprietary file server, mission-critical applications, etc. VPN connectivity is initiated by authenticating the mobile device as well as verifying user provided access credentials, i.e., a password or user identifier. Once entry is granted, the mobile device user can access the internal or private resources remotely just as if they were on-site or directly connected to the internal network. However, when a user inadvertently leaves his\/her mobile device somewhere, another user who finds the device has access to the VPN and thus the internal resources.","By way of illustration, an employee of a corporation may require remote access to a work or business related computer, an intranet server, a proprietary file server, etc. Remote access is garnered according to access credentials, i.e., a password or user identifier. If the user inadvertently leaves their mobile device behind while it is connected, anyone who retrieves the device can access the private resources available during the active networking session. Consequently, the device may be subject to unauthorized exploitation, accessing of private information and the like. One security option is to remotely trigger wiping of the data on the device. However, the result is a loss of valuable proprietary data. Unfortunately, traditional approaches are not effective in preventing access to private or internal resources while enabling data retention when control of the mobile device is compromised.","To address this issue, system  presents a notification service platform  for activating a security function of a user device based on a determination of a security breach\u2014i.e., the device is unintentionally left behind, accessed without authorization, attempted to be accessed at an unknown location, subject to a privacy or network breach, etc. In addition, the notification service platform  permits execution of various security functions for securing the device while maintaining sensitive data (e.g., avoiding its permanent loss, deletion, etc.). For the purpose of illustration, a device involved in any circumstance where valuable information is at risk of loss or breach is considered to be in a condition of risk (\u201cat risk\u201d); the risk being due to the lack of presence, control or availability of an authorized user to the device. The degree to which the device is determined to be at risk also determines the type of security function to be activated by the notification service platform  at the device. Conversely, the notification service platform  may also determine a limited risk condition of a device\u2014i.e., the device is left behind at a known\/private location of the user, is currently in use by another designated\/known user, etc.","The determination of the extent of risk can be based on current location and\/or usage status related to the device, the user of the device, or a combination thereof. By way of example, the security function for an at risk device may correspond to one or more of the following: disabling a display of the device, activating a screensaver of the device, activating a login screen of the device, restricting access to a resource associated with the device, disabling a communication session of the device, disabling a power setting or any external interfaces of the device, encrypting data maintained in local storage for subsequent retrieval when the risk is mitigated, or a combination thereof. Each of these security functions can be performed singularly, or in combination, in response to the interpretation of the current location and\/or usage status\u2014i.e., context information for conveying the device status or condition. It is noted that other security functions of a device deemed at risk may also be configured to accommodate different application requirements, operating system requirements and enterprise needs. For example, a government issued smartphone that is determined to be compromised (e.g., stolen) may feature a data encryption or data wiping security function for erasing all data maintained in memory or on an external memory device.","In certain embodiments, a security function is triggered when a proximity threshold of two or more paired devices is determined. In the example of , any of the devices -or , subject to a pairing and associated with the notification service platform , may be determined to be at risk. At least one of the paired devices (e.g., device and device ) is operated by an authorized user, while the other device is at risk (e.g., not in the presence of or control of the user or at an unauthorized location). By way of example, the notification service platform  maintains pairing information related to one or more user devices -, a wireless device , etc., in database .","By way of example, the wireless device  may include a wireless headset, a wireless transmitter, a wireless keyboard, a wireless mouse, a wireless speaker, or any other device. In the case of wireless device  and\/or user device -pairing, at least one of the devices may be maintained on the authorized user's person as they travel about a given area.","Pairing of user device and device  is facilitated by way of a range based communication protocol such as Bluetooth, infrared, or the like. Device pairing may include, for example, the detecting of whether one or more devices are configured for connectivity (e.g., Bluetooth), execution of a handshake to initiate a pairing connection, and the conveying of pairing information for establishing the connection. Pairing information is generated to facilitate the pairing, and may include connection status information related to the connected devices -and\/or device , timestamp information related to the pairing, an alias of the connected devices -and\/or device , location or connectivity data regarding the connected devices -and\/or device , or a combination thereof.","Once a connection is established, the connected devices and  may announce they are connected in various ways. For example, the display of the user device may feature an indicator, message prompt or other alert for signifying an active connection between the devices and . For example, the alias\/name of the paired devices and  may also be presented to the display.","In certain embodiments, the notification service platform  detects a change in proximity of one or more of the paired devices and device  per the range based connection. For example, the notification service platform  may determine that at least one of the connected devices and  are approaching the proximity threshold; e.g., the distance of separation may reach the limit of the capabilities of the devices and  to maintain the connection. In addition, the service platform  can determine that at least one of the connected devices and device  has exceeded the proximity threshold. Still further, the service platform  may determine that at least one of the connected devices and  is within range of the proximity threshold (has not exceeded or otherwise satisfied the threshold).","Under this scenario, the notification service platform  causes generation of an alert, such as an alarm or notification message, at one or both of the devices and  when the proximity threshold is satisfied. As noted, the threshold can correspond to a scenario where a relative distance between any one of the paired devices causes or is close to causing a severing of the pairing\/disabling of the exchange of pairing information (e.g., connection status=inactive). For example, when a user of a Bluetooth headset exceeds a proximity range required to sustain a pairing connection with a smartphone, the notification service platform  triggers generation of an alert and initiation of a security function of the smartphone.","Alternatively, a satisfactory range of a device to within the threshold may be determined based on the establishing or reestablishing of a handshake between devices\/the exchange of pairing information (e.g., connection status=active). Under this scenario, a security verification process may be initiated by the notification service platform  for determining that the proper devices are paired. For example, when a user of a Bluetooth headset that was once connected to a smartphone comes back to within an acceptable proximity range, the notification service platform  triggers reestablishment of the pairing connection. This may also correspond to the deactivating of a security function of the device based on satisfactory reentry and proper verification.","In the example above, deactivation of the security function is contingent upon the proper security criteria being exchanged between the smartphone and the Bluetooth device. The security criteria may include a secret message, a security code, one or more historical interactions between the smartphone and the Bluetooth device, an encryption scheme, or a combination thereof. In the case of the historical interactions, this may include prior connectivity between the two devices. Also, the security criteria may be processed by the notification service platform  in connection with a seed value, key or other identifier associated with a device during the exchange between the smartphone and the Bluetooth device. For example, when the user comes within range of the smartphone, the Bluetooth device must present the correct\/required security criteria and seed information to support establishment of a connection.","It is noted that processing of the security criteria is necessary to prevent Bluetooth signal spoofing or premature deactivation of a security function of device determined to be at risk. As such, when another device attempts to create a pairing with the at risk device having access to a private resource, it must present the correct security criteria (e.g., credentials). Failure to present the seed value or an improper response to the other security criteria results in maintenance of a current security function of the device at risk or activation of a higher level security function of the device.","In certain embodiments, the notification service platform  maintains and processes context information regarding user devices -and . It is noted that the context information is processed by the service platform  to determine its current location and\/or usage status. Context information may be gathered by way of one or more sensors of the respective connected devices, such as user devices -and subsequently shared with the notification service platform  by way of a context module -respectively. The context modules -may convey context information to the notification service platform  in the form of location information, motion information, device usage information, device status information, or a combination thereof.","It is noted that user devices -may be any type of mobile terminal, fixed terminal, or portable terminal including a mobile handset, station, unit, device, multimedia computer, multimedia tablet, Internet node, communicator, desktop computer, laptop computer, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), smartphone or any combination thereof. It is also contemplated that the user devices -can support any type of interface for supporting the presentment or exchanging of data. In addition, user devices -may facilitate various input means for receiving and generating information, including touch screen capability, keyboard and keypad data entry, voice-based input mechanisms and the like. Any known and future implementations of user devices  are applicable.","In certain embodiments, user devices -, the notification service platform  and other elements of system  may be configured to communicate via a service provider network within network . According to certain embodiments, network  provides for one or more networks, such as data network, telephony network, and\/or wireless network, can interact with the service provider network. Network  may be any suitable wireline and\/or wireless network, and be managed by one or more service providers. For example, telephony network may include a circuit-switched network, such as the public switched telephone network (PSTN), an integrated services digital network (ISDN), a private branch exchange (PBX), or other like network.","Communication network  may employ various technologies for enabling wireless communication including, for example, code division multiple access (CDMA), long term evolution (LTE), enhanced data rates for global evolution (EDGE), general packet radio service (GPRS), mobile ad hoc network (MANET), global system for mobile communications (GSM), Internet protocol multimedia subsystem (IMS), universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS), etc., as well as any other suitable wireless medium, e.g., microwave access (WiMAX), wireless fidelity (WiFi), satellite, and the like. Meanwhile, data network may be any local area network (LAN), metropolitan area network (MAN), wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or any other suitable packet-switched network, such as a commercially owned, proprietary packet-switched network, such as a proprietary cable or fiber-optic network.","Still further, the communication provider network  may embody circuit-switched and\/or packet-switched networks that include facilities to provide for transport of circuit-switched and\/or packet-based communications. It is further contemplated that such networks may include components and facilities to provide for signaling and\/or bearer communications between the various components or facilities of system . In this manner, the communication network  may embody or include portions of a signaling system 7 (SS7) network, Internet protocol multimedia subsystem (IMS), or other suitable infrastructure to support control and signaling functions.","Though not shown, in certain embodiments, user devices -may be configured to establish peer-to-peer communication sessions with each other using a variety of technologies\u2014near field communication (NFC), Bluetooth, ZigBee, infrared, etc. Also, connectivity can be provided via a wireless local area network (LAN). By way of example, a group of user devices -may be configured to a common LAN so that each device can be uniquely identified via any suitable network addressing scheme. For example, the LAN may utilize the dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) to dynamically assign \u201cprivate\u201d DHCP internet protocol (IP) addresses to each user device , i.e., IP addresses that are accessible to devices connected to the service provider network as facilitated via a router.","In certain embodiments, the notification service platform  may be implemented for use over the communication network  as a hosted solution or subscription service. This may include, for example, the telecommunications service provider that supports execution of the devices -via the communication network , the provider of the communication network , or a combination thereof. Alternatively, the notification service platform  may be directly integrated for execution by a user device -or wireless device .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["103","103","201","203","205","207","209","211","213"]},"In addition, the service platform  also accesses context data generated by the one or more sensors (not shown) of respective connected devices (e.g., user devices -, wireless device ) from a context information database . Still further, profile information regarding one or more subscribed\/authorized users and\/or their related user devices -and wireless devices  (of which one is shown) are maintained in a profile information database . The aforementioned modules - may access one or more of the databases ,  and  for enabling execution of its various functions.","In one embodiment, an authentication module  authenticates users and user devices -for interaction with the notification service platform . By way of example, the authentication module  receives a request to subscribe to the notification service for enabling activation of a security function of a device in response to a determined risk condition. The subscription process may include the establishing of a preferred mode of alert transmission, including text, email or application based alerting (e.g., pop-up window). Other preferences and settings may also be established based on the features of the device or the type of private resource(s) capable of being accessed by the device. Preferences and settings information may be referenced to a specific user, user device, wireless device, or combination thereof, and maintained as profile information . It is noted that the user may establish which devices to associate with its user profile in connection with the notification service. As such, in one embodiment, only those devices specified by the user are able to be configured for activation of a security function. Moreover, only a device specified by the user may be used to engage another device of the user for permitting delaying or disabling of a security function that has been activated","The authentication process performed by the module  may also include receiving and validating a login name and\/or user identification value as provided or established for a particular user during a registration process with the service provider. The login name and\/or user identification value may be received as input provided by the user from the user device  or other device via a graphical user interface to the platform  (e.g., as enabled by user interface module ). Registration data for respective subscribers, which contains pertinent user or device profile data, may be cross referenced as part of the login process. Alternatively, the login process may be performed through automated association of profile information  maintained as registration data with an IP address, a carrier detection signal of a user device , mobile directory number (MDN), subscriber identity module (SIM) (e.g., of a SIM card), radio frequency identifier (RFID) tag or other identifier.","In certain embodiments, the pairing information processing module  is configured to determine if a device associated with a user (e.g., via profile information ) is at risk. Devices are deemed by the module  as at risk in response to detection of an exceeding of a proximity threshold between paired devices. This also causes the device to be set to an inactive state due to absence of the peer. By way of example, a user's work cellular phone may suddenly lose a paired connection to a company issued laptop computer that is currently accessing the company network. The loss of connectivity may be the result of the user walking away from the laptop computer as they exit the building to talk on the cellular phone. Under this scenario, the pairing information processing module  determines at least one of the devices (e.g., the laptop) is at risk. The context information processing module  operates in connection with the pairing information processing module  to further determine the extent of risk of the device, which particular device subject to the pairing disconnect is at risk, etc. Of note, the device deemed not to be in the direct presence and\/or control of the user for authorized usage is deemed at risk and made inactive (if not already).","The pairing information processing module  also performs one or more security validation functions in conjunction with the authentication module . This includes determining that a device attempting to establish a paired connection with another is a known device based on the exchange of security criteria. By processing the pairing information as exchanged between devices with respect to security criteria at the time of an attempted connection, an device deemed at risk is able to avoid a spoofed Bluetooth device to \u2018step in\u2019 and thwart activation of a security function of the device. The pairing information processing module  enables devices to respond to seed\/context polls from the peered device using series dependent calculation (e.g., cipher-block chaining mode in encryption). In addition, device interaction history is maintained along with a secret key\/message, initial-seed values, encryption parameters, or the like. The seed value and other security criteria may be periodically generated and assigned to a specific device of the user and associated with specific profile information .","In one embodiment, the context information processing module  received notification of an at risk device associated with a user from the pairing information processing module (e.g., a proximity threshold is exceeded). Once received, the context information processing module  analyzes the context information  provided by context modules -of the various devices of the user. In instances where a device associated with the user is not equipped with a context module  (e.g., wireless device ), the context information processing module  interprets data collected by one or more sensors of the device to generate context information. The data is processed according to the sensor type\u2014i.e., if the sensor is a network detection sensor, it processes and interprets the network data (e.g., internet protocol address information). Once processed, the context information processing module  further determines the level of risk associated with the device. As noted, the level of risk determines the security action to be exercised in accordance with user settings, including whether to perform any secured data retention procedures.","By way of example, the context information processing module  uses motion sensing to determine whether a device that was previously paired is in continuous possession or use. In the example of the user leaving a laptop behind as the user exits a building to use a cellular phone, the context information processing module  determines the laptop is in a lost\/misplaced\/unused condition. This risk condition may be based on processing of context information such as: (1) motion information related to the cellular phone indicates the device is in active motion while motion information for the laptop indicates it is dormant; (2) location information related to the cellular phone indicates variation while that of the laptop is constant; (3) usage information for the laptop indicates it is connected to a private resource; (4) usage information for the cellular phone indicates it is actively making a call; (5) an idle condition of the laptop is determined. In this example, the module  is able to determine that the laptop is the device currently at risk. It is noted that one or more of above types of context information are relied upon to render a determination of the status\/risk condition of the device.","Table 1 below depicts various risk conditions capable of being determined and associated with a device along with a corresponding security function\/action to be executed. The context information corresponding to each risk condition is also shown. It is noted in Table 1 that the risk condition is expressed as a message suitable for conveyance to a device. In certain embodiments, the message is conveyed to a device on the user's person and pertains to the at risk device. It is noted that the risk conditions and corresponding security functions to be applied may vary depending on the device type, the needs of the enterprise or user implementing the notification service platform , security requirements and protocols, network capabilities of the devices, etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"140pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"133pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Results from processing of context","Risk condition and corresponding security"]},{"entry":["information","function\/action"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Active Device - presence of peer - known","(\u201cI am in a home location\u201d) = best security"]},{"entry":["neighbors (e.g., known WiFi signal)","case; Security function = limited device"]},{"entry":[{},"timeout)"]},{"entry":["Active Device - presence of peer - unknown","(\u201cI am a visitor somewhere\u201d) = vigilant"]},{"entry":["neighbors (e.g., unknown WiFi signal)","posture; Security function = short device"]},{"entry":[{},"timeout"]},{"entry":["Inactive Device - presence of peer - unknown","(\u201cI am a visitor and not active\u201d) = paranoid"]},{"entry":["neighbors","posture; Security function = device lockout"]},{"entry":["Inactive Device - absence of peer - unknown","(\u201cI am at risk\u201d) = suicidal posture; Security"]},{"entry":["neighbors","function = device will wipe itself on one"]},{"entry":[{},"failed password attempt"]},{"entry":["Inactive Device - absence of peer - change of","(\u201cI am being transported by a stranger\u201d) ="]},{"entry":["neighbors (e.g., varying WiFi signals)","hostage posture; Security function = beacon"]},{"entry":[{},"the device location and\/or wipe device clean"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"Per Table 1, it is noted that execution of a device is contingent upon the determined presence of a peer device. By way of example, the device is active when the peer device is present, and inactive when the peer device is not present. Results are determined by the context information processing module  due to the processing of context information (e.g., device usage, presence information, location information).","Also, in certain embodiments, the security function execution module  operates in connection with the context information processing module  to enable execution of a particular security function. The security function execution module  may generate one or more control signals, instructions, or the like for executing the security function relative to the operating system or capabilities of the device. The security function execution module  may also enable the user to configure one or more application settings or timing settings for execution of a security function. By way of example, a device lockout setting may be set to X seconds, or a device tracking application may be set to transmit a beacon every Y seconds.","As noted in Table 1, wiping the data on the device is a possible security function, i.e., corresponding to a high risk scenario or condition being determined. In addition to the above, the security function execution module  can be configured to enable retention of the data and protection from compromise without data wiping. This may include, for example, the following functions:\n\n","It is noted that the above described security functions may be performed by the security function execution module  singularly or in combination. The actual function performed can be set by the enterprise and\/or user of the device per the configuration settings. By way of example, the above described security actions may be enabled by government agencies, intelligence bureaus and any other organizations where private but useful data is to be prevented from unwarranted access, but not subject to permanent loss by the organization.","In one embodiment, the user interface module  enables presentment of data to a graphical user interface (GUI) of user devices -. The user interface module , for example, renders graphic primitives to the displays of the devices for indicating activation of a security function, pairing information, etc. As such, the user interface module  executes in accordance with the application programming interface and operating system instructions of the devices . Also, the communication interface  supports transmission of data, such as response input, based on one or more action buttons and\/or notification messages presented to a display of the user devices -by the user interface module .","The above described modules and components of the notification service platform  can be implemented in hardware, firmware, software, or a combination thereof.

As such, the service platform  may generate direct signal inputs by way of the operating system of the user device  for interacting with the context module  and accessing various sensors of the user device . In another embodiment, one or more of the modules - may be implemented for operation by respective user devices -and\/or wireless device  as a platform , or combination thereof.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0059"},"figref":["FIGS. 3A-3D","FIG. 9","FIG. 1"],"b":["103","300","304","310","316"]},"In step  of process  (), the notification service platform  determines whether a proximity threshold between a first device (e.g., user device ) and a second device (e.g., wireless device ) is satisfied based on pairing information corresponding to a wireless link between the first device and the second device . As noted previously, the pairing information includes data exchanged between the devices and  for formulating and\/or validating the pairing, including device alias\/name information, timestamp information, etc. In certain instances, the proximity threshold may be based in part on the particular protocol employed to formulate the pairing. For example, a Wireless communication pairing may be established between multiple devices to within a given maximum distance (e.g., supportable by the device capabilities).","Per step , the notification service platform  generates a control signal to activate a security function to restrict access on either the user device or the wireless device  based on the determination. In some embodiments, the security function may include, for example, disabling a display of the first device or the second device, activating a screensaver of the first device or the second device, activating a login screen of the first device, restricting access to a resource associated of the first device or the second device, disabling a communication session of the first device or the second device, disabling power of the first device or the second device, or a combination thereof.","In step , process  () determines context information for one or both of the device and the device , wherein the context information includes motion information, device usage information, device status information, and\/or location information. In another step , the notification service platform  determines whether the user device or the wireless device  is in use and\/or at a known location based on the context information. For example, the user device may be on the user's person (e.g., attached to their phone holster) while the other device  may be left unattended. Per step , the notification service platform  determines a security function to activate based on the determination. As noted, the security function is selected based on the status of the device, its current state of use, etc.","In step  of process  (), transmission of the control signal is initiated to either the first device of the second device.

The pairing information  includes, for example, icons - for visually representing the device types subject to the paired connection. Also associated with each icon - are aliases\/names of the respective devices. Under this scenario, one of the devices is a Bluetooth headset corresponding to icon  with the name EAR_V. Another device is a cellular phone corresponding to icon  with the name JOHN'S CELL. Another device is the tablet computer  corresponding to icon  with the name TAB_KKV. It is noted that the aliases\/names may be established by default or set by a user of the device. Also, it is noted that multipoint technology or any other connectivity scheme may be used to connect multiple devices simultaneously as opposed to only two. For example, a wireless communication headset with multipoint connectivity allows the user to easily switch calls from one device to another without having to manually disconnect and reconnect.","The user may select various alert types  to be activated in response to detection of a breaching of a proximity threshold, detection of a risk condition, or a combination thereof. By way of example, the alert types  may include an alarm, an alert message (e.g., a notification message) or a vibration. The user may select one or more of the particular alert types  to be activated. Additional alert types  may also be added or deleted from the list  by way of an ADD link  or REMOVE link  accordingly. The addition or deletion is subject to the capabilities of the various devices. For example, the alert type capabilities of the Bluetooth headset may differ from that of the tablet of cellular phone due to its lack of interface.","Also, the user may establish which of the devices are subject to the selected alert types  by selecting a checkbox  or . By way of example, all of the connected devices (e.g., as represented by icons -) may be selected via checkbox , including the device determined by the notification service as at risk (to some extent). Under this scenario, for example, an alarm is caused to be generated by all of the devices in the event of a determined risk condition including the at risk device. Alternatively, only the devices paired to the device at risk may be selected via checkbox . It is noted that selection of one checkbox prevents the selection of the other.","The user may also select various security functions  to be executed by the notification service platform  as required due to a determined at risk condition of a device. By way of example, the security functions listed include an option to activate a screen lock, to turn off the device, to terminate any existing network sessions, to delete any data stored on the device, or a combination thereof. Additional security functions may also be added or deleted from the list  by way of an ADD link  or REMOVE link  accordingly. The addition or deletion is subject to the capabilities of the various devices, the enterprise to which the notification service platform  is associated, etc.","The user may also activate a checkbox  for enabling a network session to be reestablished automatically once the device is determined to no longer be at risk. This includes, for example, when the user reenters a range to within the predetermined proximity threshold (e.g., reestablishing of a pairing connection). Still further, the user may activate a checkbox  for enabling a user specified delay time to be applied prior to activation of a security function . By way of example, the user may enter a delayed response time of 40 seconds, which causes the notification service platform  prevent application of a selected security function during this time. Upon elapse of the delayed response time, however, the security function of the device is activated accordingly. It is noted that the delayed response time may be overridden in cases where the determined risk is great, such as when it is determined the device is being transported by an unknown user.","Various action buttons may also be selected by the user, including a SAVE action button  for saving the configuration settings, a SET AS DEFAULT action button  for establishing the selected configuration settings as default settings and a CANCEL action button  for cancelling any entered configuration settings. Once the settings are saved, the notification service platform  executes alerts and security functions in accordance with said settings. The settings may also be associated with a specific user and\/or device profile.","In the case of the notification service being associated with an enterprise\u2014i.e., a company\u2014the configuration interface  may be restricted to access by a sole network administrator or resource manager for affecting a plurality of user devices associated with one or more members. Also, in certain embodiments, a default security function of the notification service platform  may be maintained without any alteration by the user. For example, a checkbox  may be automatically checked and not able to be unchecked for indicating that a connected device is only active in the presence of a peer. Under this scenario, peer presence is required for enabling normal operation of the device at risk.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0073"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 6","FIG. 4","FIG. 6"],"b":["501","504","501","504","600","501","505","103"]},"The user  accidently leaves the tablet device  at a table while it is in a connected state with a private resource. The private resource may include a virtual private network (or intranet) through which the user  is able to access proprietary information regarding a project being undertaken by an employer of the user. While accessing this resource, the user  receives an important phone call and activates the call via the headset . As the call is private, the user  decides to exit the room where the tablet computer  is located, proceeding instead to the nearest exit. Upon exiting the room, the user exceeds a distance D required to maintain a paired connection with the tablet device  and the headset . Also, the pairing between the cellular phone  and the tablet computer  is disabled. The disconnection between the devices maintained in the presence of the user (the headset  and cellular phone ) and the unattended device (tablet computer ) is represented by crossed lines . Conversely, the connection between the headset  and the cellular phone  is maintained due to their close proximity.","Context information regarding the devices is persistently collected and processed by the notification service platform . For example, motion and location information regarding the cellular phone  of the user or the headset  may be analyzed by the service platform  to determine the user is in motion. Motion and location information for the tablet computer  may reveal, however, that is it not in motion and that its present location is unchanged. In addition, usage information for the devices may be collected and analyzed to enable the notification service platform  to deduce that the devices are currently in use. Under this scenario, the tablet device  is determined to be connected to a private network resource while the Bluetooth headset  and cellular phone  are actively engaged in a call session. Still further, a signal  as emitted from a device of an unknown user , an unknown WiFi connection within the building, etc., may be determined and collected as context information.","Based on the disconnection  and the context information as processed, the notification service platform  is able to determine that the tablet computer  was left behind in an unfamiliar location while in a connected state. As a result, the notification service platform  flags the tablet computer  as being at risk and selects the appropriate security function to invoke. An immediate security function may include making the device inactive\u2014i.e., per configuration setting of checkbox . Exceeding of the proximity threshold causes activation of an alert by at least one of the devices available to the user as registered with the notification service platform . Under this scenario, an alarm  is sounded by the Bluetooth headset  as a means of notifying the user  they have exceeded an acceptable range of the tablet device .","Also, as shown in , a light emitting diode  of the cellular phone  is activated, an alarm  is sounded, or a notification message  is rendered to the display  of the cellular phone . An alarm  may also be sounded by the tablet computer , such as in cases where all devices were configured as such.","A suitable response by the user to the various alarms may include turning around and proceeding back towards the tablet computer . Under this scenario, when the user  is back within an acceptable distance D of the tablet , a pairing connection may be reestablished. The connection is facilitated based on the exchange of security criteria between the tablet computer , the headset  and the cellular phone . Once the connection is established, any security function queued by the notification service for execution is halted.","The user may also respond to the alarm by way of the notification message rendered to the display  of the cellular phone . By way of example, the notification message  may provide details regarding the device labeled TAB_KKV as well as one or more action buttons for selection by the user. An INFO action button  may be selected to enable rendering of additional risk condition details if any. Per Table 1, for example, the additional information may include presentment of the message \u201cI am at risk\u201d based upon the collected context information. Also presented is the alias\/name of the device at risk (TAB_KKV). The OK and IGNORE action buttons  and  respectively may be selected to indicate the user  acknowledges the determined risk condition or is ignoring the risk condition.","A delayed response action message  is also presented for indicating the amount of time (in seconds) the user has before a security function is invoked. In certain embodiments, the default security function includes deactivating a prior active device due to the absence of a peer. Additional security functions may also be executed per the configuration, as set by the user or enterprise, etc., when this delay time is over. The action buttons as shown are only capable of activating their respective function when (1) the cellular phone  is back within range of the tablet computer ; and (2) the cellular phone provides correct security credentials to the tablet computer .","In the case where the tablet computer  is taken by an unknown user  and transported to another location, the notification service platform  causes generation of an updated notification message . The notification message  includes information for indicating the device alias\/name that is at risk as well as a message for denoting the level of risk (e.g., \u201cI am being transported by a stranger.\u201d). Per Table 1, this corresponds to a hostage posture of the device , wherein the security function invoked may include activating of a tracking beacon.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0076","num":"0082"},"figref":["FIGS. 7A and 7B","FIG. 5","FIG. 7A","FIG. 7B"],"b":["505","701","703","705"]},"It is noted that these exemplary security functions may correspond to those invoked by the notification service platform  upon detecting a disconnection  between any of the paired devices. By way of example, the screen lock may be activated prior to execution of an additional security function so as to deter unwanted access by the unknown user . In addition, improper passage of security credentials by the wireless device of the user  can also cause invocation of a security function.","The exemplary techniques and systems presented herein enable a security function of a mobile device to be activated based on a change in proximity of the user. An advantage of the exemplary embodiments includes the automated deactivation of a connected user device in response to the loss of presence of a peer device. As such, resources of the device can only be accessed when the peer device is present, thus limiting the accessing of said resources by unknown users. As another advantage, a notification service platform  may be integrated for use with multiple devices of the user for collecting and processing context information. Processing of the context information enables the notification service to determine the type of security function to invoke based on the determined risk condition associated with the device. Different security functions are invoked based on the determined level of risk.","The processes described herein for enabling a security function of a mobile device to be activated based on a change in proximity of another device may be implemented via software, hardware (e.g., general processor, Digital Signal Processing (DSP) chip, an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), etc.), firmware or a combination thereof.

An input device , such as a keyboard including alphanumeric and other keys, is coupled to the bus  for communicating information and command selections to the processor . Another type of user input device is a cursor control , such as a mouse, a trackball, or cursor direction keys, for communicating direction information and command selections to the processor  and for adjusting cursor movement on the display .","According to an embodiment of the invention, the processes described herein are performed by the computer system , in response to the processor  executing an arrangement of instructions contained in main memory . Such instructions can be read into main memory  from another computer-readable medium, such as the storage device . Execution of the arrangement of instructions contained in main memory  causes the processor  to perform the process steps described herein. One or more processors in a multi-processing arrangement may also be employed to execute the instructions contained in main memory . In alternative embodiments, hard-wired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions to implement the embodiment of the invention. Thus, embodiments of the invention are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software.","The computer system  also includes a communication interface  coupled to bus . The communication interface  provides a two-way data communication coupling to a network link  connected to a local network . For example, the communication interface  may be a digital subscriber line (DSL) card or modem, an integrated services digital network (ISDN) card, a cable modem, a telephone modem, or any other communication interface to provide a data communication connection to a corresponding type of communication line. As another example, communication interface  may be a local area network (LAN) card (e.g. for Ethernet\u2122 or an Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) network) to provide a data communication connection to a compatible LAN. Wireless links can also be implemented. In any such implementation, communication interface  sends and receives electrical, electromagnetic, or optical signals that carry digital data streams representing various types of information. Further, the communication interface  can include peripheral interface devices, such as a Universal Serial Bus (USB) interface, a PCMCIA (Personal Computer Memory Card International Association) interface, etc. Although a single communication interface  is depicted in ,  and A and B, multiple communication interfaces can also be employed.","The network link  typically provides data communication through one or more networks to other data devices. For example, the network link  may provide a connection through local network  to a host computer , which has connectivity to a network  (e.g. a wide area network (WAN) or the global packet data communication network now commonly referred to as the \u201cInternet\u201d) or to data equipment operated by a service provider. The local network  and the network  both use electrical, electromagnetic, or optical signals to convey information and instructions. The signals through the various networks and the signals on the network link  and through the communication interface , which communicate digital data with the computer system , are exemplary forms of carrier waves bearing the information and instructions.","The computer system  can send messages and receive data, including program code, through the network(s), the network link , and the communication interface . In the Internet example, a server (not shown) might transmit requested code belonging to an application program for implementing an embodiment of the invention through the network , the local network  and the communication interface . The processor  may execute the transmitted code while being received and\/or store the code in the storage device , or other non-volatile storage for later execution. In this manner, the computer system  may obtain application code in the form of a carrier wave.","The term \u201ccomputer-readable medium\u201d as used herein refers to any medium that participates in providing instructions to the processor  for execution. Such a medium may take many forms, including but not limited to computer-readable storage medium ((or non-transitory)\u2014i.e., non-volatile media and volatile media), and transmission media. Non-volatile media include, for example, optical or magnetic disks, such as the storage device . Volatile media include dynamic memory, such as main memory . Transmission media include coaxial cables, copper wire and fiber optics, including the wires that comprise the bus . Transmission media can also take the form of acoustic, optical, or electromagnetic waves, such as those generated during radio frequency (RF) and infrared (IR) data communications. Common forms of computer-readable media include, for example, a floppy disk, a flexible disk, hard disk, magnetic tape, any other magnetic medium, a CD-ROM, CDRW, DVD, any other optical medium, punch cards, paper tape, optical mark sheets, any other physical medium with patterns of holes or other optically recognizable indicia, a RAM, a PROM, and EPROM, a FLASH-EPROM, any other memory chip or cartridge, a carrier wave, or any other medium from which a computer can read.","Various forms of computer-readable media may be involved in providing instructions to a processor for execution. For example, the instructions for carrying out at least part of the embodiments of the invention may initially be borne on a magnetic disk of a remote computer. In such a scenario, the remote computer loads the instructions into main memory and sends the instructions over a telephone line using a modem. A modem of a local computer system receives the data on the telephone line and uses an infrared transmitter to convert the data to an infrared signal and transmit the infrared signal to a portable computing device, such as a personal digital assistant (PDA) or a laptop. An infrared detector on the portable computing device receives the information and instructions borne by the infrared signal and places the data on a bus. The bus conveys the data to main memory, from which a processor retrieves and executes the instructions.
