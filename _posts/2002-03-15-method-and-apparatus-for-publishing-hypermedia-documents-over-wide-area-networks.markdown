No. 6,393,469 which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08\/412,981, filed Mar. 28, 1995, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,870,552, both of which are incorporated by reference.","The present invention relates to the field of authoring, publishing, and managing electronic hypermedia documents across distributed, wide area networks such as the World Wide Web.","The distribution of information is being revolutionized before our very eyes. Wide area networks (\u201cWAN's\u201d), notably the Internet, are assuming the role of \u201cinformation superhighways\u201d and are distributing electronic embodiments of mail, textbooks, magazines, advertisements, and even audio and video clips around the world. Herein, the term \u201cdocument\u201d denotes and includes any and all such electronic content, generically.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0005","num":"0004"},"figref":"FIG. 1","i":"a\u2013n "},"One of the most rapidly expanding aspects of the Internet is the World Wide Web (the \u201cWeb\u201d). The Web is comprised of those Internet servers (and their clients) able to support the Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol, better known as \u201chttp.\u201d The Web allows documents and graphical materials to be interlinked by means of \u201chypertext\u201d (or more generally, hypermedia) document elements. When a user utilizes a cursor control device to select and \u201cclick\u201d on a hypermedia item in one document, a related document will automatically be accessed as identified by that link. For example,  illustrates a simple example of a popular Web document known as a \u201chome page.\u201d Home page  includes title , graphic image , instructional text , and list of bullet items . Selections are each hypertext. A Web hypermedia item is actually encoded with a Uniform Resource Locator (\u201cURL\u201d) tag, which literally addresses a document located on a remote network server. If a client of a Web server is equipped with suitable \u201cbrowser\u201d software, then a user of that client can point and click on any one of the hypermedia items within home page , and an http request to view the associated, linked content residing elsewhere on the Internet will automatically be generated and dispatched by the client's server to the appropriate Internet server which \u201chosts\u201d the linked document. The linked material will then automatically be retrieved and ultimately displayed on the client. Http further includes the Hyper-Text Markup Language (\u201chtml\u201d), which may be used to specify a certain layout structure for Web documents, e.g., specifying subsections of the document as a title, image, list, etc. Html specifications are interpreted by a client's browser, resulting in an appropriate display on the particular client's computer platform. A survey and discussion of many popular Web browsers is provided in the Feb. 7, 1995, issue of (\u201c\u201d), at pages 173\u2013196.","An important challenge that must be addressed, especially in light of the burgeoning expansion and popularity of the Internet and the Web, is how best to facilitate the authoring and publishing of hypermedia documents on the Web. Many large and small publishers of content\u2014such as newspaper and magazine publishers, for example\u2014wish to make their content available in on-line form to subscribers. However, this opportunity presents a major bottleneck, because high-quality development platforms and authoring tools have not yet been developed that adequately facilitate the authoring and publishing of hypermedia on a distributed WAN like the Web. A summary of the primary limitations of current Internet and Web publishing tools follows:","1. Current publishing tools are typically not fully network-integrated. Browsers or other \u201ccruiseware\u201d help users view existing WAN content, but do not generally support authoring of new WAN content. Current authoring tools, on the other hand, are typically either \u201cstand-alone\u201d local products, or at best offer a limited bridge to WAN access such that authoring and WAN navigation remain fundamentally non-integrated processes.","For example, in order to publish a document on a WAN, it is typically necessary to edit documents in a local storage context using authoring tools, and thereafter manually copy the documents to a WAN server. Manual copying is often tedious and inconvenient, especially where a publisher frequently publishes a large quantity of content from diverse sources, including text files, graphics images, video and sound clips, etc. Yet, current authoring tools generally provide little assistance with this chore.","The non-integrated nature of current authoring tools presents other difficulties and limitations as well. For example, it is not generally possible to \u201copen\u201d multiple WAN documents for editing and to transfer text, images, and URL's among those documents in the seamless fashion as is presently done with typical word processors for local computer documents. As another example, current Web authoring tools generally do not provide full WYSIWYG (\u201cWhat You See Is What You Get\u201d) feedback as to html markups and hypermedia links. In other words, the creation and editing of documents is typically performed in a purely local context; html and URL codes must then be separately tested in a serial fashion, by loading the document into a WAN browser or the like. This serial, iterative process is highly inefficient.","2. Current WAN publishing tools provide little assistance with managing collections of documents. Although the World Wide Web is famous for supporting hypermedia document links, current tools provide scant support for maintaining and operating on collections of related documents as a group. Much progress is needed in this area. For example, an integrated publishing environment should preferably allow users to visually navigate through collections of interconnected documents; to upload, download, and transport collections of documents from one WAN location to another as a group; and to set access privileges or other attributes for a WAN collection as a group. Current tools generally fall far short of these objectives.","3. Current publishing tools provide little assistance with content-based indexing and retrieval. Current navigational tools, such as browsers, provide very little assistance with systematically organizing and searching the information content contained within the numerous sites comprising a network like the Internet. Clearly, as the volume of both information and traffic on the Internet continues to explode, publishers need to be able to make their content available to subscribers in an intelligently organized fashion that facilitates uniform, content-driven search and access.","4. Current publishing tools provide little assistance with asset management. For commercial publishers of proprietary material like newspapers or periodicals, asset management is critical. In other words, publishers need to be able to control and limit access to their WAN documents, and to keep track of usage for billing and other purposes. Yet, currently available tools for WAN publishing generally ignore this area almost completely.","5. Current Publishing tools do not address the creation of application programs. For on-line network publishing to realize its full potential, publishers will want to do more than simply dump passive, one-way content onto the Internet. They will want to provide application programs allowing network users to take advantage of interactive on-line services such as subscribing to a publication, registering for a conference, or perhaps even more exotic applications like participating in multi-player games contests. Current network publishing and authoring tools largely ignore this area.","Accordingly, there is a great need for a new development platform for distributed publishing that overcomes the various limitations described above. This need is especially pronounced and important in view of the rapid expansion of interest in the Internet and the Web, and the tremendous economic opportunities presently available to publishers if a suitable development platform can be provided. Recently, authoring tools have begun to emerge, which attack some of the foregoing problems in piecemeal fashion. See at pp. 110\u2013196. However, there remains a great need for a comprehensive solution to the problems described, and especially for an authoring\/publishing tool that is truly and fully network-integrated.","We disclose herein a development platform technology for publishing hypermedia documents across wide area networks (\u201cWAN's\u201d). This technology supports key publishing functions including document authoring, management and publishing of document collections, and support for database operations and interactive application program development. These functions are supported in a uniquely and fully WAN-integrated manner, as described further below.","In one feature of the present invention, a WAN document residing on a WAN server may be accessed via a hypermedia link, edited, and stored to the same server or any other WAN server, using a client computer coupled to the same server or any other WAN server. The processes of accessing, editing, and storing may be performed using a seamless user interface on the client computer. By \u201cseamless\u201d user interface we mean that users are not required to request additional steps such as intermediate copying or storage of the document being edited, or to switch back and forth among distinct \u201cmodes\u201d or interfaces. Thus, browsing and editing of WAN documents is truly integrated. A related feature of the invention allows convenient transfers of content and\/or hypermedia links among a plurality of WAN documents, such as by \u201ccut and paste\u201d or \u201cdrag and drop\u201d copying. Another related feature provides immediate execution and feedback for any display instructions added to the document using a standard WAN mark-up language.","In another feature of the present invention, at least two WAN documents residing on the same or different WAN servers are accessed, and a hypermedia link addressing one of the documents is inserted into another. Once again, the processes of accessing and editing are performed using a seamless user interface on a client computer. In a related feature of the invention, a list of suggested target hypermedia links is automatically generated using statistical language processing techniques, and the link to be inserted is interactively chosen from that list.","Another feature of the present invention provides a method for publishing and managing a collection of related documents on a WAN. The related documents to be included in the collection are specified, and a desired operation (such as setting access controls or changing location) may then be performed collectively on each document in the collection, simply by interactively issuing a single command corresponding to the operation. A related feature includes hypermedia links between documents of the collection, which address target documents relatively to source documents; i.e., each link address does not specify an absolute address for the target independently of the source. In another related feature, elements of the collection including documents and hypermedia links are graphically depicted using icons and connecting lines, thereby facilitating convenient, visual navigation and organization of the collection.","In a further feature, the present invention includes a method for providing form-driven interactive services on a WAN. A form-driven service is developed by creating a template form comprising one or more informational fields, as well as one or more hypermedia links addressing a database system or other utility program stored on an application server. The form-driven service is utilized by filling in the informational fields, and \u201cclicking\u201d or otherwise signalling on the hypermedia link when ready. In response, the application server is sent an appropriate WAN message, and processes the form. These steps (except the last step) are performed using a seamless user interface environment, so there is once again no need for users to switch interfaces or request any intermediate copying in order to perform the process of creating and filling in a template form and signalling when the form is ready for processing.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"],"b":["20","68","66","64","62","60","10","20","20","50"],"i":["d ","d","d ","d"]},"As described in much greater detail below, client software  and server software  preferably share the responsibility for providing advantageous and innovative electronic publishing capabilities in accordance with the present invention. Note that a user of client computer seeking the benefits of the present invention need only have client software  available on client computer , and all or part of server software  available on server (depending on the particular features desired). The user can then advantageously access and publish documents to and from the remainder of the WAN in accordance with the present invention, even though other computer systems on the WAN have not been similarly modified or upgraded.","The inventors are, as of this writing, in the process of developing a preferred embodiment of the present invention including client software  called \u201cNaviPress\u201d and server software  called \u201cNaviServer.\u201d As a supplement to the detailed description provided below, an Appendix is provided herewith which contains illustrative source code, architectural specifications entitled \u201cNaviPress and NaviServer: A Client-Server Publishing System for the World-Wide Web\u201d (hereinafter \u201cWhite Paper\u201d), and excerpts from a draft User Manual for NaviPress and NaviServer. The reader is referred to the Appendix for more details regarding this preferred embodiment, and the Appendix materials are incorporated herein in their entirety by this reference.","The present invention enables users to access, edit, and store documents distributed throughout a WAN, in the advantageous manner of state-of-the-art, private computer or local area network word processing tools. In accordance with the present invention, the basic process framework by which WAN documents are accessed, edited, and stored is seamless and is substantially the same as, if all steps occurred locally on a private computer. In particular, users are not required to perform any intermediary downloading or copying steps, or to switch back and forth among distinct \u201cmodes\u201d or interfaces in order to access and browse WAN documents, to edit them, and to store them.","As a more concrete illustration of this capability,  illustrates a preferred, menu-driven document editor in accordance with the present invention. Typically, menu bar  would be displayed continually at the top of a computer display \u201cwindow\u201d in which a particular document is being edited. \u201cPull-down\u201d menus, such as \u201cfile\u201d menu , are displayed when a user selects a corresponding item from command bar , preferably using a cursor control device. For example, file menu  includes commands to \u201copen\u201d existing documents for editing, and to \u201csave\u201d such documents as revised, etc. This general, menu-driven methodology is of course by now familiar to those of ordinary skill in the relevant arts. The present invention enables these capabilities to be applied seamlessly across a wide area network. In other words, a user can conveniently access, edit, and save any WAN document in much the same way as the user has been accustomed to doing with respect to documents residing locally on the user's private, personal computer. Consider a scenario in which multiple WAN hypermedia documents are being worked upon. As indicated in , edit menu  includes \u201ccut and paste\u201d commands allowing text and other information to be transferred conveniently between multiple WAN documents. \u201cCut\u201d and \u201ccopy\u201d commands will typically post to a \u201cclipboard\u201d (i.e., temporary storage) selected content from any document being edited, while the \u201cpaste\u201d command will insert whatever content is currently held in the clipboard into a different document at a point of insertion selected by the user.","The present invention provides further advantages in the context of hypermedia WAN documents, as illustrated by the scenarios described in the flow charts of and . With respect to , at step  the user of client computer invokes file menu  to access a source document, such as by \u201copening\u201d an existing document located on any WAN server. In this example, the source document contains a hypermedia link addressing a target document, located on the same or any other WAN server. At step , the user accesses the target document by \u201cclicking\u201d on the hypermedia link using a cursor control device, which immediately opens the target document for editing in accordance with menu bar , preferably in a separate document window.","At step , the user can immediately edit and revise the accessed target document. This step preferably includes use of a markup language recognized on the WAN, such as html; elements menu  and format menu  in  provide convenient tools for creating and editing html content with immediate WYSIWYG feedback. The editing step also preferably includes interactively transferring or copying any selected portion of the source document to the target document (or vice versa), such as by \u201ccutting and pasting\u201d or by \u201cdragging and dropping\u201d the selected portion using a cursor control device. Moreover, the copied portion may include hypermedia links (URL's) or other mark-up codes, and any such mark-up codes will immediately be active as soon as inserted into the target document. Because the browsing and editing environment is seamless in accordance with the present invention, these editing tasks can now be performed without requiring users to switch between separate interface modes or to temporarily download documents into local storage, as was traditionally necessary.","Finally, at step , the target document is saved as revised to any WAN server by using the \u201csave\u201d or \u201csave as\u201d commands of file menu . Note that server , the source server, target server, and the ultimate destination server of the target document may all be the same server, or may all be different.","In the scenario described in , at steps  and  the user of client computer accesses a source document and a target document, such as by invoking file menu . The source and target may originally be located on any wan servers. At step , the \u201ccopy URL\u201d command of edit menu  is used to post a hypermedia pointer addressing the target document onto a clipboard for temporary storage. (Recall that \u201cURL\u201d is the term for a hypermedia link on the World Wide Web, as discussed earlier in the Background section.) At step , the \u201cpaste URL\u201d command of edit menu  is used to paste the stored hypermedia link onto a selected \u201canchor\u201d item of content within the source document. At step , this new document, including the new hypermedia link, may be \u201cpublished\u201d by storing it to any WAN server, simply by using the \u201csave\u201d commands of file menu . Thus, in accordance with the present invention, publishing hypermedia content across a WAN is achieved in a highly advantageous manner that fully and seamlessly integrates hypermedia browsing and editing.","As briefly noted above, the WAN-integrated editing environment is enhanced by elements menu  and format menu  which provide WYSIWYG feedback for html markup authoring without any need for users to separately launch a browser program or upload the document being edited. Other, preferred features of the editing environment depicted in  include WAN browser menu , display options and preferences, and access to help. Menu bar  further provides access to various WAN tools and services discussed further below, including \u201cNaviLinks\u201d link generation; form-driven database update and search, and asset administration services.","In summary, prior art technology has traditionally separated between WAN \u201cbrowsing\u201d on one hand, in which WAN documents are accessed and mark-up codes are interpreted and executed, and document editing on the other hand, in which documents are modified. Conventionally, users must manually switch between distinct browsing and editing environments or \u201cmodes,\u201d and\/or perform intermediate steps in which WAN documents of interest are downloaded to the user's private local storage, thereafter edited, and thereafter uploaded back to the WAN. The present invention now enables users to access WAN documents, copy content (including hypermedia links and other mark-up codes) among multiple WAN documents, and execute WAN mark-up codes, all in a seamless fashion without requiring intermediate steps. Moreover, these capabilities require only the user's computer system to include software implementing the browsing and editing environment, and do not require any modification of other WAN computers.","For more details on an exemplary embodiment of the WAN document editing and browsing environment, the user is referred to the Appendix, and especially to the draft User Manual at Chapters 2, 3, and Appendix A. Exemplary source code for use in implementing this unique environment is also included in the Appendix.","Working With Collections of WAN Documents","Another aspect of the present invention is the ability to publish, maintain, and otherwise operate on collections of multiple, related documents as a group. This is an especially valuable capability in the context of hypermedia collections, where there are explicit links between specific, related portions of documents.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["100","100","102","104","106"]},"A related aspect of this invention involves the ability to transport collections of documents interrelated by hypermedia links in a convenient manner. Those of skill in the art recognize that when the target reference of a hypermedia link is moved, the link is thereby \u201cbroken,\u201d much like the address on a letter to a recipient who has moved and left no forwarding address. Thus, moving a collection of documents interrelated by numerous hypermedia links has been extremely onerous using prior art technology, since the hypermedia links must manually be \u201cfixed\u201d to address new locations.","In accordance with the present invention, one or more relative hypermedia links are preferably created among the documents of a collection. A \u201crelative\u201d link only addresses its target document relative to the source document's address. In other words, only a portion of the full target address is given, namely, a portion sufficient to locate the target relative to the source. Preferably, a specification of a hierarchical directory structure for each collection is maintained in a separate file along with the collection, so that only the topmost page in the collection need be tied to an absolute address, while other hypermedia links within the collection can be made relative and still be interpreted properly. Sample listings for such a specification are included on the following pages. Because the links are relative, they do not need to be modified when the collection is moved.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"259pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"navidoc 1.0"},{"entry":"graph=1"},{"entry":"nametype=0"},{"entry":"title="},{"entry":"style="},{"entry":"template="},{"entry":"Pages:"},{"entry":"\u2033top.htm\u2033 Up=\u2033\u2033 Style=\u2033\u2033 Title=\u2033The NaviServer Documentation\u2033 1 94 467"},{"entry":"\u2033install.htm\u2033 Up=\u2033\u2033Style=\u2033\u2033 Title=\u2033Installing the NaviServer\u2033 1"},{"entry":"\u2033startup.htm\u2033 Up=\u2033\u2033 Style=\u2033\u2033 Title=\u2033Starting up the NaviServer\u2033 1"},{"entry":"\u2033security.htm\u2033 Up=\u2033\u2033 Style=\u2033\u2033 Title=\u2033Security on the NaviServer\u2033 1"},{"entry":"\u2033costs.htm\u2033 Up=\u2033\u2033 Style=\u2033\u2033 Title=\u2033Charging money for access \u2033 1"},{"entry":"\u2033search.htm\u2033 Up=\u2033\u2033 Style=\u2033\u2033 Title=\u2033Searching the NaviServer\u2033 1"},{"entry":"\u2033srchdata.htm\u2033 Up=\u2033\u2033 Style=\u2033\u2033 Title=\u2033Searching Database Tables\u2033 1"},{"entry":"\u2033srchpage.htm\u2033 Up=\u2033\u2033 Style=\u2033\u2033 Title=\u2033Searching for Pages\u2033 1"},{"entry":"\u2033hitlist.htm\u2033 Up=\u2033\u2033 Style=\u2033\u2033 Title=\u2033Hitlists and Hittabies\u2033 1"},{"entry":"\u2033hilite.htm\u2033 Up=\u2033\u2033 Style=\u2033\u2033 Title=\u2033Hiliting and MoreLikeThis\u2033 1"},{"entry":"\u2033under.htm\u2033 Up=\u2033\u2033 Styles=\u2033\u2033 Title=\u2033Coming Soon!\u2033 1"},{"entry":"\u2033entup.htm\u2033 Up=\u2033\u2033 Style=\u2033\u2033 Title=Entering Data and Updating It\u2033 1"},{"entry":"\u2033smartlnk.htm=\u2033\u2033 Up=\u2033\u2033 Style=\u2033\u2033 Title=\u2033SmartLinking\u2033 1"},{"entry":"\u2033describe.htm\u2033 Up=\u2033\u2033 Style=\u2033\u2033 Title=\u2033Describing Pages\u2033 1"},{"entry":"\u2033custom.htm\u2033 Up=\u2033\u2033 Style=\u2033\u2033 Title=\u2033Customizing Entry, Update and Search Forms\u2033 1"},{"entry":"\u2033archive.htm\u2033 Up=\u2033\u2033 Style=\u2033\u2033 Title=\u2033Archive Versioning\u2033 1"},{"entry":"\u2033logging.htm\u2033 Up=\u2033\u2033 Style=\u2033\u2033 Title=\u2033Logging\u2033 1"},{"entry":"\u2033ops.htm\u2033 Up=\u2033\u2033 Style=\u2033\u2033 Title=\u2033NaviServer URL Reference\u2033 1"},{"entry":"\u2033maktable.htm\u2033 Up=\u2033\u2033 Style=\u2033\u2033 Title=\u2033Creating.and Dropping Tables\u2033 1"},{"entry":"\u2033tables.htm\u2033 Up=\u2033\u2033 Style=\u2033\u2033 Title=\u2033NaviServer System Tables\u2033 1"},{"entry":"\u2033page21.htm\u2033 Up=\u2033\u2033 Style=\u2033\u2033 Title=\u2033Please title this page.

preferred embodiment of the MiniWeb facility that has been described includes an advantageous, graphical front-end for viewing and navigating within a collection of hypermedia documents.  illustrates an example of such a miniweb interface. Display icons each represent corresponding documents located anywhere on the WAN, or anywhere within the user's local storage. Arrow icons indicate hypermedia links between documents, in the direction indicated by the arrows. Thus, the miniweb display provides an intuitive, graphical view of the relationship among a collection of hypermedia documents.","The graphical interface of  is preferably displayed in a separate window of client computer , alongside document editing windows in accordance with . Users can preferably use the miniweb window as a short-cut to access desired documents within a collection by simply \u201cdouble-clicking\u201d on the corresponding icon in the miniweb, or by \u201cdragging and dropping\u201d an icon from the miniweb onto a document editing window. Moreover, the precise appearance of icons and connecting arrows preferably indicates the nature or state of the corresponding document or link. For example, icon represents a sound file, while icon is a hypermedia \u201cweb\u201d document, as suggested by the appearance of those two icons. Further, the color and shading of icons and arrows may indicate such states as a modified and unsaved document, or a relative or absolute address link. For more details regarding the graphical interface of  and its preferred uses, the reader is referred to the draft User Manual in the Appendix, and particularly chapters 4 Appendix B thereto. Once again, source code included in the Appendix provides exemplary means for implementing the miniweb facility we have described.","Automated Authoring of WAN Hypermedia: \u201cNaviLinks\u201d","Most content on the World Wide Web is not originally created as hypermedia. For example, news articles, product brochures, and other literature originally created for non-interactive environments do not initially contain any hypermedia links to other documents. Such links must be creatively defined and implemented. A preferred feature of the present invention provides assistance in the authoring of hypermedia WAN documents, by facilitating and partially automating the creation of useful hypermedia links. This facility, which we call \u201cNaviLinks\u201d herein, uses statistical language processing algorithms to generate automatically a list of suggested, possible hypermedia links between a source document and a collection of potential target documents. A human author can then review the suggestions in a convenient manner, and choose to incorporate, modify, or discard them.","The NaviLinks facility is preferably integrated along with the publishing tools described above, and as illustrated in the \u201cscreen shots\u201d of and . Both figures depict document editing window , including menu bar  in accordance with the teachings of  and the earlier discussion herein. A document entitled \u201cWild Rice Risotto\u201d(evidently a recipe) is currently open within window . In the example shown, the user has already invoked the NaviLinks facility for assistance in creating hypermedia links from the recipe document to related documents. NaviLinks window  is thus shown overlapping on document editing window . Window  displays list  of suggested anchor items. An \u201canchor\u201d item is an item of content within a source document encoded as a hypermedia link; users \u201cclick\u201d on anchor items to bring up linked target documents. Thus, the highlighted entry in list  corresponds to item  in the recipe document, namely, the recipe author's name (Carey Schnell-Wright). NaviLinks window  also displays list  of potential target documents for the currently highlighted anchor item. The lists of suggested anchor items and potential targets are generated automatically, preferably using statistical language processing techniques such as provided in the Xerox Lexical Technology (\u201cXLT\u201d) package commercially available from the Xerox Corporation.","Because of the integrated nature of the tools described herein in accordance with the present invention, the process of exploring and selecting among the suggested anchor items and corresponding hypermedia links shown in  can be performed very conveniently. For each anchor item in list , a suggested link in list  can be encoded directly onto the anchor item in the source document by pressing \u201cApply\u201d button ; or, the target document addressed by the suggested link can itself be accessed and edited in yet another editing window, by pressing \u201cShow Page\u201d button . illustrates the results of pressing these buttons. The visual appearance of anchor item  is updated to indicate that it is now encoded as an URL (i.e., a hypermedia link), as a result of the user \u201capplying\u201d a suggested link. In addition, as a result of the user selecting a \u201cShow Page\u201d request, document editing window  has been created overlapping on windows  and , and displays an open WAN document containing another recipe by the same author and entitled \u201cMarjoram Potato Casserole.\u201d","WAN-Integrated, Form-Driven, Interactive Services","A hypermedia publishing platform should preferably support not only the authoring and distribution content, but also a variety of form-driven interactive services, such as content-based indexing of documents, and controlled access to proprietary WAN documents. Preferably, application developers and end-users should be able to generate and store new forms, retrieve existing forms, fill out forms, and submit them for appropriate processing, all in a convenient and seamless manner utilizing an integrated editing and browsing environment such as described earlier in connection with .","A great many, desirable, interactive WAN services are database-oriented. For example, a service might involve a particular database \u201cview\u201d(i.e., a specified set of indices) for indexing WAN documents, for managing historical versions of WAN documents, for collecting and reviewing customer feedback, or for relating specified access controls (such as security restrictions and access costs, perhaps of a hierarchical nature) to specific, proprietary WAN documents. Therefore, the form-driven interface environment of the present invention is preferably integrated not only with editing and browsing tools as previously described, but also with a database management system such as the Illustra object relational database management system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 10","FIG. 10","FIG. 10"],"b":["140","20","160","160","70","140","162","162","164","140","50","10","50"],"i":["d ","a","a\u2013n","a","a\u2013n ","a","d "]},"Once a database table is created, at step  template forms are generated for interactively updating and searching the database described by the new table. Updating, such as by adding a new database entry, may interactively be performed using a form as illustrated in , in which informational fields correspond to the data fields specified in the database table. Thus, a user who accesses the entry form at step  can then describe the database attribute values for a new entry at step  simply by filling in informational fields . Analogous comments apply with regard to forms for submitting a specific database search or query, such as the form of which includes corresponding information fields .","Because description and search forms are integrated with the authoring environment previously described, as indicated by the presence of menu bar  in , , and , users can seamlessly take full advantage of the editing capabilities of that environment in the course of filling out description or search forms. For example, while a WAN document is being accessed and edited by the user in one display window, the user can fill out a corresponding description form or access control form in another window, concurrently. Moreover, users can even modify and customize the style and appearance of entry or search forms, by using the editing facilities of menu bar , such as the html mark-up commands of the Elements and Format menus (as discussed previously in connection with ). For example, depicts an edited version of that still corresponds to the database table of . Thus, fields of map directly onto fields of , but are merely displayed in a somewhat different appearance.","Thus, the steps of generating and filling in new tables, entry forms, and search forms are seamlessly integrated with the editing and browsing environment previously described. Moreover, even the step of submitting a completed form to the application server for processing may likewise be performed in seamless fashion together with the preceding steps. Thus, at step , a user who has completed a database entry or search form submits the form to the application server by pressing a hypermedia \u201center\u201d button or the like using a cursor control device as indicated by comments  (on ) and  (on ), akin to the \u201ccreate table\u201d button described above in connection with . Entry and search forms are thus \u201clive,\u201d meaning that completing a form and interactively signalling a hypermedia link included in the form will automatically send an appropriate message to the application server, causing server software  to initiate appropriate database actions at step . The user need not invoke a separate interface, copy any files, or compose any database scripts. Thus, to enjoy interactive database services, users can simply fill out forms using the same environment they use to access and edit documents.","Note that a WAN document referenced in a database may preferably be located anywhere in the WAN in accordance with the present invention, and need not be local to the application server. From the standpoint of server software  the database tables reference and index WAN-compatible URL's, (i.e., WAN address pointers), and so need not store documents locally. Note also that, multiple tables and hence multiple indexing views and forms covering the same documents are possible. For example, an administrator might systematically index all documents on a server, while individual users might create their own indexing schemes for documents and criteria of special interest.","For more details regarding various menu-driven interactive services provided by a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the reader is referred to the Appendix, and especially to chapter 5 of the draft User Manual and chapter 3.3 of the White Paper. Details regarding a preferred architecture and implementation for server software  in support of menu-driven interactive database services will now be described.","Preferred embodiments of client software  (\u201cNaviPress\u201d) and server software  (\u201cNaviServer\u201d) communicate through a WAN hypermedia protocol such as http. All requests and responses between client and server are accomplished through http. Thus, NaviPress sends requests to NaviServer using GET, PUT, POST, BROWSE, and DELETE methods, and NaviServer returns results using standard http return codes, as well as some special content types in accordance with the present invention. Both NaviPress and NaviServer are thus \u201copen\u201d in the sense that any http-compliant client computer can access most services provided by NaviServer, and NaviPress can be used with any http-compliant WAN server.","NaviPress requests for services from NaviServer may contain ordinary URL's, but sometimes contain special URL's that map to server functions. If a request is not immediately serviceable\u2014e.g., GET a page for browsing\u2014NaviServer checks to see if the URL contains a special data field encoding a registered operation that maps to server-specific processing code. For example, NaviServer preferably includes about twenty pre-installed operations, listed in Table 1, for implementing common server functions such as publishing, administration, information retrieval, and document management functions. These special URL's take the general form of \u201c\/prefix\/operation\/arguments,\u201d where the \u201carguments\u201d are an arbitrarily long string that is passed to the \u201coperation.\u201d The NaviServer looks for registered prefixes and recognized operations, and then passes the request to the appropriate utility program or process. NaviServer is designed so that custom services can be added easily. Application developers can register new operations with their own unique prefixes. Since a standard, open protocol is used for communications between client and server, even vendors of other authoring tools can write interfaces that advantageously publish content to a server running NaviServer software.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0068"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"280pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Examples of NaviServer operations"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["GetSearchFormPicker","Get list of links to a variety of search forms installed on the"]},{"entry":[{},"server.
