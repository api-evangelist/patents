title: Configurable state model for supply chain management
abstract: Methods and systems for supply chain management in accordance with a state model. A supply chain management system includes a transaction state module within an inter-enterprise server assessable by trading partners. The transaction state module can define a state model which allows a trading partner to view a transaction and perform an action in accordance with a state of the transaction. The state model describes, in association with each state, which of the trading partners have visibility to the transaction and ability to perform an action. The trading partners can include consumers, retailers, distributors, etc. The transactions can include a forecast order, a purchase order, a billing, a product shipment, a payment, an invoice, a credit memo, a request for quote (RFQ), and a return material authorization (RMA). States of the transaction can include, for example, create, open, public view, private view, publish, commit, cancel, supersede, and the like.

Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to supply chain management, and more specifically, to inter-enterprise supply chain management software that manages supply chain transaction data using programs.","2. Description of the Related Art","Outsourcing has become very popular in all sectors of the industry and especially in product manufacturing. Companies no longer manufacture and assemble all components of a product themselves, but outsource most or all parts of the development, manufacturing, distribution, and marketing of the product. For example, companies A and B may manufacture and sell parts to company C. Company C may assemble those parts and sell assembled modules of a product to company D. Company D may assemble such modules together with other components and modules obtained from other companies, and sell the final product to Company E. Company E may sell the product under its brand to a distributor Company F which sells the final product to a retailer company G, which eventually sells the final product to the end consumer.","Since most or all parts of the development, manufacturing, distribution, and marketing of the product are outsourced, no single company has control of all the supply chain transaction data and information relating to the overall development, manufacturing, distribution, and marketing of the product. Therefore, enterprise supply chain management software that manages the data relating to the role played by only one company in the process of development, manufacturing, distribution, and marketing of the product cannot effectively manage the entire outsourcing process.","Conventional inter-enterprise supply chain management software resides in a separate location apart from and between the various companies. The various companies involved in such process exchange data with the conventional inter-enterprise supply chain management software according to the format of their own enterprise supply chain management software, and are able to view or perform actions on certain supply chain management transaction data (e.g., placing an order, paying an invoice) using the conventional inter-enterprise supply chain management software. At the same time, such companies are able to obtain and monitor information on the entire process of development, manufacturing, distribution, and marketing of the product through the conventional inter-enterprise supply chain management software.","One shortcoming of the conventional inter-enterprise supply chain management software is that transactions are typically presented from one point of view. In other words, similar options for viewing and performing actions against a transaction can be presented to each user regardless of their role in the transaction or a current state of the transaction.","Therefore, what is needed is a method of system for allowing accessibility to transactions in a supply chain management system in accordance with a configurable state model.","The present invention provides methods and systems for supply chain management in accordance with a state model. In one embodiment, a supply chain management system includes a transaction state module within an inter-enterprise server assessable by trading partners. The transaction state module can define a state model which allows a trading partner to view a transaction and perform an action in accordance with a state of the transaction. The state model describes, in association with each state, which of the trading partners have visibility to the transaction and ability to perform an action. The trading partners can include consumers, retailers, distributors, etc. The transactions can include a forecast of an order or an actual order. States of the transaction can include, for example, create, open, public view, private view, publish, commit, cancel, supersede, and the like.","In one embodiment, a default state model establishes parameters based on a role of the trading partner in the supply chain. For example, a retailer that originally places a transaction can have full visibility and action privileges throughout the lifecycle of the transaction. On the other hand, a supplier may only be able to view a transaction once it has been committed to by the retailer. In addition, the supplier may be able to close the transaction, while the retailer is not able to do so. The privileges can be set according to factors such as business processes, company policy, or industry norms.","Advantageously, the supply chain management system can automatically control access on a per-trading partner basis using the configurable state model.","The features and advantages described herein are not all inclusive, and, in particular, many additional features and advantages will be apparent to one skilled in the art in view of the drawings, specifications, and claims. Moreover, it should be noted that the language used in the specification has been principally selected for readability and instructional purposes and may not have been selected to circumscribe the claimed invention.","The figures depict embodiments of the present invention for purposes of illustration only. One skilled in the art will readily recognize from the following discussion that alternative embodiments of the structures and methods illustrated herein may be employed without departing from the principles of the invention described herein.","Methods and systems for supply chain management with a state model are described. Generally, the state model refers to a status of a transaction that is within a supply chain. The status can be affected by various trading partners that perform actions with respect to the transaction. For example, a supplier can check the availability of goods at a central warehouse responsive to a purchase order received from a retailer. In the meantime, the supplier can change the state of the purchase order from open to pending commit. Satisfied that the order can be fulfilled, the supplier can change the state from pending commit to commit. The goods can be shipped from a central warehouse to a regional warehouse and updated within the supplier's proprietary supply chain management system without affecting the information available to the retailer (i.e., no change in state). Once the shipping has occurred, the retailer can change the state from pending or commit to close. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the embodiment described herein with respect to a supply chain is only exemplary and can be modified for different applications such as a package delivery system or the like.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","101","102","104","106","108","110","112","114","116","102","116","120","122","124","126","128","130","122","104","106","120","130"]},"Trading partners - can exchange supply chain data with inter-enterprise server  and other trading partners -. Trading partners - can comprise a computing device (e.g., a personal computer or server device) operated by a company or other type of entity involved in the supply chain. Trading partners - can have different roles relative to other trading partners - as transactions progress through the supply chain. The roles within system  can include buyers, manufacturers, suppliers, and vendors. Trading partners - typically maintain their own enterprise supply chain management software for managing its own supply chain transaction data. However, some of the supply chain transaction data is shared with other trading partners - for the purpose of tracking. More specifically, trading partners - can change a state associated with the transaction. Changes in state can result from various actions such as placing a purchase order (PO), billing, shipping a product, remitting a payment, etc. For example, one trading partner  may be waiting for parts to arrive from another trading partner , but would not know whether such parts were shipped from the trading partner  unless trading partner  makes such information available to trading partner . In one embodiment, trading partners - are only able to view transactions in accordance with a state model. In another embodiment, trading partners - are only able to make changes to the state in accordance with the state model.","Inter-enterprise server  exchanges the supply chain data with trading partners - as described. Inter-enterprise server  can be a computing device (e.g., a personal computer or a server device) operated by a service provider for supply chain management. In one embodiment, inter-enterprise server  manages a state model associated with each transaction. When trading partners - access inter-enterprise server  to view the supply chain data and to potentially perform actions on the transactions, inter-enterprise server  allows viewing or changes in accordance with the state model. Inter-enterprise server  and the state models are described in further detail below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["101","101","201","202","203","204","101"]},"In one embodiment, web interface  interfaces with the trading partners by packing and unpacking the supply chain data in data packets suitable for transport across the network (e.g., TCP\/IP packets). Web interface  can also provide a set of application programming interfaces, or APIs, for issuing commands to transaction state module .","Transaction state module  allows configuration of state models for transactions. For example, a wizard displays a set of user interfaces such as those illustrated below. Transaction state module  stores the configurations in a memory device (not shown) such as hard drive or a RAM device. In response to access by a trading partner -, transactions state module  refers to the state model to determine visibility configurations and outputs supply chain data from supply chain database . When actions are requested against the transaction, transaction state module  refers to the state model to determine action configurations and can implement business logic rules from business logic module . For example, business logic module can send out an e-mail to a purchasing department of an initiating trading partner once an order has been closed. Methods implemented within transaction state module  are discussed further below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","300","100"]},"A state model is defined  by, for example, an administrator of supply chain management system, a trading partner (e.g., one of trading partners -), or a vendor (e.g., default state models) using, for example, user interfaces shown in . More specifically,  shows a user interface  for entering general information  about the state model such as name  and transaction type .  shows a user interface  for viewing transaction visibility for each of the trading partners, and  shows a user interface  for selecting transaction visibility .  shows a user interface  for selecting actions for state transitions.  shows a user interface  for selecting how a role of the trading partner that performs an action will affect the state. In one embodiment, the state model is pre-defined, and thus only needs to be associated with a particular transaction. Additionally, default state models that are configured according to industry norms can be supplied by a vendor. The trading partner can either modify an existing state model or fully customize the state model to suit their business process.","The availability of a transaction refers to which of the trading partners will be able to view, or have visibility to, the transaction. For example, a supplier may be unable to view a transaction as a public draft of a buyer until it is committed. Table 1 is an example of transaction availability for a forecast transaction; table 2 is an example of transaction availability for a create order action; and table 3 is an example of transaction availability for an order

For example, a buyer can place an order for televisions with a manufacturer. In turn, the manufacturer can place several orders for components from its suppliers.","The trading partner associates  the state model with the transaction.

order in which the steps of the methods of the present invention are performed is purely illustrative in nature. The steps can be performed in any order or in parallel, unless otherwise indicated by the present disclosure. The methods of the present invention may be performed in hardware, firmware, software, or any combination thereof operating on a single computer or multiple computers of any type. Software embodying the present invention may comprise computer instructions in any form (e.g., source code, object code, interpreted code, etc.) stored in any computer-readable storage medium (e.g., a ROM, a RAM, a magnetic media, a compact disc, a DVD, etc.). Such software may also be in the form of an electrical data signal embodied in a carrier wave propagating on a conductive medium or in the form of light pulses that propagate through an optical fiber.","While particular embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that changes and modifications may be made without departing from this invention in its broader aspect and, therefore, the appended claims are to encompass within their scope all such changes and modifications, as fall within the true spirit of this invention.","In the above description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the invention. It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the invention can be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring the invention.","Reference in the specification to \u201cone embodiment\u201d or \u201can embodiment\u201d means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the invention. The appearances of the phrase \u201cin one embodiment\u201d in various places in the specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment.","Some portions of the detailed description are presented in terms of algorithms and symbolic representations of operations on data bits within a computer memory. These algorithmic descriptions and representations are the means used by those skilled in the data processing arts to most effectively convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. An algorithm is here, and generally, conceived to be a self-consistent sequence of steps leading to a desired result. The steps are those requiring physical manipulations of physical quantities. Usually, though not necessarily, these quantities take the form of electrical or magnetic signals capable of being stored, transferred, combined, compared, and otherwise manipulated. It has proven convenient at times, principally for reasons of common usage, to refer to these signals as bits, values, elements, symbols, characters, terms, numbers, or the like.","It should be borne in mind, however, that all of these and similar terms are to be associated with the appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels applied to these quantities. Unless specifically stated otherwise as apparent from the discussion, it is appreciated that throughout the description, discussions utilizing terms such as \u201cprocessing\u201d or \u201ccomputing\u201d or \u201ccalculating\u201d or \u201cdetermining\u201d or \u201cdisplaying\u201d or the like, refer to the action and processes of a computer system, or similar electronic computing device, that manipulates and transforms data represented as physical (electronic) quantities within the computer system's registers and memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the computer system memories or registers or other such information storage, transmission or display devices.","The present invention also relates to an apparatus for performing the operations herein. This apparatus can be specially constructed for the required purposes, or it can comprise a general-purpose computer selectively activated or reconfigured by a computer program stored in the computer. Such a computer program can be stored in a computer readable storage medium, such as, but is not limited to, any type of disk including floppy disks, optical disks, CD-ROMs, and magnetic-optical disks, read-only memories (ROMs), random access memories (RAMs), EPROMs, EEPROMs, magnetic or optical cards, or any type of media suitable for storing electronic instructions, and each coupled to a computer system bus.","The algorithms and modules presented herein are not inherently related to any particular computer or other apparatus. Various general-purpose systems can be used with programs in accordance with the teachings herein, or it may prove convenient to construct more specialized apparatuses to perform the method steps. The required structure for a variety of these systems will appear from the description below. In addition, the present invention is not described with reference to any particular programming language. It will be appreciated that a variety of programming languages can be used to implement the teachings of the invention as described herein. Furthermore, as will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the relevant art, the modules, features, attributes, methodologies, and other aspects of the invention can be implemented as software, hardware, firmware or any combination of the three. Of course, wherever a component of the present invention is implemented as software, the component can be implemented as a standalone program, as part of a larger program, as a plurality of separate programs, as a statically or dynamically linked library, as a kernel loadable module, as a device driver, and\/or in every and any other way known now or in the future to those of skill in the art of computer programming. Additionally, the present invention is in no way limited to implementation in any specific operating system or environment.","It will be understood by those skilled in the relevant art that the above-described implementations are merely exemplary, and many changes can be made without departing from the true spirit and scope of the present invention. Therefore, it is intended by the appended claims to cover all such changes and modifications that come within the true spirit and scope of this invention."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The teachings of the present invention can be readily understood by considering the following detailed description in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.
