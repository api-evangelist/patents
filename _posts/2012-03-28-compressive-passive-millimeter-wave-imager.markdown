Specifically, the present invention relates to compressive passive millimeter wave imaging.","Passive millimeter wave (MMW) imaging has many applications such as remote sensing of the Earth's resources, aircraft landing in optically obscure weather, and security point inspection of concealed weapons in humans. The underlying principle is the measurement of Planck's blackbody radiation of materials at millimeter wavelengths. The main advantage of passive MMW imaging is that it provides information about ground-based targets under all weather conditions; optical systems (visible and IR), on the other hand, require clear atmospheric conditions for reliable operation. For example, the atmospheric attenuation at MMW frequencies is 0.07 to 3 dB\/km in drizzle and fog, whereas it is one to three orders of magnitude higher at optical frequencies (exceeding 100 dB\/km in foggy conditions). (See, e.g., L. Yujiri, M. Shoucri, and P. Moffa, \u201cPassive millimeter-wave imaging,\u201d IEEE Microwave Magazine, September (2003); R. Appleby and R. N. Anderton, \u201cMillimeter-wave and submillimeter-wave imaging for security and surveillance,\u201d Proc. IEEE, 95, 1683-1690 (2007); A. H. Lettington, D. Dunn, M. Attia, and I. M. Blankson, \u201cPassive millimeter-wave imaging architectures,\u201d J. Optics A: Pure and Applied Optics, 5, S103-S110 (2003)). Excellent image contrast is obtained in outdoor environments due to cold sky-reflected radiation by targets. For example, the apparent temperature of the sky at 94 GHz is 70K in comparison to 220K at infrared wavelengths. Even at the same ambient temperature, there exists variation in MMW thermal contrast of objects because of emissivity differences of objects at these wavelengths, e.g., the emissivity of metal is \u22480, water 0.4, wood 0.4, and concrete 0.8. (M. R. Fetterman, J. Grata, G. Jubic, W. L. Kiser, Jr., and A. Visnansky, \u201cSimulation, acquisition, and analysis of passive millimeter-wave images in remote sensing applications,\u201d Optics Express, 16, 20503-20515 (2008).) As a result, signal \u201cwashouts\u201d do not occur because the apparent temperature between the background and the object are rarely similar.","In addition to imaging, passive millimeter waves can be used to obtain spectroscopic signatures of chemicals based on molecular rotational energy transitions. With a 16-channel filter bank in the 146-154 GHz band, the 150 GHz spectral line of nitric oxide from a test stack at a distance of 600 m from the radiometer has been measured. (N. Gopalsami, S. Bakhtiari, T. W. Elmer, and A. C. Raptis, \u201cApplication of Millimeter-Wave Radiometry for Remote Chemical Detection,\u201d IEEE Trans. on Microwave Theory and Techniques, 56, 700-709 (2008)). While imaging can provide broad area search of facilities for certain observables such as structural changes, traffic, and effluent heat, the spectroscopy system can provide more specific signatures of effluent chemicals from exhaust stacks. Millimeter wave radiation allows for rotational spectroscopy of polar molecules, so it can provide fingerprint signatures of chemicals emanating from material processing facilities.  is an example of an outdoor image that was obtained with a prior system.","A major disadvantage of such a single-pixel detector system is the long scanning time for image acquisition. For example, a 100\u00d7100 pixel image with 1 s integration time per pixel requires a minimum of 2 h 47 min. With such a long imaging time, the imager's value is diminished for applications involving imaging of nonstationary objects or for real-time or near real-time applications. Stemming from the need for faster imaging, there has evolved the concept of compressive sensing which has the potential in reducing the image acquisition time by a factor of 10 or more.","One embodiment of the invention relates to a method for millimeter-wave imaging. A portion of an extended Hadamard mask is positioned. The extended Hadamard mask is within an opening of a template with an opening of size p\u00d7q, the extended Hadamard mask having a size (2p\u22121)\u00d7(2q\u22121) wherein p and q are prime numbers, the Hadamard mask receiving millimeter waves from a source. A portion of the millimeter waves are transmitted through transmit pixels in the Hadamark mask. A portion of the millimeter waves are reflected by reflect pixels in the Hadamark mask. The transmitted portion of the millimeter waves are focused and these focused millimeter waves are received by a detector","Another embodiment relates to a system for passive millimeter wave imaging a source, the system having an extended Hadamard mask comprises a plurality of pixels, the pixels including transmitting pixels and non-transmitting pixels, the transmitting pixels allowing millimeter waves to pass through. The system further including a template with an opening smaller than the extended Hadamard mask, the template is positioned between the source and the extended Hadamard mask. A focusing lens is positioned behind the extended Hadamard mask relative to the source and positioned to receive millimeter waves from the extended Hadamard mask. A receiving antenna is associated with the focusing lens to receive millimeter waves. A radiometer is in communication with the receiving antenna.","Another embodiment relates to a computer-implemented machine for imaging an object, comprising a processor, and a tangible computer-readable medium operatively connected to the processor and including computer code. The computer code is configured to control imaging an object via an imaging lens at an image plane. The computer code positioning a Hadamard mask at the image plane. The computer code is further configured to control interacting millimeter waves from the object with the Hadamark mask.

The computer code is further configured to control focusing the transmitted portion of the millimeter waves. The computer code receiving the focused millimeter waves.","Additional features, advantages, and embodiments of the present disclosure may be set forth from consideration of the following detailed description, drawings, and claims. Moreover, it is to be understood that both the foregoing summary of the present disclosure and the following detailed description are exemplary and intended to provide further explanation without further limiting the scope of the present disclosure claimed.","In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof. In the drawings, similar symbols typically identify similar components, unless context dictates otherwise. The illustrative embodiments described in the detailed description, drawings, and claims are not meant to be limiting. Other embodiments may be utilized, and other changes may be made, without departing from the spirit or scope of the subject matter presented here. It will be readily understood that the aspects of the present disclosure, as generally described herein, and illustrated in the figures, can be arranged, substituted, combined, and designed in a wide variety of different configurations, all of which are explicitly contemplated and made part of this disclosure.","A serious drawback of single-pixel passive millimeter wave (PMMW) imaging and spectroscopy system is the long acquisition time needed to produce a high-fidelity image, arising from two factors: (a) the time to scan the whole scene pixel by pixel and (b) the integration time for each pixel for adequate signal to noise ratio (SNR). Compressive sensing (CS) has been developed for single pixel optical cameras. CS reduces the time necessary for imaging while still producing high-fidelity images by exploiting the sparsity of the data in the image space. Although the efficacy of CS for optical cameras has been proven, its application to PMMW systems is not straightforward. PMMW systems differ from the typical optical camera system in at least two important ways. First, PMMW systems involve longer wavelengths by three to four orders of magnitude. The longer wavelengths cause high diffraction and insertion losses in finite size spatial waveform modulators. Second, PMMW systems involve weaker radiation intensity, often several orders of magnitude difference. The present invention relates to systems and method for utilizing a CS technique for PMMW imagers.","CS takes advantage of the sparsity or compressibility of an image in a domain such that fewer samples can be taken to achieve the image than required for conventional imaging; yet the CS derived image can be nearly exactly reconstructed with minimal loss of information in comparison to convention imaging. Some existing compression mechanisms rely upon bandwidth compression to achieve reduced data size for an image, for example JPEG. In contrast, CS techniques exploit compression in signal\/image structure and collect fewer data, thus saving on imaging time.","Mathematically, an image of size p\u00d7q can be represented by a vector x(i), i=1, 2, . . . , N where N=p\u00d7q. If x is sparse or compressible in some basis \u03a8 resulting from the concatenation of basis functions \u03c8, i=1, . . . N, the vector x may be represented as",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"x","mo":"=","mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"i","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"N"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":["\u03b1","i"]},{"mi":"\u03c8","mn":"1"}],"mo":"\u2062"}}},{"mrow":[{"mi":"where","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"msub":{"mi":["\u03b1","i"]}},{"mrow":[{"mn":"0","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mi":"or"},{"mn":"0","mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}],"mi":["for","i"]},{"mi":["M","and","M"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}],"mrow":{"mo":"<<","mi":"N"}}],"mo":["\u2062","\u2248",">"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}}],"mo":"="}],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mtext":{}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}]}}}}},"This is generally true in most imaging scenarios. In this case, it is possible to design a sampling matrix \u03a6 that operates on x to provide y(i), i=1, . . . , M measurements. The transformation between x and y is represented by\n\n\u2003\u2003(2)\n\nwhere \u03a6 and \u0398 are M\u00d7N matrices.\n","For the sampling matrix it is necessary to choose M samples or the \u03a6 matrix such that the image x can be reconstructed from y with minimal or no loss of information. The acquisition matrix \u03a6 must satisfy the mathematical requirement of restricted isometry property (RIP). Generally speaking, RIP, implies that the rows of \u03a6 and the columns of \u03a9 in (2) must be incoherent. In one embodiment, the RIP and coherence requirements can be satisfied by simply selecting \u03a6 as a random matrix, independent of \u03a8 or x. An example of an \u03a6 matrix is a series of M random masks each having a size p\u00d7q that modulates the scene to provide M projections of the scene that constitute the CS measurements. In one embodiment, each pixel in the series of M random masks is either transmitting (\u201c1\u201d) or blocking (\u201c0\u201d).","The image reconstruction is generally posed as an lnorm optimization problem:\n\n\u03b1=argmin \u2225\u03b1\u2032\u2225such that \u0398\u03b1\u2032=\u03b3\u2003\u2003(3)\n\nIf the signal is K sparse (i.e., \u03b1=0 for i>K), then the algorithm can exactly recover the signal using only\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mi":"M","mo":"\u2265","mrow":{"mi":"cK","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.6em","height":"0.6ex"}}},"mrow":{"mi":"log","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mfrac":{"mi":["N","K"]}}}}}}},"br":{}},"Although CS has been applied to optical systems, the apparatus and methods for such systems does not extend to PMMW applications. CS for optical systems has utilized digital micromirror devices (DMD) which simulate random masks by changing their reflection angles electronically to achieve either a transmitting or blocking for a pixel. As mentioned earlier, the CS implementation at millimeter wavelengths is not straightforward, i.e., there are no suitable spatial intensity modulators such as DMDs for these wavelengths. Implementation of compressive sampling in MMW imagers entails the following steps:\n\n","Reflective or transmissive printed circuit elements (PCE) on a MMW transparent plastic sheet may be utilized. In one embodiment, the PCE are patterned arbitrarily. However, this approach is not practical in passive MMW imagers. The manual use of masks is insufficient for the speed necessary to achieve the desired fast imaging by CS. In addition, the optical components in passive systems must be carefully designed to avoid excessive insertion or diffraction loss by the masks since passive MMW radiation is of inherently very low power.","Thus, in one embodiment of the invention, a single extended mask is utilized to scan a scene rather than M random masks, one at a time. In one embodiment, the size of the extended Hadamard mask is determined by the twin prime construction method in Hadamard transform theory: for an image size of p\u00d7q, where p and q are prime numbers, the size of the extended mask is (2p\u22121)\u00d7(2q\u22121). See, M. Harwit and N. Sloane, , Academic Press, New York (1979), incorporated herein by reference. The sample area is determined by positioning the extended Hadamard mask against a template with an opening of size p\u00d7q. A cyclic S matrix of size pq\u00d7pq, where p and q are prime numbers, and q=p+2, is obtained with twin prime construction procedure by folding the elements of the first row of the S-matrix into a p\u00d7q matrix. The p\u00d7q matrix is periodically repeated to form a (2p\u22121)\u00d7(2q\u22121) extended matrix as shown in .  is the fabricated mask made of chrome on quartz, in which the blue and red rectangles show examples of two mask positions for data acquisition. If the extended mask is scanned in a raster pattern behind a template with an opening of size p\u00d7q, N (=pq) different mask patterns are exposed for a full set of data collection. One may randomly choose M p\u00d7q submasks out of the (2p\u22121)\u00d7(2q\u22121) extended mask for compressive data collection.","For one embodiment, the design of mask is based on the following considerations:\n\n","In one embodiment, a device in accordance with the present invention operates as follows. An imaging lens (the first lens behind the object) produces an image of the object at its image plane according to lens equation (1\/f=1\/d+1\/d). A Hadamard mask pattern consisting of transmit\/reflect pixels is introduced at the image plane. The Hadamard mask patterns of given size are predetermined by the Hadamard transform theory. The radiation from the image plane is modulated (transmitted through or reflected away) by the Hadamard mask pattern and the transmitted radiation is refocused by a second lens (focusing lens) onto the radiometer antenna. Essentially with this process the 2-D image is converted into a single data point in the Hadamard transform domain. Many such data points, but fewer than the total number required for conventional imaging, are collected by randomly introducing a different Hadamard mask pattern each time. The original image may be faithfully reconstructed from the compressively sampled data using a known iterative reconstruction algorithm. It should be appreciated that while the examples described below illustrate embodiments for detection of passive millimeter waves, the present invention may be applied to active millimeter wave systems and methods as well.","Traditional imagers utilize a radiometer placed at the focal plane of a 15.24 cm lens. The lens is then raster-scanned to form an image. In one embodiment, CS techniques of the present invention require masks to be inserted at the image plane of the lens for spatial intensity modulation. Therefore, the CS techniques, in certain embodiments, require an additional lens to collect the modulated radiation and focus it into the radiometer horn.  shows such a two-lens PMMW setup for CS implementation using Hadamard masks. The extended Hadamard mask  is placed at the image plane of the first lens , and a metal plate  with a hole of size p\u00d7q, placed in front of the mask, defines the exposure window. The object , i.e. the imaging target, is positioned on the opposite side of the imaging lens  from the Hadamard mask . The extended mask  is controlled by a 2-axis translation stage  to expose different mask patterns for compressive data collection, one for each measurement. A second lens  of one inch diameter collects the modulated radiation field through the Hadamard mask , and focuses it to a receiving antenna  that is in communication with a multichannel radiometer . It should be appreciated that the positions of the lenses ,  and the mask  are governed by the lens equation: 1\/f=1\/d+1\/d, where fis the focal length of either of the lenses , , dand dare the image and object distances, respectively. For purposes of the example, because the targets used in the experiments did not have spectral features, all the spectral channels were averaged to increase the signal-to-noise ratio (\u201cSNR\u201d). The multichannel radiometer  is in communication with a processor, such as a personal computer , to process and store the information from the multichannel radiometer .","If a complete set of N acquisitions is made by raster-scanning the extended Hadamard mask pixel by pixel, the image reconstruction consists of simple matrix manipulations as shown below. The measured intensity vector Iby the cyclic Hadamard mask may be expressed as\n\n\u2003\u2003(4)\n\nwhere S (pq\u00d7pq) is the cyclic S-matrix realized by the Hadmard mask and I(pq\u00d7l) is the scene intensity vector, which can be reconstructed from the full set of Hadamard measurements by\n\n.\u2003\u2003(5)\n\nFor a given size Hadamard mask, the S matrix in Eq. (5) is predetermined from the Hadamard sequence, so the image reconstruction is very fast.\n","To analyze the effect of masks on the SNR, a simple setup consisting of a single 1-inch diameter lens collecting the radiation from the mask, as shown in  (without the 6-inch lens), was utilized. Although the MMW transmission through individual pixels in the mask  suffers from small pixel sizes relative to the wavelength ratio, the overall transmission as used in this setup is not affected significantly as the signals from nearly half of the open mask pixels are summed up by the detector. The radiometer  signals were first measured for three backgrounds: a 60 W incandescent lamp , a liquid nitrogen load, and an absorber at ambient temperature. ) and () give, respectively, the radiometer signals without and with the mask in the beam path. The brightness temperature of the lamp as calibrated with liquid nitrogen and ambient loads is about 475K. The SNR values of the radiometer for the lamp radiation without and with the mask in the beam path are 13.2 and 7.9, respectively (see )). A factor-of-2 reduction in SNR is a tradeoff for higher image resolution achieved with subwavelength pixel size. The transmission through mask assumes 50% of the pixels are blocked, and SNR is defined as \u03bc\/\u03c3.","To test image formation and reconstruction, the simplified imaging setup in  was used with a light bulb  (thermal light source) illuminating an object  consisting of 2.54 cm circular hole with a 3 mm wide metal strip in the middle, and with the Hadamard mask  situated behind the object  in close proximity. The Hadamard transform and image reconstruction process was first simulated for the object geometry. ) gives the binary coded image of the object with \u20181\u2019 representing the hole and \u20180\u2019 the metal portion, and ) is its Hadamard transformed image according to Eq. 4. The reconstructed image from Hadamard transformed data using Eq. (5) was exact and identical to ) for this case.","Next obtained a full set of pq=1763 Hadamard acquisitions were obtained by raster scanning the Hadamard mask. ) gives the Hadamard transformed image, and ) shows the reconstructed image. An excellent agreement is seen between the simulated ()) and experimental, fully acquisition, ()) Hadamard transformed images. The reconstructed image of a circular hole with a horizontal metal strip shows the feasibility of Hadamard imaging at millimeter wavelengths with subwavelength resolution (1.24 mm pixel size for 2 mm wavelength).","To get the full set of Hadamard acquisitions, such as seen in , the extended mask was scanned one pixel at a time, along q pixels in the horizontal and p pixels in the vertical directions. However, in accordance with embodiments of the invention, the number of acquisitions can be reduced several ways. For example, the mask may be sampled randomly or sequentially every npixel in the horizontal and vertical directions. These reduced acquisitions represents sub-sampled data set in the Hadamard transform space. To reconstruct the image, the missing data in the Hadamard space may be calculated with a numerical procedure. In one embodiment, using the nsequential pixel approach, the relaxation method, which is frequently used in 2D solution of Poisson equation in electrostatics, was utilized. (See, e.g., J. D. Jackson, , Wiley, New York (1998)). The relaxation method is an iterative scheme, where a trial value at a missing pixel may be obtained as a weighted average of the values at the neighboring pixels. The iterative procedure continues until the predicted values converge to within some tolerance limit. One of ordinary skill will appreciate that the tolerance limit may be set depending on the desired degree of accuracy of reproduction of the image. Once the missing pixel values are calculated, the reconstruction equation in Eq. (5) may be used for image recovery.","To test the relaxation technique, every 3column and 3row of the Hadamard space was sampled, providing 1\/9 of a full acquisition. ) gives the recovered image in the Hadamard space, and ) shows the reconstructed image of the object. The recovered Hadamard image ()) from partial data compares well with the full Hadamard image in ). Also, the reconstructed image of the object clearly shows the circular hole with a strip in the middle. Thus, the image reconstructed from 1\/9of the acquisitions compares favorably with a full acquisition image.","Embodiments of the present invention provide a progressive sampling and image reconstruction method in which the Hadamard acquisition starts at every nrow and ncolumn in the Hadamard space. The relaxation technique is applied to fill the Hadamard space from which the image is reconstructed after every sample in real time by Eq. 5, since the S matrix is predetermined for given p and q. However, the error in reconstruction will be less after each complete pass (N\/n samples) as shown by the circles in . The complete image acquisition and reconstruction software for the examples described herein was implemented in LabVIEW\u00ae. If the image is not satisfactory, then the Hadamard space in between the sampled points is continued to be sampled and reconstructed with (2N\/n) data, and so on. The sample space is progressively increased until satisfactory image quality is obtained. In one embodiment, samples are collected until a user recognizes the imaged object. In another embodiment, the sampling continues until 25% of the total possible samples have been collected.","The reconstructed image quality using the progressive sampling method was compared against the Bayesian random sampling method. A normalized mean squared error (NMSE) metric was adopted for comparison of reconstructed images from partial and full set of samples.

In order to extend the principles of the present invention to far field imaging, a two-lens compressive sensing setup as shown in  was utilized. In the examples tested, to ensure high thermal contrast under indoors, a 60 W incandescent lamp (thermal source) was used as the target to be imaged. In outdoor conditions, however, such an artificial hot or cold source is not needed as the cold sky reflected radiation would offer an excellent thermal contrast. ) gives the reconstructed images of the lamp, and ) gives that with one quarter of the lamp blocked by a metal plate. Although the reconstruction in this example used a full set of acquisitions, partial acquisitions should be adequate for far-field imaging as shown by earlier images for the single lens setup.","The above examples illustrate embodiments of the present invention relating to a compressive sensing approach for single-pixel passive millimeter wave imaging with potential for reducing image acquisition time by a factor of 10 or more. It is based on a Hadamard transform mask for spatial intensity modulation, and allows for fast real-time image reconstruction as it involves the quickly converging relaxation numerical method and simple matrix manipulations. In one exemplary embodiment, a Hadamard mask of 41\u00d743 pixels, with pixel size of 1.24 mm, about half the wavelength of the utilized 146 GHz to 154 GHz bandwidth radiometer was used. To introduce different Hadamard masks in the MMW beam path for compressive sensing, an extended cyclic Hadamard mask of 81\u00d785 pixels may be used. A t-axis translational stage may be used to expose different submask of size 41\u00d743 from the extended mask. An incandescent lamp of brightness temperature 475K was used as an illumination thermal source for indoor imaging. An imaging object was placed behind the mask. The STN ratios of radiometer signals for lamp radiation without and with the Hadamard mask in the beam path were 13.2 and 7.9, respectively; the degradation is not severe considering subwavelength size pixels used in the mask.","Images were first reconstructed from a full set (1763) of Hadamard acquisitions. The Hadamard transform process was also simulated by binary coding of the object, generating Hadamard transformed data, and reconstructing the object image from the data. The agreement between the simulated and measured Hadamard transform images was very good, validating the effectiveness of the CS imager. An iterative relaxation method may be used, as shown in the examples, for image reconstruction from partial Hadamard acquisitions. The Hadamard space is efficiently extrapolated by the numerical relaxation procedure and the image reconstruction then uses standard (full set) Hadamard inversion. The reconstructed image of the object compared well in quality with the original image with as little as 11% of the full samples. As illustrated in the examples, the relaxation method was extended to implement a progressive sampling scheme in LabVIEW\u00ae with real time reconstruction and image display. The image is reconstructed and displayed after each Hadamard acquisition; the acquisitions may continue until satisfactory image quality is obtained. Most test cases resulted in good quality images with about 10 percent of the acquisitions, thus offering a factor-of-ten increase in imaging speed by adapting the CS approach.","In one embodiment, shown in , a system  is provided for implementing the methods described herein.  shows an exemplary block diagram of an exemplary embodiment of a system  according to the present disclosure.
