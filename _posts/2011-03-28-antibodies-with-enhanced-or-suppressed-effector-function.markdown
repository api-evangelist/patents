The contents of the International Application and both provisional applications are incorporated in their entirety by reference herein.","The present invention relates to antibodies, fusion proteins and polypeptides. Specifically, the instant invention relates to designed antibodies and polypeptides that comprise Fc region amino acid substitutions that synergistically provide enhanced selectivity and binding affinity to a target Fc receptor.","Antibodies are proteins which exhibit binding specificity to a specific antigen. Native antibodies are usually heterotetrameric glycoproteins of about 150,000 daltons, composed of two identical light (L) chains and two identical heavy (H) chains. Each light chain is linked to a heavy chain by one covalent disulfide bond, while the number of disulfide linkages varies between the heavy chains of different immunoglobulin isotypes. Each heavy and light chain also has regularly spaced intrachain disulfide bridges. Each heavy chain has at one end a variable domain (V) followed by a number of constant domains. Each light chain has a variable domain at one end (V) and a constant domain at its other end; the constant domain of the light chain is aligned with the first constant domain of the heavy chain, and the light chain variable domain is aligned with the variable domain of the heavy chain. Particular amino acid residues are believed to form an interface between the light and heavy chain variable domains.","The term \u201cvariable\u201d refers to the fact that certain portions of the variable domains differ extensively in sequence among antibodies and are responsible for the binding specificity of each particular antibody for its particular antigen. However, the variability is not evenly distributed through the variable domains of antibodies. It is concentrated in three segments called complementarity determining regions (CDRs) both in the light chain and the heavy chain variable domains. The more highly conserved portions of the variable domains are called the framework regions (FRs). The variable domains of native heavy and light chains each comprise four FRs, largely adopting a .beta.-sheet configuration, connected by three CDRs, which form loops connecting, and in some cases forming part of, the .beta.-sheet structure. The CDRs in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FRs and, with the CDRs from the other chain, contribute to the formation of the antigen binding site of antibodies (see Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1991)).","The constant domains are not involved directly in binding an antibody to an antigen, but exhibit various effector functions. Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant region of their heavy chains, antibodies or immunoglobulins can be assigned to different classes. There are five major classes of immunoglobulins: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG and IgM, and several of these may be further divided into subclasses (isotypes), e.g. IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4; IgA1 and IgA2. The heavy chain constant regions that correspond to the different classes of immunoglobulins are called \u03b1, \u03b4, \u03b5, \u03b3 and \u03bc, respectively. Of the various human immunoglobulin classes, only human IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgM are known to activate complement; and human IgG1 and IgG3 mediate ADCC more effectively than IgG2 and IgG4","Papain digestion of antibodies produces two identical antigen binding fragments, called Fab fragments, each with a single antigen binding site, and a residual \u201cFc\u201d fragment, whose name reflects its ability to crystallize readily. The crystal structure of the human IgG Fc region has been determined (Deisenhofer, Biochemistry 20:2361-2370 (1981)). In human IgG molecules, the Fc region is generated by papain cleavage N-terminal to Cys 226. The Fc region is central to the effector functions of antibodies.","The effector functions mediated by the antibody Fc region can be divided into two categories: (1) effector functions that operate after the binding of antibody to an antigen (these functions involve the participation of the complement cascade or Fc receptor (FcR)-bearing cells); and (2) effector functions that operate independently of antigen binding (these functions confer persistence in the circulation and the ability to be transferred across cellular barriers by transcytosis). Ward and Ghetie, Therapeutic Immunology 2:77-94 (1995).","While binding of an antibody to the requisite antigen has a neutralizing effect that might prevent the binding of a foreign antigen to its endogenous target (e.g. receptor or ligand), binding alone may not remove the foreign antigen. To be efficient in removing and\/or destructing foreign antigens, an antibody should be endowed with both high affinity binding to its antigen, and efficient effector functions.","Fc Receptor (FcR)","The interaction of antibodies and antibody-antigen complexes with cells of the immune system effects a variety of responses, including antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) (reviewed in Daeron, Annu. Rev. Immunol. 15:203-234 (1997); Ward and Ghetie, Therapeutic Immunol. 2:77-94 (1995); as well as Ravetch and Kinet, Annu. Rev. Immunol. 9:457-492 (1991)).","Several antibody effector functions are mediated by Fc receptors (FcRs), which bind the Fc region of an antibody. FcRs are defined by their specificity for immunoglobulin isotypes; Fc receptors for IgG antibodies are referred to as Fc\u03b3R, for IgE as Fc.epsilon.R, for IgA as Fc.alpha.R and so on. Three subclasses of Fc\u03b3R have been identified in humans: Fc\u03b3RI (CD64), Fc\u03b3RII (CD32) and Fc\u03b3RIII (CD16). Because each Fc\u03b3R subclass is encoded by two or three genes, and alternative RNA spicing leads to multiple transcripts, a broad diversity in Fc\u03b3R isoforms exists. The three genes encoding the Fc\u03b3RI subclass (Fc\u03b3RIA, Fc\u03b3RIB and Fc\u03b3RIC) are clustered in region 1q21.1 of the long arm of chromosome 1; the genes encoding Fc\u03b3RII isoforms (Fc\u03b3RIIA, Fc\u03b3RIIB and Fc\u03b3RIIC) and the two genes encoding Fc\u03b3RII (Fc\u03b3RIIIA and Fc\u03b3RIIIB) are all clustered in region 1q22. These different FcR subtypes are expressed on different cell types (reviewed in Ravetch and Bollard, Annu. Rev. Immunol. 19:275-290 (2001). For example, in humans, Fc\u03b3RIIIB is found only on neutrophils, whereas Fc\u03b3RIIIA is found on macrophages, monocytes, natural killer (NK) cells, and a subpopulation of T-cells. Notably, Fc\u03b3RIIIA is the only FcR present on NK cells, one of the cell types implicated in ADCC.","Fc\u03b3RI, Fc\u03b3RII and Fc\u03b3RII are immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) receptors; Fc\u03b3RI has three IgSF domains in its extracellular domain, while Fc\u03b3RII and Fc\u03b3RIII have only two IgSF domains in their extracellular domains.","Another type of Fc receptor is the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). FcRn is structurally similar to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and consists of an .alpha.-chain noncovalently bound to .beta.2-microglobulin.","Fc\u03b3RII (CD32), has several isoforms, IIa, IIIb1, Iib2, IIb3 and IIc, and is the most widely distributed human Fc\u03b3R type, being expressed on most types of blood leukocytes, dendritic cells and platelets. Fc\u03b3RII is a low affinity receptor that only binds to aggregated IgG. It is the only Fc\u03b3R class to be able to bind to IgG2. The Fc\u03b3RIIa is expressed on a range of cell types, including monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils, which it can co-activate in combination with other immunogloblulin receptors through its ITAM motifs. Fc\u03b3RIIa binds IgG antibodies attached to cells and causes lysis of those cells. This process is called antibody-dependant cell mediated cytotoxicity. The Fc\u03b3RIIb is also widely expressed but bears an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) which is necessary for its inhibitory effects. Fc\u03b3RIIb can suppress activation of B cells by invoking negative signaling when it is cross-linked to surface immunoglobulin via Ab-Ag complexes. The activation of macrophages and monocytes via Fc\u03b3R is suppressed by co-ligation of Fc\u03b3RIIb. (Armour et al. (2003) \u201cDifferential binding to human Fc\u03b3RIIa and Fc\u03b3RIIb receptors by human IgG wildtype and mutant antibodies,\u201d Mol. Immunol., 40:585-593). Cells transfected to express both Fc\u03b3RIIa and Fc\u03b3RIIb show reduced phagocytosis relative to cells bearing Fc\u03b3RIIa alone and the cytotoxicity of anti-tumour Ab was enhanced in Fc\u03b3RIIb-deficient mice. (Hunter et al. (1998) \u201cInhibition of Fc\u03b3 receptor mediated phagocytosis by nonphagocytic Fc\u03b3 receptor.\u201d Blood, 91:1762-1768; and Clynes et al. (2000) \u201cInhibitory Fc receptors modulate in vivo cytotoxicity against tumour targets.\u201d Nat. Med. 6:443-446). Thus, shifting relative binding affinity of Fc\u03b3R from Fc\u03b3RIIa to Fc\u03b3RIIb, for example would suppress activation of B cells and or macrophages and monocytes and would be useful to dampen immune responses in inflammatory disorders such in various autoimmune diseases. Conversely, shifting the relative binding affinity of Fc\u03b3 from Fc\u03b3RIIb to Fc\u03b3RIIa would lead to an enhancement of ADCC, and would be useful to enhance tumor cell killing, for example in the treatment of cancer.","Fc\u03b3RIII (CD16) has two isoforms which are able to bind to IgG1 and IgG3. The Fc\u03b3RIIIa has an intermediate affinity for IgG and is expressed on macrophages, monocytes, NK cells and subsets of T cells. Fc\u03b3RIIIb is a low-affinity receptor which is selectively expressed on neutrophils. Fc\u03b3RIIIa, like FC\u03b3RIIa, binds to IgG antibodies attached to cells and causes the lysis of those cells by ADCC. Fc\u03b3RIIIa binds clustered IgG molecules bound to cell surfaces and does not bind to monomeric IgG. Therefore, ADCC occurs only when the target cell is coated with antibody. Engagement of Fc\u03b3RIIIa by antibody-coated target cells activates NK cells to synthesize and secrete cytokines such as IFN-\u03b3, as well as discharge the contents of their granules, which mediate the cytolytic functions of this cell type.","Altering the effector activity of antibodies by shifting effector function from otherwise inhibitory immune response to inducing ADCC and vice versa is desirable for bettering treatment outcomes in a variety of diseases and conditions.

(2007) Immunology, 121:392, and Shields, et al. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276:6591 disclose efforts in this research area.","Presta et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 6,737,056) discloses polypeptides comprising a variant Fc region. The disclosed variations are based on single position mutations. By performing alanine scans, Presta et al. discloses single position Fc region amino acid modification at positions 238, 265, 269, 270, 292, 294, 295, 298, 303, 324, 327, 329, 333, 335, 338, 373, 376, 414, 416, 419, 435, 438 or 439; these single position mutations are purported to result in reduced binding to Fc\u03b3RII. Presta et al. also discloses that systematic alanine scans of the entire Fc region purportedly show that an Fc region amino acid modification at any one of amino acid positions 238, 239, 248, 249, 252, 254, 265, 268, 269, 270, 272, 278, 289, 293, 294, 295, 296, 301, 303, 322, 327, 329, 338, 340, 373, 376, 382, 388, 389, 416, 434, 435 or 437 results in reduced binding to Fc\u03b3RIII. Presta et al. also discloses polypeptides with increased binding to an Fc\u03b3RII comprising single position amino acid modifications at any one of amino acid positions 255, 256, 258, 267, 268, 272, 276, 280, 283, 285, 286, 290, 301, 305, 307, 309, 312, 315, 320, 322, 326, 330, 331, 337, 340, 378, 398 or 430 of the Fc region identified by alanine scans as well. Presta et al. discloses one single instance where two Fc amino acid positions are mutated at the same time (i.e., modifications S317A and K353A), however Presta et al. does not suggest that these double mutations provide any sysnergistic effect in obtaining a desired binding profile of the modified polypeptide to Fc\u03b3RII. Presta et al. is completely silent on potential synergism of simultaneous modifications at more than a single amino acid position.","Lazar et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 7,317,091) discloses antibodies comprising an amino acid modification at position 332 in the Fc region purportedly resulting in altered binding to an Fc\u03b3R. Lazar et al. discloses that individual substitutions in positions 234, 235, 239, 240, 243, 264, 266, 272, 274, 278, 325, 328, 330, and 332 purportedly effect the binding to an Fc\u03b3R. While Lazar al. purports to disclose synergy of Fc variants when combined with engineered glycoforms, Lazar et al. is silent on potential synergism that may be provided by a selection of simultaneously modified Fc amino acid positions, regardless of additional synergism that may be provided by engineered glycoforms.","Stavenhagen (U.S. Pat. No. 7,632,497) discloses molecules having a variant Fc region, wherein the variant Fc region comprises at least one amino acid modification relative to a wild-type Fc region. These modified molecules purportedly confer an effector function to a molecule, where the parent molecule does not detectably exhibit this effector function.","Current approaches to optimize the Fc region in therapeutic monoclonal antibodies and soluble polypeptides fused to Fc regions have focused on a limited number of single amino acid changes based on alanine screens, site-directed mutagenesis etc. Other approaches in engineering Fc regions have focused on the glycosylation of the Fc region to optimize Fc region function. Still other approaches have focused on Fc modifications that purportedly confer effector function by modifying wild type molecules that lack effector function, but do not purport to increase or otherwise modify existing effector function of a wild type molecule.","There is currently no known Fc protein or polypeptide that is optimized to bind a particular Fc\u03b3R of interest with very high specificity as compared to other Fc\u03b3 receptors. Although the effect of individual Fc region amino acid mutations on the binding with certain Fc\u03b3 receptors is well understood, previous studies fail to describe the effect of simultaneous changes to multiple amino acids. Additionally, the prior art does not suggest suitable replacements for substituted Fc region amino acids to obtain optimal binding to the Fc\u03b3R of interest, including modification of effector function of a wild type molecule that already has detectable effector function.","Hence, there is a need in the art for polypeptides and antibodies that comprise multiple, synergistic amino acid substitutions in the Fc region such that the antibody or fusion protein is optimized for binding to the Fc\u03b3R isoform of choice.","The instant compositions provide polypeptides, fusion protein and antibodies comprising Fc region that bind a target Fc\u03b3R with very high specificity. These polypeptides and antibodies are designed by rational analysis of the binding of each Fc\u03b3R with the Fc region and by subsequent design of multiple (three or more) amino acid substitutions that synergistically provide desired selectivity and binding affinity for the target Fc receptor. Accordingly, the polypeptides and proteins provided herein comprise multiple variations in the Fc region as compared to the wild type Fc region, said variations tailored to improving the specificity for the Fc\u03b3R under consideration, and for obtaining a selected binding profile based on enthalpic and entropic factors optimized by the choice of the most favorable amino acid for each position.","One embodiment provides a polypeptide comprising a variant Fc region, wherein said variant Fc region comprises three or more amino acid modifications relative to a wild-type Fc region, and has an altered effect relative to a polypeptide comprising a wild-type Fc region; wherein at least two of the three or more modifications provide a synergistic effect compared to single position modifications at the at least two positions thereby exhibiting a selected binding profile to Fc\u03b3 receptors.","Another embodiment provides a polypeptide wherein the amino acid modifications produce amino acid interactions and dynamics that result in enhanced binding free energy to a first Fc\u03b3 receptor while diminishing binding affinity to a second Fc\u03b3 receptor compared to a polypeptide that lacks the at least three or more amino acid modifications.

Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1991), expressly incorporated herein by reference. The \u201cEU index as in Kabat\u201d refers to the residue numbering of the human IgG1 EU antibody.","A \u201cparent polypeptide\u201d is a polypeptide comprising an amino add sequence which lacks one or more of the Fc region modifications disclosed herein and which differs in effector function compared to a polypeptide variant as herein disclosed. The parent polypeptide may comprise a native sequence Fc region or an Fc region with pre-existing amino acid sequence modifications (such as additions, deletions and\/or substitutions).","As used herein, \u201csynergistic\u201d means that the Fc\u03b3R binding of the Fc protein designed with multiple amino acid substitutions is greater than their additive binding observed for individual substitutions.","The term \u201cFc region\u201d is used to define a C-terminal region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain. The \u201cFc region\u201d may be a native sequence Fc region or a variant Fc region. Although the boundaries of the Fc region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain might vary, the human IgG heavy chain Fc region is usually defined to stretch from an amino acid residue at position Cys226, or from Pro230, to the carboxyl-terminus thereof. The Fc region of an immunoglobulin generally comprises two constant domains, CH2 and CH3.","The \u201cCH2 domain\u201d of a human IgG Fc region (also referred to as \u201cC\u03b32\u201d domain) usually extends from about amino acid 231 to about amino acid 340. The CH2 domain is unique in that it is not closely paired with another domain. Rather, two N-linked branched carbohydrate chains are interposed between the two CH2 domains of an intact native IgG molecule. It has been speculated that the carbohydrate may provide a substitute for the domain-domain pairing and help stabilize the CH2 domain. Burton, Molec. Immunol. 22:161-206 (1985).","The \u201cCH3 domain\u201d comprises the stretch of residues C-terminal to a CH2 domain in an Fc region (i.e. from about amino acid residue 341 to about amino acid residue 447 of an IgG)","A \u201cfunctional Fc region\u201d possesses an \u201ceffector function\u201d of a native sequence Fc region.

One such computer program is \u201cAlign 2\u201d, authored by Genentech, Inc., which was filed with user documentation in the United States Copyright Office, Washington, D.C. 20559, on Dec. 10, 1991.","The term \u201cFc region-containing polypeptide\u201d refers to a polypeptide, such as an antibody or immunoadhesin (see definitions below), which comprises an Fc region.","The terms \u201cFc receptor\u201d or \u201cFcR\u201d are used to describe a receptor that binds to the Fc region of an antibody. The preferred FcR is a native sequence human FcR. Moreover, in certain embodiments, the FcR is one which binds an IgG antibody (a gamma receptor) and includes receptors of the Fc\u03b3RI, Fc\u03b3RII, and Fc\u03b3RIII subclasses, including allelic variants and alternatively spliced forms of these receptors. Fc\u03b3RII receptors include Fc\u03b3RIIA (an \u201cactivating receptor\u201d) and Fc\u03b3RIIB (an \u201cinhibiting receptor\u201d), which have similar amino acid sequences that differ primarily in the cytoplasmic domains thereof. Activating receptor Fc\u03b3RIIA contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) in its cytoplasmic domain. Inhibiting receptor Fc\u03b3RIIB contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) in its cytoplasmic domain. (see review M. in Daeron, Annu. Rev. Immunol. 15:203-234 (1997)).

The term also includes the neonatal receptor, FcRn, which is responsible for the transfer of materal IgGs to the fetus (Guyer et al., J. Immunol. 117:587 (1976) and Kim et al., J. Immunol. 24:249 (1994)).","\u201cAntibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity\u201d and \u201cADCC\u201d refer to a cell-mediated reaction in which nonspecific cytotoxic cells that express FcRs (e.g. Natural Killer (NK) cells, neutrophils, and macrophages) recognize bound antibody on a target cell and subsequently cause lysis of the target cell. The primary cells for mediating ADCC, NK cells, express Fc\u03b3RIII only, whereas monocytes express Fc\u03b3RI, Fc\u03b3RII and Fc\u03b3RIII. FcR expression on hematopoietic cells is summarized in Table 3 on page 464 of Ravetch and Kinet, Annu. Rev.

The effector cells may be isolated from a native source thereof, e.g. from blood or PBMCs as described herein.","A polypeptide with \u201caltered\u201d FcR binding affinity or ADCC activity is one which has either enhanced or diminished FcR binding activity and\/or ADCC activity compared to a parent polypeptide or to a polypeptide comprising a native sequence Fc region. The polypeptide which \u201cdisplays increased binding\u201d to an FcR binds at least one FcR with better affinity than the parent polypeptide. The polypeptide which \u201cdisplays decreased binding\u201d to an FcR, binds at least one FcR with worse affinity than a parent polypeptide. Such variants which display decreased binding to an FcR may possess little or no appreciable binding to an FcR, e.g., 0-20% binding to the FcR compared to a native sequence IgG Fc region, e.g. as determined in the Examples herein.","The polypeptide which binds an FcR with \u201cbetter affinity\u201d than a parent polypeptide, is one which binds any one or more of the above identified FcRs with substantially better binding affinity than the parent antibody, when the amounts of polypeptide and parent polypeptide in the binding assay are essentially the same. For example, the polypeptide with improved FcR binding affinity may display from about 1.15 fold to about 100 fold, e.g. from about 1.2 fold to about 50 fold improvement in FcR binding affinity compared to the parent polypeptide, where FcR binding affinity is determined, for example, as disclosed in the Examples herein.","The polypeptide which \u201cmediates antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) in the presence of human effector cells more effectively\u201d than a parent antibody is one which in vitro or in vivo is substantially more effective at mediating ADCC, when the amounts of polypeptide variant and parent antibody used in the assay are essentially the same. Generally, such polypeptides will be identified using the in vitro ADCC assay as herein disclosed, but other assays or methods for determining ADCC activity, e.g. in an animal model etc, are contemplated. The preferred polypeptide is from about 1.5 fold to about 100 fold, e.g. from about two fold to about fifty fold, more effective at mediating ADCC than the parent, e.g. in the in vitro assay disclosed herein.","An \u201camino acid modification\u201d refers to a change in the amino acid sequence of a predetermined amino acid sequence.

Preferably, the replacement residue is not cysteine. Substitution with one or more non-naturally occurring amino acid residues is also encompassed by the definition of an amino acid substitution herein. A \u201cnon-naturally occurring amino acid residue\u201d refers to a residue, other than those naturally occurring amino acid residues listed above, which is able to covalently bind adjacent amino acid residues(s) in a polypeptide chain. Examples of non-naturally occurring amino acid residues include norleucine, ornithine, norvaline, homoserine and other amino acid residue analogues such as those described in Ellman et al. Meth. Enzym. 202:301-336 (1991). To generate such non-naturally occurring amino acid residues, the procedures of Noren et al. Science 244:182 (1989) and Ellman et al., supra, can be used. Briefly, these procedures involve chemically activating a suppressor tRNA with a non-naturally occurring amino acid residue followed by in vitro transcription and translation of the RNA.","An \u201camino acid insertion\u201d refers to the incorporation of at least one amino acid into a predetermined amino acid sequence. In certain embodiments, the insertion consists of the insertion of one or two amino acid residues.

In these embodiments the inserted residue(s) are naturally occurring or non-naturally occurring as disclosed above.","An \u201camino acid deletion\u201d refers to the removal of at least one amino acid residue from a predetermined amino acid sequence.","\u201cHinge region\u201d is generally defined as stretching from Glu216 to Pro230 of human IgG1 (Burton, Molec. Immunol. 22:161-206 (1985)). Hinge regions of other IgG isotypes may be aligned with the IgG1 sequence by placing the first and last cysteine residues forming inter-heavy chain S\u2014S bonds in the same positions.","The \u201clower hinge region\u201d of an Fc region is normally defined as the stretch of residues immediately C-terminal to the hinge region, i.e. residues 233 to 239 of the Fc region. Prior to the present disclosure, Fc\u03b3R binding was generally attributed to amino acid residues in the lower hinge region of an IgG Fc region.","\u201cC1q\u201d is a polypeptide that includes a binding site for the Fc region of an immunoglobulin. C1q together with two serine proteases, C1r and C1s, forms the complex C1, the first component of the complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) pathway.

In the case of an FcR, the binding domain can comprise a portion of a polypeptide chain thereof (e.g. the .alpha. chain thereof) which is responsible for binding an Fc region. One useful binding domain is the extracellular domain of an FcR\u03b1chain.","The term \u201cantibody\u201d is used in the broadest sense and specifically covers monoclonal antibodies (including full length monoclonal antibodies), polyclonal antibodies, multispecific antibodies (e.g., bispecific antibodies), and antibody fragments so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity.","\u201cAntibody fragments\u201d, as defined herein, comprise a portion of an intact antibody, generally including the antigen binding or variable region of the intact antibody or the Fc region of an antibody which retains FcR binding capability. Examples of antibody fragments include linear antibodies; single-chain antibody molecules; and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments. In certain embodiments, the antibody fragments retain at least part of the hinge and optionally the CH1 region of an IgG heavy chain. In some embodiments the antibody fragments retain the entire constant region of an IgG heavy chain, and include an IgG light chain.","The term \u201cmonoclonal antibody\u201d as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single antigenic site. Furthermore, in contrast to conventional (polyclonal) antibody preparations that typically include different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen. The modifier \u201cmonoclonal,\u201d indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. In certain embodiments the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present disclosure are made by the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al., Nature 256:495 (1975), or may be made by recombinant DNA methods (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567). In some embodiments \u201cmonoclonal antibodies\u201d are isolated from phage antibody libraries using the techniques described in Clackson et al., Nature 352:624-628 (1991) and Marks et al., J. Mol. Biol. 222:581-597 (1991), for example.","The monoclonal antibodies herein specifically include \u201cchimeric\u201d antibodies (immunoglobulins) in which a portion of the heavy and\/or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; and Morrison et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81:6851-6855 (1984)).","\u201cHumanized\u201d forms of non-human (e.g., murine) antibodies are chimeric antibodies that contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. For the most part, humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which residues from a hypervariable region of the recipient are replaced by residues from a hypervariable region of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat, rabbit or nonhuman primate having the desired specificity, affinity, and capacity. In some instances, Fv framework region (FR) residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Furthermore, humanized antibodies may comprise residues that are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications are made to further refine antibody performance. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optionally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human Immunoglobulin.

Mol. Biol. 196:901-917 (1987)). \u201cFramework\u201d or \u201cFR\u201d residues are those variable domain residues other than the hypervariable region residues as herein defined.","As used herein, the term \u201cimmunoadhesin\u201d designates antibody-like molecules which combine the \u201cbinding domain\u201d of a heterologous \u201cadhesin\u201d protein (e.g. a receptor, ligand or enzyme) with an immunoglobulin constant domain. Structurally, the immunoadhesins comprise a fusion of the adhesin amino acid sequence with the desired binding specificity which is other than the antigen recognition and binding site (antigen combining site) of an antibody (i.e. is \u201cheterologous\u201d) and an immunoglobulin constant domain sequence.","The term \u201cligand binding domain\u201d as used herein refers to any native cell-surface receptor or any region or derivative thereof retaining at least a qualitative ligand binding ability of a corresponding native receptor. In a specific embodiment, the receptor is from a cell-surface polypeptide having an extracellular domain that is homologous to a member of the immunoglobulin supergenefamily. Other receptors, which are not members of the immunoglobulin supergenefamily but are nonetheless specifically covered by this definition, are receptors for cytokines, and in particular receptors with tyrosine kinase activity (receptor tyrosine kinases), members of the hematopoietin and nerve growth factor receptor superfamilies, and cell adhesion molecules, e.g. (E-, L- and P-) selectins.","The term \u201creceptor binding domain\u201d is used to designate any native ligand for a receptor, including cell adhesion molecules, or any region or derivative of such native ligand retaining at least a qualitative receptor binding ability of a corresponding native ligand. This definition, among others, specifically includes binding sequences from ligands for the above-mentioned receptors.","An \u201cantibody-immunoadhesin chimera\u201d comprises a molecule that combines at least one binding domain of an antibody (as herein defined) with at least one immunoadhesin (as defined in this application). Exemplary antibody-immunoadhesin chimeras are the bispecific CD4-IgG chimeras described in Berg et al., PNAS (USA) 88:4723-4727 (1991) and Chamow et al., J. Immunol. 153:4268 (1994).","An \u201cisolated\u201d polypeptide is one that has been identified and separated and\/or recovered from a component of its natural environment. Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials that would interfere with diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the polypeptide, and may include enzymes, hormones, and other proteinaceous or nonproteinadeous solutes. In certain embodiments, the polypeptide will be purified (1) to greater than 95% by weight of polypeptide as determined by the Lowry method, and most preferably more than 99% by weight, (2) to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N-terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of a spinning cup sequenator, or (3) to homogeneity by SDS-PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions using Coomassie blue or, preferably, silver stain. Isolated polypeptide includes the polypeptide in situ within recombinant cells since at least one component of the polypeptide's natural environment will not be present. Ordinarily, however, isolated polypeptide will be prepared by at least one purification step.","\u201cTreatment\u201d refers to both therapeutic treatment and prophylactic or preventative measures. Those in need of treatment include those already with the disorder as well as those in which the disorder is to be prevented.","A \u201cdisorder\u201d is any condition that would benefit from treatment with the polypeptide variant. This includes chronic and acute disorders or diseases including those pathological conditions which predispose the mammal to the disorder in question. In one embodiment, the disorder is cancer.","The word \u201clabel\u201d when used herein refers to a detectable compound or composition which is conjugated directly or indirectly to the polypeptide. In certain embodiments the label is itself detectable (e.g., radioisotope labels or fluorescent labels). In some other embodiments, the label catalyzes chemical alteration of a substrate compound or composition which is detectable. An exemplary embodiment comprises an enzymatic label that catalyzes a chemical alteration of a substrate compound or composition which is detectable.","An \u201cisolated\u201d nucleic acid molecule is a nucleic acid molecule that is identified and separated from at least one contaminant nucleic acid molecule with which it is ordinarily associated in the natural source of the polypeptide nucleic acid. An isolated nucleic acid molecule is other than in the form or setting in which it is found in nature. Isolated nucleic acid molecules therefore are distinguished from the nucleic acid molecule as it exists in natural cells. However, an isolated nucleic acid molecule includes a nucleic acid molecule contained in cells that ordinarily express the polypeptide where, for example, the nucleic acid molecule is in a chromosomal location different from that of natural cells.","The expression \u201ccontrol sequences\u201d refers to DNA sequences necessary for the expression of an operably linked coding sequence in a particular host organism. The control sequences that are suitable for prokaryotes, for example, include a promoter, optionally an operator sequence, and a ribosome binding site. Eukaryotic cells are known to utilize promoters, polyadenylation signals, and enhancers.","Nucleic acid is \u201coperably linked\u201d when it is placed into a functional relationship with another nucleic acid sequence. For example, DNA for a presequence or secretory leader is operably linked to DNA for a polypeptide if it is expressed as a preprotein that participates in the secretion of the polypeptide; a promoter or enhancer is operably linked to a coding sequence if it affects the transcription of the sequence; or a ribosome binding site is operably linked to a coding sequence if it is positioned so as to facilitate translation. Generally, \u201coperably linked\u201d means that the DNA sequences being linked are contiguous, and, in the case of a secretory leader, contiguous and in reading phase. However, enhancers do not have to be contiguous. Linking is accomplished by ligation at convenient restriction sites. If such sites do not exist, the synthetic oligonucleotide adaptors or linkers are used in accordance with conventional practice.","As used herein, the expressions \u201ccell,\u201d \u201ccell line,\u201d and \u201ccell culture\u201d are used interchangeably and all such designations include progeny. Thus, the words \u201ctransformants\u201d and \u201ctransformed cells\u201d include the primary subject cell and cultures derived therefrom without regard for the number of transfers. It is also understood that all progeny may not be precisely identical in DNA content, due to deliberate or inadvertent mutations. Mutant progeny that have the same function or biological activity as screened for in the originally transformed cell are included. Where distinct designations are intended, it will be clear from the context.","The term \u201cmolecular complex\u201d when used herein refers to the relatively stable structure which forms when two or more heterologous molecules (e.g. polypeptides) bind (preferably noncovalently) to one another. The preferred molecular complex herein is an immune complex.","\u201cImmune complex\u201d refers to the relatively stable structure which forms when at least one target molecule and at least one heterologous Fc region-containing polypeptide bind to one another forming a larger molecular weight complex. Examples of immune complexes are antigen-antibody aggregates and target molecule-immunoadhesin aggregates. The term \u201cimmune complex\u201d as used herein, unless indicated otherwise, refers to an ex vivo complex (i.e. other than the form or setting in which it may be found in nature). However, the immune complex may be administered to a mammal, e.g. to evaluate clearance of the immune complex in the mammal.","The term \u201ctarget molecule\u201d refers to a molecule, usually a polypeptide, which is capable of being bound by a heterologous molecule and has one or more binding sites for the heterologous molecule. The term \u201cbinding site\u201d refers to a region of a molecule to which another molecule can bind. The \u201cfirst target molecule\u201d herein comprises at least two distinct binding sites (for example, two to five separate binding sites) for an analyte (e.g. an Fc region-containing polypeptide) such that at least two analyte molecules can bind to the first target molecule. In a preferred embodiment, the two or more binding sites are identical (e.g. having the same amino acid sequence, where the target molecule is a polypeptide). An \u201canalyte\u201d is a substance that is to be analyzed. The preferred analyte is an Fc region-containing polypeptide that is to be analyzed for its ability to bind to an Fc receptor.","A \u201creceptor\u201d is a polypeptide capable of binding at least one ligand. The preferred receptor is a cell-surface receptor having an extracellular ligand-binding domain and, optionally, other domains (e.g. transmembrane domain, intracellular domain and\/or membrane anchor). The receptor to be evaluated in the assay described herein may be an intact receptor or a fragment or derivative thereof (e.g. a fusion protein comprising the binding domain of the receptor fused to one or more heterologous polypeptides). Moreover, the receptor to be evaluated for its binding properties may be present in a cell or isolated and optionally coated on an assay plate or some other solid phase.","The phrase \u201clow affinity receptor\u201d denotes a receptor that has a weak binding affinity for a ligand of interest, e.g. having a binding constant of about 50 nM or worse affinity. Exemplary low affinity receptors include Fc\u03b3RII and Fc\u03b3RIII.","By \u201ceffector function\u201d as used herein is meant a biochemical event that results from the interaction of an antibody Fc region with an Fc receptor or ligand. Effector functions include but are not limited to ADCC, ADCP, and CDC. By \u201ceffector cell\u201d as used herein is meant a cell of the immune system that expresses one or more Fc receptors and mediates one or more effector functions. Effector cells include but are not limited to monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, dendritic cells, eosinophils, mast cells, platelets, B cells, large granular lymphocytes, Langerhans' cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and \u03b3\u03b3 T cells, and may be from any organism including but not limited to humans, mice, rats, rabbits, and monkeys. By \u201clibrary\u201d herein is meant a set of Fc proteins in any form, including but not limited to a list of nucleic acid or amino acid sequences, a list of nucleic acid or amino acid substitutions at variable positions, a physical library comprising nucleic acids that encode the library sequences, or a physical library comprising the Fc protein proteins, either in purified or unpurified form.","By \u201cFc-fusion\u201d as used herein is meant a protein wherein one or more polypeptides is operably linked to an Fc region or a derivative thereof. Fc fusion is herein meant to be synonymous with the terms \u201cimmunoadhesin\u201d, \u201cIg fusion\u201d, \u201cIg chimera\u201d, and \u201creceptor globulin\u201d (sometimes with dashes) as used in the prior art (Chamow et al., 1996, Trends Biotechnol 14:52-60; Ashkenazi et al., 1997, Curr Opin Immunol 9:195-200). An Fc fusion combines the Fc region of an immunoglobulin with a fusion partner, which in general can be any protein or small molecule. The role of the non-Fc part of an Fc fusion, i.e. the fusion partner, is to mediate target binding, and thus it is functionally analogous to the variable regions of an antibody. Virtually any protein or small molecule may be linked to Fc to generate an Fc fusion. Protein fusion partners may include, but are not limited to, the target-binding region of a receptor, an adhesion molecule, a ligand, an enzyme, a cytokine, a chemokine, or some other protein or protein domain. Small molecule fusion partners may include any therapeutic agent that directs the Fc fusion to a therapeutic target. Such targets may be any molecule, preferrably an extracellular receptor, that is implicated in disease. Two families of surface receptors that are targets of a number of approved small molecule drugs are G-Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs), and ion channels, including K+, Na+, Ca+ channels. Nearly 70% of all drugs currently marketed worldwide target GPCRs. Thus the Fc proteins described herein may be fused to a small molecule that targets, for example, one or more GABA receptors, purinergic receptors, adrenergic receptors, histaminergic receptors, opiod receptors, chemokine receptors, glutamate receptors, nicotinic receptors, the 5HT (serotonin) receptor, and estrogen receptors. A fusion partner may be a small-molecule mimetic of a protein that targets a therapeutically useful target. Specific examples of particular drugs that may serve as Fc fusion partners can be found in L. S. Goodman et at, Eds., Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics (McGraw-Hill, New York, ed. 9, 1996). Fusion partners include not only small molecules and proteins that bind known targets for existing drugs, but orphan receptors that do not yet exist as drug targets. The completion of the genome and proteome projects are proving to be a driving force in drug discovery, and these projects have yielded a trove of orphan receptors. There is enormous potential to validate these new molecules as drug targets, and develop protein and small molecule therapeutics that target them. Such protein and small molecule therapeutics are contemplated as Fc fusion partners that employ the Fc proteins described herein. A variety of linkers, defined and described below, may be used to covalently link Fc to a fusion partner to generate an Fc fusion.","By \u201cFc ligand\u201d as used herein is meant a molecule, preferably a polypeptide, from any organism that binds to the Fc region of an antibody to form an Fc-ligand complex. Fc ligands include but are not limited to Fc\u03b3Rs, Fc\u03b3Rs, Fc\u03b3Rs, FcRn, C1q, C3, mannan binding lectin, mannose receptor, staphylococcal protein A, streptococcal protein G, and viral Fc\u03b3R. Fc ligands also include Fc receptor homologs (FcRH), which are a family of Fc receptors that are homologous to the Fc\u03b3Rs (Davis et al., 2002, Immunological Reviews 190:123-136). Fc ligands may include undiscovered molecules that bind Fc.","By \u201cIgG\u201d as used herein is meant a polypeptide belonging to the class of antibodies that are substantially encoded by a recognized immunoglobulin gamma gene.

Fc proteins that are optimized for binding to a nonhuman Fc\u03b3R may find use in experimentation. For example, mouse models are available for a variety of diseases that enable testing of properties such as efficacy, toxicity, and pharmacokinetics for a given drug candidate. As is known in the art, cancer cells can be grafted or injected into mice to mimic a human cancer, a process referred to as xenografting. Testing of antibodies or Fc fusions that comprise Fc proteins that are optimized for one or more mouse Fc\u03b3Rs, may provide valuable information with regard to the efficacy of the antibody or Fc fusion, its mechanism of action, and the like. In certain embodiments, the Fc polypeptides and proteins described herein are optimized for enhanced functionality and\/or solution properties in aglycosylated form. In an exemplary embodiment, the aglycosylated Fc proteins described herein bind an Fc ligand with greater affinity than the aglycosylated form of the parent Fc polypeptide. Said Fc ligands include but are not limited to Fc\u03b3Rs, C1q, FcRn, and proteins A and G, and may be from any source including but not limited to human, mouse, rat, rabbit, or monkey, preferably human. In an alternately preferred embodiment, the Fc proteins are optimized to be more stable and\/or more soluble than the aglycosylated form of the parent Fc polypeptide. An Fc protein that is engineered or predicted to display any of the aforementioned optimized properties is herein referred to as an \u201coptimized Fc protein\u201d.","In certain embodiments, the Fc polypeptides and proteins described herein are derived from parent Fc polypeptides that are themselves from a wide range of sources. In some embodiments the parent Fc polypeptide is substantially encoded by one or more Fc genes from any organism, including but not limited to humans, mice, rats, rabbits, camels, llamas, dromedaries, monkeys, preferably mammals and most preferably humans and mice. In an embodiment, the parent Fc polypeptide comprises an antibody, referred to as the parent antibody. In certain embodiments, the parent antibody is fully human, obtained for example using transgenic mice (Bruggemann et al., 1997, Curr Opin Biotechnol 8:455-458) or human antibody libraries coupled with selection methods (Griffiths et al., 1998, Curr Opin Biotechnol 9:102-108). The parent antibody need not be naturally occurring. In certain embodiments the parent antibody is an engineered antibody, including but not limited to chimeric antibodies and humanized antibodies (Clark, 2000, Immunol Today 21:397-402). In certain embodiments, the parent antibody is an engineered variant of an antibody that is substantially encoded by one or more natural antibody genes. In one embodiment, the parent antibody has been affinity matured, as is known in the art. Alternatively, the antibody has been modified in some other way, for example as described in U.S. Ser. No. 10\/339,788, filed on Mar. 3, 2003.","In certain embodiments, the Fc proteins described herein is substantially encoded by immunoglobulin genes belonging to any of the antibody classes. In an exemplary embodiment, the Fc proteins described herein find use in antibodies or Fc fusions that comprise sequences belonging to the IgG class of antibodies, including IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, or IgG4. In an alternate embodiment the Fc proteins described herein find use in antibodies or Fc fusions that comprise sequences belonging to the IgA (including subclasses IgA1 and IgA2), IgD, IgE, IgG, or IgM classes of antibodies. In some embodiments, the Fc proteins described herein comprise more than one protein chain. That is, in some embodiments, the polypeptides described herein find use in an antibody or Fc fusion that is a monomer or an oligomer, including a homo- or hetero-oligomer.","In some embodiments, the antibodies of the invention are based on human sequences, and thus human sequences are used as the \u201cbase\u201d sequences, against which other sequences, such as rat, mouse, and monkey sequences are compared. In order to establish homology to primary sequence or structure, the amino acid sequence of a precursor or parent Fc polypeptide is directly compared to the human Fc sequence outlined herein. After aligning the sequences, using one or more of the homology alignment programs known in the art (for example using conserved residues as between species), allowing for necessary insertions and deletions in order to maintain alignment (i.e., avoiding the elimination of conserved residues through arbitrary deletion and insertion), the residues equivalent to particular amino acids in the primary sequence of human Fc are defined. Alignment of conserved residues preferably should conserve 100% of such residues. However, alignment of greater than 75% or as little as 50% of conserved residues is also adequate to define equivalent residues (sometimes referred to as \u201ccorresponding residues\u201d). Equivalent residues may also be defined by determining homology at the level of tertiary structure for an Fc polypeptide whose tertiary structure has been determined. Equivalent residues are defined as those for which the atomic coordinates of two or more of the main chain atoms of a particular amino acid residue of the parent or precursor (N on N, CA on CA, C on C and O on O) are within 0.13 nm and preferably 0.1 nm after alignment. Alignment is achieved after the best model has been oriented and positioned to give the maximum overlap of atomic coordinates of non-hydrogen protein atoms of the Fc polypeptide.","In some embodiments, the Fc polypeptides described herein are combined with other Fc modifications, including but not limited to modifications that alter effector function or interaction with one or more Fc ligands. In certain embodiments, these combinations provide additive, synergistic, or properties in antibodies or Fc fusions.

Many of these techniques are based on controlling the level of fucosylated and\/or bisecting oligosaccharides that are covalently attached to the Fc region, for example by expressing an Fc polypeptide in various organisms or cell lines, engineered or otherwise (for example Lec-13 CHO cells or rat hybridoma YB2\/0 cells), by regulating enzymes involved in the glycosylation pathway (for example FUT8 [.alpha.1,6-fucosyltranserase] and\/or .beta.1-4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III [GnTIII]), or by modifying carbohydrate(s) after the Fc polypeptide has been expressed. Engineered glycoform typically refers to the different carbohydrate or oligosaccharide; thus an Fc polypeptide, for example an antibody or Fc fusion, may comprise an engineered glycoform. Alternatively, engineered glycoform may refer to the Fc polypeptide that comprises the different carbohydrate or oligosaccharide.

For example, reference to CTLA-4 as a target antigen implies that the ligands and receptors that make up the T cell co-stimulatory pathway, including CTLA-4, B7-1, B7-2, CD28, and any other undiscovered ligands or receptors that bind these proteins, are also targets. Thus target as used herein refers not only to a specific biomolecule, but the set of proteins that interact with said target and the members of the biochemical pathway to which said target belongs. One skilled in the art will further appreciate that any of the aforementioned target antigens, the ligands or receptors that bind them, or other members of their corresponding biochemical pathway, may be operably linked to the Fc proteins described herein in order to generate an Fc fusion. Thus for example, an Fc fusion that targets EGFR could be constructed by operably linking an Fc protein to EGF, TGF.alpha., or any other ligand, discovered or undiscovered, that binds EGFR. Accordingly, an Fc protein described herein could be operably linked to EGFR in order to generate an Fc fusion that binds EGF, TGF.alpha., or any other ligand, discovered or undiscovered, that binds EGFR. Thus virtually any polypeptide, whether a ligand, receptor, or some other protein or protein domain, including but not limited to the aforementioned targets and the proteins that compose their corresponding biochemical pathways, may be operably linked to the Fc proteins described herein to develop an Fc fusion.","A number of antibodies and Fc fusions that are approved for use, in clinical trials, or in development benefit from the Fc proteins described herein. Said antibodies and Fc fusions are herein referred to as \u201cclinical products and candidates\u201d.

In one embodiment, the protein is administered with an anti-angiogenic agent. By \u201canti-angiogenic agent\u201d as used herein is meant a compound that blocks, or interferes to some degree, the development of blood vessels. The anti-angiogenic factor may, for instance, be a small molecule or a protein, for example an antibody, Fc fusion, or cytokine, that binds to a growth factor or growth factor receptor involved in promoting angiogenesis. The preferred anti-angiogenic factor herein is an antibody that binds to Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF). In an alternate embodiment, the antibody or Fc fusion is administered with a therapeutic agent that induces or enhances adaptive immune response, for example an antibody that targets CTLA-4. In an alternate embodiment, the antibody or Fc fusion is administered with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. By \u201ctyrosine kinase inhibitor\u201d as used herein is meant a molecule that inhibits to some extent tyrosine kinase activity of a tyrosine kinase.

By \u201clinker\u201d, \u201clinker sequence\u201d, \u201cspacer\u201d, \u201ctethering sequence\u201d or grammatical equivalents thereof, herein is meant a molecule or group of molecules (such as a monomer or polymer) that connects two molecules and often serves to place the two molecules in a preferred configuration. A number of strategies may be used to covalently link molecules together. These include, but are not limited to polypeptide linkages between N- and C-termini of proteins or protein domains, linkage via disulfide bonds, and linkage via chemical cross-linking reagents. In one aspect of this embodiment, the linker is a peptide bond, generated by recombinant techniques or peptide synthesis. Choosing a suitable linker for a specific case where two polypeptide chains are to be connected depends on various parameters, including but not limited to the nature of the two polypeptide chains (e.g., whether they naturally oligomerize), the distance between the N- and the C-termini to be connected if known, and\/or the stability of the linker towards proteolysis and oxidation. Furthermore, the linker may contain amino acid residues that provide flexibility. Thus, the linker peptide may predominantly include the following amino acid residues: Gly, Ser, Ala, or Thr. The linker peptide should have a length that is adequate to link two molecules in such a way that they assume the correct conformation relative to one another so that they retain the desired activity. Suitable lengths for this purpose include at least one and not more than 30 amino acid residues. Preferably, the linker is from about 1 to 30 amino acids in length, with linkers of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 19 and 20 amino acids in length being preferred. In addition, the amino acid residues selected for inclusion in the linker peptide should exhibit properties that do not interfere significantly with the activity of the polypeptide. Thus, the linker peptide on the whole should not exhibit a charge that would be inconsistent with the activity of the polypeptide, or interfere with internal folding, or form bonds or other interactions with amino acid residues in one or more of the monomers that would seriously impede the binding of receptor monomer domains. Useful linkers include glycine-serine polymers (including, for example, (GS)n, (GSGGS)n, (GGGGS)n and (GGGS)n, where n is an integer of at least one), glycine-alanine polymers, alanine-serine polymers, and other flexible linkers such as the tether for the shaker potassium channel, and a large variety of other flexible linkers, as will be appreciated by those in the art. Glycine-serine polymers are preferred since both of these amino acids are relatively unstructured, and therefore may be able to serve as a neutral tether between components. Secondly, serine is hydrophilic and therefore able to solubilize what could be a globular glycine chain. Third, similar chains have been shown to be effective in joining subunits of recombinant proteins such as single chain antibodies. Suitable linkers may also be identified by screening databases of known three-dimensional structures for naturally occurring motifs that can bridge the gap between two polypeptide chains. In a preferred embodiment, the linker is not immunogenic when administered in a human patient. Thus linkers may be chosen such that they have low immunogenicity or are thought to have low immunogenicity. For example, a linker may be chosen that exists naturally in a human. In a preferred embodiment the linker has the sequence of the hinge region of an antibody, that is the sequence that links the antibody Fab and Fc regions; alternatively the linker has a sequence that comprises part of the hinge region, or a sequence that is substantially similar to the hinge region of an antibody. Another way of obtaining a suitable linker is by optimizing a simple linker, e.g., (Gly4Ser)n, through random mutagenesis. Alternatively, once a suitable polypeptide linker is defined, additional linker polypeptides can be created to select amino acids that more optimally interact with the domains being linked. Other types of linkers that may be used in the present invention include artificial polypeptide linkers and inteins. In another embodiment, disulfide bonds are designed to link the two molecules. In another embodiment, linkers are chemical cross-linking agents. For example, a variety of bifunctional protein coupling agents may be used, including but not limited to N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithiol) propionate (SPDP), succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate, iminothiolane (IT), bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters (such as dimethyl adipimidate HCL), active esters (such as disuccinimidyl suberate), aldehydes (such as glutareldehyde), bis-azido compounds (such as bis(p-azidobenzoyl) hexanediamine), bis-diazonium derivatives (such as bis-(p-diazoniumbenzoyl)-ethylenediamine), diisocyanates (such as tolyene 2,6-diisocyanate), and bis-active fluorine compounds (such as 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene). For example, a ricin immunotoxin can be prepared as described in Vitetta et al., 1971, Science 238:1098. Chemical linkers may enable chelation of an isotope. For example, Carbon-14-labeled 1-isothiocyanatobenzyl-3-methyldiethylene triaminepentaacetic acid (MX-DTPA) is an exemplary chelating agent for conjugation of radionucleotide to the antibody (see PCT WO 94\/11026). The linker may be cleavable, facilitating release of the cytotoxic drug in the cell. For example, an acid-labile linker, peptidase-sensitive linker, dimethyl linker or disulfide-containing linker (Chari et al., 1992, Cancer Research 52: 127-131) may be used. Alternatively, a variety of nonproteinaceous polymers, including but not limited to polyethylene glycol (PEG), polypropylene glycol, polyoxyalkylenes, or copolymers of polyethylene glycol and polypropylene glycol, may find use as linkers, that is may find use to link the Fc variants described herein to a fusion partner to generate an Fc fusion, or to link the antibodies and polypeptides described herein to a conjugate.","In one embodiment, an antibody or polypeptide described herein is conjugated or operably linked to another therapeutic compound, referred to herein as a conjugate. The conjugate may be a cytotoxic agent, a chemotherapeutic agent, a cytokine, an anti-angiogenic agent, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, a toxin, a radioisotope, or other therapeutically active agent. Chemotherapeutic agents, cytokines, anti-angiogenic agents, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and other therapeutic agents have been described above, and all of these aforemention therapeutic agents may find use as antibody or Fc fusion conjugates. In an alternate embodiment, the antibody or Fc fusion is conjugated or operably linked to a toxin, including but not limited to small molecule toxins and enzymatically active toxins of bacterial, fungal, plant or animal origin, including fragments and\/or variants thereof. Small molecule toxins include but are not limited to calicheamicin, maytansine (U.S. Pat. No. 5,208,020), trichothene, and CC1065. In one embodiment of the invention, the antibody or polypeptide is conjugated to one or more maytansine molecules (e.g. about 1 to about 10 maytansine molecules per antibody molecule). Maytansine may, for example, be converted to May-SS-Me which may be reduced to May-SH3 and reacted with modified antibody or Fc fusion (Chari et al., 1992, Cancer Research 52: 127-131) to generate a maytansinoid-antibody or maytansinoid-Fc fusion conjugate. Another conjugate of interest comprises an antibody or Fc fusion conjugated to one or more calicheamicin molecules. The calicheamicin family of antibiotics are capable of producing double-stranded DNA breaks at sub-picomolar concentrations. Dolastatin 10 analogs such as auristatin E (AE) and monomethylauristatin E (MMAE) may find use as conjugates for the Fc variants described herein (Doronina et al., 2003, Nat Biotechnol 21(7):778-84; Francisco et al., 2003 Blood 102(4):1458-65). Useful enzymatically active toxins include but are not limited to diphtheria A chain, nonbinding active fragments of diphtheria toxin, exotoxin A chain (from ), ricin A chain, abrin A chain, modeccin A chain, alpha-sarcin, proteins, dianthin proteins, proteins (PAPI, PAPII, and PAP-S), inhibitor, curcin, crotin, sapaonaria officinalis inhibitor, gelonin, mitogellin, restrictocin, phenomycin, enomycin and the tricothecenes. See, for example, PCT WO 93\/21232. The present invention further contemplates a conjugate or fusion formed between an antibody or Fc fusion described herein and a compound with nucleolytic activity, for example a ribonuclease or DNA endonuclease such as a deoxyribonuclease (DNase).","In an alternate embodiment, an Fc variant protein described herein is conjugated or operably linked to a radioisotope to form a radioconjugate. A variety of radioactive isotopes are available for the production of radioconjugate antibodies and Fc fusions. Examples include, but are not limited to, At, I, I, Y, Re, Re, Sm, Bi, Pand radioactive isotopes of Lu.","In yet another embodiment, an Fc varaint described herein is conjugated to a \u201creceptor\u201d (such streptavidin) for utilization in tumor pretargeting wherein the antibody-receptor or Fc fusion-receptor conjugate is administered to the patient, followed by removal of unbound conjugate from the circulation using a clearing agent and then administration of a \u201cligand\u201d (e.g. avidin) which is conjugated to a cytotoxic agent (e.g. a radionucleotide). In an alternate embodiment, the antibody or Fc fusion is conjugated or operably linked to an enzyme in order to employ Antibody Dependent Enzyme Mediated Prodrug Therapy (ADEPT). ADEPT may be used by conjugating or operably linking the antibody or Fc fusion to a prodrug-activating enzyme that converts a prodrug (e.g. a peptidyl chemotherapeutic agent, see PCT WO 81\/01145) to an active anti-cancer drug. See, for example, PCT WO 88\/07378 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,975,278. The enzyme component of the immunoconjugate useful for ADEPT includes any enzyme capable of acting on a prodrug in such a way so as to covert it into its more active, cytotoxic form. Enzymes that are useful in the method of this invention include but are not limited to alkaline phosphatase useful for converting phosphate-containing prodrugs into free drugs; arylsulfatase useful for converting sulfate-containing prodrugs into free drugs; cytosine deaminase useful for converting non-toxic 5-fluorocytosine into the anti-cancer drug, 5-fluorouracil; proteases, such as protease, thermolysin, subtilisin, carboxypeptidases and cathepsins (such as cathepsins B and L), that are useful for converting peptide-containing prodrugs into free drugs; D-alanylcarboxypeptidases, useful for converting prodrugs that contain D-amino acid substituents; carbohydrate-cleaving enzymes such as .beta.-galactosidase and neuramimidase useful for converting glycosylated prodrugs into free drugs; beta-lactamase useful for converting drugs derivatized with .alpha.-lactams into free drugs; and penicillin amidases, such as penicillin V amidase or penicillin G amidase, useful for converting drugs derivatized at their amine nitrogens with phenoxyacetyl or phenylacetyl groups, respectively, into free drugs. Alternatively, antibodies with enzymatic activity, also known in the art as \u201cabzymes\u201d, can be used to convert the prodrugs of the invention into free active drugs (see, for example, Massey, 1987, Nature 328: 457-458). Antibody-abzyme and Fc fusion-abzyme conjugates can be prepared for delivery of the abzyme to a tumor cell population.","Other modifications of the Fc Variants comprise linking said protein or poly-peptide to one of a variety of nonproteinaceous polymers, e.g., polyethylene glycol (PEG), polypropylene glycol, polyoxyalkylenes, or copolymers of polyethylene glycol and polypropylene glycol.","Pharmaceutical compositions are encompassed wherein a Fc variant protein or polypeptide or Fc fusion described herein and one or more therapeutically active agents are formulated. Formulations of the antibodies and Fc fusions described herein are prepared for storage by mixing said antibody or Fc fusion having the desired degree of purity with optional pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients or stabilizers (Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 16th edition, Osol, A.

The formulations to be used for in vivo administration are preferrably sterile. This is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes or other methods.","In certain embodiments, the proteins and polypeptides disclosed herein are formulated as immunoliposomes. A liposome is a small vesicle comprising various types of lipids, phospholipids and\/or surfactant that is useful for delivery of a therapeutic agent to a mammal. Liposomes containing the antibody or Fc fusion are prepared by methods known in the art, such as described in Epstein et al., 1985, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 82:3688; Hwang et al., 1980, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 77:4030; U.S. Pat. No. 4,485,045; U.S. Pat. No. 4,544,545; and PCT WO 97\/38731. Liposomes with enhanced circulation time are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,013,556. The components of the liposome are commonly arranged in a bilayer formation, similar to the lipid arrangement of biological membranes. Particularly useful liposomes can be generated by the reverse phase evaporation method with a lipid composition comprising phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol and PEG-derivatized phosphatidylethanolamine (PEG-PE). Liposomes are extruded through filters of defined pore size to yield liposomes with the desired diameter. A chemotherapeutic agent or other therapeutically active agent is optionally contained within the liposome (Gabizon et al., 1989, J National Cancer Inst 81:1484).","In certain embodiments, the antibodies, polypeptides, and other therapeutically active agents are entrapped in microcapsules prepared by methods including but not limited to coacervation techniques, interfacial polymerization (for example using hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin-microcapsules, or poly-(methylmethacylate) microcapsules), colloidal drug delivery systems (for example, liposomes, albumin microspheres, microemulsions, nano-particles and nanocapsules), and macroemulsions.

Such molecules find applications in the treatment of different disorders.","In certain embodiments, the polypeptide variant with improved ADCC activity is employed in the treatment of diseases or disorders where destruction or elimination of tissue or foreign micro-organisms is desired. For example, the polypeptide may be used to treat cancer; inflammatory disorders; infections (e.g. bacterial, viral, fungal or yeast infections); and other conditions (such as goiter) where removal of tissue is desired, etc.","Where the polypeptide variant has diminished ADCC activity, such variants are used to treat diseases or disorders where a Fc region-containing polypeptide with long half-life is desired, but the polypeptide preferably does not have undesirable effector function(s). For example, in an embodiment, the Fc region-containing polypeptide is an anti-tissue factor (TF) antibody; anti-IgE antibody; and anti-integrin antibody (e.g. an anti-a\u03b14\u03b27 antibody). The desired mechanism of action of such Fc region-containing polypeptides may be to block ligand-receptor binding pairs. Moreover, the Fc-region containing polypeptide with diminished ADCC activity may be an agonist antibody.","In an aspect are provided methods for generating Fc proteins that are subsequently screened experimentally to single out optimized Fc proteins. General methods for antibody molecular biology, expression, purification, and screening are described in Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual by Harlow & Lane, New York: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1988.","One embodiment described herein relates to a rational design process to identify Fc proteins with improved selectivity and binding affinity to the Fc receptors. In one aspect, the invention includes understanding the structural features associated with dynamic properties which drive the interaction between the Fc and its receptors. Another embodiment described herein provides a method for identifying Fc protein polypeptides based on their binding affinities to Fc\u03b3RIIa, Fc\u03b3RIIb, and Fc\u03b3RIIIa, electrostatics, solvation, packing, packing density, hydrogen binding networks and entropic effects associated with the dynamic nature of the protein molecule.

Automation and high-throughput screening technologies may be utilized in the screening procedures. Screening may employ the use of a fusion partner or label.","Design Strategies","A rational design process was undertaken to design Fc proteins with multiple amino acid substitutions that synergistically provide enhanced selectivity and binding affinity to a target Fc receptor. Central to this process is the understanding of structural features and associated dynamic properties which drive the interaction between the Fc and its receptors. Starting with the known co-complex structure between the Fc and the Fc\u03b3RIIIb, homology models were constructed for the receptors of question: Fc\u03b3RIIa, Fc\u03b3RIIb, and Fc\u03b3RIIIa. Applying a proprietary suite of in silico structure and dynamics-based technologies (including but not limited to ZymeCAD\u2122 and ResidueNetworks\u2122 (as described in WO 2009\/098596, US20070276791 and US 20080147360)), unique insights into the structure-function relationships of these protein-protein interactions were identified and led to the proposal of unique combinations of mutations which were predicted to preferentially bind to various Fc receptors, and in certain examples, with improved binding strength. The primary quantitative metric to evaluate the Fc proteins is the binding energies. However, a number of other parameters such as changes in electrostatics, solvation, packing and packing density, hydrogen binding networks and entropic effects associated with the dynamic nature of the protein molecule are also employed in selecting attractive Fc proteins.","WO 2009\/098596 provides methods and systems of determining biopolymer profiles and correlations between structural units (residues) of a biopolymer based on sampling of the conformational space available to the molecule. The correlations between these structural units are further used to find coupled residue networks in the protein.","In one embodiment, the functional and\/or biophysical properties of Fc proteins are screened in an in vitro assay. Assays may employ a variety of detection methods including but not limited to chromogenic, fluorescent, luminescent, or isotopic labels. Assay to detect ADCC include but are not limited to, ADCC reporter assays, cytotoxicity assays, chromium release assay, europium release assay, sulfur release assay, and flow cytometry. Examples of well known assays can be found in the art, for example in Stavenhagen et al.

They should not, however, be construed as limiting the scope of this invention. All literature and patent citations mentioned herein are expressly incorporated by reference.","Antibodies Targeting the HER2\/Neu Receptor:","The Human Epidermal growth factor Receptors (HERs) are proteins embedded in the cell membrane and communicate molecular signals from outside the cell to inside the cell, and turn genes on and off. The HER proteins regulate cell growth, survival, adhesion, migration, and differentiation\u2014functions that are amplified or weakened in cancer cells. Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2\u2033\u2014a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor family, is a protein giving higher aggressiveness in breast cancers. HER2\/neu has also been designated as CD340. Approximately 15-20 percent of breast cancers have an amplification of the HER2\/neu gene or overexpression of its protein product. Overexpression of this receptor in breast cancer is associated with increased disease recurrence and worse prognosis. Because of its prognostic role as well as its ability to predict response to trastuzumab, breast tumors are routinely checked for overexpression of HER2\/neu. Overexpression also occurs in other cancer such as ovarian cancer, stomach cancer, and biologically aggressive forms of uterine cancer, such as uterine serous endometrial carcinoma.","Trastuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to the domain IV of the extracellular segment of the HER2\/neu receptor. Cells treated with trastuzumab undergo arrest during the G1 phase of the cell cycle so there is reduced proliferation. It has been suggested that trastuzumab induces some of its effect by downregulation of HER2\/neu leading to disruption of receptor dimerization and signaling through the downstream PI3K cascade. P27Kip1 is then not phosphorylated and is able to enter the nucleus and inhibit cdk2 activity, causing cell cycle arrest. Also, trastuzumab suppresses angiogenesis by both induction of antiangiogenic factors and repression of proangiogenic factors. It is thought that a contribution to the unregulated growth observed in cancer could be due to proteolytic cleavage of HER2\/neu that results in the release of the extracellular domain. Trastuzumab has been shown to inhibit HER2\/neu ectodomain cleavage in breast cancer cells.","Design of a Polypeptide Comprising a Combination of Modifications that Produce a Selected Fc\u03b3R Binding Profile:","Some of the proteins and polypeptides disclosed herein are designed based on the impact of selected amino acid substitutions to the protein interactions and dynamics, which are indicative of enthalpic and entropic changes, respectively. Relative changes to protein binding characteristics, especially compared to the wild-type system, can be optimized.","In this example, a polypeptide is designed with the goal of selecting amino acid mutations that increase binding selectivity to the Fc\u03b3RIIIa receptor when compared to a wild-type antibody (Trastuzumab\/Herceptin\u00ae). The rational design performed resulted in a quadruple variant (S239E\/S298A\/K326A\/A327H). In the following example, the main strategies of introducing Fc\u03b3RIIIa-specific electrostatic interactions and adding steric repulsion to both Fc\u03b3RIIa and Fc\u03b3RIIb receptors are highlighted such that the selectivity design goal was achieved. In some cases, the mutations' contribution to binding on one chain of the Fc is different than the other chain and these chain-specific effects are also demonstrated. The specific effects to binding as a result of each of the four mutations are discussed with the binding profile of the Fc variant being an overall synergistic combination of the structural and dynamic changes.","A327H as a Steric Selectivity Driver:","His327 is a much bulkier group compared to the wild-type alanine and this substitution is a main selectivity driver that has minimal impact on the Fc\u03b3RIIIa receptor while being detrimental for Fc\u03b3RIIa and Fc\u03b3RIIb. As shown in , the binding interface and the protein-protein interactions with the Fc\u03b3RIIIa are preserved with the addition of His327 when compared to the wild-type Fc, which suggests that binding will not be affected between these two partners. The primary factor for the interface stabilization is due to the presence of the sidechain hydroxyl group from Tyr132 in Fc\u03b3RIIIa. This non-conserved moiety is not present in Fc\u03b3RIIa and hence the addition of His327 resulted in a major destabilization of the binding interface, most notably with the rapid dynamics observed for the receptor's neighboring His134 residue (). It is anticipated that binding to the IIa receptor will be severely disrupted.","While Fc\u03b3RIIIa and Fc\u03b3RIIa share a conserved His134 residue that is differentially affected with the addition of His327 to the Fc, Fc\u03b3RIIb contains of an even bulkier Arg134. While this residue is also perturbed with the His134 mutation, it is however able to adopt a pseudo-favorable conformation that is stabilized with a serine sidechain on the Fc (). It is expected that binding of the Fc to the III) receptor will be reduced but not abolished because of the stabilized Arg rotomer.","S239E as an Electrostatic General Stabilizer and a Selectivity Driver:","The mutation S239E displays Fc chain-specific interactions to the receptors thereby facilitating both of its roles as a general stabilizing mutation as well as a selectivity driver for the Fc\u03b3RIIIa receptor.Glu239 on chain-B of the Fc () is a general stabilizing residue across all three receptors as it is able to form a hydrogen bond with conserved Lys120 residues. General stabilizing residues are beneficial in protein variant design as they ensure that the integrity of the binding interfaces is maintained when numerous mutations are introduced within confined areas.","The S239E mutation, when introduced on chain-A of the Fc () is a selectivity driver for improved Fc\u03b3RIIIa binding as it is able to form a bifurcated electrostatic interaction with the non-conserved Lys161 while the enhanced binding interaction is not possible with the Thr161 in the Fc\u03b3RIIa and IIb receptors.","S298A as Both a Steric and Electrostatic Selectivity Driver","The Ser298 residue in the wild-type antibody Fc interacts with Ser129 in the Fc\u03b3RIIa and IIb receptors via hydrogen bonding while the receptors' Lys128 is stabilized intramolecularly and is not involved in any binding interactions (). The S298A mutation removes one of the key electrostatic binding partners between the Fc and the receptors and is therefore expected to drastically reduce binding to Fc\u03b3RIIa and IIb receptors.","The wild-type Fc binds to the Fc\u03b3RIIIa receptor using a different mechanism, with the interaction mediated by the backbone carbonyl group of Ser298 on the Fc with Lys128 from the receptor, which is able to partially occupy the binding interface. The sidechain flexibility and motions required for this interaction was demonstrated using molecular dynamics simulations (). The Fc\u03b3RIIIa's Lys128 is \u2018locked\u2019 and pre-positioned in the binding conformation when the S298A mutation is introduced in the Fc.","Synergistic Combination of Mutations","By combining the above computational and structural insights in the Fc design process; the present disclosure provides a new variant that has, relative to the wild-type Fc, improved Fc\u03b3RIIIa binding while having reduced binding to Fc\u03b3RIIb and substantially abolished binding to Fc\u03b3RIIa. As illustrated by in vitro binding assays with the resulting binding profile shown in .","These results also demonstrate the unexpected synergistic nature of these mutations (). With the single S239E mutation, it is shown that the variants cannot clearly differentiate binding between the highly homologous receptors. With the addition of the S298A\/K326A\/A327H mutation combination, Fc\u03b3RIIIa selectivity was improved.","Once designed in silico individual antibodies are tested according to the methods described in Stavenhagen et al. (2007) 67:882 and Stavenhagen et al. (2008), 48:152.","Briefly, the gene for each mutant is constructed by standard chemical synthesis using, for example, Trastuzumab IgG1 as the wild-type framework. After cloning into a suitable vector, the mutant Fc polypeptides are expressed in mammalian HEK293 cells. The Fc\u03b3RIIa, Fc\u03b3RIIb and Fc\u03b3RIIIa are also cloned and expressed in HEK293 cells. The binding affinities of the antibodies to each of the three receptors is then determined by surface plasmon resonance.","Surface Plasmon Resonance Analysis:","Affinity of Fc\u03b3 receptors to antibody Fc was measure by SPR (surface Plasmon resonance) using a ProteOn XPR36 system from BIO-RAD. HER-2 in buffer (10 mM Hepes pH 6.8) was immobilized on CM5 chip through amine coupling until 3000 RU. Fc variants in an antibody format containing anti HER2 F(ab)were immobilized to the HER-2 surface to 300 RU. Running buffer and the surfactant was maintained at pH 6.8. Purified analyte FcR was diluted in its running buffer and injected at a flow rate of 20-30 mul\/min for 2 minutes, followed by dissociation for another 4 minutes. Five twofold dilutions of each antibody beginning at 20 nM were analyzed in triplicate. Sensograms were fit globally to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model. All experiments were conducted at room temperature. The in vitro binding Kd determined by SPR for each variant is shown in Table 1.","Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity Analysis:","The SKBR-3 cells were used as target cells in these experiments. A fresh vial of cryopreserved SKBR3 cells was thawed and a robust culture established. The SKBR3 cells were maintained in McKoy's medium enriched with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum and 1% PenStrep. The cells were passaged regularly upon attaining \u02dc75% confluence (approximately every 3-4 days). To verify the binding of the variant antibodies to the target cells (SKBR3), binding curves for all variants and positive control (Herceptin) were obtained. SKBR-3 cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in FACS (Fluorescence-activated cell sorting) tubes at 2\u00d710cells per tube in 100 \u03bcl volume of PBS\/1% BSA. Antibodies were added to the tubes to achieve 0.1, 1 and 10 \u03bcg\/ml final concentration, cells incubated on ice for 1 hour, washed with 1% BSA\/PBS and resuspended in 1:200 dilution of FITC-conjugated anti-human IgG. Cells were incubated on ice for another 40 min, washed again and resuspended in 200 \u03bcl of PBS. 10 \u03bcl of 10 mg\/ml Propidium Iodide were added to each tube, and samples were analyzed by FACS. FACS gates were set to exclude dead cells (PI+). The Mean Fluorescence Intensity (\u201cMFI\u201d) for each sample was measured. Cells stained with secondary but not primary antibody were used as negative control. As measured from the fold-difference in mean fluorescence intensity (\u201cMFI\u201d), all variants demonstrated levels of binding comparable to Herceptin.","To establish an effector:target cell (E:T) ratio and duration of incubation to achieve suitable cell killing, a preliminary ADCC experiment was performed using Herceptin as a positive control. SKBR-3 cells were seeded in flat bottom 96 well plates a day prior to experiment, at 2\u00d710cells per well in 200 \u03bcl of culture media. PBMCs were purified from fresh buffy coats from five different donors using Ficoll gradient centrifugation, washed 3 times with PBS and resuspended in RPMI containing 10% Heat Inactivated FBS and 10 ng\/ml IL-2. Twenty four hours later, three wells containing SKBR-3 cells were trypsinized to verify cell count and to determine the exact number of PBMCs required to achieve the desired E:T ratio. Target cells were labeled with 10 \u03bcg\/ml CFSE immediately prior of assay. Antibody (Herceptin) was added to cells at 1 and 10 \u03bcg\/ml and incubated for 15 min. PBMCs at 10:1, 50:1 and 100:1 effector:target (E:T) ratio were then added to corresponding wells, and plates were briefly spun down at low RPM to concentrate cells in the bottom of the wells. The plates were then incubated in a standard tissue culture incubator for four, eight and twenty four hours. Following treatment, cells were harvested and added to 400 \u03bcl PBS containing propidium iodide (\u201cPI\u201d), a viability stain, and immediately analyzed by FACS. The extent of ADCC activity was determined by measuring the frequency of PI green cells (killed targets) as the fraction of total target cells (PI and PI green cells). The pilot ADCC experiment demonstrated significant ADCC activity of Herceptin in SKBR3 cells. At 24 hours, higher E:T ratios (50:1 and 100:1) appeared to result in some antibody independent cell death. Because the killing of the cells at antibody concentrations of 1 and 10 \u03bcg\/ml is indistinguishable, ADCC activity appears to be saturating above 1 \u03bcg\/ml. Optimal results were observed at 24 hours with an E:T ratio of 10:1.","For the subsequent ADCC experiment, PBMCs from five buffy coats were purified using Ficoll gradient centrifugation. Following centrifugation and washes, cells were resuspended in 100 ml of pre-warmed RPMI. The cells were counted, and viability was determined by the Trypan Blue exclusion. An aliquot of cells from each donor was cryopreseved for future use. An additional aliquot of cells was used for FACS-based genotyping for the 158V\/F CD16 polymorphism using a two-antibody staining protocol that exploits the fact that the G38 anti-CD16 antibody binds with equal affinity to both V and F alleles and comparing that with staining using the MEM-154 anti-CD16 antibody that has a lower affinity for the V allele than for the F allele (S. Bottcher et al., 2005, Journal of Immunological Methods, Volume 306, Issues 1-2, pp 128-136). Based on the CD16 genotyping results, samples from three donors heterozygous in the F\/V, high cell viability and no endogenous cell killing were selected. All data points were obtained in triplicate wells and the viability for each donor was normalized to the viability of SKBR-3 cells incubated with PBMCs of the same donor, but without test antibody. The average ADCC results for these samples are summarized in Table 1.","As seen from table 1, the ex vivo ADCC assay revealed that a designed variants had significantly lowered ADCC than the wild-type antibody. This shows that the variations described herein are useful in modulating ADCC.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0237","num":"0236"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"385pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE

The recommended dosage for patients with low-grade or follicular NHL is 375 mg\/m 2 infused i.v. at weekly intervals for a total of four doses. In a majority of patients, this can be accomplished in an outpatient clinic over a 22-day period.","Just before administration, the antibody preparation is diluted with 5% dextrose in water or 0.9% sodium chloride injection to a final concentration of 1-4 mg\/mL. A 1-mg\/mL dilution is preferable to facilitate adjustments in the infusion and to avoid adverse effects potentially caused by inadvertently rapid administration. Prepared infusions are stable in polyvinyl chloride or polyethylene bags at 2-8\u00b0 C. (36-46\u00b0 F.) for 24 hours and at room temperature for an additional 12 hours. Unused portions of undiluted drug must be discarded because of the absence of a preservative.","Thirty to 60 minutes before each infusion, acetaminophen 650-1000 mg and diphenhydramine hydrochloride 50-100 mg can be administered to help prevent infusion-related effects. Infusion may be through either a central or peripheral i.v. catheter but should never be given by i.v. push or bolus injection, owing to the risk of potentially serious infusion-related adverse effects. Before beginning each infusion, the administering clinician must prime the i.v. tubing with drug-containing solution to guarantee that active drug rather than other solution is being infused from the beginning. The first infusion should be initiated at 50 mg\/hr with the rate increased by 50 mg\/hr every 30 minutes as tolerated until a maximum rate of 400 mg\/hr is reached. Subsequent infusions may be started at 100 mg\/hr, with 100-mg\/hr increases every 30 minutes as tolerated until the maximum rate (400 mg\/hr) is attained. In patients with a large tumor burden (white blood cell count, >25,000\/mm 3), an initial infusion rate of 25 mg\/hr should be considered.","All subjects receive anti-CD22 antibodies incorporating the Fc polypeptide modifications described herein monthly, with loading doses on days 8 and 15 of month one, until disease progression or subject discontinuation. The drug is prepared in a 10 mg\/ml prepared in 17.5 vials. Administration is carried out by slow intravenous infusion using PBS as a vehicle\/buffer for the infusion procedures. All patients were given 1200 mg antibody given in 2 doses every other week in 12 week treatment cycles. Assessments of the patients treated were accomplished through a combined response index analysis evaluating BILAG, SLEDAI, and a physician's global assessment and treatment failure status.","The dosage used is 120-1000-mg\/m2 by infusion with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.","Sub-CutaneousAdministration of Antibodies comprising the amino acid modifications described herein","The subcutaneous immunoglobulin is infused in the subcutaneous tissue on the abdomen twice or thrice a week, with a maximal speed of 2 mL\/h. Every time 20 mL is infused, the needle is removed to a new place.","Continuous monthly administration of anti-hepatitis B antibodies incorporating the Fc polypeptides described herein at 5000 IU a month as a treatment results in reduced serum levels of the patient's own anti-hepatitis B antibodies and decreased symptoms of liver disease.","Treatment of organ transplant patients is done either weekly, biweekly, bi-monthly, or monthly, by infusion of anti-CD20 antibodies comprising the amino acid modifications provided herein from 100 to 1000 mg\/m2, according the above protocol for infusion and pretreatment.","The polypeptides and methods disclosed herein are used, without limitation to develop antibodies and polypeptides based on synergistic improvements to the Fc region of the following antibodies: Bevacizumab (Avastin); Abciximab (ReoPro); Adalimumab (Humira); Alemtuzumab (Campath); Cetuximab (Erbitux); Efalizumab (Raptiva); Etanercept (Enbrel); Gemtuzumab oxogamicin (Mylotarg); Infliximab (Remicade); Natalizumab (Tysabri, aka Antegren); Omalizumab (Xolair); Palivizumab (Syangis); Rituximab (Rituxan); Trastuzumab (Herceptin); Golimumab (Simponi); Panitumumab (Vectibix); Canakinumab (ILARIS); Ustekinumab (Stelara); Denosumab (Prolia); Ofatumumab (Arzerra)","While specific embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described herein, it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that such embodiments are provided by way of example only.
