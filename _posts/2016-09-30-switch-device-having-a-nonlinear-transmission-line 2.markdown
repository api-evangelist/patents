title: Switch device having a non-linear transmission line
abstract: Switching devices are provided. The switching devices include an input electrode, having a main electrode and a trigger electrode, and an output electrode. The main electrode and the trigger electrode are separated from the output electrode by a main gap and a trigger gap, respectively. During operation, the trigger electrode compresses and amplifies a trigger voltage signal causing the trigger electrode to emit a pulse of energy. This pulse of energy form plasma near the trigger electrode, either by arcing across the trigger gap, or by arcing from the trigger electrode to the main electrode. This plasma decreases the breakdown voltage of the main gap. Simultaneously, or near simultaneously, a main voltage signal propagates through the main electrode. The main voltage signal emits a main pulse of energy that arcs across the main gap while the plasma formed by the trigger pulse is still present.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENTAL INTEREST","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","OVERVIEW","CONCLUSION"],"p":["This invention was developed under Contract DE-AC04-94AL85000 between Sandia Corporation and the U.S. Department of Energy. The U.S. Government has certain rights in this invention.","A detonator is a device used to trigger an explosive device. Detonators can be chemically, mechanically, or electrically initiated. There are three categories of electrical detonators: instantaneous electrical detonators (IED), short period delay detonators (SPD) and long period delay detonators (LPD). Delays in SPDs are measured in milliseconds, and delays in LPDs are measured in seconds. These conventional electrical detonators often use switches that activate using a surface breakdown. For example, some conventional switches use a thin\/thick dielectric film between two electrodes that needs to be broken down by a high voltage. However, these conventional switches often suffer from switch to switch jitter behavior. In some situations, two switches operating at similar voltage amplitudes and with similar voltage pulse rise times, can often have their dielectric gap breakdown occur with different timing. For example, one switch can operate 100 ns after initial voltage application but a second switch can operate after 250 ns after the initial voltage application. This switch jitter behavior often results from variations of thickness of dielectric material of the dielectric gap which can result in variations of the time required for the voltage application to break through the dielectric gap.","Switching devices are provided. The switching devices include an input electrode, having a main electrode and a trigger electrode, and an output electrode. The main electrode and the trigger electrode are separated from the output electrode by a main gap and a trigger gap, respectively. During operation, the trigger electrode compresses and amplifies a trigger voltage signal causing the trigger electrode to emit a pulse of energy. This pulse of energy form plasma near the trigger electrode, either by arcing across the trigger gap, or by arcing from the trigger electrode to the main electrode. This plasma decreases the breakdown voltage of the main gap. Simultaneously, or near simultaneously, a main voltage signal propagates through the main electrode. The main voltage signal emits a main pulse of energy that arcs across the main gap while the plasma formed by the trigger pulse is still present. Thereafter, current flows from the main electrode, through the arc, to the output electrode to provide an output voltage signal.","A first exemplary switch device includes an input electrode and an output electrode. The input electrode includes a central electrode, a main electrode electrically connected to the central electrode, and a trigger electrode electrically connected to the central electrode, The trigger electrode includes a non-linear transmission line. In this first exemplary switch device, a first part of the output electrode is separated from an end of the main electrode by a main gap and a second part of the output electrode is separated from an end of the trigger electrode by a trigger gap. The trigger gap and main gap are located such that arcing of a current across the trigger gap or between the main electrode and the trigger electrode decreases a breakdown voltage of the main gap.","A second exemplary switch device includes an input electrode and an output electrode. The input electrode includes a main electrode and a trigger electrode having, a non-linear transmission line. The output electrode is separated from the main electrode and the trigger electrode by a main gap and a trigger gap, respectively. In this second exemplary switch device, the non-linear transmission line compresses and amplifies a trigger voltage signal to cause the trigger electrode to emit a trigger pulse of energy. The trigger pulse of energy creates plasma in or near the main gap, such that a breakdown voltage of the main gap decreases. The main electrode propagates a main voltage signal to cause the main electrode to emit a main pulse of energy. The main pulse of energy creates, assisted by the plasma created by the trigger pulse of energy, an arc from the main gap to the output electrode.","A method for operating a switch device is also disclosed. The switch device includes an input electrode, including a main electrode and a trigger electrode, and an output electrode, the output electrode being separated from the main electrode and the trigger electrode by a main gap and a trigger gap, respectively. The method includes transmitting an input voltage signal to the input electrode, wherein the input voltage signal creates a trigger voltage signal in the trigger electrode, and a main voltage signal in the main electrode, compressing and amplifying the trigger voltage signal in the trigger electrode, to create a trigger pulse of energy that creates plasma in or near the main gap, such that a breakdown voltage of the main gap decreases, and propagating the main voltage signal along the main electrode to the main gap, to create a main pulse of energy that arcs across the main gap to the output electrode while the breakdown voltage of the main gap is decreased.","The disclosure will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the drawings, like reference numbers generally indicate identical, functionally similar, and\/or structurally similar elements. The drawing in which an element first appears is indicated by the leftmost digit(s) in the reference number.","In some embodiments, switching devices are provided. The switching devices include an input electrode, having a main electrode and a trigger electrode, and an output electrode. The main electrode and the trigger electrode are separated from the output electrode by a main gap and a trigger gap, respectively. During operation, the trigger electrode compresses and amplifies a trigger voltage signal causing the trigger electrode to emit a pulse of energy. This pulse of energy form plasma near the trigger electrode, either by arcing across the trigger gap, or by arcing from the trigger electrode to the main electrode. This plasma decreases the breakdown voltage of the main gap. Simultaneously, or near simultaneously, a main voltage signal propagates through the main electrode. The main voltage signal emits a main pulse of energy that arcs across the main gap while the plasma formed by the trigger pulse is still present. Thereafter, current flows from the main electrode, through the arc, to the output electrode to provide an output voltage signal. Because the trigger electrode amplifies and compresses the trigger voltage signal, the trigger pulse can reliably form a plasma based on an input voltage signal lower than would be possible in the absence of amplification. And, the plasma formed by the trigger pulse allows the main pulse to arc based on an input voltage lower than would be possible in the absence of such plasma.","First Exemplary Switch Device",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 1A","b":["100","102","104","102","106","107","108","109","104","117","118","106","108","114","110","107","106","117","104","112","109","108","118","104","106","108","104","117","118","104"]},"In some embodiments, the main gap  has a length of 2 microns to 1000 microns.

In an example, the variable capacitor can be formed by way of axially stacking such layers or radially stacking such layers. For instance, when the layers are radially stacked, the variable capacitor can include one or more concentric rings.

The input voltage signal creates a trigger voltage signal in a trigger electrode of the switch device, and a main voltage signal in a main electrode of the switch device. The input voltage signal can be a series of voltage pulses, or repetitive voltage pulses, ranging from a few Hertz (Hz) to many Megahertz (MHz) to provide an example.","At step , the exemplary operational control flow  compresses and amplifies the trigger voltage signal of step  in the trigger electrode to create a trigger pulse of energy.","At step , the trigger pulse arcs across the trigger gap, or between the trigger electrode and the main electrode. The amplification of the trigger voltage signal assists with such arcing, as arcing occurs at higher voltages. This arcing creates plasma in or near the main gap, such that a breakdown voltage of the main gap decreases. The specific location of arcing from the trigger electrode is not particularly important, so long as it creates plasma in or near the main gap. This plasma acts as a conductor, and decreases the breakdown voltage of the main gap.","In some embodiments, the trigger gap and\/or the main gap include the solid material. In this exemplary embodiment, the trigger pulse of energy effectively vaporizes, namely changes a physical state from a solid to a gas, the solid material of the trigger gap and\/or of the main gap when present by forming a plasma, or plasma-like material, in or near the main gap.","This vaporization of the solid material is irreversible. As a result, the switch device  can be considered to be a single operation device. However, if the main gap  and\/or the trigger gap  does not include the solid material and is filled with the gas as discussed above, the switch device  can be considered to be a multi-operation or re-usable device.","When the trigger pulse of energy exceeds a breakdown voltage of any gas present within the trigger gap, a spark forms between the main electrode and the trigger electrode, ionizing the gas of the trigger gap. Usually, this ionizing of the gas of the trigger gap is violent and disruptive, often leading to sound, light, and\/or heat.","At step , the main voltage signal propagates along the main electrode to the main gap. This creates a main pulse of energy at the end of the main electrode.","At step , the main pulse of energy arcs across the main gap to an output electrode of the switch device, while the breakdown voltage of the main gap is decreased by plasma created by the trigger pulse.","Depending on the structure of the switch, a solid material may be present in the main and\/or trigger gap before the switch is used. The trigger pulse of energy and the main pulse of energy vaporizes any solid material that may be present in the main gap when present, and ionizes the gas of the main gap. Thereafter, an electric main current flows via arcing between the main electrode and the output electrode using a pathway formed by the ionized gas of the main gap to provide an output voltage signal.","The non-linear transmission line may amplify the trigger voltage signal by any suitable amount. In some embodiments, the trigger voltage signal is amplified by at least a factor of 3 in the trigger electrode.","The input signal may be a single pulse, or a repetitive pulse.","The Detailed Description referred to accompanying figures to illustrate exemplary embodiments consistent with the disclosure.
