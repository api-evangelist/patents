{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured, used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government.","Embodiments of the present invention generally relate to magnetic imaging and, more particularly, to a surface scanning radio frequency antenna for magnetic resonance force microscopy.","Magnetic resonance force microscopy (MRFM) is an imaging technique that acquires magnetic resonance images (MRI) at nanometer scales, and possibly at atomic scales in the future. An MRFM system comprises a probe, method of applying a background magnetic field, electronics, and optics. The system measures variations in the resonant frequency of a cantilever or variations in the amplitude of an oscillating cantilever. The changes in the characteristic of the cantilever being monitored are indicative of the tomography of the sample. More specifically, as depicted in , an MRFM probe  comprises a base  with a cantilever  tipped with a magnetic (for example, Samarium cobalt) particle  to resonate as the spin of the electrons or nuclei in the sample  are reversed. There is a background magnetic field  generated by a background magnetic field generator  which creates a uniform background magnetic field in the sample . As the magnetic tip  moves close to the sample , the atoms' electrons or nuclear spins become attracted (force detection) to the tip and generate a small force on the cantilever . Using a radio frequency (RF) magnetic field applied by an RF antenna\/wire coil  through the RF source , the spins are then repeatedly flipped at the cantilever's resonant frequency, causing the cantilever  to oscillate at its resonant frequency. In the geometry shown, springiness preservation by aligning magnetization (SPAM), when the cantilever  oscillates, the magnetic particle's  magnetic moment remains parallel to the background magnetic field , and thus it experiences no torque. The displacement of the cantilever is measured with an optical sensor  comprised of an interferometer (laser beam)  and an optical fiber  to create a series of 2-D images of the sample  held by sample stage , which are combined to generate a 3-D image. The interferometer measures the time dependent displacement of the cantilever . Smaller ferromagnetic particles and softer cantilevers increase the signal to noise ratio of the sensor. Current magnetic resonance force microscopy probes are limited to small samples due to probe geometries, where the radio frequency (RF) magnetic field is applied by a wire coil  positioned at an edge  of the sample . Because the wire coil  must be positioned at the edge  of the sample , the probe can only measure the topography near the edge or on a small sample.","Therefore, there is a need in the art for probe for magnetic resonance force microscopy in a more flexible manner for scanning arbitrarily large samples not limited to the edge of samples.","Embodiments of the present invention relate to a probe for scanning a surface of an arbitrarily sized sample in magnetic resonance force microscopy comprising a magnetic sensor having a support element coupled to a magnetic particle; an RF antenna, at least partially circumscribing the magnetic sensor, for emitting an RF magnetic field across a portion of the sample; and an optical sensor, positioned proximate the magnetic sensor, for detecting displacement of the support element.","Embodiments of the present invention comprise a probe for use in magnetic resonance force microscopy (MRFM). Embodiments of the probe may be used in an MRFM technique known as Springiness Preservation by Aligning Magnetization (SPAM). By adopting the SPAM geometry and using a new probe geometry, accurate scanning of arbitrarily sized samples is achieved, not limited to scanning the edges of a sample.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","202","204","204","206","216","204","201","206","208","208","210","204","204","212","214","216","200","217","218","218","212","201","212","214","212","214","201","212","201","212","206","212","216","217","212","201","212","212","118","212","216","212","212"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["300","300","302","305","105","304","306","318","304","302","201","308","310","304","317","218","302","201","201","306","305","304","302","304","310","108","102","304","310","312","302","304","310","302","201","201"]},"The RF antenna  produces both RF magnetic field and RF electric fields. Typically, MRFM uses the RF magnetic field to oscillate the spin of atoms in the sample. The RF electric field is undesired in MRFM because it causes transients in the magnetic sensor  oscillation frequency and\/or the position of the support element . The RF electric field along the axis of an ideal loop antenna is zero. The support element  and the magnetic particle  are then located in a much stronger RF magnetic field than in conventional MRFM systems. In an exemplary embodiment the RF antenna , the antenna has a nearly circular shape with a small gap at which the input lead  and the output lead  extend outwards on the same plane. In other embodiments, the leads  and  extend downward or in another direction. In yet another embodiment, the RF antenna  does not have extended leads, but receives RF power through an inductive coupling to another segment of nearby wire (not shown).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"],"b":["400","402","310","201","402","310","414","416","403","402"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4"],"b":["500","502","514","516","403","502","310","168","310","502","310","314","316"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","602","614","616","305","602","603","602","604","602","603","604","602","201","201","602","201","310"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["700","201","702","714","716","304","306","702","310","304","702","702","201","310"]},"In any of the foregoing embodiments, the sample and the magnetic particle can be swapped, such that the sample is coupled to the cantilever and the magnetic particle is replaced with a single particle or an array of magnetic particles secured to a moveable stage.","The foregoing description, for purpose of explanation, has been described with reference to specific embodiments.
