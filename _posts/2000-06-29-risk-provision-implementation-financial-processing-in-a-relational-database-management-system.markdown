Field of the Invention","This invention relates in general to financial processing systems performed by computers, and in particular, to the implementation of \u201crisk provision\u201d calculations for financial processing using data accessed from a relational database management system.","2. Description of Related Art","Financial processing systems provide tools for financial analysis of accounting data. Typically, each financial processing system operates in a unique way and approaches financial analysis differently. Some financial processing systems are advanced in their approach to profitability calculations, and others are still at a more basic level. In addition, there is no agreement as to the rules for profitability calculations, outside of generally accepted accounting policies that external auditors use.","Yet, the majority of financial processing systems attempt to use profitability calculations to differentiate between sources of revenues and expenses. There is a need, then, for a flexible approach to profitability calculations in terms of the overall metric, as well as the type of data used.","A Value Analyzer is a data-driven computer-facilitated financial processing system that accesses account, event and organization attributes from a relational database management database, wherein: (1) the account attributes comprise data about accounts being measured, (2) the event attributes comprise data about account-related transactions, and (3) the organization attributes comprise data about the organization's financial status. Profitability calculations are performed using the account, event and organization attributes accessed from the relational database management system, as well as one or more profit factors and one or more rules. The profitability calculations include the following:\n\nProfit=Net Interest Revenue (NIR)\n\n+Other Revenue (OR)\n\n\u2212Direct Expense (DE)\n\n\u2212Indirect Expense (IE)\n\n\u2212Risk Provision (RP)\n","In this calculation, Risk Provision (RP) comprises an expected future loss that arises from one or more risk factors.","In the following description of the preferred embodiment, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration a specific embodiment in which the invention may be practiced. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.","The Value Analyzer is a data-driven computer-facilitated financial model that provides accurate and consistent profitability calculations using account, event and organization data stored in a relational database management system (RDBMS), wherein: (1) the account attributes comprise data about accounts being measured, (2) the event attributes comprise data about account-related transactions, and (3) the organization attributes comprise data about the organization's financial status. The profitability calculations performed by the Value Analyzer rely on a Five Factor Atomic Profit Metric (FFAPM):\n\nProfit=Net Interest Revenue (NIR)\n\n+Other Revenue (OR)\n\n\u2212Direct Expense (DE)\n\n\u2212Indirect Expense (IE)\n\n\u2212Risk Provision (RP)\n\n=NIR+OR\u2212DE\u2212IE\u2212RP\n","In the above equation, it is assumed that the sign of elements that reduce profit are negative and those that contribute are positive.","Each of the five factors of FFAPM are defined below:\n\n","Each of these five factors can be measured for a desired period (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, etc.). Moreover, each factor is essentially discrete and independent with fundamentally different characteristics, which strengthens the user's ability to fully utilize the output to determine relationships between account, event and organization data, and enable consistent multiple dimensional aggregation.","The FFAPM is \u201catomic\u201d in that profitability is computed using data stored in a relational database management system (RDBMS). There are three aspects to this:\n\n","The Value Analyzer generally defines \u201cindirect\u201d components of profitability to be those which must be apportioned to accounts and \u201cdirect\u201d components to be those which are either computed at the account level, or are rolled up to the account level from lower level events.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","104","106"]},"In the preferred embodiment, the Value Analyzer Client  and the Value Analyzer Calculation Engine  together are referred to as the Value Analyzer. Generally, the Value Analyzer Client  includes a graphical user interface (GUI) for operators of the system , wherein requests are transmitted to the Value Analyzer Calculation Engine  and responses are received therefrom. The Value Analyzer Calculation Engine  performs the profitability calculations and other processing, including commands or functions for performing various search and retrieval functions in the RDBMS , wherein queries are transmitted to the RDBMS  as requests and tuples are received therefrom as responses. The Value Analyzer Client  and the Value Analyzer Calculation Engine  may be implemented in separate machines, or may be implemented as separate or related processes in a single machine.","In the preferred embodiment, the RDBMS  includes at least one Parsing Engine (PE)  and one or more Access Module Processors (AMPs) A-E storing the relational database in one or more data storage devices A-E. The Parsing Engine  and Access Module Processors  may be implemented in separate machines, or may be implemented as separate or related processes in a single machine. The RDBMS  used in the preferred embodiment comprises the Teradata\u00ae RDBMS sold by NCR Corporation, the assignee of the present invention, although other DBMS's could be used.","In the preferred embodiment, the system  may use any number of different parallelism mechanisms to take advantage of the parallelism offered by multiple Access Module Processors . Further, data within the relational database may be fully partitioned across all data storage devices  in the system  using hash partitioning or other partitioning methods.","Generally, the Value Analyzer Client , Value Analyzer Calculation Engine , RDBMS , Parsing Engine , and\/or Access Module Processors A-E comprise logic and\/or data tangibly embodied in and\/or accessible from a device, media, carrier, or signal, such as RAM, ROM, one or more of the data storage devices A-E, and\/or a remote system or device communicating with the computer system  via one or more data communications devices.","However, those skilled in the art will recognize that the exemplary environment illustrated in  is not intended to limit the present invention. Indeed, those skilled in the art will recognize that other alternative environments may be used without departing from the scope of the present invention. In addition, it should be understood that the present invention may also apply to components other than those disclosed herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["104","104","200","202","204","206","208","200","210","212","214","214"]},"Input Definitions","Account Attributes  comprise data about the accounts being measured. This data includes: balance, rate (or interest accrued), product identification, limits, expected default frequency, and various dates (e.g., open, rate reset, last payment, next payment, maturity, etc.).","Event Attributes  comprise data about account-related events or transactions. This data includes: account identification, event or transaction amounts, event or transaction location, event or transaction time, counter-party identification, event or transaction type (e.g., loan payment, interest paid, loan draw down amount, etc.).","Organization Attributes  comprise data about the financial status of the organization. This data includes: balance sheet and profit statement amounts aggregated by the legal or management entities that own the account base being measured.","Profit Factors  include parameter values necessary to perform the Profitability Calculations . The major classifications of this data include:\n\n","Rules","The Profitability Calculations  use one or more Rules  applied to data retrieved from the RDBMS . These Rules  include, inter alia, the following:","Treatments. Every account with cash flows affecting a organization's balance sheet requires a method of valuing the account's use of internal funds. One approach is \u201cmatched maturity funds transfer pricing,\u201d which uses a canonical representation of an account's funding characteristics and then determines a value based on adjusted market yields for each instance that requires an interest rate transfer price to calculate an account's marginal Net Interest Revenue.","Equity Allocation. In order to provide precise Net Interest Revenue calculations, the amount of equity funds required at an account must be determined. This rule allows for equity allocation using any of the following methods: simple ratios; regulatory definitions; economic allocations, or user defined allocations.","Apportionment. Other Revenue, Risk Provision and Indirect Expense calculations are applied at the account level using Organization Attributes  that are not related directly to account activity. These profit adjustments are made so that the sum of all account-level Profitability Calculations  comprises the overall profit. One approach is to pool indirect costs and revenues and then apportion them. Apportionment rules specify how the pooled indirect costs and revenues is completely allocated to appropriate accounts, wherein the preferred embodiment uses closed form rules, which require only information known in the current period and not iterative computation.","Amortization. Some types of income or expense are deferred or accrued over multiple periods, including and subsequent to the current accounting period. This is common to accrual accounting methods used in profit presentations of financial statements, and gives rise to timing differences between cash flows and their related profit as presented in a financial statement in any accounting period. Since the Value Analyzer is designed to reconcile to the financial statement's profit values, it supports deferral and accrual accounting principles. Amortization methods that account for these timing differences are: interest amortization (used for interest income and expense accruals and for deferral of fees that are in lieu of interest), and straight line or declining balance amortizations (used for cost deferrals and investment depreciation).","Other Revenue Pricing. In situations where account and event activity can be used to derive account level income or fees, the Value Analyzer calculates these drivers of the profitability in the Other Revenue calculations. These calculations comprise linear combinations of event or account values and modeled coefficients.","Direct Expense. The calculation of account profit adjustments due to account-related activity requires rules that take the form of linear combinations of event or account values and modeled coefficients.","Indirect Expense. In situations where expense apportionment or amortization amounts are aggregated, the user may want different rules applied depending on the path (or =dimension) of aggregation. These rules allow for multiple profit calculations rules to be applied to derive multiple account level Indirect Expense amounts.","Risk Provision. Adjusting current profit for expected future losses is known as \u201cactuarial\u201d profit provisioning. The Value Analyzer applies actuarial-based methods in its account level profit calculations, where the actuarial reserve that the provisions maintain represents the expected loss associated with all accounts.","Taxable Equivalent Gross-up. Profit is an after-tax measure, and thus some events or portions of some accounts' profits may be excluded from normal taxation. The Value Analyzer adjusts these pre-tax values, so that a singular tax rate can be used to convert pre-tax profit into after-tax values, which are also known as taxable equivalent adjustment. These rules use account and event attributes to adjust each of the five factors of the FFAPM to a taxable equivalent basis.","Interest Yield Adjustments. Since the Value Analyzer can calculate profits for any number of periods, the adjustment of cash interest payments, and the financial statement's accrual or smoothed representation of interest-related Profit, The Value Analyzer provides a method for converting cash interest amounts to accrual amounts for financial statements. The Value Analyzer implements an \u201ceffective interest rate\u201d conversion to accomplish this type of calculation.","Profitability Calculations","The following describes the method used by the Profit Calculations :","1. Retrieve data from the RDBMS .","2. Calculate Net Interest Revenue for every account.","3. Calculate Other Revenue for every account.","4. Calculate Direct Expense for every account.","5. Calculate Indirect Expense for every account.","6. Calculate Risk Provision for every account.","7. Calculate Profit for every account.","8. Store the FFAPM Profit and the five factors of FFAPM into the RDBMS .","9. Aggregate and\/or re-calculate the FFAPM Profit and the five factors of FFAPM as necessary.","Note that steps 2 through 6 perform account-level calculations. Steps 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 can be performed independently and in parallel, while step 7 requires values derived in steps 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, and therefore must be performed after steps 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are completed.","Output Definition","The Profit Calculations  generate one or more values for the five factors of the FFAPM , and specifically, the NIR, OR, DE, IE, RP, and Profit values. These values are used to generate the output data , which can be stored by the RDBMS  in the relational database.","Analytic Variations","The Value Analyzer operates on data and calculations across a continuum, in order to provide the analytic variations necessary for financial processing at various levels of aggregation. This continuum is comprised of multiple tiers as described below:","basic\u2192intermediate\u2192advanced\u2192breakthrough.","Not every tier is necessarily present for each element of data or every calculation.","This continuum embodies the notion of inheritance, wherein the data and calculations of the higher tiers embody the data and calculations of the lower tiers. The principle of inheritance means that the data and calculations by which the separate tiers are defined are nested, i.e., the definition of \u201cintermediate\u201d includes the definition of \u201cbasic,\u201d but with added functionality that goes beyond \u201cbasic,\u201d and so on. Thus, there is consistency in the data and calculations performed at the different tiers in the continuum.","Risk Provision","As noted above, the Risk Provision (RP) factor of FFAPM focuses on providing a component of profitability related to risk factors of the organization. There are numerous forms of risk in any business, such as market risk, customer risk, operational risk, competitive risk, political risk regulatory risk, etc. Risk cannot be eliminated by the organization, but exposure can be controlled; and the first step in risk control is developing a risk measurement process.","In the Value Analyzer, this measurement process requires the separation of expected profit outcomes from the uncertainty of this estimate. The Value Analyzer, therefore, includes the expected cost of risk, or \u201cRisk Provision,\u201d in the FFAPM As experience with the Value Analyzer builds over time, statistical time series methods can be applied to historical profit data to study and measure risk behavior using the Risk Provision to adjust the Profit for expected outcomes and hedging costs.","The Value Analyzer focuses on ensuring that the organization is able to provide adequately for predicted losses at an account level, which enables sophisticated risk management and provides a better reflection of the organization's profitability. This approach to provisioning is consistent with the \u201cCredit Metrics\u201d approach found in current risk management literature.","A simple model for understanding the basic dynamics of Risk Provision on the Profitability Calculations  follows. Suppose the organization has reserves committed to cover possible future loss; for example, loan loss reserves for various loans. As transactions occur, an allowance is made to fund or provision these reserves, and on occasion of default, there will be withdrawals from the reserves to repay them. The provisioning is smooth and in small amounts, at the rate of new product sales. On the other hand, funding is sudden, unscheduled (though not unexpected), and typically large, so that the reserve pool varies over time.","There are three variables to consider: the rate of provisioning (inflow), the rate of losses (outflow), and the mean volume of reserves over time. It can be assumed that these factors are in balance. The organization appropriately plans for adequate provisioning to cover expected losses. In particular, then, the flows during the period are related:\n\nEnding Loss Reserves=Beginning Loss Reserves\n\n\u2212Losses\n\n+Recoveries\n\n+Risk Provisions\n\n","The following shows the calculation of the Risk Provision from known reserve amounts:\n\nRP amount for group RPG=Reserve amount for RPGat end of this period\n\n\u2212Reserve amount for RPGat end of last period\n\n+Losses during this period\n\n\u2212Recoveries during this period\n","Risk Provision in the Basic Tier","Following are the inputs and outputs of the calculation of Risk Provision in the Basic Tier:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0079","num":"0094"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"140pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Inputs","Outputs"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Groups RPGof accounts based on product","Risk Provision for each"]},{"entry":[{},"account type"]},{"entry":"Risk Provision amount associated with each"},{"entry":"RPG, the total of which is the total RP to be"},{"entry":"allocated"},{"entry":"Rule to determine to which RPGeach account"},{"entry":"is assigned, e.g., a rule associating an account"},{"entry":"type with each group."},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"Risk Provision in the Basic Tier comprises an expected loss that is apportioned to accounts, e.g., by account balance percentage.
