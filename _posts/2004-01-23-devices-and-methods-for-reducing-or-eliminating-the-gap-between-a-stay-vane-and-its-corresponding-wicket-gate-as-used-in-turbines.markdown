title: Devices and methods for reducing or eliminating the gap between a stay vane and its corresponding wicket gate as used in turbines
abstract: An improved design for turbines increases efficiency while reducing potential for fish kill. In an embodiment of the present invention as relates to Kaplan turbines, the gap between stay vanes and their corresponding wicket gates is reduced or eliminated by provision of an extension to the trailing edge of the stay vane. In alternative embodiments, the extension may be added to the wicket gate or affixed to both in an arrangement that permits free movement of the wicket gate. To facilitate eliminating the gap altogether, the extension may be made of a pliable material or be fabricated in a telescoping or accordion arrangement to permit contact with opposing parts without damage thereto. By designing extensions using accepted hydraulic principles, a better fit of the stay vane to its associated wicket gate, and possibly to the turbines runners may be effected, further improving operational efficiency and possibly even extending maintenance intervals.

No. 60\/442,551, Devices and Methods for Reducing or Eliminating the Gap Between a Stay Vane and its Corresponding Wicket Gate as Used in Turbines, by Wittinger et al., filed Jan. 27, 2003, and incorporated herein by reference.","The United States Government has rights in this invention pursuant to U.S. Army Corp of Engineers Contract No. DACW 68-95-C0017 with VA TECH HYDRO GmbH & Co. This patent and related patents are available for licensing. Please contact Phillip Stewart at 601 634-4113 or Christian Weiss at 0043 1 89100 2752.","Hydropower generating systems, i.e., hydro-turbines, are dependent on a continuous source of water, generally drawn from an open source, such as an impoundment, river or lake. Water intake requirements amount to thousands of gallons per minute. Turbines used to transform the associated hydrostatic head into electric power are designed with cascades, each comprising a fixed stay vane and an adjustable valve, termed a wicket gate. The cascade, most often arranged in a circle about the turbine runners, directs the water flow into the turbine runner at the desired angle to optimize energy recovery. These cascades are placed in the penstock tube, i.e., the conduit used to transport water to the turbine. Typically there are 20 to 24 cascades for a large turbine. The cascades direct water to the runners of the turbine where the flow is converted to rotary turbine motion. The cascades provide regulation of the turbine by directing water into the turbine at a flow orientation and flow rate to meet a pre-specified demand. This regulation is achieved by adjusting the openings of the cascade to compensate as the hydrostatic head varies with changes in the environment. Further, the cascade modulates sudden flow surges when the turbine starts and stops.","These turbines are often provided as reversible pump-turbines, i.e., water motion may be converted to mechanical motion or vice versa. That is, the cascades are also capable of regulating the flow of water from the turbine runner back through the penstock tube. This is necessary when a sudden loss of power to the generator occurs and back-flow must be prevented.","During operation, the demand for water may vary between a maximum possible intake, to nearly no water within a short period. At high water flow rates the cascades may be plagued by erosion and pitting from cavitation. At low or no water flow, marine growth and corrosion result. These problems directly alter the surface profile of the cascades, resulting in a reduction in the effective water flow rate through the penstock tube to the turbine runners. Cascades are designed with shapes that permit optimized water flow with minimal turbulence. Because the wicket gates move and the stay vanes are fixed, conventionally, more attention is paid to addressing changes to the design of the wicket gates than the stay vanes. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,228,830, Wicket Gate, to Pastore, Jul. 20, 1993; U.S. Pat. No. 5,441,384, Hydraulic Turbine and Guide Gate Apparatus and Runner Apparatus Therefor, to Gokhaman, Aug. 15, 1995; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,203,703, Hydraulic Turbo Machine Wicket Gate Seals, to Koeller, May 20, 1980.","Erosion is the gradual wearing-away of a surface. Impinging particles carried along by rapidly moving water causes it. Pitting is caused by cavitation. Pitting occurs when gas-filled cavities, as may be created by structure vibration, collapse on the surface. This collapse imparts a pressure pulse of such magnitude that it removes small pieces of the surface. A pitted or eroded surface sets up turbulence and associated vibration, thereby accelerating damage. Means to prevent both corrosion and pitting include optimizing water flow to minimize particles impinging on surfaces of the cascade by improving the orientation of flow to reduce turbulence in the area of the entrance to the runners.","To optimize operation of a turbine, regular maintenance is done on the cascades. Due to their location, it is difficult to access them, requiring shutting down and sending divers into the penstock tube. The divers inspect, and, if possible, make repairs in situ. When in situ repairs are impossible, the wicket gates may be removed and brought to the water surface. Further, due to the dimensions and weight of the gates, they must be removed individually. The stay vanes are part of the structure, however, and require careful attention to remove and replace only some of them at a time. Because of the awkwardness of the retrieval operation, the gates or stay vanes are dragged through the tube, often resulting in damage to the removed structures, the penstock tube, or both. Thus, it is important, both operationally and fiscally, to minimize damage to the cascades and extend maintenance intervals wherever possible.","An approach to minimizing the effects of cavitation is through \u201chydro-dynamically shaping\u201d turbine components, including the cascades. This increases the maximum flow rates while minimizing turbulence at the boundary between the turbine parts and the flowing water. As discussed above, the majority of effort has been to address the shape of only the wicket gates in conventional efforts at improving flow. Although these efforts have ameliorated the effects of erosion and cavitation, they have not eliminated them. Thus, periodic maintenance of the cascade components is still required. Design optimization techniques have included selection of the location of the turbine and control of the turbine operation. Changes in these parameters may result in a reduction in the effects of erosion and cavitation, but such a reduction often comes at the expense of the power-generating capacity of the hydroelectric unit. The net effect of such an effort is an extension of the maintenance lifecycle at the cost of a reduction in power output. An embodiment of the present invention not only has the potential for increasing required maintenance intervals but also increasing turbine output while reducing fauna (fish) casualties.","A conventional turbine-machinery stay vane is separated from its respective wicket gate by a \u201cgenerous\u201d clearance gap. Mainly due to hydraulic shear and cross flow between stay vane and wicket gate, waterborne fauna may be severely injured or killed when passing through the turbine. Thus, an embodiment of the present invention also has the potential for reducing fauna (fish) casualties.","Conventional design practice does not identify the size of this clearance gap. The immobile stay vanes are structural members used to hold the superstructure in place and transfer the building and operating loads to the main civil structure. Thus, it is advantageous to provide these structural members with a provision for replacement of sections of the structure (stay vane) that are susceptible to wear or amenable to modification due to an improvement in other components of the turbine, such as the wicket gates or turbine runners. A wicket gate is the removable and movable component of the cascade, thus it is not as important to provide separate removable pieces for it. The wicket gate permits real time adjustment of the cascade to meet operating requirements, whereas the design of the stay vane must be judiciously selected to \u201ccooperate\u201d with the other components of the turbine. This \u201ccooperation\u201d is based on the projected entire operating cycle of the turbine, including an option to be altered readily to \u201ccooperate\u201d with modifications to other components of that turbine over its projected life. Basic machine parameters, such as overall civil constraints, head, power and flow, determine the radial location, number and size of the wicket gates and stay vanes. An embodiment of the present invention addresses the option to alter stay vanes even though they are part of supporting structure.","In an embodiment of the present invention, a modified stay vane is provided for use with a turbine. The stay vane has a leading edge and a trailing edge with respect to a fluid inlet to the turbine and structurally supports the turbine. In an embodiment of the present invention the stay vane is modified with an extension affixed to the trailing edge of the stay vane, such that the modified stay vane reduces the gap between the stay vane and its associated wicket gate. This improves hydraulic performance of the turbine configuration by \u201chydraulically complementing\u201d at least the modified stay vane's corresponding wicket gate and possibly the turbine runners also. In addition to increased operating efficiency, the reduced gap has other beneficial consequences including reduced casualties among fish that may be passing through the turbine. The gap may be reduced in the range of 25% of its initial value, and preferably by 50\u2013100% of its initial value.","In an embodiment of the present invention, the extension is affixed to the trailing edge of the stay vane mechanically, such as by a bolt threadably connected to a tapped borehole provided in the existing stay vane. The borehole may be countersunk and the portion above the bolt head (as installed) filled with a suitable sealant that may be any of: an auto-body filler, an RTV sealant, an epoxy, and any combination thereof. The bolt may also be threadably connected to a threaded insert provided in the borehole (which may be countersunk) in the trailing edge of the existing stay vane and, if countersunk, covered as above with sealant.","As an alternative embodiment, the extension may also be permanently affixed to the stay vane, for example by welding, soldering or chemically bonding.","In another embodiment of the present invention, the trailing edge of the extension touches the wicket gate thus closing the gap between stay vane and corresponding wicket gate, at least for certain positions of the wicket gate. In yet another embodiment, the extension from the stay vane is affixed to the wicket gate thus closing the gap for all possible wicket gate positions. For either of these embodiments that completely close or eliminate the gap, the extension is advantageously made of a durable pliable, flexible or elastic material or comprises a telescoping, or accordion, arrangement. Such an embodiment further reduces or even eliminates the negative effects of the gap between stay vane and wicket gate. Of course, in yet another embodiment an extension of flexible material as described for insertion between the wicket gate and its corresponding stay vane may be attached only to the wicket gate and close the gap for certain positions of the wicket gate in a manner similar to the flexible extension attached to the stay vane only.","Also included as an embodiment of the present invention is a hydraulic turbine configuration incorporating the above alternative extensions to the stay vane and the extension itself.","Further, a method of improving operation of a turbine configuration incorporating stay vanes, wicket gates, and turbine runners is also provided. The method also has potential for reducing casualties among fauna passing through the turbine configuration. The method involves: designing an extension for the stay vanes that hydraulically complements at least said stay vanes and affixing the extension to the stay vanes, so that the extension reduces the width of any gap between a trailing edge of each stay vane and its corresponding wicket gate, thus improving operation of the turbine configuration. The method further provides a design for the extension that hydraulically complements the turbine runners of the turbine configuration. The method may provide that the extension reduces the width of the gap or closes the gap between the stay vanes and the wicket gates by an amount of at least 25%, and preferably from about 50\u2013100% of the gap before installation of the extension.","In an embodiment of the present invention, a fixed, yet removable, extension is attached mechanically to the trailing edge of installed stay vanes to reduce the clearance between the stay vane and its corresponding wicket gate. The extension shape is hydraulically optimized, i.e., hydro-dynamically shaped to complement either the existing or modified wicket gates. The resultant smaller clearance reduces leakage, turbulence, cross flow, hydraulic shear and vortices between each wicket gate and its stay vane. The extension is attached to each existing stay vane and may be removable to facilitate maintenance or upgrades to the turbine, e.g., disassembly of the structure with potential for reducing the need to alter structure, e.g., the stay vane itself, during routine maintenance. Further, by reducing gap leakage, potential for casualty to fish passing near or through the previous \u201cgenerous\u201d gap is lessened. Advantages of embodiments of the present invention include:\n\n","Refer to . An extension  is designed to meet pre-specified hydrodynamic requirements for use with a specific configuration of turbine runners and cascades, i.e., stay vanes and associated wicket gates in a turbine. The extension , representing an embodiment of the present invention, is added to a stay vane  at the trailing edge . To facilitate orientation of the reader, sides ,  and edges ,  of the extension are labeled in both . Although the extension  is shown with four sides with none of the sides having dimensions equal to its opposing side, the extension may be provided in any of a number of configurations, including a continuous arc with no corners.","Using countersunk bores , the extension  is attached mechanically to the trailing end  via suitable connectors , here shown as three bolts threaded in a tapped borehole, but also possibly threaded into threaded inserts (not shown separately) affixed in the trailing edge . An epoxy, RTV sealant, or other suitable sealant may be used to seal the hole (countersunk bore ) above the countersunk head of the connector .","Refer to , B, and C.  is a top view of an arrangement  of 20 stay vanes  as they may be disposed about a turbine impeller (not shown separately). For clarity of presentation, only one of the stay vanes  is shown incorporating an extension  that is an embodiment of the present invention. Also shown at that stay vane  with extension  is a typical wicket gate , depicted as being capable of movement in a plane lying in the paper. Water enters the configuration  between the stay vanes  and through at least partially opened wicket gates  as depicted at the arrows . A top view of a single modified cascade (stay vane  with extension  and wicket gate ) is shown in , clearly showing at the arrows  how water from a radial intake (not shown separately) flows past the cascade when the wicket gate  is fully open.  shows three wicket gates  in the closed position for comparison. As stated previously, stay vanes , including those with extensions , are immobile.","Refer again to . Stay vanes  without extensions  of an embodiment of the present invention abut a circle  defined at a radius, r, whereas stay vanes  with extensions  abut a circle  defined at a radius, r, where ris clearly less than r. The \u201cgenerous gap,\u201d shown as a, between the stay vane  without extension  and the wicket gate  is much larger than the gap, shown as b, between the stay vane  with extension  and its associated wicket gate . Narrowing this gap in the range of 50\u2013100% of the initial gap and providing a \u201chydro-dynamically enhanced\u201d shape for the extension , provides significant improvements as discussed above. For example, tests indicate turbine efficiency is increased an average of 0.5% throughout the operating range of the turbine. Other expected benefits include longer mean times to first maintenance actions associated with the cascades and reduced fauna (fish) casualty.","Although an embodiment of the invention is described with respect to an extension  that may be added to existing designs, it is understood that new stay vanes  may be made as part of the structure to hold new turbines while incorporating a \u201chydro-dynamically enhanced\u201d trailing edge and be installed with a reduced gap (from that of conventional designs) between the trailing edge  and the wicket gate  and fall within the ambit of the present invention.","Other embodiments of the present invention are schematically depicted in ,  and . These are top views of a single cascade, comprising a stay vane  with extension , ,  and wicket gate .","In the embodiment of  the extension  is attached, e.g. bonded, to the trailing edge of the stay vane  and is made of a durable flexible or elastic material, e.g., rubber, silicon, or other suitable pliable synthetic material or may comprise a telescoping or accordion arrangement to allow flexion without undue wear of the material. The trailing edge of the extension  is in touch  with the wicket gate , thus closing the gap between the stay vane  and the wicket gate . The extension  preferably functions similar to a sealing lip, and it is pressed against the wicket gate  by elastic forces caused by the deformation of the durable flexible extension . Because of the flexibility of this pliable extension , the gap is completely eliminated over a certain (limited) number of positions of the wicket gate . In case that the wicket gates  are closed as in  or partially open as in , the flexible extension  still ameliorates water flow past the cascade, just like the inflexible extension  as shown in .","In yet another embodiment, shown in  for the fully open position of the wicket gate , the extension  is affixed, e.g. chemically bonded or mechanically affixed, to the trailing edge of the stay vane  and to the leading edge of the wicket gate . This arrangement eliminates the gap between stay vane  and wicket gate  for all possible positions of the wicket gate , as shown in . To this end the extension  is preferably again made of a flexible material or fabricated in a telescoping or accordion arrangement.","Refer to . In a manner similar to the flexible extension  of , another embodiment envisions a flexible extension , affixed to the wicket gate  only, touching  in selected positions of the stay vane  that are near the fully open position and not touching as depicted in  when the wicket gate  is partially open or fully closed.","The extension , ,  of the embodiments of ,  and  may be removable, e.g. as described above, or permanently affixed to the stay vane  or wicket gate  respectively, e.g., by chemical bonding.","While the invention has been described in terms of one or more embodiments, those skilled in the art will recognize that the invention may be practiced with modifications within the spirit and scope of the appended claims. For example, although the system is described in specific examples for large hydro-turbines it will operate equally well with scaled-down systems.
