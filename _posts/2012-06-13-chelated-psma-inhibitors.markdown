No. 61\/647,932, filed May 16, 2012 and U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61\/497,206, filed Jun. 15, 2011, which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.","This application was supported by Grant No. 1R44CA153481-01A1 and Grant No. R01CA140617 awarded by the National Cancer Institute. The U.S. government has certain rights in the invention.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to small molecules having high affinity and specificity to prostrate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) and methods of using them for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.","2. Summary of the Related Art","Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is uniquely overexpressed on the surface of prostate cancer cells as well as in the neovasculature of a variety of solid tumors. As a result, PSMA has attracted attention as a clinical biomarker for detection and management of prostate cancer. Generally, these approaches utilize an antibody specifically targeted at PSMA to direct imaging or therapeutic agents. For example, ProstaScint (Cytogen, Philadelphia, Pa.), which has been approved by the FDA for the detection and imaging of prostate cancer, utilizes an antibody to deliver a chelated radioisotope (Indium-111). However, it is now recognized that the ProstaScint technology is limited to the detection of dead cells and therefore its clinical relevance is questionable.","The success of cancer diagnosis and therapy using antibodies is limited by challenges such as immunogenicity and poor vascular permeability. In addition, large antibodies bound to cell-surface targets present a barrier for subsequent binding of additional antibodies at neighboring cell-surface sites resulting in a decreased cell-surface labeling.","In addition to serving as a cell-surface target for antibodies delivering diagnostic or therapeutic agents, a largely overlooked and unique property of PSMA is its enzymatic activity. That is, PSMA is capable of recognizing and processing molecules as small as dipeptides. Despite the existence of this property, it has been largely unexplored in terms of the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. There are a few recent examples in the literature that have described results in detecting prostate cancer cells using labeled small-molecule inhibitors of PSMA.","Certain phosphoramidate and phosphate PSMA inhibitors have been described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US-2007-0219165-A1.","Provided herein are PET diagnostics and therapeutics for prostate cancer that capitalize on the potency and specific affinity of small-molecule inhibitors to PSMA. The diagnostic agents can be used to monitor and stratify patients for treatment with appropriate therapeutic agents.","Our probes are comprised of a PSMA-targeting a peptidomimetic core coupled to an imaging reporter or to a therapeutic radiotracer. In one aspect, we have demonstrated that Tc-chelate structures can be used be used to radiolabel our PSMA inhibitors and that the labeled probe specifically targets and internalizes into PSMA-expressing prostate cancer cells and tumors.","In another aspect, we have developed a direct labeling protocol using the PET isotope Ga- with a chelate-structure-PSMA inhibitor conjugate that can be performed in a typical radiopharmacy and may provide an efficient synthesis pathway while maintaining the necessary biological activity. These PSMA imaging constructs can serve as the foundation for a PET imaging agent, and can be easily modified to incorporate other PET imaging radionuclides such as Zr and Cu, and a radiometal such as Re, Y, Lu, Sm, Bi, Ac, Ra in the chelate structure that can serve as a therapeutic agent for targeted radiotherapy.","For example, the design of PSMA-targeted imaging agents can be modified and optimized for chelated Zr or Cu or Ga labeling using desferrioxamine-p-SCN or -p-SCN-Bn-NOTA, p-SCN-Bn-PCTA, p-SCN-Bn-Oxo-DO3A, and DOTA-NHS amine-reactive chelate structures as examples. The labeling conditions may ensure efficient and reproducible labeling in clinical radiopharmacies for PET imaging of prostate tumors. PSMA-targeted imaging agents can also be modified with Re, Y, Lu, Sm, Bi, Ac, Ra in chelated structures to achieve a PSMA targeted radiotracer with therapeutic efficacy.","The labeled tracers herein are examples of suitable imaging agents for PSMA positive tumors in vivo.","Accordingly, in one aspect the present disclosure provides compounds of the formula",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"30.90mm","wi":"72.64mm","file":"US09446157-20160920-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"39.54mm","wi":"58.59mm","file":"US09446157-20160920-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"In another aspect the present disclosure provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of the preceding aspect and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.","In another aspect the present disclosure provides methods for imaging one or more prostate cancer cells or tumor-associated vasculature in a patient comprising administering to the patient a compound or a pharmaceutical composition of either of the preceding aspects.","Isotopes that are currently used in PET imaging studies are attractive and potentially better alternatives to F, Ga, Cu and Zr are available isotopes that are being assessed for PET imaging due to their light metal properties and the ability to bind to chelating agents (1). We have chosen isotopes Re, Y, Lu, Sm, Bi, Ac, Ra as radioisotopes with potential therapeutic efficacy.","It has been shown that the chelating agent, DOTA (1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid), (or modified derivatives thereof), is an excellent ligand for binding of gallium; and DOTA-peptides can be rapidly and efficiently labeled with Ga at high specific activities (2). We have already prepared and tested these chelating agents and these types of chelating agents have been routinely used for PET imaging agents (1). The rationale for the Ga metal isotope is driven by biological, cost and patient considerations. The Ga isotope is the most attractive of the radiometals, since it's half-live is closer to that of F and would facilitate imaging soon after administration with reduced exposure to the patient. It has been shown that due to rapid diffusion of many small molecules and peptides, the 68 minute half-life of Ga very closely matches the pharmacokinetics of these molecules resulting in better tumor localization and faster blood clearance. In addition, a significant factor in selecting Ga is that it can be cost effectively and continuously produced by a commercially available Ge\/Ga generator, alleviating the need for proximity of PET centers to the cyclotrons needed for the production of, for example, F (2).","According to the Clinical Trials Network (www.clinicaltrials.gov) there are currently four PET imaging oncology clinical trials using Cu labeled targeting agents; two in breast cancer using Cu-DOTA-Trastuzumab (3) and two for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer using Cu-ATSM (4). There are two ongoing PET imaging Clinical Trials with Ga. One using Ga labeled F(ab\u2032)2-trastuzumab for breast cancer and one using Ga-bombesin (5) for prostate cancer. Zr is also being tested with antibody targeted imaging (6, 7) in seven clinical studies testing imaging capabilities in breast cancer and renal cell carcinoma.","We have preserved the modular approach to install metallic PET radionuclides into our PSMA-targeting inhibitors. We functionalize our PSMA-targeting inhibitors with selected amine-reactive bifunctional chelators and subsequently radiolabel these conjugates with complementary metallic radionuclides. Amine-reactive chelate structures for these radionuclides are commercially available such as DOTA-NHS and others noted in the following table, where the chelator can be attached in the R groups via the divalent linking group as defined herein (\u201cL\u201d in the

The advantages are three-fold. First, the timing of imaging between manufacture of the final imaging agent and animal\/human imaging is less important. Second, there can be additional time between injection of the imaging agent and the PET scan which will allow additional renal clearance of any unbound material and additional time for clearance from the kidneys, liver and bladder. Thirdly, the longer half-lives allow for longitudinal studies on a patient with a single injection of the imaging agent.","Presently, there are no current marketed commercial Zr\/Cu\/Ga labeled PET imaging agents for prostate cancer. The PET market is the fastest growing segment of the nuclear imaging market (Chemical Engineering News Molecular Imaging Volume 83, Number 30 pp. 25-34).","The ease with which the Ga can be generated from a GMP commercially available source that can be stored for up to a year, may make this product more attractive than one which is dependent on proximity to a cyclotron. Commercial GMP sources for the generators exist, e.g IDB markets an iThemba GMP 68 gallium generator. The parent isotope Ge has a half-life of 271 days and can be easily sent to hospitals within the generator, where it is storable for almost a year. The on-site generator is required to minimize the time losses since there will be pharmaceutical preparation time to attach the gallium-68 as a tracer to the pharmaceutical chelate molecules so that the total preparation time may approach the isotope half-life.","Representative Preparation of DOTA Conjugates of PSMA Targeting Molecules",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0153","num":"0258"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00095","num":"00095"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00095","he":"237.91mm","wi":"134.96mm","file":"US09446157-20160920-C00095.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0154","num":"0259"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00096","num":"00096"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00096","he":"121.84mm","wi":"121.75mm","file":"US09446157-20160920-C00096.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sup":["68","69"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0155","num":"0260"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00097","num":"00097"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00097","he":"188.38mm","wi":"133.94mm","file":"US09446157-20160920-C00097.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0156","num":"0261"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00098","num":"00098"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00098","he":"148.42mm","wi":"152.91mm","file":"US09446157-20160920-C00098.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"In one example, a Ga-chelating group is attached to a PMSA inhibitor as shown in the preceding scheme.
