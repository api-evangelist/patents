No. 61\/103,817 filed on Oct. 8, 2008 is claimed.","This invention was made with government support under Department of Energy Grant No. 04-ER 46109 and National Science Foundation Grant Nos. 05-03172 and 08-03172. The United States government has certain rights in this invention.","This invention relates to electronic devices based on organic semiconducting materials. More specifically, the invention covers organic spintronic photovoltaic devices having unique organic compositional features. Therefore, the present invention relates generally to the fields of electrical engineering, quantum physics, chemistry, materials science, spintronics, and photovoltaic applications.","Conventional energy sources such as coal, oil, natural gas, and uranium, represent a finite resource and furthermore result in adverse consequences in terms of environmental damage and\/or risk of damage. Despite some improvements in pollution control and safety protocols, none of these energy sources satisfactorily eliminates environmental concerns. In contrast, renewable energy sources are never exhausted and often more controllable effects or little effect on the environment. Common renewable energy harnessing technologies include photovoltaic systems, solar thermal applications, wind mills, wind energy electricity generators, micro-hydro power plants, biomass\/biogas plants, geothermal, wave and tidal plants, and their associated energy storage components. Each of these technologies currently has economic, practical, and\/or technical hurdles which prevent their widespread use. Photovoltaic electricity generation has the singular advantage of being modular and not limited to geographic location. For this reason, decentralized electricity generation, and systems of different sizes are possible. The conversion of solar radiation into electrical energy by means of solar cells has been successfully implemented as a part of satellite and space travel technology. Other applications for solar cells such as charging batteries, powering watches, calculators and other devices has also seen modest commercial success.","The theoretical efficiency of solar cells is about 30%, and in practice, efficiencies as high as 25% have been achieved with silicon photovoltaic laboratory devices. Overall system efficiencies of commercial devices are in the range of 10 to 14%. The technology of photovoltaic devices is well developed, but large scale application is hampered by the high price of the cells. The widespread use of solar power has been elusive because it can be difficult and costly to manufacture commercial photovoltaic cells, which are made of inorganic crystals such as silicon.","One alternative to circumvent this problem is to develop photovoltaic cells from materials that can be processed as easily as plastics. Organic solar cells have an advantage over their inorganic counterparts, in that they are much less expensive to produce. They do not require the high deposition temperatures or complex processing as required for inorganic devices, and they can be deposited onto large flexible substrates. For example, organic cells can be made in different colors and be flexible enough to use on window blinds, walls, and other materials in buildings. This provides design options that could lower the cost of using the cells. Unfortunately, poor energy conversion efficiencies have thus far prevented organic-based devices from being successfully commercialized. The last few years have seen a tremendous progress in the application of organic materials for photovoltaic following the success of this class of materials in other electrical, electronic and opto-electrical applications. However, none of the existing techniques provides sufficient improvements in efficiencies and reduced manufacturing costs.","In light of the problems and deficiencies noted above, an organic spintronic photovoltaic device with an organic electron active layer functionally associated with a pair of electrodes has been developed. The organic electron active layer can include a spin active molecular radical distributed in the active layer which increases spin-lattice relaxation rates within the active layer. The organic electron active layer can be configured in a wide variety of designs, depending on the particular device. For example, photovoltaic device design can include, bulk heterojunction, planar heterojunction, dye sensitized, or other newer or exotic configurations. The pair of electrodes is functionally associated with the organic electron active layer to complete a circuit which transfers electrons via the organic electron active layer. The increase spin lattice relaxation rate can also influence the efficiency of OLED and charge mobility in FET devices.","In one aspect, the organic spintronic device is an organic photovoltaic. Organic photovoltaic embodiments can be a bulk heterojunction design including a donor material blended with an acceptor material with the spin active molecular radical distributed therein. Alternatively, the organic electron active layer can be a dye sensitized layer including an electron donor dye, an electron acceptor phase, and a redox coupling electrolyte. In yet another alternative, the organic electron active layer can be a bi-layer or planar heterojunction including an organic donor layer adjacent to an organic acceptor layer. In this case the spin active molecular radical can be distributed primarily in the organic acceptor layer, although it can also be present in the donor layer to achieve similar decreases in spin-lattice relaxation times.","Although other spin active molecular radicals may be used, one embodiment can utilize \u00bd spin molecular radicals. Suitable spin active radicals can include those that also exhibit reduced aggregation and dispersibility in a host matrix. In one specific embodiment, the spin active molecular radical can be TEMPO or TOPO.","A method of forming an organic spintronic device can generally include preparing a first electrode layer. The organic electron active layer can be formed on the first electrode layer. A second electrode layer can then be formed on the organic electron active layer. Although manufacturing techniques can vary such sequential processing is typical.","There has thus been outlined, rather broadly, the more important features so that the detailed description thereof that follows may be better understood, and so that the present contribution to the art may be better appreciated. Other features will become clearer from the following detailed description, taken with the accompanying drawings and claims, or may be learned by the practice of these concepts.","The following detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the invention makes reference to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof and in which are shown, by way of illustration, exemplary embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. While these exemplary embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention, it should be understood that other embodiments may be realized and that various changes to the invention may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Thus, the following more detailed description of the embodiments of the present invention is not intended to limit the scope of the invention, as claimed, but is presented for purposes of illustration only and not limitation to describe the features and characteristics of the present invention, to set forth the best mode of operation of the invention, and to sufficiently enable one skilled in the art to practice the invention. Accordingly, the scope of the present invention is to be defined solely by the appended claims.","The following detailed description and exemplary embodiments of the invention will be best understood by reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein the elements and features of the invention are designated by numerals throughout.","In describing and claiming the present invention, the following terminology will be used.","The singular forms \u201ca,\u201d \u201can,\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to \u201ca layer\u201d includes reference to one or more of such structures and reference to \u201ccoating\u201d refers to one or more such steps.","As used herein, \u201celectron active\u201d refers to a material which produces and\/or absorbs electrons upon input of sufficient energy. For example, an electron active layer is one which can produce electrons (and corresponding holes) which are desirably transported to an anode to produce electric current.","As used herein, \u201cradical\u201d refers to a compound which has at least one unpaired electron. A radical may also carry an electric charge (i.e. a radical ion) but ions are not always \u201cradicals.\u201d This usage is consistent with published IUPAC recommendation definitions for physical organic chemistry, Pure & Applied Chem., vol. 66, No. 5, pp. 1155-1156 (1994).","As used herein, \u201ctransparent\u201d refers to sufficient light transmission to achieve desired efficiencies. The transparent substrate should thus generally not be a limiting factor in possible efficiencies. Thus, although some diffusion or hazing (e.g. translucence) is allowable this is generally limited to prevent excessive loss of photons impacting the organic electron active layer.","As used herein with respect to an identified property or circumstance, \u201csubstantially\u201d refers to a degree of deviation that is sufficiently small so as to not measurably detract from the identified property or circumstance. The exact degree of deviation allowable may in some cases depend on the specific context.","As used herein, \u201cadjacent\u201d refers to the proximity of two structures or elements. Particularly, elements that are identified as being \u201cadjacent\u201d may be either abutting or connected. Such elements may also be near or close to each other without necessarily contacting each other. The exact degree of proximity may in some cases depend on the specific context.","As used herein, a plurality of items, structural elements, compositional elements, and\/or materials may be presented in a common list for convenience. However, these lists should be construed as though each member of the list is individually identified as a separate and unique member. Thus, no individual member of such list should be construed as a de facto equivalent of any other member of the same list solely based on their presentation in a common group without indications to the contrary.","Concentrations, amounts, and other numerical data may be presented herein in a range format. It is to be understood that such range format is used merely for convenience and brevity and should be interpreted flexibly to include not only the numerical values explicitly recited as the limits of the range, but also to include all the individual numerical values or sub-ranges encompassed within that range as if each numerical value and sub-range is explicitly recited. For example, a numerical range of about 1 to about 4.5 should be interpreted to include not only the explicitly recited limits of 1 to about 4.5, but also to include individual numerals such as 2, 3, 4, and sub-ranges such as 1 to 3, 2 to 4, etc. The same principle applies to ranges reciting only one numerical value, such as \u201cless than about 4.5,\u201d which should be interpreted to include all of the above-recited values and ranges. Further, such an interpretation should apply regardless of the breadth of the range or the characteristic being described.","In the present disclosure, the term \u201cpreferably\u201d or \u201cpreferred\u201d is non-exclusive where it is intended to mean \u201cpreferably, but not limited to.\u201d Any steps recited in any method or process claims may be executed in any order and are not limited to the order presented in the claims. Means-plus-function or step-plus-function limitations will only be employed where for a specific claim limitation all of the following conditions are present in that limitation: a) \u201cmeans for\u201d or \u201cstep for\u201d is expressly recited; and b) a corresponding function is expressly recited. The structure, material or acts that support the means-plus function are expressly recited in the description herein. Accordingly, the scope of the invention should be determined solely by the appended claims and their legal equivalents, rather than by the descriptions and examples given herein.","\u03c0-conjugated polymers (PCPs) have shown significant promise for potential applications such as organic light-emitting devices, organic field-effect transistors, and organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices (a.k.a. organic solar cells). The best power conversion efficiency of >5% is achieved in OPV devices that employ a bulk heterojunction structure. In a bulk heterojunction device architecture, a solvent-cast layer of PCP\/fullerene blend is sandwiched between a cathode and an anode. Electron- and hole-transport layers are often inserted at the cathode and anode sides of the device, respectively, to improve charge collection.","PCPs absorb in the UV-visible part of the solar spectrum, and this compensates the relative optical transparency of fullerene and fullerene-derivative molecules in this energy range. Upon photoexcitation of PCPs, excitons (tightly bound intrachain electron-hole pairs) are usually formed. Dissociation of the photogenerated excitons is facilitated by energy differences between a donor material (the PCP) and an acceptor material (the fullerene). Initially each exciton separates into a loosely-bound polaron pair (PP), an intermediate species that exists at the donor\/acceptor interface. Subsequently some of the PP species separate into \u201cfree\u201d electrons and holes that are available for transport. In the blend, the PCP acts as electron donor and hole transporter, whereas the fullerene derivative is an electron acceptor and hole transporter. Thus, the photogenerated holes and electrons can be readily collected at the anode and cathode, respectively. However, if recombination of either the exciton or polaron pair occurs prior to dissociation, there is no contribution to the photocurrent, and the photon is wasted.","Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and Resonance Raman spectroscopy studies have shown that phase-separated domains of aggregated PCP and fullerene molecules are formed in the blend, especially after the film undergoes an annealing process at elevated temperature. The domain size of these aggregates is ideally on the scale of the exciton diffusion length, which enables excitons to reach the donor\/acceptor interface before recombination occurs. Crystallization of both PCP and fullerene phases have also been observed in these domains, which leads to improved charge mobility. In accordance with one embodiment, a PCP\/fullerene blend comprised of regio-regular poly(3-hexylthiophene) [or RR-P3HT] and fullerene derivative 1-[3-(methoxycarbonyl)propyl]-1-1-phenyl)[6,6]C[or PCBM] is disclosed.","Since the polaronic charge carriers in OPV devices carry a spin \u00bd, then adding spin \u00bd free radicals into bulk heterojunction OPV devices can manipulate the charge dissociation\/recombination\/transport rates, and consequently influence the device performance. In one embodiment, the free radical used in the bulk heterojunction is galvinoxyl, which is a conjugated molecule with Csymmetry. The Csymmetry allows the unpaired electron in galvinoxyl to delocalize along the conjugated molecule. The delocalization of the unpaired electron enhances the possibility of spin-spin interaction across the molecule. Adding a few percent (by weight) of the radicals improves the device performance. It is assumed that the improved device performance results from spin-spin interactions of the radical impurities with the photogenerated electrons and holes in the device. The technique of optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR), which is sensitive to spin lattice relaxation rates, is used to verify this hypothesis.","An organic spintronic device with an organic electron active layer functionally associated with a pair of electrodes can be used. For example,  illustrates one embodiment of an organic solar cell  in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The organic electron active layer  can include a spin active molecular radical distributed in the active layer which increases spin-lattice relaxation rates within the active layer. The organic electron active layer can be configured in a wide variety of designs, depending on the particular device. For example, photovoltaic device design can include, bulk heterojunction, planar heterojunction, dye sensitized, or other newer or exotic configurations. Other suitable devices can include, but are not limited to, photodiodes, organic light emitting diodes, field effect transistors (FETs) and light FETs, as well as organic spin valves. The organic solar cell  can include a first electrode  and a second electrode . At least one of the first and second electrodes can be comprised of a material that is substantially transparent to a desired wavelength of light. The organic solar cell can be formed on a flexible transparent substrate . The electrodes are functionally associated with the organic electron active layer to complete a circuit which transfers electrons via the organic electron active layer.","In one aspect of the present invention, the organic spintronic device is an organic photovoltaic. Organic photovoltaic embodiments can be a bulk heterojunction design including a donor material blended with an acceptor material with the spin active molecular radical distributed therein. Alternatively, the organic electron active layer can be a dye sensitized layer including an electron donor dye, an electron acceptor phase, and a redox coupling electrolyte. In this case the spin active molecular radical can be distributed primarily in the electron acceptor phase. In yet another alternative, the organic electron active layer can be a bi-layer or planar heterojunction including an organic donor layer adjacent to an organic acceptor layer. In this case the spin active molecular radical can be distributed primarily in the organic acceptor layer, although it can also be present in the donor layer to achieve similar decreases in spin-lattice relaxation times.","Although other spin active molecular radicals may be used, one embodiment of the present invention can utilize \u00bd spin molecular radicals. Suitable spin active radicals can include those that also exhibit reduced aggregation and dispersibility in a host matrix. Furthermore, spin active molecular radicals can be non-polymeric. Non-limiting examples of suitable spin active molecular radicals can include:\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0041"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"18.03mm","wi":"27.26mm","file":"US08841549-20140923-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":"4-Amino-TEMPO"}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0043"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"24.38mm","wi":"27.26mm","file":"US08841549-20140923-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003","list-style":"none"},"li":"4-Hydroxy-TEMPO benzoate"}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0045"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00003","num":"00003"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00003","he":"33.95mm","wi":"35.90mm","file":"US08841549-20140923-C00003.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004","list-style":"none"},"li":"4-[(1-Hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidinyl)amino]-4-oxo-2-butenoic acid"}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0047"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00004","num":"00004"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00004","he":"32.77mm","wi":"41.15mm","file":"US08841549-20140923-C00004.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0005","list-style":"none"},"li":"1-Hydroxy-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-2,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrole-3-carboxylic acid"}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0049"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00005","num":"00005"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00005","he":"25.91mm","wi":"27.60mm","file":"US08841549-20140923-C00005.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0006","list-style":"none"},"li":"4-Phenyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-3-imidazolin-1-yloxy"}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0051"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00006","num":"00006"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00006","he":"30.06mm","wi":"27.94mm","file":"US08841549-20140923-C00006.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0007","list-style":"none"},"li":"3-(3-(2-IODO-ACETAMIDO)-PROPYL-CARBAMOYL)-PROXYL"}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0053"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00007","num":"00007"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00007","he":"25.48mm","wi":"62.82mm","file":"US08841549-20140923-C00007.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0008","list-style":"none"},"li":"BDPA complex with benzene (1:1)"}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0055"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00008","num":"00008"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00008","he":"37.76mm","wi":"64.18mm","file":"US08841549-20140923-C00008.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0009","list-style":"none"},"li":"N,N-Bis(4-methoxyphenyl)hydroxylamine"}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0057"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00009","num":"00009"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00009","he":"18.71mm","wi":"56.73mm","file":"US08841549-20140923-C00009.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0010","list-style":"none"},"li":"Galvinoxyl (2,6-Di-tert-butyl-\u03b1-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-oxo-2,5-cyclohexadien-1-ylidene)-ptolyloxy)"}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0059"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00010","num":"00010"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00010","he":"18.71mm","wi":"47.58mm","file":"US08841549-20140923-C00010.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0011","list-style":"none"},"li":"Tris(1-hydroxy-2,2,4,6,6-pentamethyl-4-piperidinyl)phosphinetricarboxylate"}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0061"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00011","num":"00011"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00011","he":"53.34mm","wi":"56.56mm","file":"US08841549-20140923-C00011.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0012","list-style":"none"},"li":"Bis(1-hydroxy-2,2,4,6,6-pentamethyl-4-piperidinyl)oxalate"}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0063"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00012","num":"00012"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00012","he":"32.09mm","wi":"56.56mm","file":"US08841549-20140923-C00012.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0013","list-style":"none"},"li":"Trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO);\n\nM@C60-xx, where M is Gd-157 (a stable 3\/2 spin nanoparticle);

In one specific embodiment of the present invention, the spin active molecular radical can be TEMPO or TOPO. The actual amount of spin active molecular radical in the organic electron active layer can vary depending on the specific materials and device configuration. However, as a general guideline, the spin active molecular radical can be present from 0.1 wt % to about 10 wt % of the active layer, and often from about 1 wt % to about 7 wt %. When the spin active molecular radical is TEMPO the same can be present at about 5 wt % of the active layer.","In one aspect of the present invention, the organic electron active layer can comprise a donor polymer and an acceptor molecule. Non-limiting examples of suitable donor polymers can include 2-methoxy-5-(2\u2032-ethylhexyloxy) phenylene vinylene polymer (MEHPPV), 1,4-bis[(4-styryl)styryl]-2-methoxy-5-(2\u2032-ethylhexoxy)benzene polymer, poly(2-methoxy,5-(3\u2032,7\u2032-dimethyloctyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene (MDMOPPV), poly(2,5-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene) (BEHPPV), regio regular poly(3-hexylthiophene), other polythiophenes or polyphenylenevinylenes, and combinations of these polymers. Regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) can be useful as it has good hole mobility and light absorption for wavelengths of light up to about 650 nm. The blend of P3HT\/PCBM can extend the wavelength to about 1 micrometer.","Similarly, the acceptor molecule can be any suitable molecule which can accept electrons. Non-limiting examples of acceptor molecules can include fullerene C60, 6-1-(3-(methoxycarbonyl)(propyl)-5-1-phenyl-[6,6]-C61 (PCBM, a soluble C60), TiO, other modified fullerenes such as C70, C84, and their soluble versions and Di-PCBM. PCBM is unique in that it can accept up to 6 electrons and also has high electron mobility and a HOMO and LUMO of 6.1 eV and 3.7 eV, respectively.","Further, various additives can be incorporated into one or more of the layers. For example, plasticizers can be added to increase flexibility and\/or colorants can be added to adjust appearance. Non-limiting examples of suitable plasticizers can include propylene carbonate, gamma-butyrolactone, ethylene carbonate, dimethylsulfoxide, acetonitrile, sulfolane, dioxolane, dimethylformamide, tetrahydrofuran, adiponitrile, methyl pyrrolidinone, and the like.","The pair of electrodes ,  can include any conductive material which does not inhibit performance of the device. For solar cells, transparent conductive materials can be preferred for at least one of the electrodes. Indium tin oxide can be particularly suitable and is commonly used for electronic devices. However, other transparent conductive materials can be used such as, but not limited to, thin metal oxides, doped oxides, conductive diamond, indium zinc oxide, bathocuproine-Cs, and the like. Other conductive materials can also be used for the cathode  such as, but not limited to, conductive metals such as silver, copper, gold, aluminum, magnesium, conductive polymers, and the like.","In one optional embodiment, the cathode  can further include a conductive layer  and an electron transport layer , where the electron transport layer  is oriented between the organic electron active layer  and the conductive metal layer . An optional hole transport layer  can be formed adjacent the organic electron active layer  between the anode  and the active layer . This layer  can facilitate hole transport as well as block electrons from recombination at the interface with the anode . Suitable materials for the hole transport layer  can include, but are not limited to, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) poly(styrene sulfonate) (a high conductivity transparent PEDOT:PSS which is commercially available as Baytron P\u00ae from H.C. Stark), or other hole transport layer materials available at Plextronics such as Plexcore\u00ae OC. For photovoltaic materials, the hole transport layer  can preferably be transparent in order to allow photons to reach the active layer . Although specific designs can vary, as a general guideline, the hole transport layer  can have a thickness from about 50 to about 100 nm.","Depending on the specific design, the organic spintronic devices of the present invention can exhibit an increased current of at least 10% over a device having the same structure and components as the organic spintronic device without the spin active molecular radical. In some embodiments, the increased current over those without spin active molecular radicals can be from 20% to 50%.","In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, a method  of forming an organic spintronic device is disclosed, as depicted in the flow chart of . The method can generally include preparing  a first electrode layer. The organic electron active layer can be formed  on the first electrode layer. The organic electron active layer can include a spin active molecular radical distributed therein. A second electrode layer can then be formed  on the organic electron active layer. Although manufacturing techniques can vary, such sequential processing is typical.","In the case of solar cells or other photovoltaic devices, the first electrode layer can include a transparent substrate with a transparent conductive layer thereon. Suitable transparent substrates can include glass (colored or clear), transparent resins such as, but not limited to, polyesters, polycarbonates, polyimides, polysulfones, polystyrenes, cellulosic acetates, polyamides, and the like. Any material which is substantially transparent at the desired wavelength and can be formed to provide a mechanical protective barrier can be suitable.","The particular manufacturing method used to form the organic solar cell  can vary depending on the device design. However, in one embodiment, the organic electron active layer  can be formed by coating the first electrode layer with a donor polymer, an acceptor molecule, and the spin active molecular radical. This can include preparing a substantially homogeneous mixture of the donor polymer, the acceptor molecule, and the spin active molecular radical. Alternatively, distinct layers can be coated or deposited for each of the donor polymer and the acceptor molecule. Generally, the coating can be a solution-based process such as spin casting, drop casting, dipping, bar coating, screen printing, or the like. A suitable solvent can be used such as toluene, tetrahydrofuran, chloroform, chlorobenzene, ortho-dichlorobenzene, and the like, which is then evaporated or otherwise removed. The choice of solvent can affect coating properties, e.g. polarity, vaporization rates, etc. Alternatively, the coating can be performed using deposition processes such as vacuum deposition, chemical vapor deposition, sputtering, molecular beam epitaxy, atomic layer deposition, ion plating, and the like. Again, the specific dimensions can vary depending on the materials and specific device design. However, the organic electron active layer  can typically have a thickness from about 80 to about 120 nm.","An electron transport layer  can be formed as part of the second electrode adjacent the organic electron active layer. The electron transport layer  can be any material which facilitates electron mobility from the organic electron active layer to the cathode . Non-limiting examples of suitable materials for the electron transport layer  include calcium, lithium fluoride, carbon nanotubes, n-type ZnS, Alq3 and other such small molecules, or other low work function materials. A conductive cathode layer  can then be deposited on the electron transport layer . The cathode can be any suitable conductive material as previously described. The cathode can act as both a conductive electrode, as well as mechanical protection and\/or reflect light back through the organic electron active layer. Non-limiting examples of suitable cathode materials can include gold, aluminum, silver, platinum, or the like. Generally, the cathode layer  can be thicker than other layers, e.g. several hundred nanometers.","At each interface between adjacent layers, surface roughness can influence carrier injection, electron\/hole mobilities, and ultimately the device performance. Thus, surfaces can be polished prior to depositing a material thereon. However, some materials provide inherently smooth coating properties, e.g. PEDOT:PSS, etc., such that no additional polishing is required. Similarly, impurities and debris can be likewise harmful to effective transport of charge across interfaces. Therefore, surfaces can be cleaned, e.g. solvent washing, plasma treatment, or the like.","One or more of the layers, e.g. active layer, electrode layers, etc. can be additionally treated by annealing or baking. Annealing can be performed by exposing deposited films to an inert gas (e.g. nitrogen, argon, etc.) or vacuum at elevated temperatures (or room temperature vapor annealing). Specific annealing conditions can vary but are generally well below melting points of the materials for relatively short period of time, e.g. from about 50\u00b0 C. to about 120\u00b0 C. and from 5 to 30 minutes. Multi-stage annealing, e.g. a first lower temperature followed by a second higher temperature, can also be used. Annealing can effectively eliminate solvent, water, and\/or other undesirable or unintentional impurities. Further, annealing can allow for molecules to realign so as to improve film nanomorphology, e.g. enhancing interchain interaction and increase charge polaron photogeneration. Baking offers similar benefits and conditions and generally refers to a comparable heating process for longer times, e.g. 1-2 hours.","The organic spintronic device can be optionally encapsulated with a UV curable material subsequent to forming the second electrode. This can provide protection for mechanical, chemical and\/or environmental damage. Non-limiting examples of suitable encapsulating material can include silicon oxynitride, epoxies, and the like.","Without being bound to any particular theory, one of the main contributing factors to the low efficiency appears to be the low output current due to the high carrier recombination rate and low carrier mobility. In bulk heterojunction organic photovoltaics, the accepted mechanism for current production is the following: First, upon illumination, there is exciton generation in the blend, followed by a migration of the exciton to the donor-acceptor interface where, either because of the existence of a build in potential or the dipole interaction between the donor and the acceptor, this exciton is separated into a free electron in the acceptor material and a hole in the donor material. From this point, the electron and hole migrate to the cathode and the anode, respectively. For efficient device performance, one has an exciton diffusion length that is larger than the average donor or acceptor aggregate size to minimize exciton recombination. For efficient exciton separation the exciton binding energy can also be smaller than the dipole-dipole interaction between the donor and the acceptor or the built in voltage. A relatively high and substantially equal level of electron and hole mobility allows for better carrier collection. An ohmic contact between the organic constituents and the electrodes can be formed to increase performance. Geminate recombination of polaron pairs in the spin singlet configuration can be substantially reduced by addition of the spin active molecular radicals of the present invention. In particular, the spin active molecular radical can induce spin flip in the spin \u00bd electron or hole to result in a spin triplet state, which has a longer diffusion length. As a result, spin-lattice relaxation rate increases, decreasing spin relaxation time, increasing photocurrent, and increasing carrier mobilities by reducing losses to geminate recombination. Thus, not only is there a resulting increase in short circuit current density, but also an increase in the device fill-factor (FF). Additional technical and theoretical background for these affects can be found in --, Yang et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 99 (15), 157401 (2007), which is incorporated herein by reference.","In accordance with the present invention, adding spin \u00bd radical molecules to a solution of MEHPPV has shown improvements of the triplet exciton lifetime by about 20%. In these examples, two different polymer blends were used, to which we added TEMPO at various weight ratios with respect to the donor. Different concentrations of TEMPO were added in MEHPPV:PCBM (1:2 concentration) blends. Additional examples were performed with these radicals in blends of P3HT:PCBM (1:1). Each of 1-V characterization, frequency dependent polaron photo-induced absorption (PA) measurements, quantum efficiency picosecond Photo-bleaching and impedance spectroscopy measurements were performed to characterize performance of the materials and devices.","The addition of 10% and 20% radicals in MEHPPV:PCBM (1:2) blends lead to an increase in efficiency for the larger concentration and an unchanged efficiency for the smaller one (). The fill factor is also unchanged upon addition of radicals as shown in the inset of . Reducing the radical concentration to 2% and 5%, an increase in efficiency was observed for 2% radical with a reduction for 5% (). The fill factor also remains unchanged. While the increase in current and the constant value of the fill factor were repeatable for different batches, the observed decrease in open circuit voltage (V) was not. The amount of radical added to the system appears to be too small to change the potential profile of the devices. Thus, the increase in efficiency can be attributed solely due to the increase in current. The insert in  summarizes the observed device parameters as a function of the radical concentration.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0082"},"figref":["FIGS. 5","FIG. 5"],"i":["a ","b "],"b":"5","sub":["sc","oc "]},"For both blends, an increase in efficiency is observed with increasing concentration of radicals. This increase is mainly due to the increase in current. Even though in some cases this increase in efficiency is accompanied by some increase in fill factor, this effect was disregarded, since it is not consistent from device to device. The open voltage circuit does not show any substantial change that can be attributed to the increase of radical concentration. As stated above, the concentrations of radicals used in this study are so low that it is unlikely that they can change the internal electric field profile of the device. While devices fabricated with MEHPPV:PCBM seemed more or less stable from one batch to another in terms of their efficiencies and fill factors, the devices with P3HT:PCBM showed a lot of fluctuations both in terms of open voltage circuit and fill factor. This is mainly due to the fact that, devices based on P3HT have a very regular film, and defects can disrupt the regio-regularity, leading to fluctuating V's and fill factor.","Incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) measurements performed on MEHPPV:PCBM devices with different concentrations of radicals which show only an increase in the magnitude of the photogenerated current. There is no new band created in the spectrum. This implies that there is no change in the absorption of the film with the addition of radicals, and thus no states are created in the gap.","The addition of spin \u00bd radicals thus enhances the device efficiency. The efficiency enhancement comes primarily from the enhancement of the short circuit current, Iand fill factor. The photocurrent action spectrum showed no new features except for the enhancement of the efficiency at each wavelength. In the time frame up to 100 ps, there was no change in the charge polaron generation rate. The recombination time of all the photogenerated polarons remained, and the film morphology remained the same. The only parameter that was found to change with radical concentration was an increase in the hole mobility. To explain this change in mobility, we propose a model by which radicals induced both an increase in trap density but also a decrease in spin lattice relaxation time. This decrease in spin lattice relaxation time allows the transit of some carriers that otherwise would have been blocked because of their spin orientation. The enhancement in the mobility comes from the fact that with the addition of radicals, the spin lattice relaxation time is decreased. Thus, blocked carriers can see their spin flip, and, rather than being reflected by the impurity, the blocked carriers are transmitted.","In another example embodiment, a bulk heterojunction organic photovoltaic device (OPV)  is comprised of an indium tin oxide (ITO) anode , a PEDOT:PSS hole transport layer , a single layer of spin-coated RR-P3HT\/PCBM blend , and a LiF\/Al cathode  as shown in . The ITO substrate has a low sheet resistance (8-12\u03a9\/\u25a1) leading to a small series resistance in the OPV I-V dependence. PEDOT:PSS is a mixture of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) and poly(styrenesulfonate), and has a high work function. This creates an ohmic contact that facilitates hole extraction. The PEDOT:PSS layer (40 nm thick) can be spin-coated onto ITO-coated glass in air. In one embodiment, the anode substrate can be subsequently baked at 110\u00b0 C. for 30 min in a dry nitrogen atmosphere to remove water molecules. The remaining fabrication steps can be carried out in a nitrogen-atmosphere glove box. The RR-P3HT (15 mg\/ml)\/PCBM solution can be prepared at a 1.2:1 mass ratio in ODCB (ortho-dichlorobenzene). Galvinoxyl radicals can then be dissolved into the solution in the range of 1.5% to 17% mass ratio, defined as the percentage of total P3HT and PCBM mass. The solution can be heated to 50\u00b0 C. for 5 min and then stirred overnight at room temperature. A 160 nm thick film of P3HT\/PCBM blend with added galvinoxyl radicals can be spin-coated onto the PEDOT:PSS layer. After this, the device can be thermally annealed at 150\u00b0 C. for 3 min. This processing step can significantly improve device performance by facilitating nanoscale phase separation between P3HT and PCBM aggregates. The device fabrication can be completed by thermally evaporating a 1 nm thick film of LiF followed by a 100 nm thick film of Al. The LiF forms an electrical dipole layer  at the organic\/Al interface, leading to enhanced electron transfer across the interface. Finally the completed device can be encapsulated under a cover glass . For example, a Norland 6106 UV-curable optical adhesive can be used to minimize the penetration of water and oxygen into the active layer.","Device I-V characteristics can be measured using a Keithley 236 Source-Measure unit. The light intensity of the solar simulator, composed of a xenon lamp and an AM1.5 filter, can be calibrated to 100 mW\/cmusing a pre-calibrated silicon PV cell. In order to understand the influence of galvinoxyl radical impurities on recombination kinetics in P3HT\/PCBM, photoinduced absorption detected magnetic resonance (PADMR) measurements can be carried out. PADMR records the change of photoinduced absorption (PA) induced by resonant microwaves in an external magnetic field. The PADMR signal is proportional to the change in polaron density, which, in turn is due to the change in the polaron pair recombination rate under resonance conditions. An argon laser with a wavelength of 488 nm and a tungsten lamp can be used as pump and probe light sources, respectively. PADMR samples are prepared by drop-casting onto sapphire substrates. The sample film is then placed in a liquid-helium-cooled cryostat at a temperature of 12 K, which slows down the dynamics of polaron and spin-lattice relaxation. 3 GHz microwaves (S-band) that are modulated by a square wave at 200 Hz can be used inside a matched cavity in the cryostat to measure PADMR at various values of the microwave power.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0076","num":"0088"},"figref":"FIG. 7","sub":["sc","sc ","sc "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0077","num":"0089"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":"FF","mo":"=","mfrac":{"msub":{"mi":["P","max"]},"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":["J","sc"]},{"mi":["V","oc"]}],"mo":"\u00d7"}}},"mo":","}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}]}}}},"br":{},"sub":["max ","oc "],"figref":"FIG. 2"},"Table I summarizes the device properties for all of the investigated radical concentrations (1.5-17 wt %) showing device properties for OPV devices based on P3HT\/PCBM blend at various galvinoxyl radical concentrations.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0079","num":"0091"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"6"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},"TABLE I"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},{},"No. of"]},{"entry":[{},"J(mA\/cm)","V(V)","FF (%)","\u03b7 (%)","Devices"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"6"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":["Pristine","11.3 \u00b1 0.4","0.57","55","3.46 \u00b1 0.12","8"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"7"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"right"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["1.5%","wt","11.9 \u00b1 0.5","0.60","59","4.12 \u00b1 0.17","4"]},{"entry":["3%","wt","12.7 \u00b1 0.3","0.58","60","4.20 \u00b1 0.10","8"]},{"entry":["5%","wt","11.2 \u00b1 0.5","0.58","58","3.71 \u00b1 0.17","4"]},{"entry":["10%","wt","11.2 \u00b1 0.5","0.61","53","3.55 \u00b1 0.16","4"]},{"entry":["17%","wt","10.5","0.65","51","3.40","2"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"The values given are average values obtained from the number of devices indicated in the table for each concentration. The standard deviation is given for Jand \u03b7 when four or more devices were tested. The improvement in J, FF and \u03b7 induced by the presence of galvinoxyl radical peaks at \u02dc3% wt, and gradually vanishes with increasing radical concentration. At high concentrations (>10% wt), galvinoxyl begins to suppress the overall performance of the OPV devices. This may be due to the formation of galvinoxyl aggregates at high radical concentrations, where the aggregates are assumed to be detrimental to device performance. We also notice that Vincreases at high galvinoxyl concentration. Because Vis determined by the energy difference between the LUMO (Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital) level of the fullerene phase and the HOMO (Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital) level of the polymer phase, this increase in Vmay indicate the existence of an additional energy level that is either higher than the fullerene LUMO or lower than the polymer HOMO, and spatially located between the P3HT and PCBM.
