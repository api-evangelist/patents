Ousters smaller than \u02dc2 nanometers (nm) in diameter differ from larger nanoparticles because their energy levels become quantized and they develop molecule-like electronic structures. Crystallographic efforts have confirmed that such small Au clusters form into atomically precise structures, and that some species, such as ligand-protected Auclusters, possess an inherent anionic (negative) charge. Ligand-protected Auclusters are a unique platform to study catalytic reactions because they bridge the size gap between molecules and larger nanoparticles, they possess an anionic charge, and their surface structure is precisely known. Despite these features, the catalytic activity of Auand similar atomically precise clusters have only been investigated experimentally for a handful of reactions, such as the oxidation of styrene and cyclohexane, the hydrogenation of aldehydes and ketones, and the electrochemical reduction of O. One particularly appealing catalytic challenge to consider for the negatively charged Aucluster is the reduction of carbon dioxide. Not only is COan important greenhouse gas, but it also represents an abundant starting material for the generation of fine chemicals and fuels.","These and other objects, aspects, and advantages of the present disclosure will become better understood with reference to the accompanying description and claims.","The present disclosure is directed to an apparatus and method for COreduction using an Auelectrode.

See e.g. Zhu et al., \u201cKinetically Controlled, High-Yield Synthesis of Au25 Ousters,\u201d 130 (2008), among others. Electrochemical COreduction was conducted in a two compartment cell. The Ligand-protected Auwas mixed with a conductive carbon black support (Vulcan XC-72; Cabot corp.) and an electrode binder (NAFION), and deposited onto a glassy carbon working electrode. This electrode was immersed in a COsaturated electrolyte (0.1M KHCO). A reference electrode (Ag\/AgCl) was also placed in the working electrode compartment. The reference electrode was calibrated into the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale (E=E+0.059*pH). A gas-tight lid sealed the working electrode compartment to allow collection of the reaction products. A platinum (Pt) counter electrode was immersed in the second compartment in the same electrolyte in the counter electrode compartment. A proton-exchange membrane separated the two compartments. The membrane prevented COreduction products from escaping the working electrode compartment, but it still allowed current flow via proton conduction. Electrochemical potentials greater than \u22120.103 V vs. RHE were applied to the Aucatalyst through the working electrode. Maximum performance was observed at \u22121.0 V vs. RHE.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"sub":["25 ","25 ","2 ","3 ","2 ","3 ","25","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 5"],"sub":["25 ","25 ","2 ","3 ","25 ","2 ","3 ","25 ","2 ","3 ","2 ","3 ","2 ","3 ","2 ","3 "],"b":["415","416","516","517","518","519"]},"Peak CO production from the Au(1 nm) catalyst was found at \u22121.0 V vs. RHE with approximately 100% Faradaic efficiency (FE) and a rate 7-700 times higher than 2-5 nm Au nanoparticles and bulk Au, as indicated at  and further detailed at Table 1. FE relates the amount of reaction product to the total number of electrons passed through the electrode. For Au(1 nm), CO formation at \u22121.0 V occurred with approximately 100% FE, meaning almost every electron injected into the catalyst layer was utilized for COreduction. Au is known to selectivity reduce COinto CO, and CO selectivities ranged between 80.8 and 99.6% for Au(1 nm), 71.0-96.9% for the larger Au nanoparticles, and 26.9-92.9% for bulk Au, depending on the applied voltage, as detailed at Table 2. However, the higher FE of the Au(1 nm) cluster enhanced its CO production rate compared to the those for the other Au catalysts, as indicated at  and further detailed at Table 1. See also Kauffman et al., \u201cExperimental and Computational Investigation of AuClusters and CO: A Unique Interaction and Enhanced Electrocatalytic Activity,\u201d 134 (2012), and see Kauffman et al., \u201cSupporting Information for Experimental and Computational Investigation of AuClusters and CO: A Unique Interaction and Enhanced Electrocatalytic Activity,\u201d 134 (2012), which are incorporated by reference in their entirety.","The decreased COreduction rates beyond \u22121.0 V noted at  may stem from gaseous products blocking the Ausurface. On the basis of the peak CO production rate of 1.26 mmol cmh, a maximum turnover frequency (TOF) of 87 CO molecules sitesis estimated for the Au(1 nm) catalyst, where sites are defined as accessible Au atoms and determined from electrochemical surface area measurements. This TOF value is approximately 10-100 times higher than those of current state-of-the-art electrochemical processes and is comparable to previous reports of CO oxidation on ligand-free Auclusters (n=4-19).","CO and Hwere the only reaction products detected, and the potential-dependent product distribution illustrated at  provides insight into the electrocatalytic mechanism. CO is the major CO2 reduction product for Au electrodes, and the reaction proceeds along a two-electron, two-proton pathway through an adsorbed .CO intermediate, generally via the following reactions:\n\nCO+2H+2\u2192CO+HO E=0.103 V vs. RHE (pH=7)\u2003\u2003(1)\n\n.CO\u2003\u2003(2)\n\n.CO+H\u2192.COOH+H\u2192CO+HO\u2003\u2003(3)\n\n.CO+2H\u2192CO+HO\u2003\u2003(4)\n\nH\u2192H\u2003\u2003(5)\n\nH+H\u2192H\u2003\u2003(6)\n","In the low potential regime (below \u22120.5 V), sequential proton capture and electron transfer converts adsorbed .CO into .COOHbefore forming CO and water. A sharp increase in CO production occurred with the onset of Hevolution at approximately \u22120.5 V. In this potential range, the formation of Hoccurs simultaneously with Hevolution, and a CO\u2192CO pathway based on the direct reduction of .CO with His likely. CO evolution onset potentials for the larger Au catalysts were comparable to previous results, and their equivalent values suggest the presence of similar active sites. Alternatively, the smaller CO evolution potential of Au(1 nm) points to a unique catalytic site capable of promoting the CO\u2192CO reaction closer to the thermodynamic limit.","COis not a polar molecule, but it does have a rather strong quadrupole moment and it can couple with anionic species. It is suspected that COadsorption was promoted, in part, by an electrostatic attraction to the negatively charged Aucluster. The electrostatic potential that developed between the adsorbed COquadrupole and Auredistributed charge within the cluster to produce reversible oxidation-like optical and electrochemical phenomena. Finally, the Auelectronic structure was restored by simply purging the solution with Nto desorb the weakly bound CO2.","Typical electrocatalysts require large overpotentials to convert COinto useful products, ultimately creating a challenge for large-scale deployment. In this application, Au(1 nm) catalyzed the two-electron conversion of COinto CO within 90 mV of the formal potential (thermodynamic limit) of \u22120.103 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The low overpotential is significant because it represents an approximate 200-300 mV reduction in potential compared to the larger Au nanoparticles and bulk Au tested and those in previously published reports. Moreover, Au(1 nm) showed peak CO\u2192CO conversion at \u22121.0 V with approximately 100% Faradaic efficiency and a rate 7-700 times higher than those for the larger Au catalysts tested, and 10-100 times higher than those for current state-of-the-art processes. In practical terms, CO is a very useful chemical that can be converted into a variety of valuable hydrocarbon species, and a low-voltage, high-efficiency process for converting COinto CO could be instrumental in developing new carbon management technologies.","Thus, provided here is an apparatus and method for COreduction using an Auelectrode. The Auelectrode is comprised of ligand-protected Auhaving a structure comprising an icosahedral core of 13 atoms surrounded by a shell of six semi-ring structures bonded to the core of 13 atoms, where each semi-ring structure is typically \u2014SR\u2014Au\u2014SR\u2014Au\u2014SR or \u2014SeR\u2014Au\u2014SeR\u2014Au\u2014SeR. The 12 semi-ring gold atoms within the six semi-ring structures are stellated on 12 of the 20 faces of the icosahedron of an Aucore, and organic ligand SR or \u2014SeR groups are bonded to the Aucore with sulfur or selenium atoms. The Auelectrode is typically comprised of a plurality of Aunanoparticles. The Auelectrode and a counter-electrode are in contact with an electrolyte comprising COand H+, and a potential of at least \u22120.1 volts is applied from the Auelectrode to the counter-electrode. The apparatus and method produces peak CO\u2192CO conversion at a potential generally around \u22121.0 V with approximately 100% Faradaic efficiency and a rate 7-700 times higher than those for current state-of-the-art processes.","It is to be understood that the above-described arrangements are only illustrative of the application of the principles of the present invention and it is not intended to be exhaustive or limit the invention to the precise form disclosed.
