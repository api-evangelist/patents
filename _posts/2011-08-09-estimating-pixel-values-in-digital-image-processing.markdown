title: Estimating pixel values in digital image processing
abstract: A method, system and computer program product for improving accuracy and computation efficiency in interpolation, upsampling and color channel estimation. A Bayesian estimator used to estimate the value of a pixel in an image is constructed using measurements of high-order (e.g., 3rd, 4th, 5th) statics for nearby points in natural images. These measurements reveal highly systematic statistical regularities that were ignored from the prior algorithms due to their restrictive measurements and assumptions. As a result, the accuracy in interpolation, upsampling and color channel prediction is improved. Furthermore, the process for constructing a Bayesian estimator is simpler and more direct by storing in a table the mean value of the pixel value to be estimated for each combination of values of nearby points in training samples. As a result of having a simpler and more direct approach than existing methods, the computational efficiency is improved.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61\/371,849 filed on Aug. 9, 2010 and entitled \u201cUSING HIGHER ORDER STATISTICS TO ESTIMATE PIXEL VALUES IN DIGITAL IMAGE PROCESSING TO IMPROVE ACCURACY AND COMPUTATION EFFICIENCY, which is expressly incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes.","This invention was made with government support under Grant no. R01 EY011747 awarded by National Institutes of Health. The government has certain rights in the invention.","The present invention relates to digital image processing, and more particularly to using higher order statistics (e.g., second, third, fourth, fifth order or higher) in digital image processing (e.g., interpolation, upsampling) to improve accuracy and computation efficiency.","Digital image processing is the use of computer algorithms to perform image processing on digital images. Digital images may include an array of image pixel values. Image processing may involve image enlargement, deblurring of the digital image, removing noise and artifacts from the digital image, as well as encoding the pixel values during image compression. In image processing, point prediction or estimating pixel values in digital images may be used.","Currently, there are numerous processes for estimating pixel values in digital images. Some of these processes are based on image statistics and use first and second order statistics, or are based on estimates of the parameters of specific statistical models. Other processes are not based on statistics, but upon a deterministic model of images that may involve estimation of the model parameters. For example, some processes involve estimation of pixel values by fitting smooth functions and some other processes locate edges in an image and make estimates based on the location of these edges. All of these processes may use overly restrictive assumptions about the underlying structure of images, which may lead to a reduction in accuracy. Further, many of these processes are computationally intensive and processes that rely on fitting are limited in the size of the set of training signals that can be used to specify the estimator.","By using these methods that are restrictive in their measurements and assumptions about the underlying structure of the image, the process for estimating image pixel values given a digitized array of image pixel values may not be as accurate or efficient as possible. If, however, algorithms could be developed without these restrictive measurements and assumptions, and limitations on the size of the training set, then accuracy and computational efficiency for estimating pixel values may be improved.","Therefore, there is a need in the art for improving the accuracy and computational efficiency in estimating image pixel values in a digitized array of image pixel values by developing algorithms without these restrictions in measurements and assumptions. The present invention addresses these and other needs in the art.","An example of a method of determining an optimum candidate pixel value in accordance with the disclosure includes: identifying a first plurality of candidate pixels in a training image wherein each of the plurality of candidate pixels is proximate to a first identical neighbor pixel group; for each of the first plurality of candidate pixels, determining a candidate pixel value thereby obtaining a first plurality of candidate pixel values; determining a plurality of statistical moments for the first plurality of candidate pixel values; and storing in memory a table including at least one of: (1) a first optimum candidate pixel value corresponding to the first identical neighbor pixel group, the first optimum candidate pixel being determined based on the plurality of statistical moments, and (2) information indicative of the plurality of statistical moments.","An example of a computer program product embodied in a computer readable storage medium for determining an optimum pixel value in accordance with the disclosure includes programming instructions for: identifying a first plurality of candidate pixels in a training image wherein each of the plurality of candidate pixels is proximate to a first identical neighbor pixel group; for each of the first plurality of candidate pixels, determining a candidate pixel value thereby obtaining a first plurality of candidate pixel values; determining a plurality of statistical moments for the first plurality of candidate pixel values; and storing in memory a table including at least one of: (1) a first optimum candidate pixel value corresponding to the first identical neighbor pixel group, the first optimum candidate pixel being determined based on the plurality of statistical moments, and (2) information indicative of the plurality of statistical moments.","An example of a system for determining an optimum pixel value in accordance with the disclosure includes a memory unit; and a processor coupled to the memory unit.

However, these methods are restrictive in their measurements and assumptions about the underlying structure of the image, and in the practical size of the training sets used to specify the estimator. By using these methods that are restrictive in their measurements and assumptions about the underlying structure of the image and the size of training sets, the process for estimating image pixel values given a digitized array of image pixel values may not be as accurate or efficient as possible. If, however, algorithms could be developed without these restrictive measurements and assumptions, then accuracy and computational efficiency for estimating pixel values may be improved. Therefore, there is a need in the art for improving the accuracy and computational efficiency in estimating image pixel values in a digitized array of image pixel values by developing algorithms without these restrictions in measurements and assumptions.","The principles described herein provide a technique for improving the accuracy and computation efficiency by using high-order statistics (e.g., second, third, fourth and fifth order) for measurements of nearby points in natural images as discussed below. As a result of using higher order statistics, additional insight is gained into the structure of the natural image. That is, the use of higher order statistics can be exploited to achieve substantially more accurate missing pixel prediction, upsampling and missing\/additional color channel pixel prediction than is possible with standard methods.","The methods described herein utilize training images to develop statistical moment tables. A well know database of images is the Van Hateren Natural Image Database. The Van Hateren images are a set of more than 4000 calibrated natural images that are often used in vision science research. Testing has shown that images of higher quality than the Van Hateren images can produce better results. Better results were obtained by collecting images using a higher quality, higher resolution camera than the camera used to collect the Van Hateren images. In addition, the Van Hateren images are only available in grayscale whereas the images captured using the high quality camera are color.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 2A","b":["200","1","200","1","200","1","200","6","200","7","200","8"]},"The training images and the images to be restored using the method - (and methods -, -, - and  described below) can include various color spaces including RGB, RYGB, CIE Lab, LMS, etc. Testing has shown that the training images can be in a different color space than the image to be restored. In particular, training images that comprise a single channel, e.g., a grey scale, luminance or luma channel, can be used to derive the statistical moments table and this table can then be applied independently to three (or four) color channels such as RGB, LMS, RYGB, etc., with little or moderate variation in performance. It has been found that for images of natural scenery, the RGB channels, or other color space channels, all have similar structure (statistical moment wise) to a single grey, luminance or luma channel. As an alternative to using a single grey scale, luma or luminance channel, the training portion could consider multiple color channels independently and derive a statistical moment table for each color channel and then apply those independent tables to each respective color channel in the restoration portion.","Referring to , in conjunction with , in step -, a training image is obtained. The training image is one of a plurality of training images in a set of training images. The training image and\/or the training image set can be arbitrarily large, such as on the order of millions of pixels per image and hundreds or thousands of images. The computational requirements of methods (methods ,  and ) described below scale linearly with the number of pixels in the arbitrarily large training sets. This makes it possible to accurately estimate large statistical moment tables using the arbitrarily large training sets as described further below. A training sample refers to a digital array of pixel values extracted from a portion of an array of pixel values on a digital image as illustrated in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["300","201","1","300","300"]},"Furthermore, training sample  includes other pixel values that are located above and below the pixel value identified by \u201cx.\u201d In such an embodiment, the Bayesian estimator (or another independent Bayesian estimator) may also be constructed to estimate the pixel value identified by \u201cx\u201d using neighboring pixel values that are located above and below the pixel value identified by \u201cx\u201d, such as the two nearest pixel values (e.g., pixel values \u201cf\u201d and \u201cg\u201d), or the four nearest pixel values (e.g., pixel values \u201ce,\u201d \u201cf,\u201d \u201cg\u201d and \u201ch\u201d). Other neighbor pixels, such as pixels located on or off diagonals from pixel \u201cx,\u201d may also be considered as neighboring pixels.","Two estimates for the pixel value identified by \u201cx\u201d (one estimate using horizontally located neighboring pixel values and the other estimate using vertically located neighboring pixel values) can be mathematically combined to improve the accuracy of the estimate. First and second tables (referred to herein as a \u201cfirst-level\u201d tables) may be generated using the methods described herein for each of these two estimates. A second-level table combining the predicted values for \u201cx\u201d from the two first level tables may then be generated using the methods described herein to obtain a final estimate. Other methods of combining two estimates for pixels values include using the reliability ratios, averaging two estimates, solving for optimum weights used to combine two or more predictions, and using the prediction with the lowest variance.","Returning to , in conjunction with , in step -, a plurality of candidate pixels are identified for a plurality of identical neighbor pixel groups in the training image. The identical neighbor pixel groups, in this example, include at least two neighboring pixels (e.g., pixels \u201cb\u201d and \u201cc\u201d) of the pixel to be estimated (e.g., pixel \u201cx\u201d). As discussed above, when third-order statistics are used to estimate a pixel value, then the two closest neighboring values are used. When fourth-order statistics are used to estimate a pixel value, then the three closest neighboring values are used. When fifth-order statistics are used to estimate a pixel value, then the four closest neighboring values are used. The maximum number of identical neighbor pixel groups is dependent on the number of pixel values that each pixel represents. If each pixel is a grey scale pixel with 256 possible values, then the maximum number of identical neighbor pixel groups including two pixels is 256, the maximum number identical neighbor pixel groups including three pixels is 256, etc.","In step -, a candidate pixel value is determined for each candidate pixel of each of the plurality of identical neighbor pixel groups, thereby obtaining a plurality of candidate pixel values for each of the identical neighbor pixel groups. Identifying the plurality of candidate pixel values at step - concludes when a candidate pixel value is obtained for each occurrence of each identical neighbor pixel group in the training image that was obtained at step -. Depending on the number of statistical moments to be used, additional values of the squares, cubes and powers of four or higher powers of the candidate pixel values are also determined at step -.","If more training images remain in the training image set, the method - returns to step - where another training image is obtained. Steps - through - are repeated for each training image in the training image set until a candidate pixel value is obtained for each identical neighbor pixel group in each of the training images in the training image set. When no more training images remain, the method - continues at step -.","Upon determining all of the candidate pixel values for each of the identical neighbor pixel groups in all of the training images, a plurality of statistical moments are determined at step - for each of the identical neighbor pixel groups. The plurality of statistical moments can be determined directly using standard statistical formulas (see equations 2A-2I above, for example), or information enabling quick determination of the statistical moments can be determined as an alternative. For example, the plurality of candidate pixels for a given identical neighbor pixel group can be summed and divided by the total number of occurrences of the given identical neighbor pixel group to determine a mean value (a measure of the first statistical moment). In addition, the sums of the squared pixel values, the sums of the cubed pixel values, the sums of the powers of four of the pixel values and number of occurrences can be used to determine the variance (a measure of the first statistical moment, the skewness (a measure of the third statistical moment) and\/or the kurtosis (a measure of the fourth statistical moment) using equations 2A-2E, or equations 2F-2I listed above.","Upon determining the plurality of statistical moments at step -, the method - continues at step - where an optimum candidate pixel value is obtained for each of the identical neighbor pixel groups based on the determined statistical moments. The optimum candidate pixel value can be determined based on a Bayesian MMSE model, using mean and variance measures, or based on a maximum a posteriori or MAP estimate, using mean, variance, skewness and kurtosis, for example. The mean, variance, skewness and kurtosis parameters could be estimated for a mathematical family of distributions, as specified by the equations 2A-2E, and\/or equations 2F-2I listed above. The location of the peak value of the estimated distributions in the family of distributions could then be used as the MAP estimate.","At step -, a table associating indications of the determined statistical moments and\/or the determined optimum candidate values with each of the identical neighbor pixel groups is stored in memory (e.g., the RAM  or the disk ). If no further combining of optimum candidate pixel values is needed, the optimum candidate pixel values can be stored in the table at step -. However, if multiple candidate pixel values are to be combined to determine the final optimum candidate pixel value for a plurality of identical neighbor pixel groups, then data indicative of the statistical moments determined at step - are stored in the table. For example, a mean and a variance of the candidate pixel values of each of the identical neighbor pixel groups can be stored in the table and later combined using, for example, reliability measures \u201c\u03c1\u201d (1\/variance) of two candidate pixel values combined into a relative reliability measure \u201c\u03b3.\u201d Other statistical moments (e.g., skewness and\/or kurtosis measures) can be used to combine the statistical moments of two or more entries in the table associated with multiple identical neighbor pixel groups. Upon completion of step -, the table stored in memory can be used to interpolate missing pixel values of digital images, even digital images not included in the training image set. In some aspects, the method - can conclude after completion of step -. However, the exemplary process - includes steps - and - where a digital image is processed using the stored table.","Step - is the last step in the training portion of the method -. In some aspects, the training portion can use a measure of convergence to determine when enough training images have been considered. For example, the steps - through - can be performed multiple times for incrementally larger sets of training images. When the statistical moments that are determined at step - converge, the training portion can be terminated. Convergence can be determined using a threshold value (e.g., a percentage or an absolute value). If all the statistical moments have converged within the threshold for two consecutive sets of training images, then the training portion is concluded. Percentage thresholds can be on the order of 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5% or larger, depending on the requirements. Absolute thresholds can be an integer number of quantized pixel values, depending on the quantization level. For example an absolute threshold level of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or higher could be used for 8-bit pixel values that vary from 0-255.","At step -, the restoration portion of the method - begins and a digital image is received and a missing pixel is identified. The missing pixel could be the result of transmission errors across a network or image capture errors (e.g., where the image is being captured by a camera, an X-ray machine, etc.). The missing pixel identified at step - is proximate to a first neighbor pixel group in the received image. The first neighbor pixel group includes pixel values identical to one of the identical neighbor pixel groups identified in step -.","At step -, the processor determines an optimum pixel value for the missing pixel using the stored table. If the stored table includes optimum candidate pixel values, the optimum pixel value can be retrieved directly from the table by identifying the proper identical neighbor pixel group corresponding to the first neighbor pixel group. Alternatively, the statistical moments stored in the table can be used to determine the optimum pixel value at step -. In some systems, candidate pixel values for two pixel groups (e.g., a vertical pixel group and a horizontal pixel group) can be combined using the statistical moments (e.g., mean, variance, skewness and\/or kurtosis) that are stored in the table. Steps - and - are repeated for each missing pixel in the received image.","In one embodiment, to improve the computation efficiency, a portion of the neighboring pixel values may be quantized. For example, referring to , suppose that 5th-order statistics are used to estimate the pixel value \u201cx.\u201d As a result, the pixel values of \u201ca,\u201d \u201cb,\u201d \u201cc\u201d and \u201cd\u201d may be used to estimate the pixel value \u201cx.\u201d In this scenario, the furthest pixel values \u201ca\u201d and \u201cd,\u201d also referred to herein as \u201cflanking points,\u201d may be quantized as the estimate for obtaining an accurate pixel value depends more on the closer neighboring pixel points \u201cb\u201d and \u201cc\u201d than the further away pixel points \u201ca\u201d and \u201cd.\u201d. The amount of quantization for each context pixel can be determined by analysis of various combinations of quantization parameters for different neighboring pixels. Testing has shown that quantization levels or 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 pixels could be used. For example, if four pixels \u201ca,\u201d \u201cb,\u201d \u201cc\u201d and \u201cd\u201d were used to estimate pixel \u201cx,\u201d then pixels \u201cb\u201d and \u201cc\u201d could be represented by 8 bits and the flanking pixels \u201ca\u201d and \u201cd\u201d could be represented by 4 bits for a total of 24 bits. A total neighbor group represented by 24 bits results in statistical moment tables that include about 16 million entries. Using 6 bits for all four pixels \u201ca,\u201d \u201cb,\u201d \u201cc\u201d and \u201cd\u201d also gave satisfactory results. Pixel values may also be quantized into data subsets that have unequally spaced bins, or \u201cquantiles.\u201d However, some testing has shown that using quantiles did not significantly improve accuracy, which may be due to the fact the distribution of prediction errors is complex and hard to characterize.","By using the method - for interpolation of missing pixels, the accuracy for estimating a missing pixel value is improved as higher order statistics (e.g., second, third, fourth and fifth) include information that in the prior interpolation algorithms has been ignored due to the restrictive measurements and assumptions. Furthermore, the process for obtaining the Bayesian estimator is simpler and more direct than prior algorithms thereby improving the computation efficiency.","Furthermore, in one aspect, the measured tables described herein could be replaced with smooth functions fitted to the tables to reduce memory requirements. In one aspect, the pixel values of the \u201ca,\u201d \u201cb,\u201d \u201cc\u201d and \u201cd\u201d pixels, and other neighboring pixel values such as the \u201ce\u201d \u201cf\u201d, \u201cg\u201d and \u201ch\u201d pixels, could be mapped into a different feature space found by accuracy maximization analysis (AMA) or other similar procedure. AMA involves finding an optimal encoder for a task of interest, given a relatively small population of noisy \u201cneurons\u201d between the encoder and decoder. The AMA process is described in a paper entitled \u201cOptimal Stimulus Encoders for Natural Tasks\u201d by Wilson s. Geisler, Jiri Najemnik and Almon D. Ing, published on Dec. 16, 2009 in the Journal of Vision, vol. 9 no. 13, article 17.","Method - may include alternative and\/or additional steps that, for clarity, are not depicted.

For example, suppose that pixel values \u201cb,\u201d and \u201cc\u201d represent the neighboring pixels in each of the identical neighbor pixel groups and \u201cx\u201d represents the pixel to be interpolated. Suppose further that in one training sample , pixel value \u201cx\u201d is 1 when pixel value \u201cb\u201d is 1 and pixel value \u201cc\u201d is 2. Suppose further that in another training sample , pixel value \u201cx\u201d is 2 when pixel value \u201cb\u201d is 1 and pixel value \u201cc\u201d is 2. Hence, in this example, pixel value \u201cx\u201d has the values of 1 and 2 when pixel value \u201cb\u201d is 1 and pixel value \u201cc\u201d is 2. As a result, the values of \u201cx\u201d in these two scenarios (1 and 2) are summed to provide a result of 3. By summing instead of storing the values of x for each identical neighbor pixel group comprising the pixel values of \u201cb=1\u201d and \u201cc=2,\u201d there is a reduction in the amount of information to be stored which improves the computation efficiency. Depending on the number of statistical moments to be used, additional values and sums of squared values, cubed values and powers of four of the candidate pixel values are also determined at step -.","In step -, the average pixel value of the pixel value to be estimated (e.g., pixel value \u201cx\u201d) is computed by dividing the summed value of the pixel value to be estimated (e.g., pixel value \u201cx\u201d) which is computed in step - by the number of times the associated neighboring pixel values (e.g., pixel values \u201cb\u201d and \u201cc) has the same set of values in training samples . \u201cAssociated,\u201d as used herein, refers to those neighboring pixel values that are used in connection for summing the pixel value in step . For instance, referring to the example above, the combination of pixel value \u201cb\u201d having the value of 1 and pixel value \u201cc\u201d having the value of 2 occurred twice. Hence, the summed value of 3 is divided by 2 producing a result of 1.5. If variances are to be used in estimating optimal pixel values, the sums of the squares of the candidate pixel values are also used to calculate the variance using equation 2B or 2G. Likewise, if skewness is to be used, the stored sums of the cubes of the pixel values are also used along with equation 2D or 2H. If the kurtosis is to be used, the stored sums of the powers of four of the candidate pixel values are also used along with equation 2E or 2I, and so on.","In step -, the computed average value (or alternatively the summed value) of the pixel value to be estimated (e.g., pixel value \u201cx\u201d), and possibly other parameters including variance, skewness and\/or kurtosis, for each independent pixel value group is stored in a table along with the number \u201cN\u201d of occurrences that the identical neighbor pixel group was found in the training images. Furthermore, the associated combination of pixel values for the associate identical neighbor pixel group is also stored in the table. For instance, referring to the example above, an entry of pixel value \u201cx\u201d having the value of 1.5 when pixel value \u201cb\u201d has the value of 1 and pixel value \u201cc\u201d has the value of 2, and the number of occurrences equal to 2 may all be stored in a table. In one embodiment, the table may be stored in disk . In another embodiment, the table may be stored in memory. By storing the summed candidate pixel values (the first statistical moment), the summed variances, the summed skewness, and\/or the summed kurtosis values, along with the number of occurrences \u201cN\u201d that resulted in the summed values, the second, third and fourth statistical moments (or higher order statistical moments) can be determined using standard statistical relations listed above in equations 2A-2I.","The tables of sums of the means, variances, skewness and\/or kurtosis can be temporary tables. Once the tables of sums are obtained from the training set they can be divided by the counts \u201cN\u201d and combined to obtain tables of the means, variances, skewness, kurtosis, etc. In this way, the tables storing the means, variances, skewness and\/or kurtosis would be retained once the training images have been processed. In this aspect, the table of the counts (\u201cN\u201d values) would not need to be retained.","In step -, the Bayesian estimator is determined to estimate the value of the pixel to be estimated (e.g., pixel value \u201cx\u201d) based on the table storing the average values of the pixel value to be estimated (e.g., pixel value \u201cx\u201d) for each unique set of values for the at least two neighboring values (e.g., pixel values \u201cb\u201d and \u201cc\u201d).

Some systems can normalize the conditional distributions of pixel values by dividing each distribution by its variance. This normalization gives all tables the same shape and allows for the possibility of combining tables and storing only their mean values. In some image processing systems, distributions are often smoothed, thereby removing noise and possibly improving performance. However, testing of natural images showed that smoothing the statistical moment tables did not improve performance. However, systems dealing with other types of images may show improved performance using smoothed tables.","Although the method, system and computer program product are described in connection with several embodiments, it is not intended to be limited to the specific forms set forth herein, but on the contrary, it is intended to cover such alternatives, modifications and equivalents, as can be reasonably included within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTEREST","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["A better understanding of the present invention can be obtained when the following detailed description is considered in conjunction with the following drawings, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 2A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 2B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 4A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 4B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 4C","FIGS. 4A and 4B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 6A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIGS. 6B","b":["6","6","6"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 6F","FIGS. 6B-6E"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 7"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
