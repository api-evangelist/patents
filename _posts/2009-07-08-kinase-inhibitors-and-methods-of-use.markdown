{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61\/079,127, filed on Jul. 8, 2008, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","The activity of cells can be regulated by external signals that stimulate or inhibit intracellular events. The process by which stimulatory or inhibitory signals are transmitted into and within a cell to elicit an intracellular response is referred to as signal transduction. Over the past decades, cascades of signal transduction events have been elucidated and found to play a central role in a variety of biological responses. Defects in various components of signal transduction pathways have been found to account for a vast number of diseases, including numerous forms of cancer, inflammatory disorders, metabolic disorders, vascular and neuronal diseases (Gaestel et al. (2007) 14:2214-2234).","Kinases represent a class of important signaling molecules. Kinases can generally be classified into protein kinases and lipid kinases, and certain kinases exhibit dual specificities. Protein kinases are enzymes that phosphorylate other proteins and\/or themselves (i.e., autophosphorylation). Protein kinases can be generally classified into three major groups based upon their substrate utilization: tyrosine kinases which predominantly phosphorylate substrates on tyrosine residues (e.g., erb2, PDGF receptor, EGF receptor, VEGF receptor, src, abl), serine\/threonine kinases which predominantly phosphorylate substrates on serine and\/or threonine residues (e.g., mTorC1, mTorC2, ATM, ATR, DNA-PK, Akt), and dual-specificity kinases which phosphorylate substrates on tyrosine, serine and\/or threonine residues.","Lipid kinases are enzymes that catalyze the phosphorylation of lipids within cells. These enzymes, and the resulting phosphorylated lipids and lipid derived biologically active organic molecules, play a role in many different physiological processes, including cell proliferation, migration, adhesion, and differentiation. A particular group of lipid kinases comprises membrane lipid kinases, i.e., kinases that catalyze the phosphorylation of lipids contained in or associated with cell membranes. Examples of such enzymes include phosphinositide(s) kinases (such as PI3-kinases, PI4-Kinases), diacylglycerol kinases, and sphingosine kinases.","The phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) signaling pathway is one of the most highly mutated systems in human cancers. PI3K signaling is involved in many other disease states including allergic contact dermatitis, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, asthma, disorders related to diabetic complications, and inflammatory complications of the cardiovascular system such as acute coronary syndrome.","PI3Ks are members of a unique and conserved family of intracellular lipid kinases that phosphorylate the 3\u2032-OH group on phosphatidylinositols or phosphoinositides. The PI3K family comprises 15 kinases with distinct substrate specificities, expression patterns, and modes of regulation (Katso et al., 2001). The class I PI3Ks (p110\u03b1, p110\u03b2, p110\u03b4, and p110\u03b3) are typically activated by tyrosine kinases or G-protein coupled receptors to generate PIP3, which engages downstream effectors such as the Akt\/PDK1 pathway, mTOR, the Tec family kinases, and the Rho family GTPases. The class II and III PI3-Ks play a key role in intracellular trafficking through the synthesis of PI(3)P and PI(3,4)P2.","The production of phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate initiates potent growth and survival signals. In some epithelial cancers the PI3K pathway is activated by direct genetic mutation. Additionally, the PI3K signaling pathway appears to be a crucial survival and growth signal in a broad spectrum of cancers. As PI3K signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in cell proliferation and differentiation, inhibition of this pathway is believed to be beneficial in hyperproliferative diseases.","Downstream mediators of the PI3K signal transduction pathway include Akt and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Akt possesses a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain that binds PIP3, leading to Akt kinase activation. Akt phosphorylates many substrates and is a central downstream effector of PI3K for diverse cellular responses. Full activation of Akt typically requires phosphorylation of T308 in the activation loop and S473 in a hydrophobic motif. One important function of Akt is to augment the activity of mTOR, through phosphorylation of TSC2 and other mechanisms.","mTOR is a serine-threonine kinase related to the lipid kinases of the PI3K family. mTOR has been implicated in a wide range of biological processes including cell growth, cell proliferation, cell motility and survival. Disregulation of the mTOR pathway has been reported in various types of cancer. mTOR is a multifunctional kinase that integrates growth factor and nutrient signals to regulate protein translation, nutrient uptake, autophagy, and mitrochondrial function.","mTOR exists in two complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2. mTORC1 contains the raptor subunit and mTORC2 contains rictor. These complexes are differentially regulated, and have distinct substrate specificities and rapamycin sensitivity. For example, mTORC1 phosphorylates S6 kinase (S6K) and 4EBP1, promoting increased translation and ribosome biogenesis to facilitate cell growth and cell cycle progression. S6K also acts in a feedback pathway to attenuate PI3K\/Akt activation. mTORC2 is generally insensitive to rapamycin. mTORC2 is though to modulate growth factor signaling by phosphorylating the C-terminal hydrophobic motif of some AGC kinases such as Akt. In many cellular contexts, mTORC2 is required for phosphorylation of the S473 site of Akt.","Dysregulation of signaling pathways mediated by many other kinases is a key factor in the development of human diseases. Aberrant or excessive protein kinase activity or expression has been observed in many disease states including benign and malignant proliferative diseases, disorders such as allergic contact dermatitis, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, asthma, disorders related to diabetic complications, and inflammatory complications of the cardiovascular system such as acute coronary syndrome.","As such, kinases particularly protein kinases such as mTor and lipid kinases such as PI3Ks are prime targets for drug development. The present invention addresses a need in the art by providing a new class of kinase inhibitors and various treatment methods.","In one aspect, the invention provides a compound of Formula I or a

Cyano substituted aminopyrazole 1-1 is heated with formamide at 160\u00b0 C. for 5 hours to yield 2-(4-amino-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine (compound 1-2) in 90% yield. This intermediate is reacted with N-iodosuccinimide in dimethylformamide at 80\u00b0 C. for 16 hours, to produce 2-(4-amino-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidin-3-yl iodide (Cpd. 1-3) in 90% yield.","The pyrazolopyrimidinyl iodide, Cpd. 1-3, is reacted with a species RX in the presence of a base, where X is a good leaving group such as for example, a halide, including bromo, chloro or iodide, or a tosylate, or another moiety which will act as a leaving group under the reaction conditions. The \u201cR\u201d portion of the moiety is alkyl, heterocycloalkyl, alkylaryl, alkylheteroaryl, alkenyl, alkynyl, or cycloalkyl. The base is, for example, potassium carbonate, cesium carbonate, sodium hydride, potassium tert-butoxide, and the like. The product, compound 1-4, incorporates a \u201cR\u201d moiety coupled to nitrogen, as shown. This intermediate is subjected to a Suzuki coupling, i.e. palladium catalyzed coupling between and iodide bearing compounds and a boronic acid, depicted as ArB(OH)to produce a compound of the invention, Cpd. 1-5, after deprotection. Many boronic acid analogs of formula ArB(OH)are commercially available, or may be synthesized as is known in the art, and may include heteroaromatic as well as carbocyclic aromatic moieties.","Compound 2-4 is synthesized as shown in Scheme 2.

In some embodiments, the composition further contains: (iv) an effective amount of a third agent.","In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition may be a liquid pharmaceutical composition suitable for oral consumption. Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention suitable for oral administration can be presented as discrete dosage forms, such as capsules, cachets, or tablets, or liquids or aerosol sprays each containing a predetermined amount of an active ingredient as a powder or in granules, a solution, or a suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid, an oil-in-water emulsion, or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion. Such dosage forms can be prepared by any of the methods of pharmacy, but all methods include the step of bringing the active ingredient into association with the carrier, which constitutes one or more necessary ingredients. In general, the compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately admixing the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired presentation. For example, a tablet can be prepared by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets can be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredient in a free-flowing form such as powder or granules, optionally mixed with an excipient such as, but not limited to, a binder, a lubricant, an inert diluent, and\/or a surface active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets can be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent.","This invention further encompasses anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms comprising an active ingredient, since water can facilitate the degradation of some compounds. For example, water may be added (e.g., 5%) in the pharmaceutical arts as a means of simulating long-term storage in order to determine characteristics such as shelf-life or the stability of formulations over time. Anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of the invention can be prepared using anhydrous or low moisture containing ingredients and low moisture or low humidity conditions. Pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of the invention which contain lactose can be made anhydrous if substantial contact with moisture and\/or humidity during manufacturing, packaging, and\/or storage is expected. An anhydrous pharmaceutical composition may be prepared and stored such that its anhydrous nature is maintained. Accordingly, anhydrous compositions may be packaged using materials known to prevent exposure to water such that they can be included in suitable formulary kits. Examples of suitable packaging include, but are not limited to, hermetically sealed foils, plastic or the like, unit dose containers, blister packs, and strip packs.","An active ingredient can be combined in an intimate admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. The carrier can take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. In preparing the compositions for an oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media can be employed as carriers, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents, and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations (such as suspensions, solutions, and elixirs) or aerosols; or carriers such as starches, sugars, micro-crystalline cellulose, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, and disintegrating agents can be used in the case of oral solid preparations, in some embodiments without employing the use of lactose. For example, suitable carriers include powders, capsules, and tablets, with the solid oral preparations. If desired, tablets can be coated by standard aqueous or nonaqueous techniques.","Binders suitable for use in pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms include, but are not limited to, corn starch, potato starch, or other starches, gelatin, natural and synthetic gums such as acacia, sodium alginate, alginic acid, other alginates, powdered tragacanth, guar gum, cellulose and its derivatives (e.g., ethyl cellulose, cellulose acetate, carboxymethyl cellulose calcium, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose), polyvinyl pyrrolidone, methyl cellulose, pre-gelatinized starch, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, and mixtures thereof.","Examples of suitable fillers for use in the pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms disclosed herein include, but are not limited to, talc, calcium carbonate (e.g., granules or powder), microcrystalline cellulose, powdered cellulose, dextrates, kaolin, mannitol, silicic acid, sorbitol, starch, pre-gelatinized starch, and mixtures thereof.","Disintegrants may be used in the compositions of the invention to provide tablets that disintegrate when exposed to an aqueous environment. Too much of a disintegrant may produce tablets which may disintegrate in the bottle. Too little may be insufficient for disintegration to occur and may thus alter the rate and extent of release of the active ingredient(s) from the dosage form. Thus, a sufficient amount of disintegrant that is neither too little nor too much to detrimentally alter the release of the active ingredient(s) may be used to form the dosage forms of the compounds disclosed herein. The amount of disintegrant used may vary based upon the type of formulation and mode of administration, and may be readily discernible to those of ordinary skill in the art. About 0.5 to about 15 weight percent of disintegrant, or about 1 to about 5 weight percent of disintegrant, may be used in the pharmaceutical composition. Disintegrants that can be used to form pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of the invention include, but are not limited to, agar-agar, alginic acid, calcium carbonate, microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, crospovidone, polacrilin potassium, sodium starch glycolate, potato or tapioca starch, other starches, pre-gelatinized starch, other starches, clays, other algins, other celluloses, gums or mixtures thereof.","Lubricants which can be used to form pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of the invention include, but are not limited to, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, mineral oil, light mineral oil, glycerin, sorbitol, mannitol, polyethylene glycol, other glycols, stearic acid, sodium lauryl sulfate, talc, hydrogenated vegetable oil (e.g., peanut oil, cottonseed oil, sunflower oil, sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil, and soybean oil), zinc stearate, ethyl oleate, ethylaureate, agar, or mixtures thereof. Additional lubricants include, for example, a syloid silica gel, a coagulated aerosol of synthetic silica, or mixtures thereof. A lubricant can optionally be added, in an amount of less than about 1 weight percent of the pharmaceutical composition.","When aqueous suspensions and\/or elixirs are desired for oral administration, the essential active ingredient therein may be combined with various sweetening or flavoring agents, coloring matter or dyes and, if so desired, emulsifying and\/or suspending agents, together with such diluents as water, ethanol, propylene glycol, glycerin and various combinations thereof.","The tablets can be uncoated or coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate can be employed. Formulations for oral use can also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium, for example, peanut oil, liquid paraffin or olive oil.","Surfactant which can be used to form pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of the invention include, but are not limited to, hydrophilic surfactants, lipophilic surfactants, and mixtures thereof. That is, a mixture of hydrophilic surfactants may be employed, a mixture of lipophilic surfactants may be employed, or a mixture of at least one hydrophilic surfactant and at least one lipophilic surfactant may be employed.","A suitable hydrophilic surfactant may generally have an HLB value of at least 10, while suitable lipophilic surfactants may generally have an HLB value of or less than about 10. An empirical parameter used to characterize the relative hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of non-ionic amphiphilic compounds is the hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (\u201cHLB\u201d value). Surfactants with lower HLB values are more lipophilic or hydrophobic, and have greater solubility in oils, while surfactants with higher HLB values are more hydrophilic, and have greater solubility in aqueous solutions. Hydrophilic surfactants are generally considered to be those compounds having an HLB value greater than about 10, as well as anionic, cationic, or zwitterionic compounds for which the HLB scale is not generally applicable. Similarly, lipophilic (i.e., hydrophobic) surfactants are compounds having an HLB value equal to or less than about 10.

However, an effective dosage is in the range of about 0.001 to about 100 mg per kg body weight per day, preferably about 1 to about 35 mg\/kg\/day, in single or divided doses. For a 70 kg human, this would amount to about 0.05 to 7 g\/day, preferably about 0.05 to about 2.5 g\/day. In some instances, dosage levels below the lower limit of the aforesaid range may be more than adequate, while in other cases still larger doses may be employed without causing any harmful side effect, e.g. by dividing such larger doses into several small doses for administration throughout the day.","In some embodiments, a compound of the invention is administered in a single dose. Typically, such administration will be by injection, e.g., intravenous injection, in order to introduce the agent quickly. However, other routes may be used as appropriate. A single dose of a compound of the invention may also be used for treatment of an acute condition.","In some embodiments, a compound of the invention is administered in multiple doses. Dosing may be about once, twice, three times, four times, five times, six times, or more than six times per day.

Such a method of administration may, for example, aid in the prevention or amelioration of restenosis following procedures such as balloon angioplasty. Without being bound by theory, compounds of the invention may slow or inhibit the migration and proliferation of smooth muscle cells in the arterial wall which contribute to restenosis. A compound of the invention may be administered, for example, by local delivery from the struts of a stent, from a stent graft, from grafts, or from the cover or sheath of a stent. In some embodiments, a compound of the invention is admixed with a matrix. Such a matrix may be a polymeric matrix, and may serve to bond the compound to the stent.

Suitable matrices may be nondegrading or may degrade with time, releasing the compound or compounds. Compounds of the invention may be applied to the surface of the stent by various methods such as dip\/spin coating, spray coating, dip-coating, and\/or brush-coating. The compounds may be applied in a solvent and the solvent may be allowed to evaporate, thus forming a layer of compound onto the stent. Alternatively, the compound may be located in the body of the stent or graft, for example in microchannels or micropores. When implanted, the compound diffuses out of the body of the stent to contact the arterial wall. Such stents may be prepared by dipping a stent manufactured to contain such micropores or microchannels into a solution of the compound of the invention in a suitable solvent, followed by evaporation of the solvent. Excess drug on the surface of the stent may be removed via an additional brief solvent wash. In yet other embodiments, compounds of the invention may be covalently linked to a stent or graft. A covalent linker may be used which degrades in vivo, leading to the release of the compound of the invention. Any bio-labile linkage may be used for such a purpose, such as ester, amide or anhydride linkages. Compounds of the invention may additionally be administered intravascularly from a balloon used during angioplasty. Extravascular administration of the compounds via the pericard or via advential application of formulations of the invention may also be performed to decrease restenosis.","A variety of stent devices which may be used as described are disclosed, for example, in the following references, all of which are hereby incorporated by reference: U.S. Pat.

IC50 values are measured using either a standard TLC assay for lipid kinase activity (described below) or a high-throughput membrane capture assay. Kinase reactions are performed by preparing a reaction mixture containing kinase, inhibitor (2% DMSO final concentration), buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCl2), and freshly sonicated phosphatidylinositol (100 \u03bcg\/ml). Reactions are initiated by the addition of ATP containing 10 \u03bcCi of \u03b3-32P-ATP to a final concentration 10 or 100 \u03bcM and allowed to proceed for 5 minutes at room temperature. For TLC analysis, reactions are then terminated by the addition of 105 \u03bcl 1N HCl followed by 160 \u03bcl CHCl:MeOH (1:1). The biphasic mixture is vortexed, briefly centrifuged, and the organic phase is transferred to a new tube using a gel loading pipette tip precoated with CHCl. This extract is spotted on TLC plates and developed for 3-4 hours in a 65:35 solution of n-propanol:1M acetic acid. The TLC plates are then dried, exposed to a phosphorimager screen (Storm, Amersham), and quantitated. For each compound, kinase activity is measured at 10-12 inhibitor concentrations representing two-fold dilutions from the highest concentration tested (typically, 200 \u03bcM). For compounds showing significant activity, IC50 determinations are repeated two to four times, and the reported value is the average of these independent measurements.","Other commercial kits or systems for assaying PI3-K activities are available.

For example, stability of one or more subject compounds is established by an in vitro assay. In particular, an in vitro microsome stability assay is established that measures stability of one or more subject compounds when reacting with mouse, rat or human microsomes from liver. The microsome reaction with compounds is performed in 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube. Each tube contains 0.1 \u03bcL of 10.0 mg\/ml NADPH; 75 \u03bcL of 20.0 mg\/ml mouse, rat or human liver microsome; 0.4 \u03bcL of 0.2 M phosphate buffer, and 425 \u03bcL of ddHO.

Samples are centrifuged at 15,000 rpm to remove protein. Supernatant of centrifuged sample is transferred to new tube. Concentration of stable compound after reaction with microsome in the supernatant is measured by Liquid Chromatography\/Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS).","The stability of one or more subject compounds in plasma is determined according to standard procedures known in the art. See, e.g., 10: 1019-1026. The following procedure is an HPLC-MS\/MS assay using human plasma; other species including monkey, dog, rat, and mouse are also available. Frozen, heparinized human plasma is thawed in a cold water bath and spun for 10 minutes at 2000 rpm at 4\u00b0 C. prior to use. A subject compound is added from a 400 \u03bcM stock solution to an aliquot of pre-warmed plasma to give a final assay volume of 400 \u03bcL (or 800 \u03bcL for half-life determination), containing 5 \u03bcM test compound and 0.5% DMSO.

The ratio of the parent compound remaining after 60 minutes relative to the amount remaining at time zero, expressed as percent, is reported as plasma stability. In case of half-life determination, the half-life is estimated from the slope of the initial linear range of the logarithmic curve of compound remaining (%) vs. time, assuming first order kinetics.","The chemical stability of one or more subject compounds is determined according to standard procedures known in the art. The following details an exemplary procedure for ascertaining chemical stability of a subject compound. The default buffer used for the chemical stability assay is phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at pH 7.4; other suitable buffers can be used. A subject compound is added from a 100 \u03bcM stock solution to an aliquot of PBS (in duplicate) to give a final assay volume of 400 \u03bcL, containing 5 \u03bcM test compound and 1% DMSO (for half-life determination a total sample volume of 700 \u03bcL is prepared). Reactions are incubated, with shaking, for 0 minutes and 24 hours at 37\u00b0 C.; for half-life determination samples are incubated for 0, 2, 4, 6, and 24 hours. Reactions are stopped by adding immediately 100 \u03bcL of the incubation mixture to 100 \u03bcL of acetonitrile and vortexing for 5 minutes. The samples are then stored at \u221220\u00b0 C. until analysis by HPLC-MS\/MS. Where desired, a control compound or a reference compound such as chlorambucil (5 \u03bcM) is tested simultaneously with a subject compound of interest, as this compound is largely hydrolyzed over the course of 24 hours. Samples are analyzed via (RP)HPLC-MS\/MS using selected reaction monitoring (SRM). The HPLC conditions consist of a binary LC pump with autosampler, a mixed-mode, C12, 2\u00d720 mm column, and a gradient program. Peak areas corresponding to the analytes are recorded by HPLC-MS\/MS. The ratio of the parent compound remaining after 24 hours relative to the amount remaining at time zero, expressed as percent, is reported as chemical stability.

Cells are lysed by scraping into ice cold lysis buffer containing detergents such as sodium dodecyl sulfate and protease inhibitors (e.g., PMSF). After contacting cells with lysis buffer, the solution is briefly sonicated, cleared by centrifugation, resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose or PVDF and immunoblotted using antibodies to phospho-Akt S473, phospho-Akt T308, Akt, and \u03b2-actin (Cell Signaling Technologies).","It is expected that one or more compounds of the present disclosure inhibit insulin stimulated phosphorylation of Akt at S473. Alternatively, some compounds disclosed herein additionally inhibit insulin stimulated phosphorylation of Akt at T308. Such class of compounds can inhibit Akt more effectively than rapamycin and may be indicative of mTORC2 inhibitors or inhibitors of upstream kinases such as PI3K or Akt.","PI3K\/Akt\/mTor signaling is measured in blood cells using the phosflow method (Methods Enzymol. 2007; 434:131-54). The advantage of this method is that it is by nature a single cell assay so that cellular heterogeneity can be detected rather than population averages. This allows concurrent distinction of signaling states in different populations defined by other markers. Phosflow is also highly quantitative. To test the effects of the inhibitors disclosed herein, unfractionated splenocytes, or peripheral blood mononuclear cells are stimulated with anti-CD3 to initiate T-cell receptor signaling. The cells are then fixed and stained for surface markers and intracellular phosphoproteins. It is expected that inhibitors disclosed herein inhibit anti-CD3 mediated phosphorylation of Akt-S473 and S6, whereas rapamycin inhibits S6 phosphorylation and enhances Akt phosphorylation under the conditions tested.","Similarly, aliquots of whole blood are incubated for 15 minutes with vehicle (e.g. 0.1% DMSO) or kinase inhibitors at various concentrations, before addition of stimuli to crosslink the T cell receptor (TCR) (anti-CD3 with secondary antibody) or the B cell receptor (BCR) using anti-kappa light chain antibody (Fab\u20322 fragments). After approximately 5 and 15 minutes, samples are fixed (e.g. with cold 4% paraformaldehyde) and used for phosflow. Surface staining is used to distinguish T and B cells using antibodies directed to cell surface markers that are known to the art. The level of phosphrylation of kinase substrates such as Akt and S6 are then measured by incubating the fixed cells with labeled antibodies specific to the phosphorylated isoforms of these proteins. The population of cells are then analyzed by flow cytometery. The results are expected to indicate one or more compounds disclosed herein that inhibit the phosphorylation of kinase substrates such as PI3K substrates, Akt substrates, mTORC1 substrates, mTORC2 substrates, mTOR substrates, MAPK substrates, ERK substrates, MAPKK substrates, and\/or MEK substrates.","Murine bone marrow cells freshly transformed with a p190 BCR-Abl retrovirus (herein referred to as p190 transduced cells) are plated in the presence of various drug combinations in M3630 methylcellulose media for about 7 days with recombinant human IL-7 in about 30% serum, and the number of colonies formed is counted by visual examination under a microscope. The results show that, compared to rapamycin, compounds of the present disclosure potentiate the effects of a half maximal concentration of known chemotherapeutic agents such as and without limitation imatinib, rapamycin, and dasatinib at the concentrations examined.","Alternatively, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells are obtained from philladelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) and negative (Ph\u2212) patients upon initial diagnosis or relapse. Live cells are isolated and enriched for CD19+CD34+ B cell progenitors. After overnight liquid culture, cells are plated in methocult GF+H4435, Stem Cell Technologies) supplemented with cytokines (IL-3, IL-6, IL-7, G-CSF, GM-CSF, CF, Flt3 ligand, and erythropoietin) and various concentrations of known chemotherapeutic agents in combination with either compounds of the present disclosure. Colonies are counted by microscopy 12-14 days later.","Female recipient mice are lethally irradiated from a \u03b3 source in two doses about 4 hr apart, with approximately 5 Gy each. About 1 hr after the second radiation dose, mice are injected i.v. with about 1\u00d710leukemic cells (e.g. Ph+ human or murine cells, or p190 transduced bone marrow cells). These cells are administered together with a radioprotective dose of about 5\u00d710normal bone marrow cells from 3-5 week old donor mice. Recipients are given antibiotics in the water and monitored daily. Mice who become sick after about 14 days are euthanized and lymphoid organs are harvested for analysis. Kinase inhibitor treatment begins about 10 days after leukemic cell injection and continues daily until the mice become sick or a maximum of approximately 35 days post-transplant. Inhibitors are given by oral lavage.","Peripheral blood cells are collected approximately on day 10 (pre-treatment) and upon euthanization (post treatment), contacted with labled anti-hCD4 antibodies and counted by flow cytometry. It is expected that one or more compounds disclosed herein alone or in combination with known chemotherapeutic agents significantly reduce leukemic blood cell counts as compared to treatment with known chemotherapeutic agents (e.g. GLEEVEC\u00ae (imatinib)) alone under the conditions tested.","Mice lacking the inhibitory receptor Fc\u03b3RIIb that opposes PI3K signaling in B cells develop lupus with high penetrance. Fc\u03b3RIIb knockout mice (R2KO, Jackson Labs) are considered a valid model of the human disease as some lupus patients show decreased expression or function of Fc\u03b3RIIb (S. Bolland and J. V. Ravtech 200012:277-285).","The R2KO mice develop lupus-like disease with anti-nuclear antibodies, glomerulonephritis and proteinurea within about 4-6 months of age. For these experiments, the rapamycin analogue RAD001 (available from LC Laboratories) is used as a benchmark compound, and administered orally. This compound has been shown to ameliorate lupus symptoms in the B6.Sle1z.Sle3z model (T. Wu et al. 117:2186-2196).","Lupus disease model mice such as R2KO, BXSB or MLR\/lpr are treated at about 2 months old, approximately for about two months. Mice are given doses of: vehicle, RAD001 at about 10 mg\/kg, or compounds disclosed herein at approximately 10 mg\/kg to about 50 mg\/kg. Blood and urine samples are obtained at approximately throughout the testing period, and tested for antinuclear antibodies (in dilutions of serum) or protein concentration (in urine). Serum is also tested for anti-ssDNA and anti-dsDNA antibodies by ELISA. Animals are euthanized at day 60 and tissues harvested for measuring spleen weight and kidney disease. Glomerulonephritis is assessed in kidney sections stained with H&E. Other animals are studied for about two months after cessation of treatment, using the same endpoints.","It is expected that one or more compounds disclosed herein suppresses or delays the onset of lupus symptoms in lupus disease model mice.","Female recipient mice are lethally irradiated from a \u03b3 ray source. About 1 hr after the radiation dose, mice are injected with about 1\u00d7106 leukemic cells from early passage p190 transduced cultures (e.g. as described in 2005 August; 161 (1):51-6). These cells are administered together with a radioprotective dose of approximately 5\u00d7106 normal bone marrow cells from 3-5 wk old donor mice. Recipients are given antibiotics in the water and monitored daily. Mice who become sick after about 14 days are euthanized and lymphoid organs harvested for flow cytometry and\/or magnetic enrichment. Treatment begins on approximately day 10 and continues daily until mice become sick, or after a maximum of about 35 days post-transplant. Drugs are given by oral gavage (p.o.). In a pilot experiment a dose of chemotherapeutic that is not curative but delays leukemia onset by about one week or less is identified; controls are vehicle-treated or treated with chemotherapeutic agent, previously shown to delay but not cure leukemogenesis in this model (e.g. imatinib at about 70 mg\/kg twice daily). For the first phase p190 cells that express eGFP are used, and postmortem analysis is limited to enumeration of the percentage of leukemic cells in bone marrow, spleen and lymph node (LN) by flow cytometry. In the second phase, p190 cells that express a tailless form of human CD4 are used and the postmortem analysis includes magnetic sorting of hCD4+ cells from spleen followed by immunoblot analysis of key signaling endpoints: p Akt-T308 and S473; pS6 and p4EBP-1. As controls for immunoblot detection, sorted cells are incubated in the presence or absence of kinase inhibitors of the present disclosure inhibitors before lysis. Optionally, \u201cphosflow\u201d is used to detect p Akt-S473 and pS6-S235\/236 in hCD4-gated cells without prior sorting. These signaling studies are particularly useful if, for example, drug-treated mice have not developed clinical leukemia at the 35 day time point. Kaplan-Meier plots of survival are generated and statistical analysis done according to methods known in the art. Results from p190 cells are analyzed separated as well as cumulatively.","Samples of peripheral blood (100-200 \u03bcl) are obtained weekly from all mice, starting on day 10 immediately prior to commencing treatment. Plasma is used for measuring drug concentrations, and cells are analyzed for leukemia markers (eGFP or hCD4) and signaling biomarkers as described herein.","It is expected that the results of the analysis demonstrate effective therapeutic doses of the compounds disclosed herein for inhibiting the proliferation of leukemic cells. It is further expected that combination therapy of the inhibitors disclosed herein with other chemotherapeutic agents (e.g. dasatinib) exhibit a greater degree of efficacy or decreased toxicity in comparison to the use of a single chemotherapeutic agent."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION","I.
