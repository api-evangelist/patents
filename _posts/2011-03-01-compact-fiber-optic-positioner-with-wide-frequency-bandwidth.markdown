Technical Field","The embodiments described herein generally relate to methods and devices. More particularly, the embodiments herein relate to a positioning of fiber optic devices in predetermined directions.","2. Description of the Related Art","Fiber-optic communications are well known as methods of transmitting information from one place to another by sending pulses of light through an optical fiber. The light forms an electromagnetic carrier wave that is modulated to carry information. The positioning of the optical fiber output (i.e., the source of the pulses of light) is among the most common techniques in the fields utilizing the fiber optics. The static displacement of fiber optic output having high resolution can be accomplished utilizing numerous X, Y, Z types of positioners: manual or motorized. However, it is to be noted that these positioners are very cumbersome and have various issues with regard to fiber optic displacement. For example, linear micro-motor positioners have problems moving the fiber output long distances with high speed. Additionally, modem optical communication positioners designed for near-horizontal propagation of carrier laser beams suffer from degradation of performance due to atmospheric turbulences. In particular, the degradation of the carrier beam is a result of fast fluctuating deviations of the beam from the \u201cideal line\u201d connecting the laser transmitter and photo-receiver.","Several solutions have been proposed to compensate for the above-mentioned fluctuating deviations using the fast the movement of fiber optic output emitted by the transmitter and\/or the movement of the distal end of the fiber optic output emitted by the receiver via placement of a remote photo-detector located adjacent to the proximal end of the fiber optic emitted by the receiver. Devices for the fast displacement of fiber optic output are used in such systems including but not limited to: micro-bar code scanners, scanning optical microscopes, flexible endoscopes, and micro-machining vision devices. All of them use the resonant amplification of the fiber distal end displacement by means of exciting the cantilevered fiber forcing the fiber to vibrate at certain resonance frequencies.","In U.S. Pat. No. 6,845,190 to Smithwick et al, the features of a standard PID (proportional integral-derivative) control is described allowing to have different resonance scanning modes.","In U.S. Pat. No. 6,515,274 to Moskovits et al, the resonance excitation of very thin and short fiber tip, aiming to obtain a high Q-factor (up to 9000) is described. The fiber diameter used ranges from about 20 to 100 mkm. The length of the fiber tip is 0.1 mm to 9 mm and the scanning distance is about 1 mkm. Further, obtaining of very thin fiber tips up to 20 mkm diameter is also described. Calculations are presented for the influence of fiber tip dimensions (length L, diameter d) on Q-factor and resonance frequency.","In U.S. Pat. No. 6,091,067 to Drobot et al., a one-dimensional fiber optic scanner is described based on the fiber optic being placed between two sheets of piezoelectric material to provide the bending bimorph structure. However, there is no data about embodiments and characteristics of the deviation amplitude of distal end of fiber as well as no data about the frequency bandwidth and resonant behavior. Moreover, the is not suitable for two-dimensional steering of the fiber optic distal end.","A two-dimensional laser beam steering device is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,295,014 to Toda, which is based on polyvinylidene-fluoride (PVDF) elements. The laser beam scanning is accomplished by means of mirrors connected to bimorph PVDF elements having different configurations. An electrical signal containing two frequency harmonics may induce x and y resonances at separated frequencies, thereby providing Lissajous patterns. However, it is problematic to consider this device for use in resonance-free fiber optic steering in wide frequency ranges, for instance exceeding 1 kHz, due to small stiffness of thin-film polymer-based piezoelectric material since the considerable deviations take place only at resonance conditions.","In U.S. Pat. No. 4,841,148 to Lyding, a piezoelectric tube scanner (device of Lyding) for scanning microscope is described. The tube is described as preferably being up to 6\u2033 long (hence bulky and heavy) to provide the scanning up a range of 100 mkm.","A three-dimensional scanner for a scanning probe microscope is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,173,605 to Hayes et al. In particular, the X, Y, Z scanning tube is comprised of two telescopic tubes with quadrant arrangement of electrodes on tubes. For large displacement, four telescopic tubes can be used. Further, it is claimed that displacement up to 200 mkm is possible for a 1 inch long system and multiple electrode patterns inside and outside of cylinders. Further, it was stated that described device should have better resonance performance, than previously patented devices, however, there is no data about actual scanning ranges and resonance behavior discussed.","In U.S. Pat. No. 5,170,277 to Bard et al, a piezoelectric beam deflector for compact bar code reader is described utilizing the cantilever mounted piezoelectric bimorph elements with mirrors or masks or photodiodes at the end of bimorphs. A resonance mode is considered, yet nowhere is data presented about other experimental embodiments.","In U.S. Pat. No. 6,999,221 to Sarkisov et al., PVDF bimorph actuators driven via light are described. However, this device can not be used for high frequency bandwidth due to three basic restrictions: 1) Very small stiffness of PVDF films to provide high enough distal end displacement, so the resonance frequency could be 2-3 orders less than ceramic or crystal materials; 2) The passive damping of bending actuators require the installation of damping material, which will block the controlling light; and 3) In most fiber optic base systems, there is not enough space to introduce additional elements such as, for example LEDs, lenses, and wires.","In U.S. Pat. No. 6,748,177 to Upton, a fiber optic positioner having multiple degrees of freedom is described, using a plurality of bimorph actuators connected end-to-end and forming an open square. Patterned electrodes on each actuator allow end user to control the structure of the actuators assembly and to accomplish up to 5 degrees of freedom (e.g., X, Y, Z, tip, tilt). The positioner is assumed to be used in free-space optical communication transceivers. However, the device is slow and is considered to compensate the disturbances of the laser beam propagation direction at low-frequency vibrations of mounts, building sway, etc. Additionally, the device has unwieldy and fragile structure.","Therefore, it has been determined that there are no compact lightweight devices for two-dimensional positioning or steering fiber optics in kHz frequency bandwidth having a displacement of distances of roughly 100 microns or more.","In view of the foregoing, an embodiment herein provides a device for the positioning of fiber optic output that includes a base having a hole disposed at a midpoint, a collar having an opening at a midpoint, at least two bimorph actuators where each actuator is connected to an outer side surface of the base and disposed at opposing ends, at least two flexible beams, each of the flexible beam having a first end connected to the collar and a second end connected to at least one of the bimorph actuators, a flexible tube inserted in the hole, where a bottom end of the tube is cantilevered at a bottom of the base and a top end of the tube is inserted in the opening of said collar, and a fiber optic embedded in the flexible tube.","Moreover, in such an embodiment, the device may further include a prism having first and second side surfaces and a bottom surface, the bottom surface contiguously contacting a top surface of the base and the first and second side surfaces located between each of the bimorph actuators to form gaps therebetween.","Additionally, a visco-elastic material may be embedded in the gaps.","Also, a visco-elastic material may be embedded in the hole of the base.","Moreover, each of the bimorph actuators may include at least two electro-active sheets having flat surfaces, conductive layers contiguously contacting each of the electro-active sheets, a conducting mechanism to provide an electrical signal to the conductive layers, wherein a bottom end of each of the bimorph actuators are connected to each of said side surfaces of said base and an upper end of each of said actuator moves in a first direction when a first electrical voltage is supplied to the conducting mechanism.","Further, at least one of the flexible beams may move in the first direction when the first electrical voltage is supplied to the conducting mechanism of the at least one of bimorph actuators and the flexible beams simultaneously moves in a second direction.","A top surface of the flexible tube may extends in a longitudinal direction located flush with a top surface of each of the flexible beams. The flexible tube may further be oriented perpendicular to the top surface of the base and may move in the first direction when the first electrical voltage is supplied to the conducting mechanism.","In addition, a top surface of the flexible tube may extend in a longitudinal direction, beyond a top surface of each of the flexible beams and is oriented perpendicular to the top surface of said base, and moves in the first direction when the first electrical voltage is supplied to the conducting mechanism.","A second electrical voltage may be supplied to the conducting mechanism of at least one of said bimorph actuators.","Further, each of the flexible beams and the collar may comprise any one of a metal and composite material.","Also, the electro-active sheets may comprise any one of piezoelectric crystal, piezoelectric ceramic, and electro-strictive material.","The flexible beams may be coupled to the collar using any one of screws, welding techniques, soldering techniques, glues and two-component expoxy glues.","Further, the opening of the collar may be circular having an internal diameter greater than or equal to the external diameter of the flexible tube.","Additionally, the said opening of the collar may have a rectangular-shaped cross section, the opening further having a pre-determined width and pre-determined length, whereby said pre-determined width may be equal to the external diameter the flexible tube, and the pre-determined length of the opening may forms an angle with at least one of the flexible beams.","The flexible tube may be bonded to the opening of the collar.","Moreover such an embodiment may includes a fiber optic positioner having a base having a hole disposed at a midpoint thereof, a collar having an opening at a midpoint thereof, a plurality of bimorph actuators, each actuator connected to an outer side surface of the base and disposed at opposing ends, at least two flexible beams, each of the flexible beams having a first end connected to the collar and a second end connected to at least one of the bimorph actuators, a flexible tube inserted in the hole, where a bottom end of the tube is cantilevered at a bottom of the base and a top end of the tube is inserted in the opening of the collar; and a fiber optic embedded in the flexible tube, and a prism having first and second side surfaces, a top surface, and a bottom surface, where the bottom surface contiguously contacts a top surface of the base and the first and second side surfaces are located between each of the bimorph actuators to form a gaps therebetween.","The gaps may be filled with any one of a viscous, elastic and viscous-elastic damping material to provide the damping of vibrations of said bimorph actuators at resonances.","Further, the gaps may be filled with plurality of damping materials.","The prism may further include channels formed between the top of the prism and the first and second surfaces.","The plurality of actuators may be equal to two three or four.","Further, the electrical voltages applied to said conductive mechanism of the bimorph actuators have amplitudes and polarities providing a predetermined magnitude and direction of displacement of an end of a fiber optic output.","The embodiments herein and the various features and advantageous details thereof are explained more fully with reference to the non-limiting embodiments that are illustrated in the accompanying drawings and detailed in the following description.

However, the alternate embodiments above cite examples are merely examples and as such, the present invention is not limited thereto.","Low frequency resonances of the cantilevered actuators attached to the base may be realized, and as such, these resonances must be suppressed. It has been determined found that the amplitude of the actuators tops deviation can sharply increase 20-50 times at the first resonance in comparison with the amplitude of the low-frequency deviations. For instance, at typical bimorph actuator having a length of about 15-20 mm, a first resonance at a frequency of about 1500 Hz was found. This means that the useful frequency bandwidth of the fiber optic positioner is restricted to about 500-1000 Hz. Further, sharp peaks in the frequency response must be suppressed to avoid the strong decrease of the sensitivity of the X and Y displacements in frequency intervals far from the resonant frequency.","In , the fiber optic positioner according to another embodiment herein including a prism for suppressing passive damping of low-order resonances is shown. Referring to , a rectangular prism  is shown attached to base , having a top surface , bottom surface , plurality of side surfaces , , and a gap . Base , includes a hole (not numbered) to receive a flexible tube . The bottom surface  of the prism  is attached to the top surface  of the base . It is to be appreciated that prism  and the base  can be fabricated from one piece of solid material. Examples of these materials can include but are not limited to: plexiglass, aluminum, and brass. The side surfaces  and  of the prism  are perpendicular to the top surface  and parallel to the internal surfaces of actuators  and . The gap  is disposed in a center of the prism  and is large enough to provide the free movement and motion of a flexible tube  during the X and Y displacements. The gaps between internal surfaces of the actuators  and  and respective side surfaces , of prism  may be pre-determined by end user specifications and are not limited to specific numbers or measurements. A visco-elastic material  and  is installed into these gaps and further into the hole of base  to among other things, to suppress vibrations of the flexible tube  as well as passive damping of low-order resonances. It has been determined the response amplitude at resonant frequencies can be reduced by 10-20 times whereas the response amplitude decreases only 3-4 times far from the resonance. That is, the Q-factor is significantly reduced from 20-50 to 2-3 strongly smoothing the resonance peak. Further, it has been determined that more uniform behavior of the frequency response of the fiber optic tip deviation and viewer suppression of the sensitivity from the resonance can be obtained if the gap between the internal surfaces of the actuators and side surfaces of the prism are not equidistant over the length of the actuators.","In , the fiber optic positioned according to another embodiment herein is shown having gaps between internal surfaces of the actuators  and  and side surfaces  and  of the base is shown.

The gap between the actuators and prism has a uniform width, but the forming of the viscous-elastic material is different if it is applied from bottom to top of the actuators. Further it has been determined that in order to obtain a more uniform frequency response of actuators the bottom part of the gap should be filled with viscous damping material having higher hardness than the hardness of the damping material in the upper level of the gap.","In , the design of the fiber optic positioned including a damping device according to another embodiment herein is shown where the damping material with different hardness is installed into the different areas of the gap thorough the channels in prism .

Damping material  and  having larger hardness is installed through these channels from the bottom level of the gap. Channels  and  connect the upper areas of the gap with the upper surface  of the prism. The damping material  and  with smaller hardness is installed through these channels to the upper level of the gap. It is to be appreciated that number of levels can be one or more, and thus, the present invention is not limited thereto. Further, such examples of the harder damping material may include various UV cured compounds or two-component silicones or poly-urethane materials, however, the present invention is not limited thereto. The filling of the gaps is accomplished when the UV cured compound or two-component viscous-elastic material has good enough fluidity to be installed throughout the channels , , , .","Referring to  a graphical representation of the typical dependence of the deviation interval of the fiber optic distal end is shown having a sine-wave voltage with amplitude +\/\u2212100V for non-damped and damped devices.","The foregoing description of the specific embodiments will so fully reveal the general nature of the embodiments herein that others can, by applying current knowledge, readily modify and\/or adapt for various applications such specific embodiments without departing from the generic concept, and, therefore, such adaptations and modifications should and are intended to be comprehended within the meaning and range of equivalents of the disclosed embodiments.
