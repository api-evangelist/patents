{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims priority to U.S. provisional application No. 60\/949,040, filed Jul. 11, 2007, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference.","This invention relates to methods and compositions for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension and related diseases and disorders.","Pulmonary hypertension (PH), or pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), is a disease characterized by increased pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance. 15ed., pp. 1506-1507 (McGraw-Hill, 2001). Left untreated, PH \u201cusually has a dismal prognosis culminating in right ventricular failure and death.\u201d Ulrich, S., et al., 137:73-82, 73 (2007).","In 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) sponsored the development of guidelines, called the \u201cVenice classification,\u201d which are now used to classify types of PH. http:\/\/www.tracleer.com\/default.asp?page=CouldHave_WHO (accessed Jun. 29, 2007). The first type, WHO Group 1.1, is idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH). This refers to PAH that occurs at random, without an apparent cause. IPAH used to be called \u201cprimary pulmonary hypertension\u201d or PPH. Id.","The second type, WHO Group 1.2, is familial pulmonary arterial hypertension (FPAH). With this type of PAH, a faulty gene is passed on through the family, which causes the PAH to develop over time. It is estimated that at least 6 to 10 percent of PAH cases occur in families where at least one other person has had the disease. Id.","The third type, WHO Group 1.3, is pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with other diseases or conditions (APAH). This used to be called \u201cPAH secondary to other conditions\u201d or Secondary PAH. This category includes PAH associated with collagen vascular disease or \u201cconnective tissue disease\u201d (e.g., scleroderma (SSc)-including CREST syndrome-lupus (SLE)), congenital systemic-to-pulmonary shunts (congenital heart disease), portal hypertension, HIV infection, drugs and toxins, and other diseases and disorders (e.g., thyroid disorders, glycogen storage diseases, Gaucher disease, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, hemoglobinopathies, myeloproliferative disorders, splenectomy). Id.","The fourth type, WHO Group 1.4, is pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with significant venous or capillary involvement, and includes pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) and pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis (PCH).","The fifth and final type, WHO Group 1.5, is persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn. Id.","Drugs currently used to treat PH include pulmonary vasodilators, calcium channel blockers, and inhibitors of platelet aggregation. 17ed., pp. 1703-4 (Merck Research Laboratories, 1999). Diuretics, nitric oxide, phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (e.g., sildenafil) and endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs) are also used for its treatment. Ulrich, S., et al., 137:73-82, 76-77 (2007). Endothelin receptor antagonists work by binding to the ETand\/or ETreceptor sites in the endothelium and vasculature smooth muscle, thereby preventing the neurohormone endothelin-1 (ET-1) from binding to these same receptor sites and triggering vasoconstriction. Id. at 76-77. An example of an ERA is bosentan (TRACLEER\u00ae).","Other methods of treating PH have been investigated. For example, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) reportedly reverse PH in rats. Id. at 79. These compounds, which are widely used to treat depression, affect the reuptake of the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT).","Serotonin is synthesized in two steps from the amino acid tryptophan. & 10ed., p. 270 (McGraw-Hill, 2001). The first step is rate-limiting, and is catalyzed by the enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), which has two known isoforms: TPH1, which is expressed in the periphery, and TPH2, which is expressed primarily in the brain. Walther, D. J., et al., 299:76 (2003). Mice genetically deficient for the tph1 gene (\u201cknockout mice\u201d) have been reported. In one case, the mice reportedly expressed normal amounts of serotonin in classical serotonergic brain regions, but largely lacked serotonin in the periphery. Id. In another, the knockout mice exhibited abnormal cardiac activity, which was attributed to a lack of peripheral serotonin. C\u00f4t\u00e9, F., et al., 100(23):13525-13530 (2003). Recently, TPH knockout mice were studied in a hypoxia-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension model. Morecroft, I., et al., Hypertension 49:232-236 (2007). The results of those studies suggest that TPH1 and peripheral serotonin \u201cplay an essential role in the development of hypoxia-induced elevations in pulmonary pressures and hypoxia-induced pulmonary vascular remodeling.\u201d Id. at 232.","This invention is directed, in part, to methods of treating pulmonary hypertension and related diseases and disorders, which comprise administering to a patient therapeutically effective amounts of a tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) inhibitor and at least one other active pharmaceutical ingredient.","One embodiment encompasses a method of treating, managing or preventing pulmonary hypertension, which comprises administering to a patient in need thereof therapeutically or prophylactically effective amounts of an endothelin receptor antagonist and a tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor.","Another encompasses a method of treating, managing or preventing pulmonary hypertension, which comprises administering to a patient in need thereof therapeutically or prophylactically effective amounts of an anticoagulant and a tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor.","Another encompasses a method of treating, managing or preventing pulmonary hypertension, which comprises administering to a patient in need thereof therapeutically or prophylactically effective amounts of a calcium channel blocker and a tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor.","Another encompasses a method of treating, managing or preventing pulmonary hypertension, which comprises administering to a patient in need thereof therapeutically or prophylactically effective amounts of a prostacyclin and a tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor.","Another encompasses a method of treating, managing or preventing pulmonary hypertension, which comprises administering to a patient in need thereof therapeutically or prophylactically effective amounts of nitric oxide or a nitric oxide precursor or releasing compound, and a tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor.","Another encompasses a method of treating, managing or preventing pulmonary hypertension, which comprises administering to a patient in need thereof therapeutically or prophylactically effective amounts of a phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor and a tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor.","Another encompasses a method of treating, managing or preventing pulmonary hypertension, which comprises administering to a patient in need thereof therapeutically or prophylactically effective amounts of a diuretic and a tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor.","Another encompasses a method of treating, managing or preventing pulmonary hypertension, which comprises administering to a patient in need thereof therapeutically or prophylactically effective amounts of a platelet derived growth factor and a tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor.","The invention also encompasses pharmaceutical formulations (e.g., single unit dosage forms) comprising a TPH inhibitor and at least one other active pharmaceutical ingredient.","This invention is based, in part, on studies of tph1 knockout mice and the discovery of compounds that inhibit tryptophan hydroxylase (e.g., TPH1).","Unless otherwise indicated, the term \u201calkenyl\u201d means a straight chain, branched and\/or cyclic hydrocarbon having from 2 to 20 (e.g., 2 to 10 or 2 to 6) carbon atoms, and including at least one carbon-carbon double bond.

For example, the terms \u201cpyridine\u201d and \u201cpyridyl\u201d are accorded the same meaning when used to describe a moiety attached to other chemical moieties. Thus, the two phrases \u201cXOH, wherein X is pyridyl\u201d and \u201cXOH, wherein X is pyridine\u201d are accorded the same meaning, and encompass the compounds pyridin-2-ol, pyridin-3-ol and pyridin-4-ol.","It should also be noted that if the stereochemistry of a structure or a portion of a structure is not indicated with, for example, bold or dashed lines, the structure or the portion of the structure is to be interpreted as encompassing all stereoisomers of it. Similarly, names of compounds having one or more chiral centers that do not specify the stereochemistry of those centers encompass pure stereoisomers and mixtures thereof. Moreover, any atom shown in a drawing with unsatisfied valences is assumed to be attached to enough hydrogen atoms to satisfy the valences.

For example, an inhibitor can be titrated until the severity of a serotonin-mediated adverse effect diminishes. Alternatively, blood 5-HT levels can be directly measured and correlated to the amount of TPH inhibitor administered.","This invention encompasses pharmaceutical compositions comprising a TPH inhibitor (e.g., a potent TPH1 inhibitor) and at least one other active pharmaceutical ingredient that can affect vasodilation or vasoconstriction. Examples of such other active pharmaceutical ingredients include those described herein, as well as other known by those skilled in the art.","Certain pharmaceutical compositions are single unit dosage forms suitable for oral, mucosal (e.g., nasal, sublingual, vaginal, buccal, or rectal), parenteral (e.g., subcutaneous, intravenous, bolus injection, intramuscular, or intraarterial), or transdermal administration to a patient. Examples of dosage forms include, but are not limited to: tablets; caplets; capsules, such as soft elastic gelatin capsules; cachets; troches; lozenges; dispersions; suppositories; ointments; cataplasms (poultices); pastes; powders; dressings; creams; plasters; solutions; patches; aerosols (e.g., nasal sprays or inhalers); gels; liquid dosage forms suitable for oral or mucosal administration to a patient, including suspensions (e.g., aqueous or non-aqueous liquid suspensions, oil-in-water emulsions, or a water-in-oil liquid emulsions), solutions, and elixirs; liquid dosage forms suitable for parenteral administration to a patient; and sterile solids (e.g., crystalline or amorphous solids) that can be reconstituted to provide liquid dosage forms suitable for parenteral administration to a patient.","The formulation should suit the mode of administration. For example, the oral administration of a compound susceptible to degradation in the stomach may be achieved using an enteric coating. Similarly, a formulation may contain ingredients that facilitate delivery of the active ingredient(s) to the site of action. For example, compounds may be administered in liposomal formulations in order to protect them from degradative enzymes, facilitate transport in circulatory system, and effect their delivery across cell membranes.","Similarly, poorly soluble compounds may be incorporated into liquid dosage forms (and dosage forms suitable for reconstitution) with the aid of solubilizing agents, emulsifiers and surfactants such as, but not limited to, cyclodextrins (e.g., \u03b1-cyclodextrin, \u03b2-cyclodextrin, Captisol\u00ae, and Encapsin\u2122 (see, e.g., Davis and Brewster, 3:1023-1034 (2004)), Labrasol\u00ae, Labrafil\u00ae, Labrafac\u00ae, cremafor, and non-aqueous solvents, such as, but not limited to, ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethyl formamide, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), biocompatible oils (e.g., cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor, and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols, fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof (e.g., DMSO: cornoil).","Poorly soluble compounds may also be incorporated into suspensions using other techniques known in the art. For example, nanoparticles of a compound may be suspended in a liquid to provide a nanosuspension (see, e.g., Rabinow, 3:785-796 (2004)). Nanoparticle forms of compounds described herein may be prepared by the methods described in U.S. Patent Publication Nos. 2004-0164194, 2004-0195413, 2004-0251332, 2005-0042177 A1, 2005-0031691 A1, and U.S. Pat.

In one embodiment, the nanoparticle form comprises particles having an average particle size of less than about 2000 nm, less than about 1000 nm, or less than about 500 nm.","The composition, shape, and type of a dosage form will typically vary depending with use. For example, a dosage form used in the acute treatment of a disease may contain larger amounts of one or more of the active ingredients it comprises than a dosage form used in the chronic treatment of the same disease. Similarly, a parenteral dosage form may contain smaller amounts of one or more of the active ingredients it comprises than an oral dosage form used to treat the same disease. How to account for such differences will be apparent to those skilled in the art. See, e.g., 18th ed., Mack Publishing, Easton Pa. (1990).","5.5.1. Oral Dosage Forms","Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention suitable for oral administration can be presented as discrete dosage forms, such as, but are not limited to, tablets (e.g., chewable tablets), caplets, capsules, and liquids (e.g., flavored syrups). Such dosage forms contain predetermined amounts of active ingredients, and may be prepared by methods of pharmacy well known to those skilled in the art. See generally, 18th ed., Mack Publishing, Easton Pa. (1990).","Typical oral dosage forms are prepared by combining the active ingredient(s) in an intimate admixture with at least one excipient according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. Excipients can take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration.","Because of their ease of administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit forms. If desired, tablets can be coated by standard aqueous or non-aqueous techniques. Such dosage forms can be prepared by conventional methods of pharmacy. In general, pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms are prepared by uniformly and intimately admixing the active ingredients with liquid carriers, finely divided solid carriers, or both, and then shaping the product into the desired presentation if necessary. Disintegrants may be incorporated in solid dosage forms to facility rapid dissolution. Lubricants may also be incorporated to facilitate the manufacture of dosage forms (e.g., tablets).","5.5.2. Parenteral Dosage Forms","Parenteral dosage forms can be administered to patients by various routes including subcutaneous, intravenous (including bolus injection), intramuscular, and intraarterial. Because their administration typically bypasses patients' natural defenses against contaminants, parenteral dosage forms are specifically sterile or capable of being sterilized prior to administration to a patient. Examples of parenteral dosage forms include solutions ready for injection, dry products ready to be dissolved or suspended in a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle for injection, suspensions ready for injection, and emulsions.","Suitable vehicles that can be used to provide parenteral dosage forms of the invention are well known to those skilled in the art. Examples include: Water for Injection USP; aqueous vehicles such as Sodium Chloride Injection, Ringer's Injection, Dextrose Injection, Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection, and Lactated Ringer's Injection; water-miscible vehicles such as ethyl alcohol, polyethylene glycol, and polypropylene glycol; and non-aqueous vehicles such as corn oil, cottonseed oil, peanut oil, sesame oil, ethyl oleate, isopropyl myristate, and benzyl benzoate.","Exon 3 of the murine TPH1 gene was removed by gene targeting essentially as described by Wattler et al., 26(6):1150-6 (1999). The resulting knockout animals displayed normal TPH activity in the brain but drastically reduced TPH expression in the gut.","Mice homozygous (\u2212\/\u2212) for the disruption of tph1 were studied in conjunction with mice heterozygous (+\/\u2212) for the disruption of the gene, along with wild-type (+\/+) litter mates. During this analysis, the mice were subject to a medical work-up using an integrated suite of medical diagnostic procedures designed to assess the function of the major organ systems in a mammalian subject. By studying the homozygous (\u2212\/\u2212) knockout mice in the described numbers and in conjunction with heterozygous (+\/\u2212) and wild-type (+\/+) litter mates, more reliable and repeatable data was obtained.","Disruption of tph1 gene primarily affected the GI tract isoform of TPH (TPH1), and had little or no effect on the brain isoform of TPH (TPH2). Disruption of the gene caused no measurable adverse effects on the central nervous system. This was confirmed by serotonin immunochemistry, which showed that serotonin was greatly reduced or absent in the stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum and colon, while serotonin levels were unaffected in raphe neurons.","Mice homozygous (\u2212\/\u2212) for the disruption of the tph1 gene had a decrease in thrombosis without a significant increase in bleeding or other adverse indications.","In some of the following synthetic examples, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) retention times are provided.

using genes having the following accession numbers, respectively: X52836, AY098914, X05290, and U49897.","The full-length coding sequence of human TPH1 was cloned into the bacterial expression vector pET24 (Novagen, Madison, Wis., USA). A single colony of BL21(DE3) cells harboring the expression vector was inoculated into 50 ml of L broth (LB)-kanamycin media and grown up at 37\u00b0 C. overnight with shaking. Half of the culture (25 ml) was then transferred into 3 L of media containing 1.5% yeast extract, 2% Bacto Peptone, 0.1 mM tryptophan, 0.1 mM ferrous ammonium sulfate, and 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), and grown to OD=6 at 37\u00b0 C. with oxygen supplemented at 40%, pH maintained at 7.0, and glucose added. Expression of TPH1 was induced with 15% D-lactose over a period of 10 hours at 25\u00b0 C. The cells were spun down and washed once with phosphate buffered saline (PBS).","TPH1 was purified by affinity chromatography based on its binding to pterin. The cell pellet was resuspended in a lysis buffer (100 ml\/20 g) containing 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 0.5 M NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20, 2 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, Ind., USA) and 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and the cells were lyzed with a microfluidizer. The lysate was centrifuged and the supernatant was loaded onto a pterin-coupled sepharose 4B column that was equilibrated with a buffer containing 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 2 M NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20, 0.5 mM EDTA, and 2 mM DTT.

Eluted enzyme was immediately neutralized with 200 mM KHPO, pH 7.0, 0.5 M NaCl, 20 mM DTT, 0.5 mM EDTA, and 10% glycerol, and stored at \u221280\u00b0 C.","Human tryptophan hydroxylase type II (TPH2), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) were expressed and purified essentially in the same way, except the cells were supplemented with tyrosine for TH and phenylalanine for PAH during growth.","TPH1 and TPH2 activities were measured in a reaction mixture containing 50 mM 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid (MOPS), pH 7.0, 60 \u03bcM tryptophan, 100 mM ammonium sulfate, 100 \u03bcM ferrous ammonium sulfate, 0.5 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP), 0.3 mM 6-methyl tetrahydropterin, 0.05 mg\/ml catalase, and 0.9 mM DTT. The reactions were initiated by adding TPH1 to a final concentration of 7.5 nM.

The mixtures were then filtered through activated charcoal and the radioactivity in the filtrate was determined by scintillation counting. Activities of compounds on TH and PAH were determined using this assay and calculated in the same way as on TPH1 and TPH2.","Two types of cell lines were used for screening: RBL2H3 is a rat mastocytoma cell line, which contains TPH1 and makes 5-hydroxytrypotamine (5HT) spontaneously; BON is a human carcinoid cell line, which contains TPH1 and makes 5-hydroxytryptophan (5HTP). The CBAs were performed in 96-well plate format. The mobile phase used in HPLC contained 97% of 100 mM sodium acetate, pH 3.5 and 3% acetonitrile. A Waters C18 column (4.6\u00d750 mm) was used with Waters HPLC (model 2795). A multi-channel fluorometer (model 2475) was used to monitor the flow through by setting at 280 nm as the excitation wavelength and 360 nm as the emission wavelength.","RBL CBA: Cells were grown in complete media (containing 5% bovine serum) for 3-4 hours to allow cells to attach to plate wells (7K cell\/well). Compounds were then added to each well in the concentration range of 0.016 \u03bcM to 11.36 \u03bcM. The controls were cells in complete media without any compound present. Cells were harvested after 3 days of incubation at 37\u00b0 C. Cells were >95% confluent without compound present. Media were removed from plate and cells were lysed with equal volume of 0.1 N NaOH. A large portion of the cell lysate was treated by mixing with equal volume of 1M TCA and then filtered through glass fiber. The filtrates were loaded on reverse phase HPLC for analyzing 5HT concentrations. A small portion of the cell lysate was also taken to measure protein concentration of the cells that reflects the cytotoxicity of the compounds at the concentration used. The protein concentration was measured by using BCA method.","The average of 5HT level in cells without compound treated was used as the maximum value in the ICderivation according to the equation provided above. The minimum value of 5HT is either set at 0 or from cells that treated with the highest concentration of compound If a compound is not cytotoxic at that concentration.","BON CBA: Cells were grown in equal volume of DMEM and F12K with 5% bovine serum for 3-4 hours (20K cell\/well) and compound was added at a concentration range of 0.07 \u03bcM to 50 \u03bcM. The cells were incubated at 37\u00b0 C. overnight. Fifty \u03bcM of the culture supernatant was then taken for 5HTP measurement. The supernatant was mixed with equal volume of 1M TCA, then filtered through glass fiber. The filtrate was loaded on reverse phase HPLC for 5HTP concentration measurement. The cell viability was measured by treating the remaining cells with Promega Celltiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay. The compound potency was then calculated in the same way as in the RBL CBA.","The in vivo effects of a potent TPH1 inhibitor of the invention were evaluated in several studies by determining the change of 5-HT levels in the intestines and brains of mice following oral administration of the compound.","The compound was formulated in different vehicles to provide either a suspension or solution. Generally, 14-week-old male C57 albino mice were dosed once daily by oral gavage at 5 ml\/kg for four consecutive days. Five hours after the last dose, the animals were quickly sacrificed. Various regions of the intestinal tract and whole brain were taken and frozen immediately. 5-HT was extracted from the tissues and measured by HPLC. Blood samples were taken for exposure analysis.","The potent TPH1 inhibitor was found to reduce 5-HT levels in both the small and large intestine, but not in the brain. In one study, the compound was formulated in HO and administered to mice at four different dose levels: 15, 50, 150, and 500 mg\/kg, once daily by oral gavage. As shown in , the compound caused significant reduction of 5-HT in the jejunum and ileum in a dose-dependent fashion. In the colon, statistically significant reduction of 5-HT was seen at the 50, 150, and 500 mg\/kg\/day dose levels. No significant change of 5-HT levels was observed in the brain at any of the dose levels.","All publications (e.g., patents and patent applications) cited above are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["1.
