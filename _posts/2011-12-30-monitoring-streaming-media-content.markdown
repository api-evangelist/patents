{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This patent claims priority from U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61\/499,520, entitled \u201cMonitoring Streaming Media Content,\u201d which was filed on Jun. 21, 2011. This patent also claims priority from U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61\/568,631, entitled \u201cMonitoring Streaming Media Content,\u201d which was filed on Dec. 8, 2011. U.S. Provisional Application Ser. Nos. 61\/499,520 and 61\/568,631 are hereby incorporated by reference in their respective entireties.","This disclosure relates generally to content monitoring and, more particularly, to monitoring streaming media content.","Streaming enables media content to be delivered to and presented by a wide variety of content presentation devices, such as desktop computers, laptop computers, tablet computers, personal digital assistants, smartphones, etc. Because a significant portion of media content is presented via streaming to such devices, monitoring of streaming media content, like the monitoring of broadcasted media content, can provide valuable information to advertisers, content providers, and the like.","Methods, apparatus and articles of manufacture to monitor streaming media content are disclosed herein. An example method disclosed herein to monitor streaming media content includes decoding a transport stream carrying media content being streamed to a content presentation device to obtain the media content. The example method also includes extracting metering data having a first format from the media content, the metering data identifying at least one of the media content or a source of the media content. The example method further includes transcoding the extracted metering data to form metering data (e.g., metering metadata) having a second format decodable by a meter executed by the content presentation device.","In some examples, the method additionally includes combining extracted metering data or otherwise collected metering data that is dependent on (e.g., that accompanies) the streaming media content (e.g., metering data from a provider of the media content) with metering data to be associated with the streaming media content, but provided independently of the streaming media content (e.g. metering data from an independent metering data source). In some such examples, the extracted metering data is combined with metering data from an independent metering data source, which is then transcoded to form the metering metadata. In some examples, the independent metering data source determines a timestamp from a clock source and determines an identifier for the streaming media content from a data source communicatively coupled to the independent metering data source (e.g., a configuration file). In some examples, the metering data from the independent metering data source and the extracted metering data are redundant, are identical, or are similar. In some examples, the method includes inserting, by the independent metering data source, a tag or other identifying mark within the extracted metering data to identify the independently provided metering data. In some examples, a delimiter (e.g., a text character, such as a \u201c|\u201d character, or some other sign or indicator) is inserted between the extracted metering data and the metering data from the independent metering data source.","In some examples, the method additionally includes encoding the transcoded metering data (e.g., the extracted metering data or the combined metering data after transcoding) into a metadata channel associated with (e.g., that accompanies or flows with) the transport stream, and sending the transport stream and the metadata channel to the content presentation device. In some examples, the method then includes receiving the transport stream and the metadata channel at the content presentation device, detecting the metering data in the metadata channel using the meter executed by the content presentation device, and reporting the metering data to a media monitoring facility.","In some examples, the metadata channel corresponds to at least one of an external metadata channel external to the transport stream carrying the media content, or an internal metadata channel comprising one or more data fields of the transport stream carrying the media content. An example of an external metadata channel includes an M3U file or other data file encoded to contain the metering metadata, and which is associated with the transport stream that is to be sent to the content presentation device.","In some examples, the transport stream corresponds to a Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) 2 transport stream sent according to a hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) live streaming protocol. In some examples, the metering data having the first format (which is extracted from the media content decoded from the transport stream) can include an audio watermark that is embedded in an audio portion of the media content. Additionally or alternatively, the metering data having the first format (which is extracted from the media content decoded from the transport stream) can include a video (e.g., image) watermark that is embedded in a video portion of the media content. In some examples, the metering metadata having the second format into which the extracted metering data is transcoded corresponds to metadata represented in a text format, such as a text format for inclusion in an M3U file.","Another example method disclosed herein to monitor streaming media content includes decoding a transport stream carrying media content being streamed to a content presentation device to obtain the media content. The example method also includes extracting metering data from the media content and\/or receiving metering data from an independent metering data source, the metering data identifying at least one of the media content or a source of the media content. Additionally, the example method further includes decoding content identifying metadata (e.g., such as electronic guide data, playlist data, etc.) already accompanying the transport stream carrying the media content. The example method further includes verifying the content identifying metadata using the metering data extracted from the media content.","In some examples, the method additionally includes reporting the results of verifying the content identifying metadata using the metering data extracted from the media content to a media monitoring facility to enable validation of content identifying metadata reported separately by a meter executed by the content presentation device. For example, the meter executed by the content presentation device can also detect the content identifying metadata accompanying the transport stream providing the streaming media content to the content presentation device. The meter can then report this content identifying metadata to the media monitoring facility, which validates the accuracy of the content identifying metadata based on the reported results of previously verifying the content identifying metadata using the metering data extracted from the media content. As noted above, in some examples, the metering data that is extracted from the media content decoded from the transport stream can include an audio watermark that is embedded in an audio portion of the media content. Additionally or alternatively, the metering data that is extracted from the media content decoded from the transport stream can include a video (e.g., image) watermark that is embedded in a video portion of the media content. Additionally or alternatively, the method can include reporting metering data received from an independent metering data source.","Yet another example method disclosed herein to monitor streaming media content includes storing media content (which is to be streamed to a content presentation device) in a temporary storage prior to streaming the media content to the content presentation device. The example method also includes retrieving the media content from the temporary storage, and extracting metering data from the media content (e.g., such as audio\/video watermark(s) embedded in the media content), the metering data identifying at least one of the media content or a source of the media content. The method can also include combining the extracted metering data with metering data from an independent metering data source. The example method further includes reporting the metering data to a media monitoring facility.","Prior techniques for monitoring broadcast media content can involve extracting metering data, such as audio and\/or video watermarks, from a monitored media content presentation. In the context of streaming media content, digital rights management may prevent access to the streamed media content by applications, such as a device meter, other than the media content player(s) employed by the content presentation device. Monitoring of streaming media content in accordance with examples described herein enables a device meter executed by the content presentation device to detect metering metadata identifying the streaming media content that was transcoded from a first format not decodable by the device meter (e.g., such as a first format corresponding to an audio watermark or a video watermark embedded in the media content, which is inaccessible to the device meter due to digital rights management) to a second format that is decodable by the device meter (e.g., such as a second format corresponding to a text format included in an file sent via a metadata channel accompanying the streaming media content.) Additionally or alternatively, monitoring of streaming media content in accordance with examples described herein enables content identifying metadata already accompanying the streaming media content, and decodable by the device meter without transcoding, to be validated using metering data (e.g., such as audio and\/or video watermarks) extracted from the media content. While examples disclosed herein are described in the context of monitoring streaming media content, example methods and apparatus disclosed herein may be applied to monitoring non-streaming media content.","Turning to the figures, a block diagram of a first example system  for monitoring streaming media content is illustrated in . The example system  includes a first example server meter , a first example device meter  and a first example media monitoring facility  to monitor media content that is streamed to an example content presentation device . In the illustrated example, the system  includes example compression gear , an example segmenter and packager , an example digital rights manager  and an example content streamer  to provide the streaming media content, which is provided by example content provider(s) , to the content presentation device . The example system  further includes an example network  via which media content can be streamed by the content streamer  to the content presentation device , and via which the device meter  can report metering data to the media monitoring facility .","The content provider(s)  of the illustrated example correspond to any one or more content providers capable of providing media content for streaming to the content presentation device . The media content provided by the content provider(s)  can be any type of media content, such as audio content, video content, multimedia content, etc. Additionally, the media content can correspond to live (e.g., broadcast) media content, stored media content (e.g., on-demand content), etc.","The compression gear  employs any appropriate technique(s) to compress and\/or otherwise process the received media content into a form suitable for streaming. For example, the compression gear  may compress the media content in accordance with MPEG 4 audio\/video compression. The segmenter and packager  employs any appropriate technique(s) to segment and package the compressed media content into a form suitable for streaming. For example, the segmenter and packager  can segment and package the compressed media content into one or more MPEG 2 transport streams for streaming to the content presentation device  via the network  using HTTP live streaming (HLS) or any other past, present and\/or future, streaming protocol. The digital rights manager  encrypts and\/or otherwise protects, in accordance with any appropriate digital rights management technique and\/or protocol, the media content to be streamed. The content streamer  employs any appropriate technique(s) to select and stream the media content to a requesting device, such as the content presentation device . For example, the content streamer  can select media content that has been MPEG 4 compressed, segmented and packaged into one or more MPEG 2 transport streams, and encrypted for digital rights management, and then stream the content to the content presentation device  via the network  using HLS or any other streaming protocol.","In some examples, the compression gear , the segmenter and packager  and\/or the digital rights manager  prepare content for streaming regardless of whether (e.g., prior to) a request is received from the content presentation device . In such an example, the content streamer  prepares a transport stream for streaming the already-prepared content to the content presentation device  when a request is received from the content presentation device . In other examples, the compression gear , the segmenter and packager  and\/or the digital rights manager  prepare the content for streaming in response to a request received from the content presentation device .","The content presentation device  of the illustrated example is a computing device that is capable of presenting streaming media content provided by the content streamer  via the network . The content presentation device  may be, for example, a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a mobile computing device, a television, a smart phone, a mobile phone, an Apple\u00ae iPad\u00ae, an Apple\u00ae iPhone\u00ae, an Apple\u00ae iPod\u00ae, an Android\u2122 powered computing device, a Palm\u00ae webOS\u00ae computing device, etc. In some examples, the content presentation device  includes one or more executable media players to present the streaming media content provided by the content streamer . For examples, the media player(s) available to the content presentation device  may be implemented in Adobe\u00ae Flash\u00ae (e.g., provided in a SWF file), may be implemented in hypertext markup language (HTML) version 5 (HTML5), may be implemented in Google\u00ae Chromium\u00ae, may be implemented according to the Open Source Media Framework (OSMF), may be implemented according to a device or operating system provider's media player application programming interface (API), may be implemented on a device or operating system provider's media player framework (e.g., the Apple\u00ae iOS\u00ae MPMoviePlayer software), etc., or any combination thereof. While a single content presentation device  is illustrated, any number and\/or type(s) of content presentation devices may be included in the system .","The network  of the illustrated example is the Internet. Additionally or alternatively, any other network(s) linking the content streamer , the content presentation device , the device meter  and\/or the media monitoring facility  may be used. The network  may comprise any number of public and\/or private networks using any type(s) of networking protocol(s).","As noted above, media content provided by the content provider(s)  may include metering data, such as embedded audio and\/or video watermarks, that identifies and\/or is otherwise associated with the media content. However, such metering data may not be accessible by and, thus, may not be decodable by a device meter at the content presentation device . For example, the media content and, by extension, the audio and\/or video watermarks embedded therein may be accessible only to an appropriate media player, and not a device meter or other application, due to the digital rights management techniques employed by the digital rights manager . To enable the device meter  to have access to and be able to decode metering data identifying and\/or otherwise associated with streaming media content provided to the content presentation device , the system  of the illustrated example includes the server meter . In some examples, the server meter  is implemented as a plug-in or other application\/device associated with or executed by one or more of the compression gear , the segmenter and packager , the digital rights manager  and\/or the content streamer . In some examples, the server meter  is implemented by an apparatus separate from the compression gear , the segmenter and packager , the digital rights manager  and the content streamer .","In the illustrated example, the server meter  obtains, from the media content, metering data that is in a first format. In some examples the server meter  may also collect metering data from one or more independent metering data sources. The metering data from the independent metering data sources may be in the first format or any other format(s). The server meter  then transcodes the obtained metering data (e.g., the extracted metering data and\/or the metering data from the independent metering data source) to form metering metadata that is in a second format accessible and decodable by the device meter . The metering data identifies the media content, identifies a source of the media content, and\/or otherwise describes and\/or is associated with the media content. For example, the server meter  can obtain embedded audio\/video watermarks that correspond to metering data having a first format and\/or the server meter  can obtain metering data from an independent metering data source. Then, the server meter  transcodes this metering data into text data, binary data, etc., that corresponds to metering metadata in a second format. The server meter  then encodes the transcoded metering metadata (which is in the second format that is decodable by the device meter  executed by or otherwise associated with the content presentation device ) into a metadata channel associated with the transport stream(s) that is(are) to carry the streaming media content to the presentation device . In some examples, the server meter  is implemented as a plug-in based on a software development kit (SDK) provided by the entity that embedded the audio\/video watermarks in the media content. In such examples, the server meter  can employ functionality provided by the SDK to extract and decode audio\/video watermark(s) embedded in the media content to obtain the payload data carried by the watermark(s). In some examples, in accordance with one or more versions of the ID3 tagging standards, the server meter  then inserts the payload data obtained from the watermark(s) as ID3 tag metadata and\/or other metadata in the transport stream(s) that is (are) to stream the media content in accordance with the HLS or other appropriate streaming protocol. Another example implementation of the server meter  is illustrated in , which is described in greater detail below.","The server meter  can also employ functionality provided by the SDK to collect metering data from an independent metering data source (e.g. such as by receiving data from an internal clock, receiving content identification information from a user input, receiving content identification information from a file, or another source that is independent of the provider of the media content). An example implementation of the server meter  that includes an independent metering data source is described in conjunction with .","The system  also includes the device meter  to monitor streaming media content provided to and\/or presented by the content presentation device . In the illustrated example, the device meter  is executed by the content presentation device . In some examples, the device meter  may be implemented as a plug-in that is connected to a plug-in interface of a media player executed by the content presentation device . In some examples, the device meter  may be implemented as one or more instructions that are incorporated in a media player executed by the content presentation device . In some examples, the device meter  may be implemented as an executable application that is downloaded to the content presentation device  (e.g., downloaded as an App from the Apple\u00ae App Store.) In some examples, the device meter  is implemented by an apparatus separate from the content presentation device , but that is able to access metadata (e.g., via one or more digital interfaces, data ports, etc., of the content presentation device ) associated with streaming media content received by the content presentation device .","The device meter  of the illustrated example decodes metering metadata included in a metadata channel (or channels) associated with (e.g., provided prior to or accompanying and flowing with) the transport channel(s) providing the streaming media content to the content presentation device . For example, a metadata channel decoded by the device meter  can correspond to an external metadata channel external to the transport stream carrying the media content, or an internal metadata channel comprising one or more data fields of the transport stream carrying the media content. An example external metadata channel includes an M3U file or other text file associated with a transport stream carrying the streaming media content and containing metering metadata transcoded by the server meter  into a text or other appropriate data format. In some examples, such as an example employing the HLS protocol, the device meter  extracts and decodes ID3 tag(s) that contain the metering metadata. The device meter  of the illustrated example stores the decoded metering metadata (as well as any other metering information captured by the device meter, timestamps added by the device meter  to the decoded metering metadata and\/or the other metering information, etc.) for reporting to the media monitoring facility . In the illustrated example, the device meter  reports its stored metering metadata (as well as any other metering information, timestamps, etc.) using an HTTP request sent to an HTTP interface of the media monitoring facility . An example implementation of the device meter  is illustrated in , which is described in greater detail below.","The media monitoring facility  includes an interface to receive reported metering information (e.g., metering metadata) received from the device meter  via the network . In the illustrated example, the media monitoring facility  includes an HTTP interface to receive HTTP requests that include metering information. Alternatively, any other method(s) to receive metering information may be used. In the illustrated example, the media monitoring facility  stores and analyzes metering information received from a plurality of different content presentation devices . For example, the media monitoring facility  may group metering information by content provider  (e.g., group all metering data associated with a particular content provider ). The media monitoring facility  may also analyze the metering information to eliminate erroneous information. For example, the media monitoring facility  may compare two types of identifying information received for the same media content (e.g., by comparing content identifying metadata already accompanying the streaming media content with metering data and\/or metadata determined by the device meter  and\/or server meter ) to identify discrepancies, may eliminate metering information containing discrepancies, and\/or may mark certain identifying information as erroneous to be excluded from metering information received at a later time. Any other processing of metering information may additionally or alternatively be performed.","In some examples, the reported metering information includes metering data that was obtained by a dependent metering data source and an independent metering data source. Dependent metering data sources include, for example, sources of metering data obtained from, associated with or otherwise dependent on the media content and\/or transport stream(s) providing the media content. For example, a dependent metering data source can include metering data extracted from a watermark payload of the streaming media content. In contrast, independent metering data sources include, for example, sources of metering data obtained independently from the media content and\/or transport stream(s) providing the media content, but which can nevertheless be descriptive of the media content. For example, an independent metering data source can include redundant metering data, such as metering data that is the same as the metering data obtained from the dependent metering data source, metering data that is similar to the metering data obtained from the dependent metering data source, etc., but that was obtained by an independent metering data source (e.g., such as a source identifier that is stored in a configuration file at the server meter ). In such examples, the media monitoring facility  may utilize the redundant metering data to verify the metering data from the dependent metering data source. Example metadata with redundant metering data obtained from an independent metering data source is described in conjunction with . In some examples, the media monitoring facility  may store and analyze both the redundant metering data and the metering data from the dependent metering data source. In some examples, the media monitoring facility  can store and\/or analyze the redundant metering data when the metering data from the dependent metering data source is unreadable by the media monitoring facility . For example, the metering data from the dependent metering data source may fail an error check, be blank, or be null when an audio\/video watermark is not able to be extracted from the streaming media content by the server meter  (e.g., an audio watermark may be unavailable during a silent portion of the streaming media content). Example metadata with unreadable metering data from a dependent metering data source is described in conjunction with .","The media monitoring facility  of the illustrated example also analyzes the received metering information reported by the content presentation device(s)  to generate reports concerning the presentation of media content. For example, the media monitoring facility  may generate reports indicating the number of times that media content was accessed, demographics for users that accessed the media content, interactions of users with the media content (e.g., fast-forwarding, pausing, etc.), the duration of accesses of the media content, etc. The media monitoring facility  may, for example, provide a webpage interface through which interested parties can generate custom reports or otherwise access the metering information (e.g., for a fee or part of a subscription service). For example, the media monitoring facility  may generate reports for a particular content provider , for advertisers that distribute advertisements via the content provider(s) , for competitors of the content provider(s) , etc. An example implementation of the media monitoring facility  is illustrated in , which is described in greater detail below.","A block diagram of an example implementation of the example server meter  of  is illustrated in . The example server meter  of  includes an example transport stream decoder  to decode transport stream(s) carrying streaming media content to obtain the media content being streamed to the content presentation device . For example, the transport stream decoder  can decode an MPEG 2 transport  encapsulating MPEG 4 compressed media content to obtain the encapsulated MPEG 4 content, and then perform MPEG 4 decompression to obtain the uncompressed audio\/video content.","The example server meter  of  also includes an example metering data extractor  to extract metering data having a first format from the uncompressed media content obtained from the transport stream decoder . For example, the metering data extractor  can implement functionality provided by an SDK to extract one or more audio watermarks, one or more video (e.g., image) watermarks, etc., embedded in the uncompressed audio\/video content obtained from the transport stream decoder . (For example, the uncompressed audio\/video content may correspond to uncompressed pulse code modulation (PCM) audio data or other types of audio data, uncompressed video\/image data, etc.) To transcode the metering data in the first format obtained from the metering data extractor  to a second format decodable by the device meter , the example server meter  of  further includes an example metering data transcoder . For example, the metering data transcoder  can determine (e.g., decode) the metering information (e.g., the watermark payload data, such as content identifying information, source identifying information, etc.) carried by a watermark extracted by the metering data extractor  and convert this metering information (also referred to as watermark payload data) into a text or binary format for inclusion in an M3U8 file or other data (e.g., text, binary, etc.) file for transmission as metadata (e.g., such as with a playlist or electronic program guide) accompanying the streaming media content. Additionally or alternatively, the metering data transcoder  can convert the extracted metering information (i.e., watermark payload data) into a binary or other appropriate format for inclusion in one or more data fields capable of carrying metadata in the transport stream(s) providing the streaming media content to the content presentation device . For example, the metering data transcoder  can convert watermark payload data corresponding to the metering information to ID3 tag metadata for insertion in the transport stream(s) that is (are) to stream the media content in accordance with the HLS or other appropriate streaming protocol. Other additional or alternative examples of transcoding that can be employed by the metering data transcoder  to transcode metering data into a format decodable by the device meter  are described in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 7,827,312 (\u201cMETHODS AND APPARATUS FOR TRANSCODING METADATA\u201d to Ramaswamy et al.), which issued on Nov. 2, 2010, and U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61\/442,758 (\u201cMETHODS AND APPARATUS TO MONITOR MEDIA CONTENT AT A CONTENT DISPLAY SITE\u201d to Deliyannis et al.), which was filed on Feb. 14, 2011. U.S. Pat. No. 7,827,312 and U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61\/442,758 are hereby incorporated by reference in their respective entireties. In some examples, the metering data extractor  may be replaced by or include one or more of the elements of , which enables the server meter  to operate in accordance with the system described in conjunction with .","Additionally, in some examples, the server meter  of  includes an example metering metadata encryptor  that employs any appropriate encryption to encrypt the metering metadata determined by the metering data transcoder . For example, the metering metadata encryptor  can encrypt the metering metadata using public or private key encryption such that the decryption key(s) are known and protected by the media monitoring facility . Inclusion of the metering metadata encryptor  can prevent unauthorized eavesdroppers from accessing the transcoded metering metadata identifying or otherwise associated with the streaming media content, thereby securing the privacy of users consuming the streaming media content.","In the illustrated example of , the server meter  includes an example transport stream encoder  to re-encode the transport stream(s) carrying the streaming media content to include the metering metadata determined by the metering data transcoder  (and encrypted by the metering metadata encryptor , as appropriate). For example, the transport stream encoder  can encode the metering metadata into an external metadata channel, such as by encoding an M3U8 or other data file to contain the metering metadata and to be associated with (e.g., included in, appended to, sent prior to, etc.) the transport stream(s) that are to provide the streaming media content to the content presentation device . Additionally or alternatively, the transport stream encoder  can encode the metering metadata into an internal metadata channel, such as by encoding metering metadata that is in a binary or other appropriate data format into one or more data fields of the transport stream(s) that is(are) capable of carrying metadata. For example, the transport stream encoder  can insert ID3 tag metadata corresponding to the metering metadata into the transport stream(s) that is (are) to stream the media content in accordance with the HLS or other appropriate streaming protocol.","A block diagram of an example implementation of the example device meter  of  is illustrated in . The example device meter  of  includes an example metering metadata extractor  to extract metering metadata from external and\/or internal metadata channels associated with transport stream(s) providing streaming media content to the content presentation device . For example, the metering metadata extractor  can extract metering metadata from an external metadata channel (or more than one external metadata channel), such as by decoding an M3U8 or other data file that contains metering metadata and that is associated with (e.g., included in, appended to, sent prior to, etc.) the transport stream(s) providing the streaming media content to the content presentation device . Additionally or alternatively, the metering metadata extractor  can extract metering metadata from an internal metadata channel (or more than one internal metadata channel), such as by decoding metering metadata from one or more data fields of the transport stream(s) that is(are) capable of carrying metadata. In some examples, such as an example employing the HLS protocol, the metering metadata extractor  extracts and decodes ID3 tag(s) that contain the metering metadata.","The example device meter  of  also includes an example metering metadata reporter  to report the metering metadata obtained by the metering metadata extractor  to the media monitoring facility . For example, the metering metadata reporter  may generate a GET or POST request including the metering metadata as a parameter of the request. Alternatively, any other method of transmitting the metering metadata to the media monitoring facility  may be used. The metering metadata may be transmitted at any interval. For example, the metering metadata may be transmitted as it is collected (e.g., streamed), may be transmitted when a certain amount of metering metadata is collected, when an available memory space is filled or reaches a threshold capacity (e.g., 90% or some other percentage being full), when a particular event is detected (e.g., when presentation of the media content ends, when new media content is presented, etc.), whenever new metering metadata is obtained, etc. The metadata reporter  may transmit metering metadata once for each media content or may transmit metering metadata multiple times (e.g., every time an event occurs, every time identifying information changes (e.g., when the media content includes metering data that change throughout the media content, etc.).","In some examples, the device meter  may determine metering information in addition to the metering metadata extracted by the metering metadata extractor . For example, the device meter  may collect other metadata (e.g., such as other content identifying metadata) already accompanying the transport stream(s) providing the streaming media content. Additionally or alternatively, in some examples, the device meter  may collect information describing usage of the media player presenting the media content, other usage of the content presentation device  while the media content is being presented, etc., or any combination thereof. In such examples, the metering metadata reporter  can use one or more of the example mechanisms described above to report this additional metering information to the media monitoring facility  along with, or separate from, the metering metadata extracted by the metering metadata extractor .","A block diagram of an example implementation of the example media monitoring facility  of  is illustrated in . The example media monitoring facility  of  includes an example metering metadata collector  to collect the metering metadata (and other metering information) reported by the device meter . As described above, the metering metadata collector  of the illustrated example includes an HTTP interface to receive HTTP requests that include metering information. Additionally or alternatively, any other method(s) to receive metering information may be used. The metering metadata collector  also stores (e.g., collects) and analyzes the received metering information, as described above in connection with . The example media monitoring facility  of  also includes an example report generator  to generate reports based on the reported metering information, as described above in connection with .","A block diagram of a second example system  for monitoring streaming media content is illustrated in . The second example system  includes many elements in common with the first example system  of . As such, like elements in  are labeled with the same reference numerals. The detailed descriptions of these like elements are provided above in connection with the discussion of  and, in the interest of brevity, are not repeated in the discussion of .","Turning to , the illustrated example system  includes the compression gear , the segmenter and packager , the digital rights manager  and the content streamer  to provide streaming media content to the content presentation device  via the network . To provide media content to the system , the illustrated example of  includes the content provider(s) . To monitor media content that is streamed to the content presentation device , the system  of the illustrated examples also includes a second example server meter , a second example device meter  and a second example media monitoring facility . In some examples, the server meter  may be implemented as a plug-in or other application\/device associated with or executed by one or more of the compression gear , the segmenter and packager , the digital rights manager  and\/or the content streamer . In some examples, the server meter  may be implemented by an apparatus separate from the compression gear , the segmenter and packager , the digital rights manager  and the content streamer . In some examples, the device meter  may be implemented as a plug-in that is connected to a plug-in interface of a media player executed by the content presentation device .

In some examples, the metadata inserter  and one or more of the transcoders  and\/or  may be integrated into a single device or plug-in, whereas in other examples the metadata inserter  is separate from the transcoders  and .","In the illustrated example, the metadata inserter  is coupled to an interface of the IRD  (e.g., such as a serial digital interface (SDI) or Internet protocol (IP) interface) and decodes of the television transport stream provided by the IRD . The metadata inserter  then extracts audio watermark(s) from the audio portion(s) of the television transport stream and decodes the audio watermark(s) to obtain audio watermark payload data, which in the illustrated example provides the metering information. Additionally or alternatively, in some examples the metadata inserter  extracts video (e.g., image) watermark(s) from the video portion(s) of the television transport stream and decodes the video (e.g., image) watermark(s) to obtain video watermark payload data corresponding to the metering information. In some examples the metadata inserter  may additionally or alternatively obtain metering data from an independent metering data source, such as the independent metering data source described in conjunction with . The metadata inserter  then inserts the watermark payload data corresponding to the metering information into one or more existing portions of the television transport stream capable of carrying metadata. For example, the metadata inserter  can insert the watermark payload data corresponding to the metering information (and\/or metering data obtained from an independent source) as vertical blanking interval (VBI) data in accordance with Society of Cable Telecommunications Engineers (SCTE) American National Standard ANSI\/SCTE , or as one or more Advanced Television Systems Committee (ATSC) private information descriptors of the transport stream, etc. In some examples, operation of the metadata inserter  results in little to no change in the program clock reference and\/or audio\/video timing of the television transport stream.","In the illustrated example, the system  includes one or more of the transcoder  or the transcoder . The transcoders  and  each can take metering metadata inserted by the metadata inserter  into the television transport stream and convert this metadata into a format compatible with streaming by the content delivery network . The transcoders  and  each can then insert this reformatted metadata into certain portion(s) of the streaming content transport stream(s) that are capable of carrying metadata. For example, the transcoders \/ can decode metering metadata inserted as VBI payload data or as ATSC private information descriptor(s) and convert this metering metadata into ID3 tag metadata for insertion in the transport stream(s) that is (are) to stream the media content in accordance with the HLS or other appropriate streaming protocol. In some examples, the transcoders \/ encrypt the transcoded metering metadata prior to insertion in the transport stream(s) that is (are) to stream the media content (e.g., to protect privacy). Such encryption can prevent the metering metadata from being observable by applications at the content presentation device  other than the device meter . Additionally or alternatively, such encryption can be used to prevent the device meter  from extracting and\/or decoding the metering metadata unless the device meter  has been provisioned (e.g., enabled) by the media monitoring facility .","In the illustrated example, the difference between the transcoder  and the transcoder  concerns the location and integration into the system . For example, the transcoder  performs its transcoding functions on the input to the content delivery network  and, thus, may be implemented as a device separate from the CDN  and\/or may be integrated with or separate from the metadata inserter . In contrast, the transcoder  operates on transport stream(s) within the CDN  (e.g., similar to the server meter ) and, thus, may be implemented as a plug-in and\/or application\/device associated with or executed by one or more of the elements included in the CDN .","A potential advantage of the example system  is that different vendors can provide metadata inserters  and transcoders \/, with their interfaces being specified by established industry standards (e.g., such as established SCTE or ATSC standards).","While an example manner of implementing the system  has been illustrated in , one or more of the elements, processes and\/or devices illustrated in  may be combined, divided, re-arranged, omitted, eliminated and\/or implemented in any other way.
