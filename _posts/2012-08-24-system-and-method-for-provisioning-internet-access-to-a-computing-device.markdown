{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND ART","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61\/527,145, filed on Aug. 25, 2011, and Singapore Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 201108719-4, filed on Nov. 24, 2011, both applications are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.","The present invention relates to a system and method for provisioning Internet access to a computing device. The system and method are particularly suited, but not limited to providing internet access to a mobile device and personal computers enabled with USB dongles and will be described in this context.","The following discussion of the background to the invention is intended to facilitate an understanding of the present invention only. It should be appreciated that the discussion is not an acknowledgement or admission that any of the material referred to was published, known or part of the common general knowledge of the person skilled in the art in any jurisdiction as at the priority date of the invention.","Mobile phones have recently surpassed the conventional desktop or laptop PCs as a popular means for people to connect to the internet. This in part has been fueled by social networks and mobile software applications. The main advantage of mobile phones is in their ability to be connected to the Internet wherever the user is. Mobile phone users may receive and\/or respond to Instant messaging messages, \u201cFacebook\u2122\u201d tags, \u201cTweets\u2122\u201d, surf the Internet via a mobile web browser instantly wherever the users are, as long as data connection (GSM, GPRS, 3G, Wi-Fi etc.) can be established.","The above advantages complement markets where a majority of telecommunication carrier subscribers prefer mobile data post-paid plans. Subscribers of these post-paid plans generally do not mind paying more per month to have unlimited Internet data access or a data usage capped at a relatively larger size, for example 12 Gigabytes (GB).","Another recent phenomenon is the use of \u201cbroadband dongles\u201d\u2014USB powered devices that allow computing devices such as Personal Computers\/laptops to connect to the Internet using the mobile network operator (MNO) networks (3G\/4G etc.)","However, providing \u201calways on\u201d Internet or data connection for smartphones and dongle-powered PCs has remained a challenge for telecommunications carriers in markets dominated by users who prefer \u201cprepaid plans\u201d (or \u201cpay-as-you-go\u201d plans). Users under these prepaid plans are less willing to pay a relatively larger subscription fee for full unlimited internet access. A typical prepaid plan is based on a pay-per-specified-time model, such as for example 10 pesos for 30 minutes of fast Internet connection (i.e. at maximum bandwidth as provided by the mobile network carrier). Another variation to the pay-per-specified time model may be a daily \u201calways on\u201d access to only social networking sites such as Facebook\u2122 or Twitter\u2122 for 20 pesos per day.","The above mentioned prepaid\/pay-per-specified-time plans do not offer enough flexibility to subscribers. For example, many users may be interested in visiting certain websites or URLs but not others. Further, certain telecommunications carriers may be able to provide certain services such as URLs or APIs free of charge to their subscribers without the need to pay for Internet access, or providing free of charge certain mobile applications or \u2018apps\u2019, without the need to pay for downloading such mobile applications. Subscribers to such telecommunications carriers may be only interested in these specific mobile applications, URLs or APIs without the need for general Internet access, but at present there is no system or mechanism to allow flexibility to toggle between a paid and free Internet access service.","As prepaid plan subscribers are sensitive to cost, another challenge for telecommunications carriers is to deliver Internet connection at relatively lower \u201csachet\u201d price points, such as below 20 pesos daily, while still providing prepaid plan users with \u201calways on\u201d experience. While this may be possible for certain phones which are efficient in terms of consuming data bandwidth (such as feature phones or a Blackberry\u2122 for example), it is typically difficult to implement such \u201csachet\u201d price points for more recent smartphones models which require relatively higher data bandwidth because to do so may be unprofitable for mobile network operators (MNOs) or telecommunications carrier. MNOs typically have relatively limited Internet bandwidth as compared to full Internet service providers. From the perspective of the MNOs, the relevant question for implementing \u201csachet\u201d price points for smartphone models would be\u201cWhat kind of Internet service can be offered profitably at 5 peso (or approximately US 10 cents per day) to capture the markets of these smartphone users?\u201d","Along the same line of cost consideration for prepaid plan subscribers, a fixed cost per unit time (e.g. 10 pesos per 30 minutes) plan may be deemed relatively more expensive for a user with Internet access outside an area with high network coverage (e.g. metro areas) compared to a user within the metro area. A prepaid plan subscriber outside the metro area requires more time to download a file or carry out certain actions (such as video streaming) compared to a subscriber within the metro area. This is due to the relative less dense network coverage in non-metro areas. In such cases, a user may be unduly penalized with a pay-per-specified-time plan.","In light of the above, there also exists a need for different charging plans and billing mechanisms that caters to pre-paid subscribers depending on the location of the subscriber.","The present invention seeks to address the above mentioned concerns and provide a system and method that alleviates the above mentioned drawbacks at least in part.","It is to be appreciated that \u201cfree access\u201d in the context of access to web resources including URLs, APIs or other websites\/IP addresses refer to toll free \u2018always on\u2019 data access, i.e. access to these URLs, APIs, websites\/IP addresses would be free to the user as provided by a telecommunications carrier. Such always on data access is to be distinguished from any subsequent actions to retrieve, input or manipulate data, including downloading of videos\/audio files for example. Actions to retrieve, input or manipulate data may be chargeable, although the access to the data itself may be toll free.","In addition, \u201cfree access\u201d in the context of access to mobile applications (\u201capps\u201d) refers to downloading such apps but usage of such \u201capps\u201d to download\/view\/stream or perform other functions may be chargeable.","It is further to be appreciated that \u2018Internet access\u2019 in the context of the description generally refers to mobile data Internet service such as GPRS, Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE), 3G, LTE, 4G network, Wi-Fi tethering etc. unless otherwise stated.","In accordance with a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a system for provisioning Internet access to a computing device comprising an Internet access adjustment facilitator arranged to receive a request from the computing device for adjusting Internet access from a paid Internet access mode to a toll-free Internet access mode; and a whitelist in communication with the Internet access adjustment facilitator, the white list maintaining a list of web resources available for toll free access by the computing device; wherein upon successful processing of the request, the list of web resources are toll free for access by the computing device.","Preferably any subsequent action to retrieve, input or manipulate data in the toll-free Internet access mode is chargeable. Ideally, each subsequent action to retrieve, input or manipulate data is charged or billed based on a pay per action model. Alternatively, each subsequent action to retrieve, input or manipulate data is charged or billed based on a flat fee for a defined set of subsequent actions.","Preferably in the toll-free Internet access mode the comprising device is not allowed to access any web resources not within the whitelist.","Preferably the request for adjusting Internet access is a Short Messaging Service (SMS) message, electronic text message, or Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) message.","Preferably the system further comprises a subscriber database arranged to maintain details of a plurality of subscribers; and an accounting database arranged to be in data communication with the subscriber database for settlement and checking of available funds for each subscriber and maintaining a history of transaction of each subscriber.","Preferably the mobile device is arranged to send the request automatically to the Internet access adjustment facilitator based on a priority-based algorithm that typically ranks higher quality, or more open plan or faster user subscriber plan higher in priority. More preferably the pay per action model is activated by sending a request from the mobile device to the Internet access adjustment facilitator, the Internet access adjustment facilitator operable to, upon receiving the request, toggle between an existing billing infrastructure which implements a pay-per-specific time model and an independent billing module implementing the pay per action model.","Preferably the toggle from the existing billing infrastructure to the independent billing module is achieved either by switching off the existing billing infrastructure; or defining the data bandwidth connection as a zero tariff.","In accordance with a second aspect of the present invention there is provided a method for provisioning internet access to a computing device comprising the following steps: receiving at an Internet access adjustment facilitator from the computing device a request to adjust Internet access from a paid Internet access mode to a toll-free Internet access mode; processing the request to adjust Internet access; and upon successful processing, adjusting the Internet access to the computing device; wherein in the toll-free Internet access mode; web resources within a whitelist are toll free for access by the computing device.","Preferably any subsequent action to retrieve, input or manipulate data in the toll-free Internet access mode is chargeable. More preferably the each subsequent action to retrieve, input or manipulate data is charged or billed based on a pay per action model. Alternatively, the each subsequent action to retrieve, input or manipulate data is charged or billed based on a flat fee for a defined set of subsequent actions.","Preferably in the toll-free Internet access mode the computing device is not allowed to access any web resources not within the whitelist.","Preferably the request for adjusting Internet access is a Short Messaging Service (SMS) message, electronic text message, or Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) message.","Preferably the Internet access adjustment facilitator is in data communication with a subscriber database arranged to maintain details of a plurality of subscribers; and an accounting database arranged to be in data communication with the subscriber database for settlement and checking of available funds for each subscriber and maintaining a history of transaction of each subscriber.","Preferably the computing device is arranged to send the request automatically to the Internet access adjustment facilitator based on a priority-based algorithm that typically ranks higher quality, or more open plan or faster user subscriber plan higher in priority.","Preferably the pay per action model is activated by sending a request from the computing device to the Internet access adjustment facilitator, the Internet access adjustment facilitator operable to, upon receiving the request, toggle between an existing billing infrastructure which implements pay-per-specific time model and an independent billing module implementing the pay per action model. More preferably the toggling from the existing billing infrastructure to the independent billing module is achieved either by switching off the existing billing infrastructure; or defining the data bandwidth connection as a zero tariff.","In accordance with a third aspect of the present invention there is a mobile device containing software instructions, wherein upon execution of the software instructions, performs the method according to any of the second aspect of the invention toad just the Internet access from a paid Internet access mode to a toll-free Internet access mode.","Preferably, where the method comprises an additional step of billing for the bandwidth consumed based on either a pay-per-specific time model or pay per action model, wherein the pay-per-specific time model or pay per action model is activated by sending a request from the mobile device to the Internet access adjustment facilitator, the Internet access adjustment facilitator operable to, upon receiving the request, toggle between an existing billing infrastructure implementing the pay-per-specific time model and an independent billing module implementing the pay per action model.","Other arrangements of the invention are possible and, consequently, the accompanying drawings are not to be understood as superseding the generality of the preceding description of the invention.","Preferred Embodiment Of The Invention","In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention there is a system  for provisioning Internet access from a host  to at least one computing device . The system  comprises an Internet access adjustment facilitator  and a whitelist  in data communication with the Internet access adjustment facilitator .","The host  may be a telecommunications carrier or mobile network operator.","The computing device  may preferably be a mobile phone. More preferably, the computing device  is a smartphone capable of the installation of mobile software application or \u2018app\u2019. The computing device  is connectable to the Internet via various mobile data services such as GPRS, Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE), 3G, Wi-Fi, LTE, 4G network etc.","Alternatively, the computing device  may be a personal computer\/laptop comprising a USB wireless adapter, such as a dongle, for plugging into a personal computer (desktop or laptop) to access the system  and the Internet adjustment facilitator . Such an arrangement allows the personal computer\/laptop to access the telecommunications network's GPRS, Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE), 3G, Wi-Fi, LTE, 4G network etc.","The Internet access adjustment facilitator  is adapted to process requests  from the user of computing device  to the telecommunications network  for the control of Internet access. In this sense, the Internet access adjustment facilitator  is within a proxy server for connecting to the Internet. The requests  are typically in the form of an electronic signal\/message wherein a software application is installed on the mobile device  or personal computer (PC) for such a purpose. Other means of communicating with the adjustment facilitator  may be in the form of a simple text or Short Messaging Service (SMS), Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) messages or other similar messaging service.","The system  optionally comprises a subscriber database . The subscriber database  maintains details of the subscribers of telecommunications network , such as the Mobile Subscriber Integrated Services Digital Network Number (MSISDN) of each subscriber mobile phone; and whether the subscriber is on any prepaid\/post-paid plans as well as the details of the plans such as the expiry of the prepaid plan (if applicable). The subscriber database  is in data communication with an accounting database  for the settlement and checking of available funds for the subscriber for computing device . The accounting database  further maintains a history of transaction of each subscriber.","In the case where the mobile Internet service is a GPRS service for example, the Internet access adjustment facilitator  is typically located between the Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN)and the Service Aware Support Node (SASN) of the GPRS core network.","The whitelist  is in data communication with Internet access adjustment facilitator. The whitelist  maintains a list of web resources comprising URLs, and APIs and other web services as approved by telecommunications carrier . These approved URLs and APIs are considered \u201ctoll free\u201d, i.e. available for free access by the computing device  or free to be accessed by a user as far as charging\/billing based on the data network of the telecommunications network  is concerned. Whitelist  is in data communication with Internet access adjustment facilitator.","The invention will now be described in the context of its intended use.","The computing device  is preferably installed with a dedicated mobile software application depending on the particular model of the computing device . For a typical smartphone such as an iPhone\u2122 or Android\u2122, this may be an \u201capp\u201d as colloquially known. For ease of reference, the dedicated mobile software application will be interchangeably known as \u201cSafe Browsing App\u201d.","Prior to use, the computing device  is checked if it is registered as a subscriber of the system  via checks on the MSISDN of the computing device  or other methods as well known to a skilled person. For the case where the computing device  is a personal computer or laptop that connects to the Internet via a dongle, the dongle typically comprise a subscriber identity module (SIM) card within the same, the SIM card having a MSISDN. If the computing device  is not a subscriber, the user of a computing device  may optionally be prompted a message through the Safe Browsing App to register or choose from any set of services, or the telecommunications network operator or mobile network operator (MNO)  may have dedicated APNs for the purpose of carrying out the present invention and requires the user of the computing device  to change the Access Point Name (APN) of the mobile device. The user may for example get a text message or a notification on his app asking him to make this change.","An example of the message is as follows:","\u201cTo use the Safe Browsing App, please change the APN of your smartphone to internet.abc.com\u201d.","Alternatively, the subscriber does not have to be prompted to change the APN explicitly. The MNO  may employ an intelligent APN provisioning system that enables automatic connection (in the background) to the Internet.","The installed software application (Safe Browsing Apps) may be manually activated by the user of computing device  wherein the installed application opens a user interface providing the option to adjust internet access type as desired, or may include detecting the data usage profile of the subscriber for computing device . The data usage profile details any existing data plan\/package which the subscriber is currently on.","The Safe Browsing Application also provides the user interface for the user of computing device  to toggle control of his internet access between a paid Internet access and a toll-free Internet access. Examples of these two Internet access are as described in the two modes as follows:","a \u2018full access\u2019 mode (Paid Internet access mode)\u2014full access to the Internet (provided by MNO\/telecommunications carrier) at maximum speeds available. For example, 3G\/4G networks at 10 peso for 30 minutes or a discounted rate for slower speeds such as EDGE or GPRS.","a \u2018limited access\u2019 mode (Toll free Internet access mode)\u2014restricted to certain mobile data services; including certain websites, URLs, Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and IP addresses as maintained by the whitelist ; Access to these services as listed in whitelist  will not incur any mobile data charges to the subscriber. Sites, URLs, APIs, and\/or services outside of this whitelist are however non-accessible to the user in this mode.","A third \u2018default mode\u2019\u2014upon detection by the system  to be on an existing data plan (such as a 10 pesos for 30 minutes fast internet access), the default mode overrides any other modes until the expiration of the data plan.","The \u201cSafe Browsing App\u201d may be pre-installed or downloadable. The App may be a software \u2018widget\u2019 which includes an graphical representation of an on\/off switch on the user interface of computing device , allowing the user of computing device  to toggle between the \u2018full access\u2019 (ON) mode and the \u2018limited access\u2019 (OFF) mode. Upon clicking\/sliding the \u2018On\u2019 toggle, the user sends a request  for \u2018full access\u2019 and the clicking\/sliding of the \u2018off\u2019 toggle sends a request  for \u2018limited access\u2019 mode. The \u2018default\u2019 mode is typically not presented as an option to the user of computing device  and will automatically kick once detected that an existing data plan is available.","Alternatively, the request  may be sent as an SMS (access code required) or via the World Wide Web (www).","Further details on the user adjustable \u2018full access\u2019 and \u2018limited access\u2019 modes and their functionality, as well as its operation under various computing devices , including smartphones and legacy non-smartphones) are described as follows:","\u2018Full Access\u2019 Mode:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":["a. Activated via the Safe Browsing App, via toggle \u2018ON\u2019 (may be shown as a graphical lever or switch on the user interface);","b. Allows full access to the worldwide web (www) via Internet data service","c. Billed based on traditional billing infrastructure in terms of cost per X amount of time or size (kB\/MB). If the Subscriber has no available subscriptions or data packages, the Subscriber will be automatically charged the prevailing rate (e.g. 10 pesos for 30 minutes) or any charge rate as set by telecommunications carrier\/MNO .","d. While the default rate of 10 peso for 30 minutes is applicable for a 3G\/4G network, should the subscriber connect at a lower speed (based on EDGE\/GPRS for example), a significant discount off the 10 peso for 30 minutes may be offered to the subscriber. In the regard, the Safe Browsing App will determine if the subscriber is connected at 3G\/4G or at a relatively lower speed.","e. For instances where the computing device  is connected to the Internet at 3G\/4G but the actual Internet speed falls below its rated or advertised speed due to network congestion for example, upon detection by the Safe Browsing App a significant discount may be made to the typical 10 peso for 30 minutes. The advice of charge will be calculated by the accounting database  and displayed to the Subscriber through one of the following ways:\n    \n    ","a. Displays approved whitelist of services on User Interface of the Safe Browsing App. In addition, displays icons of independent \u2018Apps\u2019 that are actively connected to the Internet. These are apps that have been created by third parties that now exist in the itunes\u2122 store or android market, and have been whitelisted for \u2018toll free\u2019 connection to the Internet.","b. The whitelist may further include certain URLs and IP addresses by browsers.","c. Blocks all other data from the Subscriber's phone  from passing through the Network.","d. If the Subscriber has no availed subscriptions\/data packages, the Subscriber will not be charged and will not be able to access other data not within the whitelist .","e. If the mobile phone's browser is used instead of the Safe Browsing App:\n    \n    "]}},"There are a number of possible ways for subscribers to switch between the \u2018full access\u2019 and \u2018limited access\u2019 modes. For example, the user may download the safe browsing app\/widget; send a SMS to the Internet access adjustment facilitator ; or via access of a mobile web browser (WebConnect).","Users who subscribe to a data plan\/data Package activates the \u2018default\u2019 mode automatically to override whatever mode he is currently at.","If the user has downloaded the \u2018safe browsing\u2019 app\/widget, a set of \u2018console\u2019 rules, governs the interaction between the user subscriber and the widget depending on the type of computing device .","If the computing device  is a smartphone specifically developed for the telecommunications carrier  (hereinafter known as a netphone), after the initial user registration process, the widget will be set to the \u2018limited access\u2019 (OFF) mode, which is the default setting.","Interaction with the Safe Browsing App via for example tapping or sliding the User interface provided on the App\/widget will toggle the OFF mode to the unlimited access (ON) mode. A prompt will appear and inform the user that by switching modes, mobile Internet will be activated and the subscriber will be charged the prevailing rate (e.g. P10 for 30 minutes). If the subscriber wishes to switch to the OFF mode, he may simply interact with the widget again as mentioned above. The subscriber may be prompted a message along the lines of:\n\n","If the computing device  is any other smartphone which is not specifically developed for the telecommunications carrier , upon installation of the safe browsing app\/widget, the widget will by default be set to the \u2018full access\u2019 ON mode instead of the OFF mode as described above. Interaction with the Widget will toggle from the ON mode to OFF mode and vice-versa.","If the computing device  is any other legacy phones (i.e. non Smartphones) capable of accessing the internet and installing the widget, the default setting is the ON mode. The installed widget is capable of detecting the current state of the computing device  data and APN setting. If detected that the mobile device's data (internet setting) is disabled, the installed widget will display the status of the computing device  as disabled. If the subscriber interacts with the widget, for example via tapping the screen of the mobile device to enable the Device's Data access and prompts the subscriber that the device Data access is enabled. The widget will then send a request  to the Internet access adjustment facilitator  to switch to \u2018limited access\u2019 MODE. Upon tapping the widget again will send another request  to switch to the \u2018full access\u2019 mode and enable all Mobile Data to pass through the Network.","As an alternative to installing the software widget, the subscriber may choose to switch between the \u2018full access\u2019 and \u2018limited access\u2019 modes via SMS. Switching via SMS may be performed by any phone via console rules as follows:","The subscriber sends an SMS comprising an Access Code, password, and the desired mode. The Internet access adjustment facilitator  responds with an SMS stating the current mode and a confirmation to proceed with the change. The subscriber then sends a confirmation SMS. Upon switching mode, the Internet access adjustment facilitator  will send a confirmation of the switch in mode.","The subscriber may switch mode on a mobile internet browser. The console rules governing the switch mode via web connect is as follows.","The subscriber of mobile device accesses web connect and logs in, for example using his user ID and password. Upon logging in, the web browser displays the current mode of the computing device . In the absence of any subscriber plan, the default mode is the \u2018unlimited access\u2019 mode. The subscriber is then allowed to change the mode. An SMS will be sent to the subscriber on first use of the switch mode service.","For roaming subscribers, in the absence of any data package\/plan the \u2018full access\u2019 mode is applicable so as not to disrupt any data service. However, a prompt\/SMS may be sent to the roaming subscriber to advise him to disable data roaming on his mobile device  so as not to incur additional roaming cost.","Should a user\/subscriber wish to buy a data subscription plan\/package, the console rules are defined as follows:","For a Netphone, the subscriber accesses the Subscription application (available to netphone), selects a Package and taps on BUY option. Upon confirmation, the Internet Widget will automatically toggle to ON\u2014\u2018full access\u2019 mode without further input required from the subscriber. A prompt will be displayed to the subscriber indicating that the Widget has been set to ON, and that all Mobile Data use is ACTIVE.","On other Smartphone , the subscriber may be availed a Package via SMS or mobile web browser. Upon confirmation, the Internet Widget will automatically toggle to the ON MODE. A prompt will be displayed to the subscriber indicating that the Widget has been set to ON, and that all Mobile Data use is ACTIVE.","For other legacy Phones, the subscriber may be availed of a Package via SMS or mobile web browser. The Internet ON\/OFF service will automatically toggle to ON MODE. An SMS will then be sent to the subscriber confirming the Package and indicating that the Internet ON\/OFF service has been set to ON, and that all Mobile Data use is now ACTIVE.","It is to be appreciated that the Internet access adjustment facilitator  may further include steps to verify the MSISDN of the computing device  is in the subscriber database . Further steps such as password authentication, SMS verification or other forms of authentication may also be performed as known to a person skilled in the art to authenticate the subscriber.","It is further appreciated that once any request  to switch mode is successfully verified, the Internet access adjustment facilitator  proceeds to adjust the internet access for the subscriber of computing device . This is based on the whitelist  as maintained by the telecommunications carrier .","The described system and method further allows the user to stop or pause the \u2018limited access\u2019 as and when desired, and thus better able to control the part of his remaining credit of the pre-paid plan.","In the case where the computing device  is a personal computer\/laptop having a dongle, the user interface may be an Internet browser that is able to be connected to the whitelist  for accessing the \u2018toll free\u2019 services. In the case where the Internet browser is for example \u201cGoogle chrome\u201d, accessed to Google chrome based applications are typically whitelisted for \u201ctoll free\u201d connection. Another user interface can be a program downloaded and installed on a personal computer\/laptop, as has been the typical case.","In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, as illustrated in , wherein like numerals reference like parts, there is a system  for provisioning Internet access from a telecommunications carrier  to at least one computing device . The system  comprises an Internet access adjustment facilitator , a subscriber database  and a whitelist  in data communication with the Internet access adjustment facilitator . The system  further comprises an independent billing\/charging module . The billing module  is an independent separate value-added billing module based on the mechanism of \u2018per action charging\u2019.","Independent billing module  is operable to be in data communication with the subscriber database  and accounting database . Independent billing module  is arranged to provide a \u2018per action charging\u2019 mechanism for charging\/billing a subscriber for his Internet bandwidth usage. The independent billing module  is advantageous because it does not require modifications to the existing billing charging structure\/database and may be implemented as a convenient \u2018add-on\u2019 to the existing resources.","\u2018Per action charging\u2019 is a charging model based on an action taken by the subscriber. Examples of such action(s) are defined as follows:\n\n","In the context of the embodiment, other actions which may fall within the definition of \u2018per action charging\u2019 may include \u2018per click within dedicated smartphone \u2018App\u2019; per click within web browser etc.","\u2018Per action charging\u2019 offer additional choice for a pre-paid subscriber as it allows the pre-paid subscriber to choose from the conventional \u2018pay-per-specified time\u2019 model (\u2018pay-per-specified time\u2019 mode such as 10 pesos for 30 minutes of Internet connection, and\/or the daily \u201calways on\u201d access to only social networking sites such as Facebook\u2122 or Twitter\u2122 for 20 pesos daily) to the \u2018per action charging\u2019 model depending on his preference such as time, location and\/or usage.","In this embodiment, the previously discussed \u2018Safe Browse App\u2019 may include an additional function which allows a subscriber of computing device  to toggle between the \u2018pay-per-specified action\u2019 charging\/billing models to the \u2018per action charging\u2019 charging\/billing model. Alternatively, the billing\/charging function may be implemented as another dedicated software application or App known as the \u2018Flexible Billing\u2019 App.","The request  for switching to per action charging is in the form of simple text or Short Messaging Service (SMS), Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) messages or any other form of an electronic signal\/message wherein a software application is installed on the mobile device  for such a purpose.","The embodiment with emphasis on the usage of the billing module  for charging\/billing a subscriber's data bandwidth usage will next be described in the context of its use.","Upon detection that per action charging is to be adopted via a request  from the user of computing device , the Internet access adjustment facilitator  switches from the existing billing infrastructure of the telecommunications carrier  to the billing module . This may be achieved by either:\n\n","The billing module  then takes over the billing\/charging based on per action charging once detected that the computing device  is in the \u2018limited access mode\u2019 as previously discussed in the previous embodiment. In particular, for the \u2018limited access\u2019 mode as discussed, the following charging methods shall apply charge per action on a specific App or a browser within the whitelist :","A flat charge for a continuous Internet connection for specific Apps or set of web resources (URLs or IP addresses) for subsequent actions for the APIs, URLs within the whitelist  (i.e. initial access to these web resources within the whitelist  is free but subsequent actions are billable).","If the user chooses to exercise the option of \u2018charge per action mode\u2019, while on Limited Access, a simplified flat nominal charge per action tariff may be charged. Such action includes updating one's Facebook's status, downloading and streaming a YouTube video, etc. If the user chooses the FLAT CHARGE for continuous streaming while on Limited Access, that charge will be applied, turning on Internet connection only for the specified apps, URLs IP addresses, and overriding Full Access mode if the user has been on the limited access mode.","The billing module  is complementary with the flexible provision of Internet access. In particular, when a request  is sent to the Internet access adjustment facilitator  to adjust the from the \u2018full access\u2019 mode to \u2018limited access\u2019 mode in conjunction with the request  to bill based on per action charging; the subscriber of computing device  gains more control of the type of charging\/billing applicable depending on where he\/she may be at. For example at a non-metro area with less dense network coverage, the user has the flexibility to turn on the \u2018limited access\u2019 mode and make use of the whitelist  to access web resources at no charges and be charged at \u2018per action\u2019 charging for any subsequent actions taken.","The system  may be suited to incorporate other permutations and combinations of usage. In particular, the billing module  may include differential pricing for accessing certain websites, URLs, Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and IP addresses. Access to these mobile services will not incur any mobile data charges to the subscriber or will be at a discounted rate.","For the \u201cfull access\u201d mode, the operational speeds may be detected via a speed monitoring application installed on the computing device . This is preferably integrated with the Flexible Billing App. By using test data packets (similar to concept of a \u201cPING\u201d), the operational speed of the computing device  may be estimated and charged based on the 3G\/4G high speed or possibly at a discounted rate for lower speed.","For the \u201climited access\u201d mode, in addition to the \u2018charge per action\u2019 billing method, a \u201cflat fee for a defined set of apps\u201d method, or some combination of both may be adopted.","As an alternative to manual switching by a user subscriber, an automatic method for switching from one mode to another may be provided. The automatic method is a priority-based algorithm that typically ranks higher quality, or more open plan or faster plan higher in priority unless otherwise switched manually by the user. For example, if the user is subscribed to a data plan that translates to a full Access mode as described, any limited access mode purchased is override.","The priority-based algorithm of the automatic method means that once the Full Access mode subscription has expired (say the full 30 minutes in a 10 peso for 30 minutes plan), the user will be automatically switched to \u201cLimited Access\u201d mode.","In the case where the computing device is a personal computer\/laptop, these modes may be presented as a form of notification anywhere within a relatively larger desktop\/laptop screen area. Clicking on such notification will take the subscriber to a Settings Area. The Settings indicate, among others, the mode that the user is currently on and the remaining balance information. The remaining balance would be either shown in terms of currently (e.g. Pesos) or time elapsed and time remaining. In the Settings section, the subscriber may also choose to switch manually from one mode of connection to another.","The \u201cFlexible Billing App\u201dmay be a feature which may be integrated as an integral module with the Safe Browsing App or any other Apps. In the case of it being a separate App, it may take the form of a software \u2018widget\u2019 which includes an graphical representation of an on\/off switch, such that when in the \u2018on\u2019 position, it indicates which mode of connection is active, balance information, and a graphical lever that allows the subscriber to switch manually to a specific modes. Upon selecting a particular mode of connection, the Flexible Billing App sends a request  to the Internet access adjustment facilitator  for instructions to adjust the same.","It is to be appreciated that \u2018charge per action\u2019 may include the following \u2018Per click within app\u2019 or \u2018per click within web browser\u2019 and \u2018per click within program\u2019 \u2018Per app running always on, for specified period\u2019 and\/or \u2018per set of apps running always on, for specified period\u2019.","Alternatively, the request  may be sent as an SMS (access code required), USSD command, or via the world wide web (www).","The Internet access adjustment facilitator  may further comprise a bandwidth throttler (not shown) to process requests  from the user of computing device  to the telecommunications network  for the adjustment of data bandwidth between a \u2018trickle\u2019 mode\u2014i.e. 9.6 kbps to 14.4 kbps and a \u2018boost\u2019 mode\u20142 Mbps onwards if on 3G for example, on demand. The \u2018Boost\u2019 mode provides the user interface (via the Safe Browse and\/or Flexible billing app) for the user of computing device  to toggle control of his data speed between the \u2018trickle\u2019 mode\u2014i.e. 9.6 kbps to 14.4 kbps and the \u2018boost\u2019 mode\u20142 Mbps onwards if on 3G for example, on demand. For the subscriber having a pre-paid contract or plan, the default mode for the data speed is the \u2018trickle\u2019 mode.","In such an instance, a \u2018boost\u2019 mode may be included in the system and the charge\/bill per-action plan may be applied to the boost mode.","\u201cBoost\u201d Mode","Upon selecting the option \u2018Boost\u2019 on the user interface, the request to change the data speed from \u2018trickle\u2019 to \u20183G\/4G\u2019 is sent to the Internet access adjustment facilitator . The Internet access adjustment facilitator  proceeds to verify if the MSISDN of the computing device  is in the subscriber database . Further steps such as password authentication, SMS verification may also be performed as known to a person skilled in the art to authenticate the subscriber.","Once the request is successfully verified, the Internet access adjustment facilitator  checks the accounting database  to make sure that the subscriber has enough funds to pay for the \u2018boost\u2019.","Upon determining that there are enough funds in the subscriber pre-paid account or pre-paid card, the Internet access adjustment facilitator  proceeds to adjust the bandwidth settings for the subscriber of computing device . This is done via a bandwidth throttler, which either caps the data speed of connection between the computing device  to the internet or allows any excess available data bandwidth to the computing device , by the Internet access adjustment facilitator .","The Internet access adjustment facilitator  may include a detecting algorithm for detecting the usage profile of the subscriber for computing device .","It is to be appreciated that while the \u2018full access\u2019 and \u201cLimited access\u201d modes are mutually exclusive, the \u201cLimited access\u201d mode can operate simultaneously while on the \u201cBoost\u201d mode.","As an example, in the combination of \u201cBoost\u201d with \u201cLimited access\u201d mode, fast Internet access may advantageously be achieved for the selected whitelisted services at no cost for the user while slower for all others not on the White List. If Facebook\u2122 is on the whitelist, this means that the subscriber could enjoy a full, fast Facebook\u2122 experience; this will not be the case for non-whitelisted Apps. These non-whitelisted apps will operate at trickle speeds. Nonetheless for \u201cnotifications\u201d or when a new email is received or an IM message is sent, the Boost mode, running on trickling mode for non-whitelisted Apps, may be adequate.","It is to be understood that the above embodiments have been provided only by way of exemplification of this invention, and that further modifications and improvements thereto, as would be apparent to persons skilled in the relevant art, are deemed to fall within the broad scope and ambit of the present invention described herein. In particular, features from one or more embodiments may be combined to form further embodiments."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The present invention will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawing, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 2"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
