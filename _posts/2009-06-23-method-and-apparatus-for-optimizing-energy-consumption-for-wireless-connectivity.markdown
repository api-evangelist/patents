One area of development is the creation of services and applications with persistent wireless (e.g., \u201calways-on\u201d) connectivity to a data network (e.g., the Internet). Providing such always-on connectivity, however, taxes the power systems of mobile devices operating with limited power sources (e.g., batteries). In particular, persistent connections demand greater activity from the radio which, in turn, requires greater battery consumption.

The invention is also capable of other and different embodiments, and its several details can be modified in various obvious respects, all without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the drawings and description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature, and not as restrictive.","A method and apparatus for optimizing energy consumption for wireless connectivity are disclosed. In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments of the invention. It is apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the embodiments of the invention may be practiced without these specific details or with an equivalent arrangement. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the embodiments of the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"The firewall\/NAT state with respect to a connection is automatically created when a client inside of the firewall\/NAT initiates the connection. The firewall\/NAT state is then automatically removed once the connection has been unused for some time. Because the connection state is created by packets sent by the client, servers outside the firewall\/NAT are not able to reach the client if the state has expired (e.g., when no data is received for a predefined period of time). To prevent this, many protocols (e.g., TCP and UDP) regularly send keep-alive messages that reset the connection expiration timers in the firewall or NAT to ensure that persistent or always-on connections do not prematurely expire.","Traditionally, the keep-alive messages are dummy data packets that are specific to each application employing an always-on connection. Consequently, as the number of concurrent applications that require always-on connections on a mobile device increases, the number of keep-alive messages that must be sent also increases. By way of example, a user initiates a push E-mail application and an instant messaging application on the user's mobile device. Each application (e.g., the push E-mail application and the instant messaging application), would require separate keep-alive messages to maintain its respective always-on connection. Sending these keep-alive messages can consume significant amounts of energy and place a significant strain on the limited power sources of mobile devices operating off battery power.","To address the general problem of energy consumption when using always-on wireless connections as well as the specific problem of energy consumption when transmitting keep-alive messages over a wireless network, the system  of , according to certain embodiments, provides for (1) buffering non-real time data that is to be transmitted, and initiating transmission of the buffered data when the radio of the wireless device is in active state that is triggered by an even unrelated to the buffered non-real time data, e.g., a telephone call, a short message service (SMS) message, or a multimedia messaging service (MMS) message; (2) designating one common keep-alive message to represent multiple keep-alive messages corresponding to different applications; and (3) synchronizing the transmission of data from a client to a corresponding application server and the transmission of data from the application server to client so that they occur concurrently. These functions of the system  advantageously reduce the amount of time that the radio of a mobile device remains active, thereby also, reducing the overall energy consumption associated with always-on connections. The system  also reduces the complexity associated with signaling multiple keep-alive messages by using one keep-alive message to substitute for or represent multiple keep-alive messages. As used herein, the term \u201cnon-real time data\u201d refers to any data that need not be transmitted in real time. The non-real time data may include, for instance, E-mail messages, instant messaging, presence information, shared media content, etc.","As shown in , a system  comprises a user equipment (UE)  with connectivity to a communication network  via a network access point . The UE  is any type of mobile terminal, fixed terminal, or portable terminal including a mobile handset, station, unit, device, multimedia tablet, Internet node, communicator, desktop computer, laptop computer, Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), or a combination thereof. It is also contemplated that the UE  can support any type of interface to the user (such as \u201cwearable\u201d circuitry, etc.). In one embodiment, the UE  utilizes a power module  for power, which can be in form of a battery or a power adapter configured to plug into, for example, an electrical outlet.","By way of example, the communication network  of system  includes one or more networks such as a data network (not shown), a wireless network (not shown), a telephony network (not shown), or any combination thereof. It is contemplated that the data network may be any local area network (LAN), metropolitan area network (MAN), wide area network (WAN), a public network (e.g., the Internet), or any other suitable packet-switched network, such as a commercially owned, proprietary packet-switched network, e.g., a proprietary cable or fiber-optic network. In addition, the wireless network may be, for example, a cellular network and may employ various technologies including enhanced data rates for global evolution (EDGE), general packet radio service (GPRS), global system for mobile communications (GSM), Internet protocol multimedia subsystem (IMS), universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS), etc., as well as any other suitable wireless medium, e.g., microwave access (WiMAX), Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks, code division multiple access (CDMA), wireless fidelity (WiFi), satellite, mobile ad-hoc network (MANET), and the like.","In one embodiment, the network access point  is a base station which is, for instance, part of the wireless network (e.g., Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Long Term Evolution (LTE), 3GPP Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN), etc.) within the communication network . For example, the network access point  can employ one or more antennas for transmitting and receiving signals to support communication with the UE . The signals support, for instance, communication sessions such as telephone calls, SMS messaging, MMS messaging, transmission of keep-alive messages, or a combination thereof.","As shown in , the UE  includes a radio management module  to coordinate the optimization of data transmitted over the radio of the UE  to reduce energy consumption when using always-on wireless connections. The radio management module  has connectivity to a database  of data buffered in the UE  for subsequent transmission. In one embodiment, the radio management module  buffers data that does not require real-time or immediate transmission by the UE  (e.g., non-real time data) and stores the data in the database . The radio management module  can then initiate transmission of the buffered non-real time data when the radio of the UE  is in active state triggered by a radio event (e.g., any cellular radio activity) unrelated to the non-real time data (e.g., a telephone call, an SMS message, an MMS message, a keep-alive message, etc.). In one embodiment, the radio event can be any activity by a radio interface (not shown) of the UE . In this way, the radio management module  reduces the amount of time the radio spends in an active state, thereby reducing energy consumption. As used herein, the term \u201cactive state\u201d refers to a state in which the radio interface of the UE  is actively transmitting or receiving data or information over the radio network. While in an active state, the UE  draws power from the power module  to provide for transmitting or receiving data via the radio interface. In contrast, while in an inactive sate, the radio interface of the UE  draws less power (e.g., consumes less energy) because the radio interface is not drawing power to transmit or receive. It is also contemplated, that the UE  may place the radio interface into a lower power dormant state to further reduce energy consumption when the radio interface is in an inactive state.","The UE  also has connectivity to a radio management platform  and an application server  via the communication network . In one embodiment, the radio management platform  and the application server  interact to reduce energy consumption for wireless transmissions to the UE  over always-on connections by buffering non-real time data on the network side; the non-real time data are then sent to the UE  when the radio of the UE  is otherwise active with a communication task not related to the non-real time data.","More specifically, the radio management platform  resides on the network side of the communication network  to coordinate the buffering of non-real time data to be transmitted to the UE  from, for instance, the application server . Although the radio management platform  is depicted as a standalone component in the system , it is contemplated that the radio management platform  may be a component within the application server  or other component of the communication network .","The application server  can be any application that transmits and\/or receives data or information from the UE . For example, the application server  may support push E-mail services to the UE  by transporting E-mail data to the UE  as they are received. In another example, the application server  may support an instant messaging service whereby the application server  forwards the instant messages from the UE  and delivers instant messages directed to the UE . In one embodiment, the application server  stores buffered application data in the database  for subsequent transmission to the UE .","By way of example, the UE  communicates with the radio management platform , the application server , and other components of the communication network  using standard protocols (e.g., TCP, UDP). For example, the UE , the radio management platform , and the application server  are network nodes with respect to the communication network . In this context, a protocol includes a set of rules defining how the network nodes within the communication network  interact with each other based on information sent over the communication links. The protocols are effective at different layers of operation within each node, from generating and receiving physical signals of various types, to selecting a link for transferring those signals, to the format of information indicated by those signals, to identifying which software application executing on a computer system sends or receives the information. The conceptually different layers of protocols for exchanging information over a network are described in the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Reference Model.","Communications between the network nodes are typically effected by exchanging discrete packets of data. Each packet typically comprises (1) header information associated with a particular protocol, and (2) payload information that follows the header information and contains information that may be processed independently of that particular protocol. In some protocols, the packet includes (3) trailer information following the payload and indicating the end of the payload information. The header includes information such as the source of the packet, its destination, the length of the payload, and other properties used by the protocol. Often, the data in the payload for the particular protocol includes a header and payload for a different protocol associated with a different, higher layer of the OSI Reference Model. The header for a particular protocol typically indicates a type for the next protocol contained in its payload. The higher layer protocol is said to be encapsulated in the lower layer protocol. The headers included in a packet traversing multiple heterogeneous networks, such as the Internet, typically include a physical (layer 1) header, a data-link (layer 2) header, an internetwork (layer 3) header and a transport (layer 4) header, and various application headers (layer 5, layer 6 and layer 7) as defined by the OSI Reference Model.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["107","101","107","201","101","201","109","201","201","201","201","109"]},"As shown, the data control module  has connectivity to an activity detection module  for detecting when the radio  of the UE  is in an active state. In one embodiment, the radio  is a cellular radio for communicating over the wireless network of the communication network . The active state, for instance, may be triggered by a radio event unrelated to the buffered data (e.g., a telephone call, an SMS message, an MMS message, a keep-alive message, and the like). For example, the activity detection module  can either monitor the radio  for activity or the radio  can signal the activity detection module  when there is activity. On detecting activity by the radio , the data control module  directs the radio control module  to initiate transmission of the buffered data in the database . In this way, the radio management module  can take advantage of periods when the radio is already active performing other tasks to transmit the buffered data, thereby reducing the need to activate the radio at other times and reducing energy consumption. In one embodiment, the data control module  can initiate a complete \u201cflushing\u201d (e.g., transmitting and then emptying) of all data buffered since the last transmission. In addition or alternatively, the data control module  can initiate the transmission of the buffered data in discrete bursts that coincide with the duration of the active period of the radio .","The data control module  also has connectivity to a keep-alive signaling module  for designating one common keep-alive message to represent multiple keep-alive messages from a plurality of applications. In other words, the common keep-alive message substitutes for the individual keep-alive messages corresponding to each application associated with the common keep-alive message. Creating one keep-alive message for multiple applications advantageously reduces the signaling requirements for transmitting and maintaining multiple keep-alive messages, thereby also reducing energy consumption required for transmitting the keep-alive messages. In one embodiment, the common keep-alive message can reset the connection expiration timer (e.g., keep-alive timer) corresponding to the always-on connections of the applications associated with the common keep-alive message. In addition, transmission of data from any one of the associated applications can also reset the connection expiration timer for all of the applications associated with the same common keep-alive message.","The associated applications (e.g., client applications  on the UE  and the application server  on the communication network ) can access the functions of the keep-alive signaling module  through, for instance, an application programming interface (API)  within the radio management module . By way of example, the API  provides a set of routines, data structures, objects classes, and\/or protocols for applications (e.g., client applications  and the application server ) to access the functions of the keep-alive signaling module  in particular and the radio management module  in general. Client applications  comprise, for instance, applications that are run on the UE  to establish connections (e.g., always on connections) for transmitting and\/or receiving data or information from external applications such as the application server .","As shown in , the data control module  also has connectivity to a synchronization module  for synchronizing the exchange of data or information between the UE  and, for instance, the application server . For example, synchronization includes coordinating the timing of the transmission of data from the UE  to the application server  to occur concurrently with the transmission of data from the application server  to the UE . To assist in synchronizing, the synchronization module  interacts with the radio management platform  to coordinate the transmission of data and information with the application server . In one embodiment, the synchronization module  may dynamically detect radio activity to synchronize the transmissions or may negotiate a predefined schedule with the application server  for synchronized transmissions. The schedule may, for instance, specify specific times that the UE  and the application server  should make their respective transmissions. In this way, the active period of the radio  is used for both transmitting and receiving information, thereby minimizing the amount of the time the radio  is active and reducing energy consumption. As described with respect to the data control module  earlier, it is contemplated that the synchronized transmissions may occur as discrete bursts or a complete flushing of the buffered data.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["111","107","103","111","101","107","111","301","101","113","115","101","113","107","101","113","113"]},"A shown, the data control module  has connectivity to an activity detection module  for detecting when the application server  receives data from the UE  or when there is network traffic to or from the UE  at the network access point  (e.g., when the UE  is engaged in transmitting or receiving a telephone call, an SMS message, an MMS message, an instant message, a keep-alive message, etc.). Detection of either the reception of data by the application server  or network traffic related to the UE  at the network access point  indicates, for instance, that the radio  of the UE  is active. On such detection, the data control module  directs the application server  via an application programming interface (API)  to initiate transmission of the buffered application data from the database . As described with respect to the radio management module , the transmission may occur as a complete flush or as discrete bursts. Because the transmission coincides with an existing active state of the radio , energy consumption at the UE  is minimized when the UE receives the transmission from the application server .","The data control module  also has connectivity to a keep-alive signaling module  for receiving and processing a common keep-alive message from the UE . In one embodiment, the common keep-alive message is applicable to all applications associated with the common keep-alive message. For example, an application (e.g., on application server ) may associate itself with the common keep-alive message (e.g., combine the application's individual keep-alive message with the common keep-alive message) via the API . Once associated, the reception of the common keep-alive message by the keep-alive signaling module  will reset the connection expiration timer (e.g., keep-alive timer) corresponding to the associated applications. In certain embodiments, the reception of any data from any of the applications associated with the common keep-alive message will reset the connection expiration timer for all applications associated with the common keep-alive message. By way of example, if a push E-mail application and an instant messaging application are associated with one common keep-alive message, reception of the common keep-alive message will reset the connection expiration timer for both the push E-mail and instant messaging applications. Additionally, reception of data associated with either application will also reset the connection expiration timer for both the push E-mail and the instant messaging applications. In this way, the UE  need only send one common keep-alive message rather than multiple messages to maintain an always-on connection, thereby reducing activity of the radio  and reducing energy consumption.","As shown in , the data control module  also has connectivity to a synchronization module  for synchronizing the exchange of data or information between the application server  and the UE . As described with respect to the radio management module , synchronization includes coordinating the timing of the transmission of data from the network side (e.g., application server ) to occur concurrently with the transmission of data from the client side (e.g., the UE ). To assist in synchronizing, the synchronization module  interacts with the radio management module  of the UE  to coordinate the exchange of data. By way of example, the exchange of data between the application server  and the UE  may occur based on dynamic detection of when the radio  of the UE  is active or according to a predefined schedule negotiated between the application server  and the UE . Coordination of the transmission from network side with transmissions from the client side enables the UE  to minimize energy consumption by fully utilizing both the transmitting and receiving channels of the radio  of the UE .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 11"],"b":["107","400","401","107","101","100","101","100","107","103","403","107","101","101","101","107","101","405","107"]},"If the radio is, for instance, in an active state, the radio management module  schedules the transmission of the buffered data over the communication network  (step ). In one embodiment, the transmission is scheduled to occur during the detected active state or when the radio is otherwise active if possible. For example, when the radio management module  detects that the UE  is receiving a telephone call, the module schedules transmission of the buffered data to occur while the radio is active on the telephone call. If, however, the radio is not anticipated to be active within a predetermined time period, the radio management module  may schedule the transmission for a time when the radio is not already in an active state. After scheduling the transmission, the radio management module  determines a communication type for carrying or transmitting the non-real time date. In one embodiment, the communication type for carrying the data is either a keep-alive message (as described previously) or a payload message. As used herein, a \u201cpayload message\u201d is a message transmitted over the communication network  that carries data from, for instance, the application server , client applications , or other network component (step ).","By way of example, if the communication type is a keep-alive message, the radio management module  inserts the non-real time data into the keep-alive message in place of dummy data that is normally part of the keep-alive message. In this way, actual data rather than dummy data may be used to construct the keep-alive message. Because the keep-alive message carrying the non-real time data serves the dual purpose of both conveying data and maintaining data connections, the radio management module  can delay the transmission of a keep-alive message that is scheduled for a subsequent time period (e.g., the next keep-alive message) (step ). It is noted that the next keep-alive generally would not be needed because the keep-alive message carrying the non-real time data can substitute for the next keep-alive message. The radio management module  then initiates transmission of the non-real time data based on the determined communication type (e.g., via either the keep-alive message or the payload message) (step ). In addition, if the determined communication type is a payload message, the radio management module  can initiate transmission of the payload message without performing the process at  (step ).","This transmission scheme reduces the number of periods in which the radio is active to reduce energy consumption. In one embodiment, the buffered non-real-time data may be associated with one or more priority classifications. These priority classifications, direct the transmission priorities of individual portions of the buffered data. For example, buffered non-real time data with the highest priority classification will be transmitted first, followed by progressively lower classifications. In certain embodiments, the priority classification may also specify a particular time window in which the buffered data must be transmitted.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 11"],"b":["107","500","501","107","101","113","101","113","107","101","113","213","307","101","113","101","107","107","101","113","503"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 11"],"b":["107","600","601","107","107","603","605","107","113","607","113","213","307"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 11","FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["111","700","700","400","701","111","113","101","113","111","103","703","101","113","101"]},"In one embodiment, the transmission of the buffered data is triggered by the receipt of data from the UE  or when there is network traffic involving the UE .

If no data is received, the radio management platform  determines whether there is any network activity to or from the UE  at the network access point  (step ). Activity at the network access point  indicates that the radio of the UE  may be actively transmitting or receiving (e.g., when on a telephone call, SMS message session, MMS message session, etc.). For example, the radio management platform  can either poll the network access point  for the activity or the network access point  can report the activity to the radio management platform . It is contemplated that the network activity is unrelated to the buffered non-real time data. In addition, the network activity need not be directed from the UE  to the application server  because the process  can depend on any active state of the radio  of the UE .

A sensor detects conditions in its vicinity and transforms those detections into physical expression compatible with the measurable phenomenon used to represent information in computer system . Other external devices coupled to bus , used primarily for interacting with humans, include a display device , such as a cathode ray tube (CRT) or a liquid crystal display (LCD), or plasma screen or printer for presenting text or images, and a pointing device , such as a mouse or a trackball or cursor direction keys, or motion sensor, for controlling a position of a small cursor image presented on the display  and issuing commands associated with graphical elements presented on the display . In some embodiments, for example, in embodiments in which the computer system  performs all functions automatically without human input, one or more of external input device , display device  and pointing device  is omitted.","In the illustrated embodiment, special purpose hardware, such as an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) , is coupled to bus . The special purpose hardware is configured to perform operations not performed by processor  quickly enough for special purposes. Examples of application specific ICs include graphics accelerator cards for generating images for display , cryptographic boards for encrypting and decrypting messages sent over a network, speech recognition, and interfaces to special external devices, such as robotic arms and medical scanning equipment that repeatedly perform some complex sequence of operations that are more efficiently implemented in hardware.","Computer system  also includes one or more instances of a communications interface  coupled to bus . Communication interface  provides a one-way or two-way communication coupling to a variety of external devices that operate with their own processors, such as printers, scanners and external disks. In general the coupling is with a network link  that is connected to a local network  to which a variety of external devices with their own processors are connected. For example, communication interface  may be a parallel port or a serial port or a universal serial bus (USB) port on a personal computer. In some embodiments, communications interface  is an integrated services digital network (ISDN) card or a digital subscriber line (DSL) card or a telephone modem that provides an information communication connection to a corresponding type of telephone line. In some embodiments, a communication interface  is a cable modem that converts signals on bus  into signals for a communication connection over a coaxial cable or into optical signals for a communication connection over a fiber optic cable. As another example, communications interface  may be a local area network (LAN) card to provide a data communication connection to a compatible LAN, such as Ethernet. Wireless links may also be implemented. For wireless links, the communications interface  sends or receives or both sends and receives electrical, acoustic or electromagnetic signals, including infrared and optical signals, that carry information streams, such as digital data. For example, in wireless handheld devices, such as mobile telephones like cell phones, the communications interface  includes a radio band electromagnetic transmitter and receiver called a radio transceiver. In certain embodiments, the communications interface  enables connection to the communication network  for optimizing energy consumption for wireless connectivity.","The term computer-readable medium is used herein to refer to any medium that participates in providing information to processor , including instructions for execution. Such a medium may take many forms, including, but not limited to, non-volatile media, volatile media and transmission media. Non-volatile media include, for example, optical or magnetic disks, such as storage device . Volatile media include, for example, dynamic memory . Transmission media include, for example, coaxial cables, copper wire, fiber optic cables, and carrier waves that travel through space without wires or cables, such as acoustic waves and electromagnetic waves, including radio, optical and infrared waves. Signals include man-made transient variations in amplitude, frequency, phase, polarization or other physical properties transmitted through the transmission media. Common forms of computer-readable media include, for example, a floppy disk, a flexible disk, hard disk, magnetic tape, any other magnetic medium, a CD-ROM, CDRW, DVD, any other optical medium, punch cards, paper tape, optical mark sheets, any other physical medium with patterns of holes or other optically recognizable indicia, a RAM, a PROM, an EPROM, a FLASH-EPROM, any other memory chip or cartridge, a carrier wave, or any other medium from which a computer can read. The term computer-readable storage medium is used herein to refer to any computer-readable medium except transmission media.","Logic encoded in one or more tangible media includes one or both of processor instructions on a computer-readable storage media and special purpose hardware, such as ASIC .","Network link  typically provides information communication using transmission media through one or more networks to other devices that use or process the information. For example, network link  may provide a connection through local network  to a host computer  or to equipment  operated by an Internet Service Provider (ISP). ISP equipment  in turn provides data communication services through the public, world-wide packet-switching communication network of networks now commonly referred to as the Internet . A computer called a server host  connected to the Internet hosts a process that provides a service in response to information received over the Internet. For example, server host  hosts a process that provides information representing video data for presentation at display .","At least some embodiments of the invention are related to the use of computer system  for implementing some or all of the techniques described herein. According to one embodiment of the invention, those techniques are performed by computer system  in response to processor  executing one or more sequences of one or more processor instructions contained in memory . Such instructions, also called computer instructions, software and program code, may be read into memory  from another computer-readable medium such as storage device  or network link . Execution of the sequences of instructions contained in memory  causes processor  to perform one or more of the method steps described herein. In alternative embodiments, hardware, such as ASIC , may be used in place of or in combination with software to implement the invention. Thus, embodiments of the invention are not limited to any specific combination of hardware and software, unless otherwise explicitly stated herein.","The signals transmitted over network link  and other networks through communications interface , carry information to and from computer system . Computer system  can send and receive information, including program code, through the networks ,  among others, through network link  and communications interface . In an example using the Internet , a server host  transmits program code for a particular application, requested by a message sent from computer , through Internet , ISP equipment , local network  and communications interface . The received code may be executed by processor  as it is received, or may be stored in memory  or in storage device  or other non-volatile storage for later execution, or both. In this manner, computer system  may obtain application program code in the form of signals on a carrier wave.","Various forms of computer readable media may be involved in carrying one or more sequence of instructions or data or both to processor  for execution. For example, instructions and data may initially be carried on a magnetic disk of a remote computer such as host . The remote computer loads the instructions and data into its dynamic memory and sends the instructions and data over a telephone line using a modem. A modem local to the computer system  receives the instructions and data on a telephone line and uses an infra-red transmitter to convert the instructions and data to a signal on an infra-red carrier wave serving as the network link . An infrared detector serving as communications interface  receives the instructions and data carried in the infrared signal and places information representing the instructions and data onto bus . Bus  carries the information to memory  from which processor  retrieves and executes the instructions using some of the data sent with the instructions. The instructions and data received in memory  may optionally be stored on storage device , either before or after execution by the processor .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0071"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 10"],"b":["1100","1100"]},"In one embodiment, the chip set  includes a communication mechanism such as a bus  for passing information among the components of the chip set . A processor  has connectivity to the bus  to execute instructions and process information stored in, for example, a memory . The processor  may include one or more processing cores with each core configured to perform independently. A multi-core processor enables multiprocessing within a single physical package. Examples of a multi-core processor include two, four, eight, or greater numbers of processing cores. Alternatively or in addition, the processor  may include one or more microprocessors configured in tandem via the bus  to enable independent execution of instructions, pipelining, and multithreading. The processor  may also be accompanied with one or more specialized components to perform certain processing functions and tasks such as one or more digital signal processors (DSP) , or one or more application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) . A DSP  typically is configured to process real-world signals (e.g., sound) in real time independently of the processor . Similarly, an ASIC  can be configured to performed specialized functions not easily performed by a general purposed processor. Other specialized components to aid in performing the inventive functions described herein include one or more field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) (not shown), one or more controllers (not shown), or one or more other special-purpose computer chips.","The processor  and accompanying components have connectivity to the memory  via the bus . The memory  includes both dynamic memory (e.g., RAM, magnetic disk, writable optical disk, etc.) and static memory (e.g., ROM, CD-ROM, etc.) for storing executable instructions that when executed perform the inventive steps described herein to optimize energy consumption for wireless connectivity. The memory  also stores the data associated with or generated by the execution of the inventive steps.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0074"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 1"]},"Pertinent internal components of the telephone include a Main Control Unit (MCU) , a Digital Signal Processor (DSP) , and a receiver\/transmitter unit including a microphone gain control unit and a speaker gain control unit. A main display unit  provides a display to the user in support of various applications and mobile station functions that offer automatic contact matching. An audio function circuitry  includes a microphone  and microphone amplifier that amplifies the speech signal output from the microphone . The amplified speech signal output from the microphone  is fed to a coder\/decoder (CODEC) .","A radio section  amplifies power and converts frequency in order to communicate with a base station, which is included in a mobile communication system, via antenna . The power amplifier (PA)  and the transmitter\/modulation circuitry are operationally responsive to the MCU , with an output from the PA  coupled to the duplexer  or circulator or antenna switch, as known in the art. The PA  also couples to a battery interface and power control unit .","In use, a user of mobile station  speaks into the microphone  and his or her voice along with any detected background noise is converted into an analog voltage. The analog voltage is then converted into a digital signal through the Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) . The control unit  routes the digital signal into the DSP  for processing therein, such as speech encoding, channel encoding, encrypting, and interleaving. In one embodiment, the processed voice signals are encoded, by units not separately shown, using a cellular transmission protocol such as global evolution (EDGE), general packet radio service (GPRS), global system for mobile communications (GSM), Internet protocol multimedia subsystem (IMS), universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS), etc., as well as any other suitable wireless medium, e.g., microwave access (WiMAX), Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks, code division multiple access (CDMA), wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA), wireless fidelity (WiFi), satellite, and the like.","The encoded signals are then routed to an equalizer  for compensation of any frequency-dependent impairments that occur during transmission though the air such as phase and amplitude distortion. After equalizing the bit stream, the modulator  combines the signal with a RF signal generated in the RF interface . The modulator  generates a sine wave by way of frequency or phase modulation. In order to prepare the signal for transmission, an up-converter  combines the sine wave output from the modulator  with another sine wave generated by a synthesizer  to achieve the desired frequency of transmission. The signal is then sent through a PA  to increase the signal to an appropriate power level. In practical systems, the PA  acts as a variable gain amplifier whose gain is controlled by the DSP  from information received from a network base station. The signal is then filtered within the duplexer  and optionally sent to an antenna coupler  to match impedances to provide maximum power transfer. Finally, the signal is transmitted via antenna  to a local base station. An automatic gain control (AGC) can be supplied to control the gain of the final stages of the receiver. The signals may be forwarded from there to a remote telephone which may be another cellular telephone, other mobile phone or a land-line connected to a Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), or other telephony networks.","Voice signals transmitted to the mobile station  are received via antenna  and immediately amplified by a low noise amplifier (LNA) . A down-converter  lowers the carrier frequency while the demodulator  strips away the RF leaving only a digital bit stream. The signal then goes through the equalizer  and is processed by the DSP . A Digital to Analog Converter (DAC)  converts the signal and the resulting output is transmitted to the user through the speaker , all under control of a Main Control Unit (MCU) \u2014which can be implemented as a Central Processing Unit (CPU) (not shown).","The MCU  receives various signals including input signals from the keyboard . The keyboard  and\/or the MCU  in combination with other user input components (e.g., the microphone ) comprise a user interface circuitry for managing user input. The MCU  runs a user interface software to facilitate user control of at least some functions of the mobile station  to optimize energy consumption for wireless connectivity. The MCU  also delivers a display command and a switch command to the display  and to the speech output switching controller, respectively. Further, the MCU  exchanges information with the DSP  and can access an optionally incorporated SIM card  and a memory . In addition, the MCU  executes various control functions required of the station. The DSP  may, depending upon the implementation, perform any of a variety of conventional digital processing functions on the voice signals. Additionally, DSP  determines the background noise level of the local environment from the signals detected by microphone  and sets the gain of microphone  to a level selected to compensate for the natural tendency of the user of the mobile station .","The CODEC  includes the ADC  and DAC . The memory  stores various data including call incoming tone data and is capable of storing other data including music data received via, e.g., the global Internet. The software module could reside in RAM memory, flash memory, registers, or any other form of writable storage medium known in the art. The memory device  may be, but not limited to, a single memory, CD, DVD, ROM, RAM, EEPROM, optical storage, or any other non-volatile storage medium capable of storing digital data.","An optionally incorporated SIM card  carries, for instance, important information, such as the cellular phone number, the carrier supplying service, subscription details, and security information. The SIM card  serves primarily to identify the mobile station  on a radio network. The card  also contains a memory for storing a personal telephone number registry, text messages, and user specific mobile station settings.","While the invention has been described in connection with a number of embodiments and implementations, the invention is not so limited but covers various obvious modifications and equivalent arrangements, which fall within the purview of the appended claims.
