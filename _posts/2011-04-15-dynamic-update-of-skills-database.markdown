title: Dynamic update of skills database
abstract: A device may include a communication interface to receive messages, a skills database that includes a skills schedule table, and one or more processors. The one or more processors may detect an event based on one of the messages, determine whether the event satisfies a condition for changing a schedule associated with a skill of a call agent of a call center, modify the schedule in the skills schedule table when the event satisfies the condition for changing the schedule associated with the skill of the call agent, and send a request, based on the modified schedule associated with the skill of the call agent, to an automatic call distribution (ACD) device to change the skill of the call agent from a database of the ACD device.

More advanced call centers rely on speech recognition subsystems in place of or in addition to DTMF signaling to provide similar functionalities.","The following detailed description refers to the accompanying drawings. The same reference numbers in different drawings may identify the same or similar elements. As used herein, the terms \u201ccall forwarding\u201d or \u201ccall routing\u201d may include establishing a session between the calling party and a party to which the call is forwarded from the called party. In some instances, forwarding\/routing may include terminating a session, if it exists, between the caller and called party. At a call center, a device may forward\/route inbound calls to call center agents (e.g., sales person, technical support agent, software agent (as opposed to a person), etc.).","As described below, a system may automatically reconfigure an automatic call distribution (ACD) logic or ACD-related system. More specifically, upon detection of specific types of events, the system may automatically update one or more information bases (e.g., files, database, tables, linked lists, etc.). The system may use the information base to configure the ACD logic to associate or disassociate skills with call agents. When the ACD logic receives a call, the ACD logic may select a call center agent whose skill set matches requirements for handling the call and forward the call to the selected call center agent.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","1","102","102","102","104","218","106","1","106","106","106","102","106","102","106"]},"Caller device  may call a call center that includes call routing system . Caller device  may call the call center to receive customer service, access information, purchase a product or a service, etc. Calls from caller device  may include a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) calls, H.323 calls, etc. These calls may provide for different types of communications, such as telephone call (plain old telephones system (POTS) calls), videoconference calls, videophone calls, text messaging sessions, Voice-over-Internet Protocol (VoIP) calls, etc.).","Network  may include one or more public switched telephone networks (PSTNs) or another type of switched network (e.g., an optical network). Network  may also include a number of transmission towers for receiving wireless signals and forwarding the signals toward the intended destination. Network  may further include one or more packet switched networks, such as an Internet protocol (IP) based network, a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), a personal area network (PAN), an intranet, the Internet, or another type of network (e.g., a satellite-based network) that is capable of exchanging information.","As further shown, network  may include call routing system . In some implementations, call routing system  may reside in a call center or at a remote location connected to the call center over an IP network. Call routing system  may receive calls, park calls, guide calls through menus, and\/or route (e.g., forward) the calls to available call agent devices . Call agent device  may connect to caller device  via call routing system .","Call routing system , in routing\/forwarding calls to call agent devices , identifies call agents whose skills match caller requirements conveyed to call routing system  via various mechanisms, such as speech recognition, dual tone multi-frequency (DTMF) tones, etc. Call routing system  may forward the calls to the identified agents.","In call routing system , logic for distributing received calls (herein referred to as \u201cACD logic\u201d) may require frequent reconfiguration for a number of reasons. For example, a call agent may acquire a new skill, and thus, become capable of resolving new caller issues. To route calls that require the new skill to the call agent, call routing system  may need to reconfigure the ACD logic, to accurately reflect the call agent's knowledge base. In another example, whether a call agent should be allowed to handle a particular type of call may be impacted by the skill set of another agent. Assume that a call agent X has a skill A and skill B, and that a call agent Y with skill B is hired. If handling calls that require skill A is more important than handling calls that require skill B, the ACD logic may be reconfigured to prevent call agent X from handling calls that require skill B. In yet another example, the call routing system  may need to reconfigure the ACD logic in accordance with performance metrics that change over time. Assume that call agents have skill A and skill B, respectively associated with high priority calls and low priority calls. Also assume that measured average number of low priority calls whose handling requires skill B increases. To prevent too many agents from handling the low priority calls, call routing system  may reconfigure the ACD logic.","In each of the above scenarios, call routing system  may automatically configure or reconfigure the ACD logic, such that the ACD logic continues to route incoming calls in accordance with the current skills of the call agents, call agent work schedules, call priorities, call center policies, and\/or other business-related rules. Without call routing system  automatically reconfiguring the ACD logic, an operator or an administrator may need to manually modify operating parameters of the ACD logic. For organizations with large call centers, this may necessitate significant allocation of resources.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","218","200","210","230","240","250","104","102","2","274","250","252","254","256","258","102","1","260","250","254","102","1","256","258","260"]},"ONT  may receive data, e.g., on a fiber optic cable, and may transfer the data to the appropriate device in customer premises , such as computer  or STB .

Skill schedule  may indicate when a particular skill of the call agent may be available during work hours. Availability field  may indicate whether a skill of a call agent is in ACD logic 's internal database.

For example, a call center may maintain call agents' schedules on an electronic calendar (e.g., for assigning different shifts) or agent-skills assignment table . Accordingly, skills database update logic  may query the calendar and\/or agent-skills assignment table  to obtain the latest schedules. In some instances, a calendar program may send notifications to skills database update logic .","Skills database update logic  may also detect a change in employment status (e.g., newly hired, terminated, transferred, promoted, etc.).

Modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teachings or may be acquired from practice of the teachings.","For example, while series of blocks have been described with regard to an exemplary process illustrated in , the order of the blocks may be modified in other implementations. In addition, non-dependent blocks may represent acts that can be performed in parallel to other blocks. Furthermore, one or more of the blocks may be omitted in other implementations.","It will be apparent that aspects described herein may be implemented in many different forms of software, firmware, and hardware in the implementations illustrated in the figures. The actual software code or specialized control hardware used to implement aspects does not limit the invention. Thus, the operation and behavior of the aspects were described without reference to the specific software code\u2014it being understood that software and control hardware can be designed to implement the aspects based on the description herein.","Further, certain portions of the implementations have been described as \u201clogic\u201d that performs one or more functions. This logic may include hardware, such as a processor, a microprocessor, an application specific integrated circuit, or a field programmable gate array, software, or a combination of hardware and software. No element, act, or instruction used in the present application should be construed as critical or essential to the implementations described herein unless explicitly described as such. Also, as used herein, the article \u201ca\u201d is intended to include one or more items. Further, the phrase \u201cbased on\u201d is intended to mean \u201cbased, at least in part, on\u201d unless explicitly stated otherwise."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0003","num":"0002"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0004","num":"0003"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0005","num":"0004"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIGS. 1 through 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIGS. 1 through 3"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
