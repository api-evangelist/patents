{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["As the reach and accessibility of computer networks such as the Internet increase, the amount of information accessible via such networks has grown exponentially. For example, as commercial enterprises increasingly embrace electronic commerce techniques, numerous websites offering information and purchasing opportunities for various products and services have appeared. Major media outlets commonly provide web-based versions of content previously available only through print or broadcast channels, and in some instances generate considerable volumes of content exclusively for web-based distribution. The reduction of cost, complexity and other barriers to entry into web-based content publishing has also facilitated the generation and dissemination of content by individual creators. This phenomenon is perhaps best illustrated by the increasing number and popularity of commercial opportunities, referred to as e-commerce, which offer the ability to sell goods, services and information online.","As the amount of online content increases, the difficulty of locating content that is of general or specific interest also increases. Unlike libraries, which may employ standardized systems of content classification such as the Library of Congress System or the Dewey Decimal System, no standard for organizing and representing web-based content exists. Numerous search engines have evolved to attempt to index web pages according to the page contents (e.g., as given by the textual content actually displayed by the page when loaded into a browser or client, or by concealed metadata such as tags associated with or embedded within the page). Such search engines have further attempted to qualify the relevance of a given indexed page using other features of the page, such as its age and\/or the number of links to the given indexed page from other indexed pages. For example, for a given keyword search, a page that satisfies the search criteria and is linked to from many sources may be considered a more relevant search result than a page having fewer external references.","While the invention is described herein by way of example for several embodiments and illustrative drawings, those skilled in the art will recognize that the invention is not limited to the embodiments or drawings described. It should be understood, that the drawings and detailed description thereto are not intended to limit the invention to the particular form disclosed, but on the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, equivalents and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims. Any headings used herein are for organizational purposes only and are not meant to limit the scope of the description or the claims. As used herein, the word \u201cmay\u201d is used in a permissive sense (i.e., meaning having the potential to), rather than the mandatory sense (i.e., meaning must). Similarly, the words \u201cinclude\u201d, \u201cincluding\u201d, and \u201cincludes\u201d mean including, but not limited to.","Comparison of the path followed by a current user to previous paths followed by previous users allows embodiments to facilitate the formation of inferences with respect to an intent of the current user. By inferring user intent, embodiments allow for the selection of content designed to facilitate the inferred intent or expected behaviors associated with the inferred intent and for the provision of that content to the user. In some embodiments, the path followed by a device associated with the current user and the paths followed by devices associated with previous users include network navigation information reflecting requests for content received from the device associated with the current user and the devices associated with the previous users, respectively. In some embodiments, the path followed by a device associated with the current user and the paths followed by devices associated with previous users include physical navigation information reflecting location data received with respect to the device associated with the current user and the devices associated with the previous users, respectively. In some embodiments, the path followed by a device associated with the current user and the paths followed by devices associated with previous users include both network navigation information and physical navigation information with respect to the device associated with the current user and the devices associated with the previous users, respectively.","In some embodiments, path information is coupled to contextual information, called contextual flags, to offer enhanced inferences with respect to user intent. Examples of context flags include information such as the recency or staleness of paths and behavior, which allow embodiments to give higher amounts of weight to recently followed paths. Other examples of contextual flags include enhanced weightings of paths or behaviors that are repeated by one or multiple users, or decreased weightings of paths that fail to reliably predict an expected behavior. As another example of contextual flags, if a group of paths include a particular location, a geographic information system (GIS) context data store is consulted to ascertain activities occurring at that location to enhance the quality of inferences with respect to user intent that are generated. As a further example, if a group of paths include a particular content source on a network, the content of the network data source is reviewed to ascertain activities associated with that content data source to enhance the quality of inferences with respect to user intent that are generated, as discussed below.","One embodiment of a system configured to facilitate the distribution of online content is illustrated in .  depicts a logical block diagram illustrating various components of a system configured to infer user intent from one or more of network navigation paths and physical navigation paths and communicate advertising content appropriate to an expected behavior associated with an intent group composed of such paths, according to one embodiment. In the illustrated embodiment, a number of hosts  are configured to receive requests for online content from a number of content requestors  via a network . Additionally, an intent analysis (IA) system  including a web services (WS) interface  and a traffic analysis (TA) engine  is configured to communicate with hosts  via network . As noted below in conjunction with the description of , in some embodiments some or all of the components illustrated in  may be partially or entirely implemented as computer-executable instructions and data stored via a computer-accessible medium.","Generally speaking, hosts  may be instances of online content sources, where a content source may encompass any suitable type of data that may be conveyed over a network, including but not limited to text documents, still image data, audio data, video data, metadata such as markup language tags, communication protocol data such as content preambles\/epilogues, and so forth. In many embodiments, hosts  may be configured to provide online content to requestors  via web-based data request and transport protocols. For example, hosts  may be configured to host web sites implementing Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) corresponding to web pages, documents or other online content, and to receive requests for access to particular URLs formatted in a version of the Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP) data transport protocol. In response to such requests, hosts  may be configured to access the content corresponding to the requested URL and to provide it to the requestor  in accordance with the HTTP protocol. It is contemplated that in some embodiments, application layer data transport protocols other than or in addition to HTTP may be used to convey requests for content and the resulting content to and from hosts . For example, a secure, authenticated version of HTTP may be employed, as may a version of File Transfer Protocol (FTP) or any other suitable protocol.","In some embodiments, a given host  may be configured as a self-contained, standalone web server that both stores online content and receives and processes requests for stored content. In other embodiments, a given host  may be included within a complex content server architecture. For example, host  may be configured as an application or content server that does not actually store content, but is instead configured to retrieve requested content from a database or other repository (not shown) that may not be directly connected to network .","Network(s)  may include any suitable data network or combination of networks configured for communicating content requests and content between traffic pattern analysis system  and mobile service provider . For example, network  may include one or more Local Area Networks (LANs) such as Ethernet networks, as well as Wide Area Networks (WANs), Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs), or other data or telecommunication networks implemented over any suitable medium, such as electrical or optical cable, or via any suitable wireless standard such as IEEE 802.11 (\u201cWi-Fi\u201d), IEEE 802.16 (\u201cWiMax\u201d), etc. In various embodiments, all or a portion of network  may encompass the network infrastructure commonly referred to as the Internet. In other embodiments, network  may be entirely contained within an enterprise and not directly accessible from the Internet.","Content requestors  in general may encompass any device, system or software application that may be configured to request online content. For example, a requestor  may include a general purpose computing system configured to implement a web browser such as a version of Microsoft\u2122 Internet Explorer\u2122, Firefox, Opera\u2122, or another suitable web browser or client application, as is described below with respect to . Requestor  may also include functionality defined by scripts, such as JavaScript modules, configured to execute in a standalone environment or an execution environment provided by a web browser. Requestor  may alternatively be configured to host a syndicated content aggregator that may use a publish\/subscribe protocol such as RSS to notify users of the existence of new or updated online content. In some embodiments, mobile requestors  may include mobile devices, such as cellular phone or wireless devices configured to request online content via embedded clients, as is described below with respect to . A requestor  may further encompass other types of network-attached devices such as television set-top boxes, digital video recorders, etc.","While online content hosted by hosts  may often conform to a web-based model in which content may be requested via URLs and delivered to a web browser or other web client, this is not a requirement for the methods and techniques described below. Broadly speaking, hosts  may host any type of online content and may interact with requestors  according to any suitable request\/response model to provide the hosted content. For example, in some embodiments, hosts  may be configured as databases, file systems, or other types of data repositories accessible by protocols other than web-based protocols.","Content Request Traffic Data Collection","As described above, a host  may receive content request traffic from various requestors  that is directed to online content hosted by host . For example, a host  may receive HTTP GET requests directed to a particular URL, or a different type of content request according to a different data transport protocol. In the illustrated embodiment, hosts  may be instrumented with traffic reporting logic , which in various embodiments may include scripts, code or hardwired logic configured to report content request traffic to interest analysis system , including information identifying particular devices, such as individual ones or groups of requestors  or mobile requestors , to particular content requests.","In one embodiment, traffic reporting logic  may be configured to invoke one or more web services (WS) calls targeting the WS interface  of IA system  as the service endpoint, and network traffic information, such as content requests, can be stored in an intent database . One embodiment of such an intent database  is discussed below with respect to . In one embodiment host  may detect an incoming HTTP GET request specifying a given URL. In response, IA system  may be notified of the content request traffic via a web services call and the reported request traffic may be stored in intent database . For example, traffic reporting logic  may be configured to issue a web services call according to the following format:\n\n","It is noted that in some embodiments, when a user navigates away from content on a particular host  to a different content source (e.g., a URL hosted by a different host ), the particular host  may be configured to detect the outgoing transition. In some such embodiments, hosts  may be configured to report such outgoing content request traffic via traffic reporting logic  in addition to incoming content request traffic. Since navigation away from one content source typically implies navigation towards another, even if the target host is not instrumented to report content request traffic data (e.g., with an instance of traffic reporting logic ), in some circumstances content request traffic data may still be captured by the host that is navigated away from.","Location Information Collection","In addition to paths based on network traffic, some embodiments of intent analysis system  are equipped to ascertain paths including location information or paths based on both location information and network traffic, as described below. In such embodiments, an intent of a mobile requestor  may be inferred based on a navigation path including physical locations of mobile requestor  as well as, in some embodiments, a content request traffic pattern, current location, and in some embodiments, demographic information regarding a user of mobile requestor .","Physical navigation path or traffic pattern information regarding mobile device user navigation between and among physical locations, such as among various stores in a shopping mall, may be analyzed to determine navigation paths between and among the locations. Such paths may be used to infer intent that is used as an aid in various types of advertising decisions, such as directing electronic advertising or coupons for a behavior associated with various paths that are statistically comparable to the path of the mobile device user, thus facilitating the expected behavior. Mobile device users' navigation paths such as the order in which users navigate among stores in a shopping mall, venders in flea market or rides in an amusement park, may be collected and may be aggregated over time to infer user intent and, from the inferred intent, recommend content appropriate to the inferred intent.","Positional information regarding the current location of a mobile device user may be obtained in any of various manners, according to various embodiments. For example, mobile devices are increasingly required to provide Global Positioning Information, such as to support 911 and other emergency services. Thus, mobile requestor  may determine its current location using position reporting logic  applied to signals from Global Positioning Satellites  and transmit its current location to a mobile service provider . Such transmission is, in some embodiments, accomplished via the normal wireless communication of the mobile device, for example via a network of communication towers , such as mobile, cellular and\/or satellite communication towers. Thus, in some embodiments, the location of a mobile device user may be tracked via GPS data provided by the device itself for assembly into a path by intent analysis system . In various embodiments, mobile requestor  may represent a mobile (e.g., cellular) phone, a GPS navigation device (either handheld or vehicle installed), pager, or generally any wireless device, such as a PDA or other handheld computer, that can be tracked positionally and treated as a requestor for the purposes of predicting intent and providing intent-dependent advertising.","Alternatively, the location of a mobile device user may be determined by cell-signal triangulation by mobile service provider . As radio, wireless and cellular signal triangulation is well understood in the art, the details thereof will not be discussed herein. In general, any method of determining the location of mobile device user may be used to provide mobile device path navigation data for analysis as described herein.","Mobile service provider  may provide a service of distributing mobile device user's locations via any of various means, such as via a web-based interface over network , according to different embodiments. In some embodiments, the mobile device user may have signed up or agreed to have his\/her movements and content requests tracked and to have information regarding resulting paths analyzed and included in data utilized by intent analysis system  to infer user intent and to suggest and\/or recommend content designed to facilitate expected behaviors. For instance, a mobile device user's service contract with mobile service provider  may include language giving mobile service provider  permission to track the user's movements and content requests and\/or to provide positional information regarding the user's movements and content requests to third parties, such as to intent analysis system  for path analysis, intent grouping, intent-dependent advertising, predicting and or recommending behavior and providing appropriate content.","An in-vehicle navigational device may act as a mobile requestor  and may also include (either as installed or via an update) aggregated navigational trail information and the navigational device may be configured to analyze the vehicles movement according to the navigational information to recommend destinations and\/or to provide advertising content for destinations, as described herein.","Additionally, in some embodiments, a user of a requestor  or mobile requestor  may be able to turn on and off the reporting of positional information and content requests as desired and to turn on or off the receipt of any intent-dependent advertising and content communications. In yet other embodiments, a user of a requestor  or mobile requestor  may allow positional and network navigation information regarding his\/her movements and content requests to be tracked, provided to third parties and used in traffic pattern analysis, path-dependent advertising, predicting and recommending destinations while also opting out of receiving any intent-dependent content, coupons, or recommended transactions.","In some embodiments, intent analysis system  may be configured to communicate with mobile server provider  over network  to obtain the location of mobile requestors  and to communicate with hosts  to obtain content requests of requestors  and mobile requestors . In other embodiments, mobile service provider  or host  may be configured to expose an application programming interface (API) or other protocol for providing positional and content request information regarding requestors  and mobile requestors .","In some embodiments, intent analysis system  may be configured to obtain (or receive) location and content request information regarding mobile device users from different mobile service providers . Intent analysis system  may be configured to store the location and content request information in intent database  for current or future analysis. For example, intent analysis system  may be configured to continuously receive and analyze positional and content request information regarding many different requestors over the course of days, weeks, months or even years to build path data structures comprising location and content request as well as related behavior, and to group the path data structures into intent groupings. These paths, once stored, may be compared to a current path for inferring intent and providing content appropriate to that intent. Intent analysis system  may store the individual path data structures in any suitable database format.","Inferring Intent from Path Data",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":"230"},"In some embodiments, after a device requests content or is identified at a particular location, intent database  may be consulted to infer the intent of the user of the device. Such an inference of intent may be constructed by identifying intent groupings containing paths of content requests specifying content similar to content that is specified in a path containing a current content request and\/or previous content requests of the current device. Such an inference of intent may alternatively be constructed by identifying intent groupings containing paths of locations similar to locations specified in a path containing a current location and\/or previous locations of the current device. Paths are recorded to path data stores such as a navigation paths data store  for recording paths storing histories of network navigation requests by various devices and associated behavior information, a physical paths data store  for recording paths storing histories of the physical locations of various devices and associated behavior information and an integrated paths data store  for storing histories of content requests by and physical locations of various devices and associated behavior information. Additionally, a network topology context data store  is used to store information relating to the content of sites that are the object of content requests, and a GIS context data store  is used to store information characterizing various physical locations or otherwise relating to activities that may be performed at various physical locations.","Intent grouping analysis engine  is further configured to group the respective ones of the plurality of users into intent groupings based on comparison of respective ones of the behaviors. Likewise, intent grouping analysis engine  is further configured to compare a navigation path (network or physical) to the paths in data stores - to identify an intent grouping matching a navigation path. Intent grouping analysis engine  may create intent groupings based on common content requests or physical locations and store these groupings in intent groupings based on common path . Intent grouping analysis engine  may create intent groupings based on behavior similarity and store these groupings in intent groupings based on behavior similarity . Intent grouping analysis engine  may create intent groupings based on similar content requests or physical location, and store these groupings in intent groupings based on path similarity . Determinations with respect to path similarity can be made by consulting one or both of GIS context data store  and network topology context data store  for comparisons of the attributes of individual path entries. Intent grouping analysis engine  may create intent groupings based on common behavior and store these groupings in intent groupings based on common behavior .","Embodiments vary with respect to the particular implementations used to determine common intent groupings without departing from the scope and intent of the present disclosure. For example, some embodiments generate intent groupings by comparing statistical measures of path similarity. Examples of statistical measures of path similarity vary. In one embodiment, statistical measures of path similarity are determined by calculating a number or percentage of common content requests or common locations visited along a path. Alternatively, statistical measures of path similarity are determined by calculating a number or percentage of \u201csimilar\u201d content requests or \u201csimilar\u201d locations visited along a path.","In some embodiments, content requests are determined to be similar on the basis of keyword analysis (e.g., number or percentage of shared keywords in content or metadatata) of sites hosting requested items of content or of the content returned responsive to the content requests themselves. For example, different users visiting two websites that host advertisements for the same type of content, such as mobile phone applications, are detected by some embodiments, either through direct analysis of the content or through extraction of information from network topology context data store , and the degree of similarity (e.g. number or percentage of shared keywords in content or metadatata) is used to numerically score the similarity of the sites.","Likewise, in some embodiments, locations will be determined to be similar on the basis of analysis of data in GIS context data store  (e.g. number or percentage of shared keywords associated with a location in GIS context data store ) associated with sites visited by users. For example, different visiting two locations indicated by GIS context data store  to sell mobile the same type of products, such as mobile computing devices, is detected by some embodiments, either through direct analysis of GIS context data store  or through extraction of information from behaviors stored in one of paths data stores -. Example of such behaviors include purchase transactions.","In some embodiments, intent grouping analysis engine  may further embody a content analysis module that is further configured identify content appropriate to a group behavior associated with the intent grouping, or this function may be performed by traffic analysis engine  or by hosts .","Further, as noted below with respect to , order in which sites are visited may be used to determine path similarity. The percentage of common ordering is used by some embodiments to determine path similarity.","Path Data Structures",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["200","305","305","305","310","310","315","305","310","310","315","305","320","320","315","305","330","330","315","305","340","340","315"],"i":["a","n ","a ","a","n ","a","a ","a","n ","a","b ","a","n ","b","c ","a","n ","c","n ","a","n ","n.
