The first PBD antitumour antibiotic, anthramycin, was discovered in 1965 (Leimgruber, et al., 87, 5793-5795 (1965); Leimgruber, et al., 87, 5791-5793 (1965)). Since then, a number of naturally occurring PBDs have been reported, and over 10 synthetic routes have been developed to a variety of analogues (Thurston, et al., 1994, 433-465 (1994)). Family members include abbeymycin (Hochlowski, et al., 40, 145-148 (1987)), chicamycin (Konishi, et al., 37, 200-206 (1984)), DC-81 (Japanese Patent 58-180 487; Thurston, et al., 26, 767-772 (1990); Bose, et al., 48, 751-758 (1992)), mazethramycin (Kuminoto, et al., 33, 665-667 (1980)), neothramycins A and B (Takeuchi, et al., 29, 93-96 (1976)), porothramycin (Tsunakawa, et al., 41, 1366-1373 (1988)), prothracarcin (Shimizu, et al, 29, 2492-2503 (1982); Langley and Thurston, 52, 91-97 (1987)), sibanomicin (DC-102)(Hara, et al., 41, 702-704 (1988); Itoh, et al., 41, 1281-1284 (1988)), sibiromycin (Leber, et al., 110, 2992-2993 (1988)) and tomamycin (Arima, et al., 25, 437-444 (1972)). PBDs are of the general structure:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0004","num":"0003"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"22.18mm","wi":"32.43mm","file":"US09592240-20170314-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"They differ in the number, type and position of substituents, in both their aromatic A rings and pyrrolo C rings, and in the degree of saturation of the C ring. In the B-ring there is either an imine (N\u2550C), a carbinolamine(NH\u2014CH(OH)), or a carbinolamine methyl ether (NH\u2014CH(OMe)) at the N10-C11 position, which is the electrophilic centre responsible for alkylating DNA. All of the known natural products have an (S)-configuration at the chiral C11a position which provides them with a right-handed twist when viewed from the C ring towards the A ring. This gives them the appropriate three-dimensional shape for isohelicity with the minor groove of B-form DNA, leading to a snug fit at the binding site (Kohn, In . Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 3-11 (1975); Hurley and Needham-VanDevanter, 19, 230-237 (1986)). The ability of PBDs to form an adduct in the minor groove enables them to interfere with DNA processing, hence their use as antitumour agents.","The biological activity of these molecules can be potentiated by joining two PBD units together through their C8\/C\u2032-hydroxyl functionalities via a flexible alkylene linker (Bose, D. S., et al., 114, 4939-4941 (1992); Thurston, D. E., et al., 61, 8141-8147 (1996)). The PBD dimers are thought to form sequence-selective DNA lesions such as the palindromic 5\u2032-Pu-GATC-Py-3\u2032 interstrand cross-link (Smellie, M., et al., 42, 8232-8239 (2003); Martin, C., et al., , 44, 4135-4147) which is thought to be mainly responsible for their biological activity.

C., et al., 64, 6700-6706 (2004); Hartley, J. A., et al., 64, 6693-6699 (2004)).","Due to the manner in which these highly potent compounds act in cross-linking DNA, PBD dimers have been made symmetrically, i.e., both monomers of the dimer are the same. This synthetic route provides for straightforward synthesis, either by constructing the PBD dimer moiety simultaneously having already formed the dimer linkage, or by reacting already constructed PBD monomer moieties with the dimer linking group. These synthetic approaches have limited the options for preparation of targeted conjugates containing PBDs. Due to the observed potency of PBD dimers, however, there exists a need for PBD dimers that are conjugatable to targeting agents for use in targeted therapy.","The present invention relates to Conjugates comprising dimers of PBDs linked to a targeting agent, wherein a PBD monomer has a substituent in the C2 position that provides an anchor for linking the compound to the targeting agent. The present invention also relates to Conjugates comprising dimers of PBDs conjugated to a targeting agent, wherein the PBD monomers of the dimer are different. One of PBD monomers has a substituent in the C2 position that provides an anchor for linking the compound to the targeting agent. The Conjugates described herein have potent cytotoxic and\/or cytostatic activity against cells expressing a target molecule, such as cancer cells or immune cells. These conjugates exhibit good potency with reduced toxicity, as compared with the corresponding PBD dimer free drug compounds.","In some embodiments, the Conjugates have the following formula I:\n\nL-(LU-D)p\u2003\u2003(I)\n\nwherein L is a Ligand unit (i.e., a targeting agent), LU is a Linker unit and D is a Drug unit comprising a PBD dimer. The subscript p is an integer of from 1 to 20. Accordingly, the Conjugates comprise a Ligand unit covalently linked to at least one Drug unit by a Linker unit. The Ligand unit, described more fully below, is a targeting agent that binds to a target moiety. The Ligand unit can, for example, specifically bind to a cell component (a Cell Binding Agent) or to other target molecules of interest. Accordingly, the present invention also provides methods for the treatment of, for example, various cancers and autoimmune disease. These methods encompass the use of the Conjugates wherein the Ligand unit is a targeting agent that specifically binds to a target molecule. The Ligand unit can be, for example, a protein, polypeptide or peptide, such as an antibody, an antigen-binding fragment of an antibody, or other binding agent, such as an Fc fusion protein.\n","In a first aspect, the Conjugates comprise a Conjugate of formula I (supra), wherein the Drug unit comprises a PBD dimer of the following formula II:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00003","num":"00003"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00003","he":"27.60mm","wi":"75.95mm","file":"US09592240-20170314-C00003.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"wherein:","Ris of formula III:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00004","num":"00004"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00004","he":"7.96mm","wi":"69.85mm","file":"US09592240-20170314-C00004.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"where A is a Caryl group, X is an activatable group for conjugation to the Linker unit, wherein X is selected from the group comprising: \u2014O\u2014, \u2014S\u2014, \u2014C(O)O\u2014, \u2014C(O)\u2014, \u2014NHC(O)\u2014, and \u2014N(R)\u2014, wherein Ris selected from the group comprising H, Calkyl and (CHO)CH, where m is 1 to 3, and either:\n\n","Ris a Caryl group, optionally substituted by one or more substituents selected from the group comprising: halo, nitro, cyano, ether, Calkyl, Cheterocyclyl and bis-oxy-Calkylene;","Rand Rare independently selected from H, R, OH, OR, SH, SR, NH, NHR, NRR\u2032, nitro, MeSn and halo;","where R and R\u2032 are independently selected from optionally substituted Calkyl, optionally substituted Cheterocyclyl and optionally substituted Caryl groups;","Ris selected from H, R, OH, OR, SH, SR, NH, NHR, NHRR\u2032, nitro, MeSn and halo; either:\n\n","R\u2033 is a Calkylene group, which chain may be interrupted by one or more heteroatoms, e.g. O, S, NR(where Ris H or Calkyl), and\/or aromatic rings, e.g. benzene or pyridine;","Y and Y\u2032 are selected from O, S, or NH;","R, R, R are selected from the same groups as R, Rand Rrespectively and R and Rare the same as Rand R, wherein if Rand Rare SOM, M may represent a divalent pharmaceutically acceptable cation.","In a second aspect, the use of the Conjugate of formula I is provided for the manufacture of a medicament for treating a proliferative disease or autoimmune disease.

Examples of treatments and therapies include, but are not limited to, chemotherapy (the administration of active agents, including, e.g. drugs; surgery; and radiation therapy).","Pharmaceutical compositions according to the present invention, and for use in accordance with the present invention, may comprise, in addition to the active ingredient, i.e. a Conjugate of formula I, a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, carrier, buffer, stabiliser or other materials well known to those skilled in the art. Such materials should be non-toxic and should not interfere with the efficacy of the active ingredient. The precise nature of the carrier or other material will depend on the route of administration, which may be oral, or by injection, e.g. cutaneous, subcutaneous, or intravenous.","Pharmaceutical compositions for oral administration may be in tablet, capsule, powder or liquid form. A tablet may comprise a solid carrier or an adjuvant. Liquid pharmaceutical compositions generally comprise a liquid carrier such as water, petroleum, animal or vegetable oils, mineral oil or synthetic oil.

Similarly, a reference to an amino group includes the protonated form (\u2014NHRR), a salt or solvate of the amino group, for example, a hydrochloride salt, as well as conventional protected forms of an amino group. Similarly, a reference to a hydroxyl group also includes the anionic form (\u2014O), a salt or solvate thereof, as well as conventional protected forms.","Salts","It may be convenient or desirable to prepare, purify, and\/or handle a corresponding salt of the active compound (the Conjugate), for example, a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts are discussed in Berge, et al., 66, 1-19 (1977).","For example, if the compound is anionic, or has a functional group which may be anionic (e.g. \u2014COOH may be \u2014COO), then a salt may be formed with a suitable cation. Examples of suitable inorganic cations include, but are not limited to, alkali metal ions such as Na and K, alkaline earth cations such as Ca and Mg, and other cations such as Al. Examples of suitable organic cations include, but are not limited to, ammonium ion (i.e. NH) and substituted ammonium ions (e.g. NHR, NHR, NHR, NR). Examples of some suitable substituted ammonium ions are those derived from: ethylamine, diethylamine, dicyclohexylamine, triethylamine, butylamine, ethylenediamine, ethanolamine, diethanolamine, piperazine, benzylamine, phenylbenzylamine, choline, meglumine, and tromethamine, as well as amino acids, such as lysine and arginine.

Examples of suitable inorganic anions include, but are not limited to, those derived from the following inorganic acids: hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydroiodic, sulfuric, sulfurous, nitric, nitrous, phosphoric, and phosphorous.","Examples of suitable organic anions include, but are not limited to, those derived from the following organic acids: 2-acetyoxybenzoic, acetic, ascorbic, aspartic, benzoic, camphorsulfonic, cinnamic, citric, edetic, ethanedisulfonic, ethanesulfonic, fumaric, glucheptonic, gluconic, glutamic, glycolic, hydroxymaleic, hydroxynaphthalene carboxylic, isethionic, lactic, lactobionic, lauric, maleic, malic, methanesulfonic, mucic, oleic, oxalic, palmitic, pamoic, pantothenic, phenylacetic, phenylsulfonic, propionic, pyruvic, salicylic, stearic, succinic, sulfanilic, tartaric, toluenesulfonic, and valeric. Examples of suitable polymeric organic anions include, but are not limited to, those derived from the following polymeric acids: tannic acid, carboxymethyl cellulose.","Solvates","It may be convenient or desirable to prepare, purify, and\/or handle a corresponding solvate of the Conjugate(s). The term \u201csolvate\u201d is used herein in the conventional sense to refer to a complex of solute (e.g. active Conjugate, salt of active Conjugate) and solvent.

For example, a reference to a methoxy group, \u2014OCH, is not to be construed as a reference to its structural isomer, a hydroxymethyl group, \u2014CHOH. Similarly, a reference to ortho-chlorophenyl is not to be construed as a reference to its structural isomer, meta-chlorophenyl. However, a reference to a class of structures may well include structurally isomeric forms falling within that class (e.g. Calkyl includes n-propyl and iso-propyl; butyl includes n-, iso-, sec-, and tert-butyl; methoxyphenyl includes ortho-, meta-, and para-methoxyphenyl).","The above exclusion does not pertain to tautomeric forms, for example, keto-, enol-, and enolate-forms, as in, for example, the following tautomeric pairs: keto\/enol (illustrated below), imine\/enamine, amide\/imino alcohol, amidine\/amidine, nitroso\/oxime, thioketone\/enethiol, N-nitroso\/hyroxyazo, and nitro\/aci-nitro.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0419","num":"0626"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00067","num":"00067"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00067","he":"17.53mm","wi":"72.98mm","file":"US09592240-20170314-C00067.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"Note that specifically included in the term \u201cisomer\u201d are compounds with one or more isotopic substitutions.

Briefly, for maleimide drug-linker the mAbs (4-5 mg\/mL) in PBS containing 50 mM sodium borate at pH 7.4 were reduced with tris(carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP) at 37\u00b0 C. The progress of the reaction, which reduces interchain disulfides, was monitored by reaction with 5,5\u2032-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) and allowed to proceed until the desired level of thiols\/mAb was achieved. The reduced antibody was then cooled to 0\u00b0 C. and alkylated with 1.5 equivalents of maleimide drug-linker per antibody thiol. After 1 h, the reaction was quenched by the addition of 5 equivalents of N-acetyl cysteine. Quenched drug-linker was removed by gel filtration over a PD-10 column. The ADC was then sterile-filtered through a 0.22 \u03bcm syringe filter. Protein concentration was determined by spectral analysis at 280 nm and 329 nm, respectively, with correction for the contribution of drug absorbance at 280 nm. Size exclusion chromatography was used to determine the extent of antibody aggregation and RP-HPLC confirmed the absence of remaining NAC-quenched drug-linker.","For halo acetamide-based drug linkers, conjugation was performed generally as follows: To a 10 mg\/mL solution of reduced and reoxidized antibody (having introduced cysteines by substitution of S239C in the heavy chains (see infra)) in 10 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 50 mM NaCl, and 2 mM DTPA was added 0.5 volumes of propylene glycol. A 10 mM solution of acetamide-based drug linker in dimethylacetamide was prepared immediately prior to conjugation. An equivalent amount of propylene glycol as added to the antibody solution was added to a 6-fold molar excess of the drug linker. The dilute drug-linker solution was added to the antibody solution and the pH was adjusted to 8.0-8.5 using 1 M Tris (pH 9). The conjugation reaction was allowed to proceed for 45 minutes at 37\u00b0 C. The conjugation was verified by reducing and denaturing reversed phase PLRP-S chromatography. Excess drug linker was removed with Quadrasil MP resin (Sigma Aldrich; Product #679526) and the buffer was exchanged into 10 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 50 mM NaCl, and 5% propylene glycol using a PD-10 desalting column (GE Heathcare; Product #17-0851-01).","Engineered hlgG1 antibodies with introduced cysteines: CD70 antibodies containing a cysteine residue at position 239 of the heavy chain (h1F6d) were fully reduced by adding 10 equivalents of TCEP and 1 mM EDTA and adjusting the pH to 7.4 with 1M Tris buffer (pH 9.0). Following a 1 hour incubation at 37\u00b0 C., the reaction was cooled to 22\u00b0 C. and 30 equivalents of dehydroascorbic acid were added to selectively reoxidize the native disulfides, while leaving cysteine 239 in the reduced state. The pH was adjusted to 6.5 with 1M Tris buffer (pH 3.7) and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 1 hour at 22\u00b0 C. The pH of the solution was then raised again to 7.4 by addition of 1 M Tris buffer (pH 9.0). 3.5 equivalents of the PBD drug linker in DMSO were placed in a suitable container for dilution with propylene glycol prior to addition to the reaction. To maintain solubility of the PBD drug linker, the antibody itself was first diluted with propylene glycol to a final concentration of 33% (e.g., if the antibody solution was in a 60 mL reaction volume, 30 mL of propylene glycol was added). This same volume of propylene glycol (30 mL in this example) was then added to the PBD drug linker as a diluent. After mixing, the solution of PBD drug linker in propylene glycol was added to the antibody solution to effect the conjugation; the final concentration of propylene glycol is 50%. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 minutes and then quenched by addition of 5 equivalents of N-acetyl cysteine. The ADC was then purified by ultrafiltration through a 30 kD membrane. (Note that the concentration of propylene glycol used in the reaction can be reduced for any particular PBD, as its sole purpose is to maintain solubility of the drug linker in the aqueous media.)","The in vitro cytotoxic activity of the selected antibody drug conjugates was assessed using a resazurin (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo., USA) reduction assay (reference: Doronina et al., 2003, 21, 778-784). The antibody drug conjugates were prepared as described above in Example 13.","For the 96-hour assay, cells cultured in log-phase growth were seeded for 24 h in 96-well plates containing 150 \u03bcL RPMI 1640 supplemented with 20% FBS. Serial dilutions of ADC in cell culture media were prepared at 4\u00d7 working concentration; 50 \u03bcL of each dilution was added to the 96-well plates. Following addition of ADC, the cells were incubated with test articles for 4 days at 37\u00b0 C. Resazurin was then added to each well to achieve a 50 \u03bcM final concentration, and the plates were incubated for an additional 4 h at 37\u00b0 C. The plates were then read for the extent of dye reduction on a Fusion HT plate reader (Packard Instruments, Meridien, Conn., USA) with excitation and emission wavelengths of 530 and 590 nm, respectively. The ICvalue, determined in triplicate, is defined here as the concentration that results in a 50% reduction in cell growth relative to untreated controls.","Referring to Table 4 (infra), the in vitro cytotoxicity of ADCs having para-aniline PBD dimers using the 96 hour assay is shown.

Conjugates having a maleimidyl-peptide linker with a meta-aniline (drug linker compound 43) were somewhat less active than those having a maleimidyl-peptide linker with a para-aniline (drug linker compound 38). Reducing the drug loading of the meta-aniline compound to 2 per antibody reduced the activity. Conjugates with a glucuronide linker of the para-aniline compound (48) generally had a lower ICthan conjugates with a maleimidyl-based linker (compound 39). Further, an aryl maleimide of the para-aniline compound (54) has no activity on these cell lines. Further, a conjugate having a maleimidyl linker conjugated directly to compound 42 has reduced activity as compared with conjugate h1F6-43 (data not shown).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0693","num":"0900"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00009","num":"00009"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 7"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"In vitro cytotoxic activity on CD70+ cell lines (ng\/mL)"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Hodgkin","Renal cell",{}]},{"entry":[{},"lymphoma","carcinina"]},{"entry":[{},"L428","786O","control"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["h1F6- 43 (4 dr\/mAb)","404","11","1205"]},{"entry":["h1F6d- 43 (2 dr\/mAb)","Max inhib. = 40%","200\u2002","1625"]},{"entry":["h1F6d-48 (2 dr\/mAb)","4093\u2002","89","1964"]},{"entry":["h1F6 54 (4 dr\/mAb)","No effect","No effect","No effect"]},{"entry":["h1F6- 38 (2 dr\/mAb)","230 (n = 2)","25 (n = 3)","\u2002503"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"In vitro cytotoxic activity of ADCs bearing drug linkers derived from aniline-linked PBD dimers","Referring to Table 8, the in vitro cytotoxicity of ADCs containing PBD dimers on CD70 cell lines using the 96 hour assay is shown.

(40): To a flame-dried 10 mL flask was added PBD dimer 37 (25 mg, 34.4 \u03bcmol), which was dissolved in 1.4 mL of a 10% MeOH in CHClsolvent mixture. Maleimidocaproic acid (39) was added (7.3 mg, 34.4 \u03bcmol), followed by EEDQ (10.2 mg, 41.3 \u03bcmol) and pyridine (6 \u03bcL, 68.8 \u03bcmol). The reaction was stirred at room temperature under a nitrogen atmosphere for 14 h, at which time LC-MS revealed conversion to product. The reaction was concentrated, dissolved in minimal CHCl, and purified by radial chromatography on a 1 mm chromatotron plate eluted with CHCl\/MeOH mixtures (100:0 to 90:10 CHCl\/MeOH) to provide drug linker 40 (14.1 mg, 45%). LC-MS: t12.81 min, m\/z (ES) found 918.9 (M+H), m\/z (ES) found 917.0 (M\u2212H).","Example 14","Preparation of PDB Dimer Conjugates","Example 15","Determination of In Vitro Activity of Selected Conjugates","Example 16","Determination of In Vivo Cytotoxicity of Selected Conjugates"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES","p":{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIGS. 1 to 6"}},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
