title: Arrow rest for an archery bow
abstract: An archery bow includes a riser and a pair of flexible limbs extending from the riser, each limb having a distal end. At least one string extends between the limb distal ends and is movable between a drawn position and a fired position. A drop-away arrow rest mounted to the riser is movable between a raised position and a lowered position. The arrow rest is biased to the lowered position and includes a trigger sear for maintaining the arrow rest in the raised position. A cable guard arm is attached to and extends from the riser. A trigger assembly is carried by the cable guard arm and associated with the trigger sear. A trigger release is carried by and slidable along the cable guard arm. The trigger release is coupled with at least one string. The trigger release engages the trigger assembly and thereby disengages the trigger sear upon movement of the at least one string from the drawn position to the fired position.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This is a non-provisional application based upon U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 60\/515,196, entitled \u201cARROW REST FOR AN ARCHERY BOW\u201d, filed Oct. 28, 2003; and a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/614,608, entitled \u201cARROW REST FOR AN ARCHERY BOW\u201d, filed Jul. 7, 2003 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,820,607.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to archery equipment, and, more particularly, to arrow rests for archery equipment.","2. Description of the Related Art","Devices are known which provide improved accuracy for individuals target shooting and hunting with archery equipment. For example, bow sights have long been used to provide improved accuracy of an archery bow. A rear sight may be in the form of a bow string mounted peep sight having a small hole which is aligned with a forward sight pin mounted on the bow riser for substantially increasing the accuracy of the bow. As a further example, the front sight may be in the form of multiple, vertically aligned horizontal pins mounted in a frame to protect the pins. These multi-pin sights have proliferated in the last few years, especially in the hunting arena, where the distance to a target can vary as much as from 10\u201360 yards. Optical lenses defining a scope sight may also be used to provide improved accuracy. Yet still, it is also known to use a laser sight which is aligned at a fixed position relative to the riser of the bow to project a laser beam and ultimately a red dot onto a target.","Arrow rests of various configurations are also known for improving the accuracy of an archery bow. An arrow rest generally includes an arrow rest platform for supporting the arrow during drawing and shooting of the bow. The fletchings of the arrow are preferably oriented so as to not impact with the arrow rest platform of the arrow rest upon shooting of the bow. The arrow rest platform may be in the form of a plate or leaf with a notch formed in the distal end for supporting the arrow, or a pair of spaced apart pins which support the underside of the arrow. Other types of arrow rest platforms are also possible.","It is also known to move the arrow rest platform of an arrow rest between a raised support position and a lowered position upon shooting of the bow such that the arrow rest platform does not interfere with the free flight of the arrow. The arrow rest platform is biased to a lowered position using a spring arrangement. A rubber tube is coupled at one end with the arrow rest platform and at the other end with the bow string. Upon drawing the bow string, the rubber tube rotates the arrow rest platform to a raised position. Upon release of the bow string, the rubber tube moves from a stretched position to a relaxed position which allows the arrow rest platform to fall to the lowered position. In theory, moving the arrow rest platform to a lowered position which does not interfere with the free flight of the arrow would provide improved accuracy. However, the mechanics of this known type of design for moving the arrow rest platform to a lowered position has proved to be cumbersome and somewhat unreliable.","What is needed in the art is an arrow rest with an arrow rest platform which may be reliably moved between a raised support position and a lowered position upon shooting of an archery bow to provide improved accuracy of the archery bow.","The present invention provides an arrow rest for an archery bow including an arrow rest platform which is automatically moved to a lowered position upon shooting the bow such that the arrow rest platform does not interfere with the free flight of the arrow.","The invention comprises, in one form thereof, an archery bow including a riser and a pair of flexible limbs extending from the riser, each limb having a distal end. At least one string extends between the limb distal ends and is movable between a drawn position and a fired position. A drop-away arrow rest mounted to the riser is movable between a raised position and a lowered position. The arrow rest is biased to the lowered position and includes a trigger sear for maintaining the arrow rest in the raised position. A cable guard arm is attached to and extends from the riser. A trigger assembly is carried by the cable guard arm and associated with the trigger sear. A trigger release is carried by and slidable along the cable guard arm. The trigger release is coupled with at least one string. The trigger release engages the trigger assembly and thereby disengages the trigger sear upon movement of the at least one string from the drawn position to the fired position.","An advantage of the present invention is that the arrow rest platform is automatically accelerated to a lowered position upon shooting of the bow such that it does not interfere with the free flight of the arrow.","Yet another advantage is that the actuator which moves the second sear to the disengaged position may be configured as a rotary actuator, linear actuator, or other suitable actuator.","Yet another advantage is that the arrow support platform may be configured as a plate, pair of pins, or other suitable arrow rest platform, depending upon the particular configuration.","Still another advantage is that the acceleration rate of the arrow rest platform between the raised support position and the lowered position may be adjusted depending upon the characteristics and attachment locations of the spring.","A further advantage is that the timing of the disengagement of the trigger sear can be adjusted.","Corresponding reference characters indicate corresponding parts throughout the several views. The exemplifications set out herein illustrate one preferred embodiment of the invention, in one form, and such exemplification is not to be construed as limiting the scope of the invention in any manner.","Referring now to the drawings, and more particularly to , there is shown an embodiment of an archery bow , incorporating an embodiment of an arrow rest assembly  of the present invention.","In the embodiment shown, bow  is a compound bow, but may be differently configured depending upon the application. For example, bow  may be a recurve or other type of bow. Bow  includes a riser  and a pair of flexible limbs  extending oppositely from riser . At the distal end of each limb  is a single rotating member , such as a pulley (as shown), or a cam wheel (not shown). At least one string  wraps around rotating members  and biases limbs  to a preloaded state.","Arrow rest assembly  is coupled with riser  and supports an arrow . Arrow  has a rear end with a nock  which is associated with a nock set  on string . Nock set  is engaged by a hand release  during use. Arrow  carried by arrow rest assembly  defines a trajectory plane (not numbered) associated with the trajectory path  of arrow . It will be appreciated that bow string  also lies within the trajectory plane of arrow . The trajectory plane may be adjusted somewhat by laterally adjusting arrow rest .","Arrow rest assembly  () includes a support body , arrow rest platform , a trigger sear including, e.g., first sear  and second sear , and resilient biasing device . Support body  is mounted to riser  using an adjustable slot  and screw .","Arrow rest platform  is movable between a raised support position () supporting arrow , and a lowered position () allowing free flight of arrow . Arrow rest platform  is shown having a plate or leaf shaped configuration with a notch in the distal end for supporting arrow . However, it will be appreciated that arrow rest platform  may be differently configured, such as a pair of pins with spaced apart distal ends supporting arrow , or other suitable configuration.","Pivot arm  extends through a transverse hole formed in support body . First sear  and corresponding set screw  maintain the longitudinal position of pivot arm  relative to support body .","Second sear  is carried by a rotary actuator which is pivotally coupled with support body . The rotary actuator includes a hub  coupled with a pendulum arm . Second sear  is coupled with pendulum arm  at an end opposite from hub . Hub  includes a hole  through which a screw  extends. Screw  is threadingly engaged with support body  and has a diameter slightly smaller than the inside diameter of hole  such that hub  is free to pivot about screw . Screw  may be formed with a shoulder or the like to limit the extent to which it may be screwed into the corresponding opening in support body .","First sear , and second sear  include mating shoulders which mate with each other when first sear  and second sear  are in the engaged position.","Resilient biasing device  is in the form of a spring in the embodiment shown. Spring  maintains first sear  and second sear  in an engaged position and in turn maintains arrow rest platform  in a raised support position, when first sear  and second sear  are engaged with each other. One end of spring  is coupled with set screw  and an opposite end of spring  is coupled with pendulum arm . The exact position and manner of attachment of spring  with pendulum arm  and\/or first sear  may vary, depending upon the application. Moreover, spring  may be a tension spring, compression spring, leaf spring, etc.","Arrow rest assembly  also includes an actuator or trigger assembly  and trigger release  allowing timed release between first sear  and second sear , to in turn provide timed movement of arrow rest platform  to the lowered position. Trigger assembly  includes cantilever body , trigger , and cable . Trigger release  is incorporated into a slide  which slides along a cable guard arm .","Cantilever body  carries cable  which is axially movable within a cable sheath . Cable sheath  is inserted into cantilever body  and held in place using a set screw . One end of cable  is engagable with second sear  and an opposite end is engagable with a cammed trigger . A spring  biases trigger  to a non-activated, generally vertical position as shown in . When the bow is in a relaxed position, trigger release  is positioned to the right of trigger  shown in . As the bow is drawn, slide  and trigger release  engage against the right side of trigger  and rotate trigger  in a clockwise direction. The curvature at the upper end of trigger  is such that cable  is not moved. As trigger release  moves past trigger , spring  biases trigger  again to the vertical orientation shown in . Upon release of arrow string  (), trigger release  engages against the left side of trigger  and rotates trigger  in a counterclockwise direction as viewed in . Trigger  has a cam profile such that cable  is moved in an axial direction and releases second sear  from first sear . The timing at which trigger  is engaged by trigger release  may be easily adjusted by sliding cantilever body along cable guard arm  and tightening a set screw . Alternatively, cantilever body  may include two body parts which are adjusted relative to each other using coarse and\/or fine adjustment screws. A return spring  () biases cable  away from second sear .","In use, if arrow rest platform  is already in the lowered position, then a user simply presses against set screw  with a thumb or finger to rotate arrow rest platform  to a raised support position. When arrow rest platform  is moved to the raised support position, first sear  and second sear  engage with each other at shoulders ,  (). Nock  of arrow  is then nocked onto string  at arrow nock location  within the confines of nock set . Arrow  is then placed on the raised arrow rest platform  (). Hand release  is engaged with nock set  so that bow  may be drawn to a fire position (). Hand release  is then activated so that string  is released. This results in forward motion of string  with which arrow  is engaged, and simultaneously results in return flexure of limbs  as arrow  moves along trajectory path . Trigger release  engages trigger , which axially moves cable  and disengages sears  and . When arrow rest platform  moves to the lowered position upon release of hand release , arrow rest platform  is entirely out of the flight path of arrow  and fletchings  so as to not interfere with the free flight of arrow .","While this invention has been described as having a preferred design, the present invention can be further modified within the spirit and scope of this disclosure. This application is therefore intended to cover any variations, uses, or adaptations of the invention using its general principles. Further, this application is intended to cover such departures from the present disclosure as come within known or customary practice in the art to which this invention pertains and which fall within the limits of the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The above-mentioned and other features and advantages of this invention, and the manner of attaining them, will become more apparent and the invention will be better understood by reference to the following description of an embodiment of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIGS. 1\u20135"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
