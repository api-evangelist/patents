{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS"],"p":["The U.S. Government has a paid-up license in this invention and the right in limited circumstances to require the patent owner to license others on reasonable terms as provided for by the terms of Contract No. DAAE 30-95-C-0009 awarded by the U.S. Army.","The present invention relates generally to a hatch and in particular to a pivoting hatch assembly for armored military vehicles.","Hatches provide access to a generally sealed environment such as areas of a ship, tanker trailers, bunkers, and military vehicles. Such hatches must be constructed to meet the same structural requirements as the surrounding structure. Furthermore, the hatch must maintain the integrity of the sealed environment when locked down.","Traditional hatches open and close by pivoting along one edge of the hatch. Examples of conventional hatches are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,424,736 to Byrne; U.S. Pat. No. 6,293,051 to Matye; U.S. Pat. No. 5,137,327 to Edmonds et al.; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,220,127 to Tiomkin et al. The one-sided hinge has particular design advantages, but requires an unobstructed envelope for completing the hatch pivot. This becomes problematic when the barrel of a cannon or other object is in close proximity to the hatch. Therefore, there is a need for a hatch with a minimal opening envelope that does not interfere with other structures.","The structural requirements for a hatch frequently make them difficult to open. One of the main purposes of a tank hatch is to facilitate the movement of military personal, while providing the same level of protection as the rest of the tank structure. Depending upon the vehicle or embodiment, any particular hatch may include armor. Additional \u201ctop-attack\u201d armor is commonly used to enhance protection when a vehicle is within a particularly high threat area. These survivability requirements drastically increase the weight of the hatch adding to the difficulty of operating the hatch.","Many traditional hinge assemblies utilized torsional springs to reduce the force required to open the side pivot hatch assemblies. Armor for the hatch of a tank, however, can be relatively heavy, and the torsion springs would have to be relatively large to be effective. Spring size would necessarily be further increased if top attack armor was used. However, large springs are bulky and impinge on the already limited interior working space. Furthermore, once the removable armor is taken off there is considerably less weight to the hatch, which in turn could create a potentially dangerous uncontrolled opening of the hatch due to the larger springs.","A hatch should be relatively easy to function, while remaining reliable. In a military vehicle, reliability must be maintained through rigorous and damaging conditional. The hatch of a military vehicle should accommodate the addition and removal of armor. The steps needed to open and close the hatch portal should be minimal, taking into consideration the amount of force and time needed to operate the hatch during emergencies. It would be desirable to have a hatch assembly in which the user can retain positive control over opening and closing. Further, opening the hatch should require as small an opening envelope as possible so as not to interfere with other operating features of the vehicle, such as a gun barrel or a military vehicle.","The improved hatch assembly in accordance with the present invention is particularly advantageous for use with any portal in which the weight of the hatch requires positive control over opening and closing operations and the area transverse to the opening is limited. The hatch assembly of the present invention is specifically appropriate for a portal on a military vehicle where armor adds to the weight of the structure. The hatch assembly includes a base plate which frames the portal, a hatch lifting mechanism supported by the base plate and a hatch which is mounted to the hatch lifting mechanism. The hatch is raised and lowered by way of a rotating telescopic assembly wherein the entire hatch is raised off the portal and then rotated away from the portal.","In a first embodiment, the hatch lifting mechanism comprises two telescoping tube sections comprised of an inner and outer cylinder with a ball screw connecting the two. The top of the inner cylinder is connected to the hatch and the bottom of the outer cylinder is connected to the base plate. The inner cylinder is advanced or retracted with regret to the outer cylinder when the ball screw is actuated by rotating either the interior or exterior handle. The outer cylinder has a cam attached to its outer face through the hatch. The cam rides in a cam slot as the cylinders are telescoping relative to each other. Thus, the hatch rotates in relation to the base plate.","The operator disengages the securing device and rotates one of the crank handles to open the hatch. The crank handles cause the splined shaft disposed within the ball screw to rotate, rotating the ball screw, and telescopically moving the inner cylinder with respect to the outer cylinder. Alternatively, a straight spline, involute spline, recalculating balls, keyed shaft or polygonal shaft, can also control vertical displacement. During rotation of the ball screw, the cam follower, which is attached to the outer cylinder, causes rotational displacement. The number of handle turns required to fully open or close the hatch is dependent upon the size of the drive sprocket. A locking device automatically engages to prevent premature movement of the hatch when the hatch reaches the fully opened position. The user may disengage the locking device and perform the steps in reverse order to close the hatch.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","102","104","106","102","104","106","104","106"]},"Hatch assembly  covers portal . Portal  provides access into the vehicle . The front end  of the military vehicle  is depicted with removable top-attack armor . The top-attack armor , which increases the weight of hatch , is often applied to military vehicles prior to insertion into high-risk environments.","As illustrated in and , hatch assembly  comprises a hatch , a base plate  and a lifting tower . Base plate  forms a frame around the portal  and is disposed within the vehicle . The hatch  is raised and lowered by lifting tower , which connects base plate  to hatch . While in the closed position, the hatch  is in direct communication with the base plate .","Hatch  of the present invention has a rear face  and a front face  relative to the front and rear of vehicle . The hatch  has a trapezoidal shape and is constructed of aluminum or other suitable metal. An external release lever  extends outward from the rear face  of hatch . The front face  of hatch  consists of three relatively vertical panels ,  and  with integrated periscopes ,  and  providing generally forward viewing when hatch  is in a closed position. The periscopes ,  and  are designed to aid in viewing the external environment from the safety of the military vehicle. Positioning of the periscopes ,  and  on the hatch  is convenient for the user and is an efficient use of space.","The hatch  is fixedly attached to the lifting tower  at tower side . The tower side  is adjacent to side panel  and rear face . Opposite tower side  are distal sides  and . Hatch  is further comprised of a top layer  which rests on lower layer . The top layer  extends distally from the rear end  at an upward angle relative to the base plate  in a first embodiment. The slope of front-end  is determined by numerous factors, including the angle of incidence with an incoming round and ergonomic look-down angle. The look-down angle is the natural line of sight for the user without eye strain, fatigue, or head movement. The upward slope in the preferred embodiment is approximately twenty degrees.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIGS. 2","FIG. 2"],"i":["a ","b ","a"],"b":["2","108","112","154","112","156","158","160","156","162","162","166","168","162","170","106","170"]},"The internal crank handle  and the external crank handle  located on exterior face of lifting tower  are used for actuating the hatch assembly . The internal crank handle  is connected to a chain . The particular position of the handle  within the military vehicle  makes actuation difficult without the chain . In an alternative embodiment (not shown), the chain may be removed and the internal crank handle may be directly connected to the cylinder assembly in a similar fashion as the external crank handle .","The sprockets  and  may be of varying sizes depending upon the desired result. Differing ratios between the sprockets  and  can result in a hatch assembly  that requires less force to actuate, but requires more turns of the handle  to open or close the hatch . Alternatively, a greater force may be necessary to turn the handle , but fewer turns would be necessary to open or close the hatch  due to the ratio between the two sprockets.","It is advantageous to have a securing device  to securely fasten the hatch  to base plate . The securing device  has an internal handle  and an external handle . The internal handle  and the external handle  extend radially from the pivot rod . A securing node  is fixedly attached to the external handle , in which they spin as one unit. The pivot rod  axially extends through the securing device arm . The securing device arm  is fixedly attached to the base plate . A receiving plate , attached to the hatch , provides a seat for the securing node .","Springs  and  frictionally maintain the connection between the securing node  and the receiving plate . An external spring  is axially inserted about the pivot rod  between the upper joint  and the securing device arm . An internal spring  is axially inserted around the pivot rod  between the securing device arm  and the internal handle .","There may be more than one securing device  for each hatch assembly . Here, the securing device  is positioned proximal to the front end . Alternatively, a securing device may also be located proximal to the tower base . The securing device  will assist in maintaining a tight seal between the base plate  and the hatch . This is particularly useful while the military vehicle  is in motion or under attack. The securing device  may be operated from the inside or the outside of the vehicle . Additional mechanical fastening devices may be implemented for the same purpose such as spring-loaded clamps, hooks or other similar devices.","Hatch  is operated by rotating either interior handle  or exterior handle . Then handles  and  are operably connected to cylinder assembly  as illustrated in FIG. . The cylinder assembly  contains a ball screw , a ball screw nut , a splined shaft , an outer cylinder , and an inner cylinder . The splined shaft  is partially contained within and fixedly attached to the ball screw . The ball screw  threadably engages ball screw nut , which is then fixed to the inner cylinder . The inner cylinder  is in telescopic communication with the outer cylinder . The base of the outer cylinder  is fixedly attached to tower base  and the top of inner cylinder  is fixedly attached to hatch .","The ball screw  is an elongated hollow, cylindrical metal structure. The ball screw nut  moves up or down the threaded mid-section  of the ball screw  depending upon the direction of rotation. Axial rotation of the ball screw  is caused by axial rotation of the splined shaft .","A splined bushing  and splined shaft  are employed to allow relatively free vertical motion, while restricting rotational motion. The splined shaft  is an elongated cylindrical metal structure. The inside wall  of the splined bushing  is adapted so as to receive the splined shaft  so that they rotate axially together. The splined bushing , however, is also free to slide up and down the splined shaft .","The splined bushing  functions to increase operational longevity. The splined bushing  is easier and cheaper to replace than splining the ball screw  to accept the splined shaft . Additionally, cutting an interior spline into the ball screw  would lose many of the advantages afforded by the \u201cfloating\u201d bushing . However, the splined bushing  is not necessary, and alternative embodiments may function without the bushing .","The splined shaft  is embedded into the ball screw . Splined shafts are desirable over keyed shafts because they are more reliable and the torque transfer is higher. Keyways also wear out over time when compared to splines, especially when considering the \u201csliding\u201d action that takes place between the shaft and bushing. Alternatively the splined shaft  may be an involute spline (not shown) rather than a straight spline, or a polygonal shaped shaft (not shown).","An O-ring , proximal to the shaft adapter , is axially inserted on the splined shaft . The O-ring  is manufactured from rubber or an alternative material suitable for creating a seal. The shaft adapter  is fixedly attached to the top end  of the splined shaft  and held in place by snap ring . Shaft adapter  extends axially through lock nut  and mounted bearing , which are fixedly attached to the ball screw  and the inner cylinder  respectively.","Attached to the top end  of the ball screw  are bushing retainer  and splined bushing . The bushing retainer  is a hollow metal ring structure that slideably fits around the top end  of the ball screw . The bushing retainer  contains a pair of opposing bushing retainer apertures . The splined bushing  is cylindrical in shape and includes a pair of opposing bushing apertures . The top end  of ball screw  also contains a pair of opposing apertures . The ball screw , bushing retainer , and bushing  are positioned so that the respective apertures , ,  line-up for insertion of a dowel . The dowel  acts as a positive stop for the travel of the ball screw nut .","The splined bushing  and the splined shaft  must be in tight communication with each other in order for the torque to be transferred to the ball screw . Two dowels  are used to maintain this relationship. The clearance between dowels  and the apertures  in the ball screw  allows the splined bushing  to \u201cfloat\u201d. The tight communication between the dowels , the splined bushing , and bushing retainer  ensure that the dowels  are captured and not free to fall out. A single continuous dowel that extends through the shaft  is not used so as not to interfere with the free movement of the splined shaft . However, the use of two dowels  is not crucial. Alternative embodiments may contain a single dowel or any other effective retention method for the designed purpose.","The ball screw nut  is fixed to the inner cylinder  through use of a nut flange  in order for the cylinder assembly  to telescopically move. A plurality of equally spaced apertures  are positioned radially on the nut flange . The apertures  receive bolts  (See FIG. ), which are fixedly attached to the inner cylinder .","Now referring to , the lifting tower  is shown with the hatch  in the closed position. An exterior crank handle  is centrally positioned on the top of the tower  and fixedly attached to the shaft adapter . Hatch insert  surrounds the outer cylinder  and is positioned between the outer cylinder  and the tower . Hatch insert  forms the helical cam path . Shaft , attached to ball screw , extends through bearing  to engage sprocket  and lock nut  at the opposing end of lifting tower .","Positioned between the hatch insert  and the outer cylinder  is a seal  to keep contaminants from entering the interior of the vehicle  and the hatch tower  while the hatch assembly  is closed. Conventional rubber or similar materials have been found particularly suitable for the seal . The seal  is positioned circumferentially around the outer cylinder , proximal to the base  of the tower . As a result of the considerable movement between the inner cylinder  and the outer cylinder , a bushing  is inserted to increase operational life.","A shaft adapter  is employed, enabling the external crank handle  to be fixedly attached to the splined shaft . A square key  is utilized to maintain this fixed relationship between the shaft  and the handle . The square key  is positioned on the top end  of the splined shaft .","A loose fit between the ball screw  and the splined bushing  enables pivoting and alignment of the crank handle . The square key  is designed and positioned to stop rotation between the shaft adapter  and the splined shaft . This necessarily creates a more direct transfer of torque from the exterior crank handle  to the ball screw . An O-ring  is placed over the splined shaft  to inhibit contaminants from penetrating the vehicle when the hatch  is closed.","A locking mechanism  is illustrated in , , , and . The hatch pin  is spring loaded. Once the hatch assembly  reaches the fully open position the hatch pin  automatically extends into the pin receptacle  of outer cylinder . The hatch pin  is substantially cylindrical in shape and is contained within a pin housing . The pin housing  is contained within the tower sidewall . A rod arm  penetrates the pin housing . The rod arm  is threadably attached to the hatch pin . The hatch pin  is attached to the rod link  at the pin hinge point . The knob link hinge  distally positioned from the hinge point . The rod link  is hingingly attached to the pin knob  at link hinge . The pin knob  extends through the rear end  of the hatch . The locking mechanism  is essentially internally contained within the hatch assembly  at hatch assembly corner , with the exception of the external release handle , hatch pin , pin housing , and spring . A detent  is provided to release the locking pin  from the clamshell insert  in order to allow for the hatch pin  to be released. The detent  is positioned on the external release lever .","Now referring to , an access aperture  covered by plug  is positioned in the rear side  of the tower . A threaded insert  is fixedly attached to the outer cylinder . A cam follower , inserted into the threaded insert , extends distally from the outer cylinder  and is positioned in the cam path  of the hatch insert .","The pin receptacle , shown in , is an aperture cut out of the outer cylinder . Positioned on the opposite side of the outer cylinder  from the pin receptacle  is the threaded insert aperture  for the cam follower . The threaded insert aperture  is cut out of the outer cylinder . Positioned within the aperture  is the threaded insert . The pin receptacle  and the threaded insert aperture  are positioned in the outer cylinder  proximal to the external crank handle .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 5"],"b":["294","246","108","256","244","206","244","246","8"],"i":"a"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["294","246","246"]},"The user will commonly desire to open the hatch , as its default position is the closed position. The user will disengage the securing device . Next, the user will rotate either the internal crank handle  or the external crank handle , depending upon whether the user is inside or outside the vehicle . Rotation of either handle ,  will actuate the cylinder assembly . The inner cylinder  moves with respect to the outer cylinder  in a telescopic manner. While this motion is occurring the cam follower , which is mounted into the outer cylinder , moves along cam path . This in turn causes the lifting and rotating motion of the hatch .","Once the hatch  reaches the fully open position the locking pin  engages preventing the premature closing of the hatch . Constant tension is placed upon the hatch pin  by the spring . As the pin  engages the pin receptacle , the rod link  causes the pin knob  to rotate, which in turn causes the locking pin  to engage the clam shell insert . The locking pin  extends outward from the locking pin rod . The locking pin rod  is spring loaded by spring . As the locking pin  engages the clamshell insert  the locking pin rod  slidably moves distally in relation to the pin knob , proximal to the detent . The detent  extends outward from the base plate  when the hatch pin  engages the pin receptacle . Depressing the detent  compresses the spring  and causes the locking pin  to disengage from the clamshell insert . Depressing the detent  followed by a rotation of the external release lever  causes the pin knob  to rotate, and thereby causing disengagement of the hatch pin  from the pin receptacle . The external release lever  must be engaged to release the locking pin  and allow the hatch  to close.","A sealing system includes a ridge  designed to fit in tight communication with a recess . Whether the ridge  is on the base plate  or whether the recess  is on the base plate  does not matter, as long as one of them is on the base plate  and the other is on the hatch . The tight communication between the ridge  and the recess  allows for a functional seal preventing external debris and contaminants from entering the portal.","The crank handles ,  may be manually rotated or a motor (not shown) actuates the hatch  opening. The opening procedure begins by lifting the hatch vertically above the surface of the military vehicle . The base plate  is flush with respect to the surrounding surface of the military vehicle. However, the presence of top attack armor  necessitates a greater clearance prior to beginning the rotational displacement of the hatch . (See FIG. ). The vertical distance required is dependent upon the exact specifications of the hatch assembly , but approximately three (3) inches has been found particularly well suited for the present embodiment.","Transverse motion of hatch  is followed by a simultaneous rotation and lifting and then a final transverse travel. The final transverse motion is included to make alignment between the locking pin  and the pin receptacle  easier from a manufacturing standpoint, since the pin  would not have to find the receptacle  while on the helical cam path. The lifting and rotating allows for the hatch to be displaced in such a manner as to avoid undesirable interaction with other systems. The hatch insert  and cam path  guide the lifting and rotating. The presence of each of these allows for a smooth guided motion. This is particularly useful in the preferred embodiment where there is no motor used for actuation of the lifting. Such a motion aids individuals in opening and closing the hatch  in a safe and easy manner.","In an alternative embodiment, a hatch insert  may not be necessary if the weight of the hatch is reduced (i.e. a hatch without armor). The structural integrity of the cylinder assembly  is thus not as great of a concern as it is with the presence of heavy armor. Therefore, the cam path  can be cut directly into the outer cylinder .","The hatch assembly  is depicted with significant armor. However, armor is not necessary for the function of the hatch assembly . The preferred embodiment is designed to be easily adaptable to non-armored vehicles and containers without change.","It should be understood that the described and disclosed embodiment is merely exemplary of the invention and that all modifications are intended to be included that do not depart from the spirit of the invention and the scope of the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DECRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 2","i":"a "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 2","i":"b "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 5","i":"a "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 5","i":"b "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 5","i":"c "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 8"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
