{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","CONCLUSION"],"p":["Content providers use audience measurement systems to estimate the size of an audience that watches a media content instance such as a particular television show or movie. These audience measurement systems sample the viewing habits of a subset of a population to estimate the number of people or households in the population that viewed a particular media content instance. This information is important to advertisers who are generally willing to pay more to advertise during media content instances that have larger audiences. In addition, this information may be published so that consumers know which media content instances are popular among the population.","An example system includes a plurality of media content processing devices, a content server, and a recommendation server. Each media content processing device is configured to receive media content from a content provider. The content server is configured to provide the media content to each of the media content processing devices. The recommendation server is configured to collect viewing data from each of the media content processing device and to provide each media content processing device with a viewing recommendation based at least in part on the viewing data collected and a social network relationship between at least two of the media content processing devices.","An example recommendation server includes a network interface device configured to communicate with the media content processing devices and a data aggregator configured to collect viewing data and social network information from each media content processing device. The recommendation server further includes an analysis module in communication with the data aggregator and the network interface device. The analysis module is configured to analyze the viewing data and the social network information and output a viewing recommendation to each media content processing device based at least in part on the social network relationships defined by the social network information.","An example media content processing device includes a social network application configured to retrieve social network information from a social network source and a recommendation application configured to receive a viewing recommendation from the recommendation server. Again, the viewing recommendation is based at least in part on the social network information.","An example method includes collecting viewing data from a plurality of media content processing devices, including a target device and a source device, receiving social media information from a social network source, and generating a viewing recommendation for the target device based at least in part on the viewing data of the source device and the social network information. As mentioned above, the social network information defines a social network relationship between the target device and the source device.","The system may take many different forms and include multiple and\/or alternate components and facilities. While an example system is shown in the figures, the example components illustrated in the figures are not intended to be limiting. Indeed, additional or alternative components and\/or implementations may be used.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","105","110","115","120","105","110","115","125","125","125"]},"Each media content processing device  may include any number of devices configured to receive media content over the communication network . Example media content may include television shows, movies, streaming video or music, games, etc. In one possible approach, the media content is provided to each media content processing device  through one or more content providers, such as a website, a content subscription service, a cable television provider, and the like. As discussed below, the media content processing device  may be configured to transmit viewing data and social network information to the recommendation server .","The viewing data may include information about content that a user of the media content processing device  views. For instance, the viewing data may include information about the television shows, movies, streaming videos, streaming music, games, etc., watched or purchased by a user using the media content processing device . The viewing data may further include any input commands provided by the user to the media content processing device  via, e.g., a remote control, keyboard, touchscreen, or other input device. Therefore, the viewing data may reflect when the particular user watches media content, the amount of time the user spends on each channel (e.g., whether the user is watching a program or flipping through channels), whether the user selected a specific channel or stopped on a specific channel while flipping, whether the user changes the channel during a commercial, search queries entered by the user, and the like.","The social network information may include information that defines a social network relationship between a user of one media content processing device  (e.g., a first user) and a user of another media content processing device  (e.g., a second user). For instance, the first user and the second user may be friends or family members living in the same or separate households. Moreover, the first and second users may have defined the nature of their relationship on a social network website such as Facebook\u00ae, Google+\u00ae, LinkedIn\u00ae, Twitter\u00ae, etc. Each media content processing device , as discussed below, may be configured to receive the first user's credentials to access the social network information and to determine the nature of the relationship between the first user and the second user based on the information on the social network website. For example, the social network information may define the first user and second user as friends, family members (e.g., spouses, parent and child, siblings, cousins, etc.), co-workers, acquaintances, etc., based on the social network information. That is, the media content processing device  may determine that the first and second users are \u201csocial network friends.\u201d Moreover, the media content processing device  may define the first user's social network friends as any member of a social network who has the same or similar interests as the first user, regardless of whether the first and second users have ever met in person. The media content processing device  may access the social network website to retrieve such social network information about the first and second users.","The content server  may include any number of devices configured to store media content and provide the media content to one or more media content processing devices  over, e.g., the communication network . For instance, the content server  may be configured to transmit television shows, movies, streaming video, streaming music, games, etc., to one or more media content processing devices  either when requested (e.g., on-demand or streaming) or on a subscription basis. In one possible approach, the content server  may be located at a content provider location .","The recommendation server  may include any device configured to collect the viewing data and social network information from each of the media content processing devices  and provide each media content processing device  with a viewing recommendation based at least in part on the viewing data and the social network relationship defined by the social network information. For instance, the recommendation server  may receive the viewing data and social network information from each media content processing device  via the communication network , identify the social network friends of a user of one of the media content processing devices , and output the viewing recommendation to that media content processing device  based on the viewing data associated with the user's social network friends. The viewing data, the social network information, and the viewing recommendation may be stored in any number of databases on the recommendation server . In one possible approach, the recommendation server  may be located at the content provider location .","In general, computing systems and\/or devices, such as each media content processing device , the content server , and the recommendation server , may employ any of a number of computer operating systems, including, but by no means limited to, versions and\/or varieties of the Microsoft Windows\u00ae operating system, the Unix operating system (e.g., the Solaris\u00ae operating system distributed by Oracle Corporation of Redwood Shores, Calif.), the AIX UNIX operating system distributed by International Business Machines of Armonk, N.Y., the Linux operating system, the Mac OS X and iOS operating systems distributed by Apple Inc. of Cupertino, Calif., the BlackBerry OS distributed by Research In Motion of Waterloo, Canada, and the Android operating system developed by the Open Handset Alliance. Examples of computing devices include, without limitation, a computer workstation, a server, a desktop, notebook, laptop, or handheld computer, or some other computing system and\/or device.","Computing devices generally include computer-executable instructions, where the instructions may be executable by one or more computing devices such as those listed above. Computer-executable instructions may be compiled or interpreted from computer programs created using a variety of programming languages and\/or technologies, including, without limitation, and either alone or in combination, Java\u2122, C, C++, Visual Basic, Java Script, Perl, etc. In general, a processor (e.g., a microprocessor) receives instructions, e.g., from a memory, a computer-readable medium, etc., and executes these instructions, thereby performing one or more processes, including one or more of the processes described herein. Such instructions and other data may be stored and transmitted using a variety of computer-readable media.","A computer-readable medium (also referred to as a processor-readable medium) includes any non-transitory (e.g., tangible) medium that participates in providing data (e.g., instructions) that may be read by a computer (e.g., by a processor of a computer). Such a medium may take many forms, including, but not limited to, non-volatile media and volatile media. Non-volatile media may include, for example, optical or magnetic disks and other persistent memory. Volatile media may include, for example, dynamic random access memory (DRAM), which typically constitutes a main memory. Such instructions may be transmitted by one or more transmission media, including coaxial cables, copper wire and fiber optics, including the wires that comprise a system bus coupled to a processor of a computer. Common forms of computer-readable media include, for example, a floppy disk, a flexible disk, hard disk, magnetic tape, any other magnetic medium, a CD-ROM, DVD, any other optical medium, punch cards, paper tape, any other physical medium with patterns of holes, a RAM, a PROM, an EPROM, a FLASH-EEPROM, any other memory chip or cartridge, or any other medium from which a computer can read.","Databases, data repositories or other data stores described herein may include various kinds of mechanisms for storing, accessing, and retrieving various kinds of data, including a hierarchical database, a set of files in a file system, an application database in a proprietary format, a relational database management system (RDBMS), etc. Each such data store is generally included within a computing device employing a computer operating system such as one of those mentioned above, and are accessed via a network in any one or more of a variety of manners. A file system may be accessible from a computer operating system, and may include files stored in various formats. An RDBMS generally employs the Structured Query Language (SQL) in addition to a language for creating, storing, editing, and executing stored procedures, such as the PL\/SQL language mentioned above.","In some examples, system elements may be implemented as computer-readable instructions (e.g., software) on one or more computing devices (e.g., servers, personal computers, etc.), stored on computer readable media associated therewith (e.g., disks, memories, etc.). A computer program product may comprise such instructions stored on computer readable media for carrying out the functions described herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["115","115","200","205","210","215"]},"The network interface device  may include any device configured to allow the recommendation server  to transmit and receive signals over the communication network . For instance, the network interface device  may include or allow the recommendation server  to connect to a router, an optical network terminal, etc. The network interface device  may include any device, therefore, configured to communicate over any type of computer or telecommunications networks, such as a packet-switched network, a cellular network, or a fiber optic network.","The data aggregator  may include hardware, software, or some combination thereof that is configured to receive signals from the media content processing devices  that are transmitted over the communication network . For instance, the data aggregator  may be in communication with the network interface device . Data, such as viewing data, social network information, or both, received by the network interface device  may be transmitted to the data aggregator . In one possible approach, the data aggregator  is configured to receive viewing data and social network information from each media content processing device  in the system . The data aggregator  may collect and store the received data in one or more databases.","The data filter  may include hardware, software, or both, in communication with the data aggregator . The data filter  may be configured to remove some of the viewing data or social network information based on various criteria. This way, unrelated viewing data may be removed, and thus, not considered when making a viewing recommendation. For example, the data filter  may remove viewing data that indicates that the user is flipping through channels.","The analysis module  may include any combination of hardware and software that is configured to analyze the viewing data and the social network information received at the recommendation server  to determine and output the viewing recommendation to one or more of the media content processing devices . In one possible approach, the analysis module  may, using the social network information, identify relationships between users of two or more of the media content processing devices  in the system . For example, the analysis module  may determine that a first user of one media content processing device  is a friend or family member of a second user of another media content processing device  based on the social network relationship between the first and second users as defined by the social network information.","The analysis module  may be configured to use the viewing data received from the media content processing devices  (e.g., source devices) to determine which television shows and movies the user of that source device likes or is currently watching. The analysis module  may use this viewing data to generate a viewing recommendation based on the viewing preferences of the user of each source device in the system . The analysis module  may, using the network interface device , transmit the viewing recommendation to a target device.","The viewing recommendation may present the television shows, movies, music, or any other media content that the users of the source devices like or are currently consuming. In one possible approach, the viewing recommendation may presents recommended media content from social network friends of the user of the target device. As discussed above, social network friends are those who have a social network relationship to the user of the target device.","In one example implementation, the analysis module  may generate and output a unique viewing recommendation for each target device in the system  based on the viewing data received and the social network relationship between the users of each source device and the target device. The analysis module  may be configured to ignore or remove viewing data received from non-source devices, e.g., devices associated with users who are not social network friends with the user of the target device. That is, the analysis module  may be configured to only consider a media content processing device  to be a source device relative to a specific target device if the users of the devices are social network friends. The analysis module  may exclude the viewing data from non-source devices using, e.g., the data filter .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["105","105","300","305","310","315","105","320","200"]},"The media content receiver  may include any combination of hardware, software, or both, that allows the media content processing device  to receive media content from one or more service providers. Accordingly, the media content receiver  may include an antenna configured to receive media content that is broadcast at particular frequencies, a tuner configured to receive media content broadcast over a cable network, a media application configured to receive streaming video or music, or a gaming application configured to present a video game to a user. The media content receiver  may transmit the media content to a display interface device  so that the media content may be displayed to a user.","The user interface module  may include any combination of hardware and software configured to present a graphical user interface to a user of the media content processing device . The user interface module , therefore, may present a menu of selectable media content or options. Moreover, the user interface module  may be configured to allow the user to customize the display of the presented information. For instance, using the user interface module , the user may sort the menus according to at least one criteria. In another example approach, the user interface module  may be configured to present a video or text chat to the user that is concurrently displayed with the media content, even if the user and the user's social network friends are consuming the media content on different types of devices. This way, the user may chat with the user's social network friends while the user is viewing the media content on, e.g., a television and the user's social network friend is simultaneously viewing the media content on, e.g., a tablet computer.","Additionally, the user interface module  may be configured to allow the user to consume media content on one media content processing device  and communicate with the user's social network friends using another media content processing device . For example, the user may view the media content on a television while engaged in a video chat, using another media content processing device , with a social network friend. In this instance, both media content processing devices  used by the user may be configured to communicate with one another through an application so that the user may seamlessly use both media content processing devices  while consuming the media content.","The user may interact with the user interface module  using an input device (not shown) connected to the media content processing device  via a user input receiver . The user input receiver  may include an infrared receiver configured to receive infrared signals from, e.g., a remote control or any other type of input receiver such as one configured to receive an input from a keyboard, a mouse, a touch screen, a track pad, a camera, a microphone, or the like. The received input may include one or more user input commands that may be used to control the graphical user interface. That is, the input commands may be used to display the graphical user interface, sort the information presented via the graphical user interface, select one or more selectable options, display media content, etc. Moreover, if the received input is from a camera or microphone, the received input may be transmitted to another media content processing device  during, e.g., a video or text chat.","The recommendation application  may include any hardware, software, or combination thereof configured to receive the viewing recommendation from the recommendation server  and output one or more viewing recommendations to the user via, e.g., the user interface module . In particular, the recommendation application  may be in communication with the network interface device  and may be configured to receive the viewing recommendation transmitted by the recommendation server  through the communication network . Additionally, the recommendation application  may be configured to output the received viewing recommendation to the user interface module  so that the viewing recommendation may be presented to the user.","In one possible approach, the recommendation application  may include a content filter  configured to only output predetermined subsets of the viewing recommendation in response to one or more criteria that may be selected by a user. For example, the content filter  may allow the recommendation application  to output viewing recommendations based on the viewing data received from source devices that are within the same geographic region as the target device. Alternatively, the content filter  may allow the recommendation application  to output viewing information based on the viewing data of the user of the target device's social network friends. Accordingly, the content filter  may be configured to output viewing data in accordance with one or more viewing criteria. The recommendation application  may be in communication with the user input receiver  and configured to receive one or more user input commands. This way, the user may select one or more of the viewing criteria using the user input commands.","The social network application  may be in communication with the network interface device  and may include any combination of hardware, software, or both, that is configured to retrieve social network information from a social network source, such as a server hosting a social network website. In one possible approach, the social network application  may include one or more application programming interfaces (API) to communicate with and receive information from the social network source. Further, the social network application  may use one or more APIs to upload social network information to one or more social network sources. The social network application , therefore, may be configured to determine the social network relationship between at least two media content processing devices . In addition, the social network application  may be configured to receive other information from the social network source. This other information may include content posted to a user's profile page, content directed at the user of the target device, etc.","Furthermore, the social network application  may be configured to define new social network relationships between users. That is, the user of the target media content processing device  may input information about a relationship with another user of another media content processing device . Alternatively, the social network application  may identify other users with similar tastes in media content and suggest that the user of the target media content processing device  establish a social network relationship with such other users. The social network application  may define the new social network relationship and transmit the new social network relationship to the social network source.","The social network application  may be configured to output the social network information, including defined social network relationships, to the recommendation application , to the social network source, or both. As previously discussed, the recommendation application  may use the social network information to filter the viewing recommendations presented to the user via the user interface module . That is, the recommendation application  may be configured to output a viewing recommendation based on the viewing data of other users who have a social network relationship with the user of the media content processing device . The social network application  may be configured to output viewing data to the social network source so, for instance, the user's social network friends may see what media content the user likes or is currently watching.","The social network application  may be further configured to output social network information to the media content receiver , the user interface module , or the display interface device . In one possible approach, the social network application  may output comments or status updates from other users to the media content receiver , the user interface module , or the display interface device  so that the social network information may be displayed concurrently with the media content. By way of example only, the social network information may include comments about the media content that the user is currently watching. The social network information may transmit the comments to the media content receiver , the user interface module , or the display interface device  so that the comments may be displayed with the media content. The comments may be overlaid on the media content or displayed just above, below, or next to the media content.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["400","105","405","410","405","410","105"]},"In one possible implementation, the media content processing device  may present the viewing recommendation in view of the selected media content options  and filter options . That is, the media content processing device  may present the media content options  and filter options  to the user using the user interface module  and the display interface device , and further, the media content processing device  may receive a selection from the user via the user input receiver . The user's selection of media content options  and filter options  may determine the viewing recommendation displayed to the user. For instance, if the user selects the media content option associated with live television and the \u201cFriends\u201d filter option, the media content processing device  may present the user with the viewing recommendation based on the user's friends' viewing data. Again, the user's friends may be defined by social network relationships according to the social network information received by the social network application .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","105","500","505","510","510","105","505","510","500","515","515"]},"The graphical user interface  may further include a channel lock button  that, when pressed, may lock the display of the user's media content processing device  to that of one of the user's social network friends' media content processing devices . In the context of , the channel lock button  may be presented as an avatar associated with one of the user's social network friends who is currently watching a recommended media content instance. The user may select the avatar of that social network friend, and the media content processing device  may respond by locking the user's display to that of the social network friend so that both users will watch the same media content. In one possible approach, as the social network friend changes the media content displayed (e.g., changes the channel or selects recorded content to view), the media content displayed on both user's media content processing device  remains the same.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","605","610","610","605","610","605","605","610","605","610","605","610","605","315","105","610","605","610","605","605"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["700","115"]},"At block , the recommendation server  may collect viewing data from a plurality of media content processing devices , such as at least one target device and multiple source devices.
