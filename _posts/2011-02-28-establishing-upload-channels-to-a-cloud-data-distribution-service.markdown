title: Establishing upload channels to a cloud data distribution service
abstract: Embodiments relate to systems and methods for establishing upload channels to a cloud data distribution (CDD) service. In particular, an administrator of a user network can desire to migrate data to a cloud-based network via the CDD service. The administrator can provide specifications for transferring the data to the CDD service via a connection between the CDD service and the user network. The CDD service can generate a set of options for transferring the data based on the specifications and a specification of the connection. The set of options can be provided to the administrator, the administrator can select one of the options, and the transfer of the data can be initiated according to the selected option.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD","BACKGROUND OF RELATED ART","DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present teachings relate to systems and methods for establishing upload channels to a cloud data distribution service, and more particularly to platforms and techniques for analyzing and configuring data transport connections and schedules based on channel capacities, schedules of users, and other factors.","Cloud computing environments utilize shared resources, software, and information that can be provided for use by end users. For example, a service level agreement (SLA) can be entered into between a vendor, such as an independent software vendor (ISV), and a cloud network provider whereby the cloud network provider agrees to commit an amount of resources associated with virtual machines in the cloud network for use by end users during operation of software products and applications of the vendor. In return, the cloud network provider can charge the vendor a specified rate in proportion to the amount of committed resources. The cloud network provider provides or maintains an amount of resources in the cloud network, such as server uptime, persistent storage, software application instantiation, network performance, cloud storage, support response time, and other elements.","A potential user or customer of the cloud network may wish to migrate or transport local network data from on-premise data stores to the cloud network. Existing data transport channels can have latency and bandwidth issues that can deter potential customers from utilizing large-scale cloud storage or other cloud resources. For example, the potential customers may not be able to afford the time necessary to migrate the local network data to the cloud network. In the case of terabyte-scale data stores or larger, attempting to migrate the data using the packet-switched public Internet could require many hours or days of time, or more. Further, other existing data transport methods such as offloading disks to a data center can be burdensome and time consuming.","Therefore, it may be desirable to provide systems and methods for establishing upload channels to a cloud data distribution service, including an ability to identify, recommend, configure, and\/or optimized data transport channels and schedules based on connection capacities and schedules of users in order to pre-stage large-scale data to a cloud data distribution service.","Embodiments of the present teachings relate to systems and methods for establishing upload channels to a cloud data distribution (CDD) service. In aspects, embodiments relate to platforms and techniques for recommending data transport channels and schedules to a CDD service, based on connection capacities, schedules of users, and\/or other factors. The CDD service can store data that is received from a user network or can transport the data received from an on-premise user network to a target cloud-based network. An administrator of the user network can desire to be presented with options or alternatives to transferring data of the user network to the CDD service. For example, the administrator can desire to transfer data in a short amount of time, within a specified time frame, under a specified cost, and other factors.","According to embodiments, the CDD service can own, operate, or otherwise manage a connection between the user network and the CDD service. An administrator or operator of the user network can generate a set of specifications associated with a transfer of data to the CDD service. The CDD service can receive the set of specifications from the administrator or other users and analyze the specifications in combination with specifications of the connection to generate one or more transfer options. The CDD service can present the one or more transfer options to the administrator for a selection. The data transfer or upload to the CDD service can commence according to the selected option. In embodiments, the data can be transferred in two directions. For example, the data can be transferred from the user network to the CDD service, and from the CDD service to the user network. In embodiments, the CDD service can be located in proximity to a target cloud-based network. In other embodiments, the CDD service can store data received from the user network or transfer data received from the user network to the target cloud-based network.","Embodiments as described herein can be implemented in or supported by a cloud network architecture, or other networks. As used herein, a \u201ccloud\u201d can refer to a cloud-based network comprising a collection of resources that can be invoked to instantiate a virtual machine, process, or other resource for a limited or defined duration. As used herein, a \u201cuser network\u201d can refer to a plurality of components or resources comprising applications, appliances, instances, images, and other data to be transferred to the CDD service and\/or the cloud. Further, as used herein, an \u201cadministrator\u201d of a user network, a CDD service, or a cloud can refer to a person, user, owner, corporation, organization, or other entity having authoritative power to initialize, oversee, or otherwise manage the operation of the user network, CDD service, or cloud. Still further, as used herein, a \u201crecommendation\u201d can refer to an alternative, option, choice, selection, pick, and\/or the like. Still further, as used herein, a \u201cproximity\u201d can refer to a general geographic proximity, range, radius, and\/or otherwise distance between or among components.","As used herein, the \u201cresources\u201d of the user network, CDD service, or cloud can refer to software or hardware such as, for example, applications, programs, servers, device drivers, storage such as hard drives, virtual memory, databases, random access memory (RAM) and other memory, processors, multimedia cards, and the like, in the cloud. The resources can be accessed by users or by software or applications independent from or associated with resources of the user network, CDD service, or cloud. In embodiments, vendors such as ISVs can supply software resources for use with other resources in a cloud. Resources of the cloud can further refer to any communications resources, such as ports or channels provided to a virtual machine or other machine or process in the cloud. Resources can likewise include services, such as Web-based services deployed in the cloud, for example security or identity management services and\/or other resources.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["1","102","108"]},"In embodiments, the entire set of resource servers  or other hardware or software resources used to support the cloud  along with its instantiated virtual machines is managed by a cloud management system . The cloud management system  can comprise a dedicated or centralized server and\/or other software, hardware, and network tools that communicate via network  such as the Internet or other public or private network with all sets of resource servers to manage the cloud  and its operation. To instantiate a new set of virtual machines, a user can transmit an instantiation request to the cloud management system  for the particular type of virtual machine that the user desires to invoke for its intended application. A user can for instance make a request to instantiate a set of virtual machines configured for email, messaging or other applications from the cloud . The request can be received and processed by the cloud management system , which identifies the type of virtual machine, process, or other resource being requested. The cloud management system  can then identify the collection of resources necessary to instantiate that machine or resource. In embodiments, the set of instantiated virtual machines or other resources can for example comprise virtual transaction servers used to support Web storefronts, or other transaction sites.","In embodiments, the user's instantiation request can specify a variety of parameters defining the operation of the set of virtual machines to be invoked. The instantiation request, for example, can specify a defined period of time for which the instantiated machine or process is needed. The period of time can be, for example, an hour, a day, or other increment of time. In embodiments, the user's instantiation request can specify the instantiation of a set of virtual machines or processes on a task basis, rather than for a predetermined amount of time. For instance, a user could request resources until a software update is completed. The user's instantiation request can specify other parameters that define the configuration and operation of the set of virtual machines or other instantiated resources. For example, the request can specify an amount of processing power or input\/output (I\/O) throughput the user desires to be available to each instance of the virtual machine or other resource. In embodiments, the requesting user can for instance specify a service level agreement (SLA) acceptable for their purposes. Other parameters and settings can be used. One skilled in the art will realize that the user's request can likewise include combinations of the foregoing exemplary parameters, and others.","When the request to instantiate a set of virtual machines or other resources has been received and the necessary resources to build that machine or resource have been identified, the cloud management system  can communicate with one or more of the set of resource servers  to locate resources to supply the required components. The cloud management system  can select providers from the diverse set of resource servers  to assemble the various components needed to build the requested set of virtual machines or other resources. It may be noted that in some embodiments, permanent storage such as hard disk arrays may not be included or located within the set of resource servers  available to the cloud management system , since the set of instantiated virtual machines or other resources may be intended to operate on a purely transient or temporary basis. In embodiments, other hardware, software or other resources not strictly located or hosted in the cloud can be leveraged as needed. For example, other software services that are provided outside of the cloud  and hosted by third parties can be invoked by in-cloud virtual machines. For further example, other non-cloud hardware and\/or storage services can be utilized as an extension to the cloud , either on an on-demand or subscribed or decided basis.","With the resource requirements identified, the cloud management system  can extract and build the set of virtual machines or other resources on a dynamic or on-demand basis. For example, one set of resource servers  may respond to an instantiation request for a given quantity of processor cycles with an offer to deliver that computational power immediately and guaranteed for the next hour. A further set of resource servers  can offer to immediately supply communication bandwidth, for example on a guaranteed minimum or best-efforts basis. In other embodiments, the set of virtual machines or other resources can be built on a batch basis or at a particular future time. For example, a set of resource servers  may respond to a request for instantiation at a programmed time with an offer to deliver the specified quantity of processor cycles within a specific amount of time, such as the next 12 hours.","The cloud management system  can select groups of servers in the set of resource servers  that match or best match the instantiation request for each component needed to build the virtual machine or other resource. The cloud management system  can then coordinate the integration of the completed group of servers from the set of resource servers , to build and launch the requested set of virtual machines or other resources. The cloud management system  can track the combined group of servers selected from the set of resource servers , or other distributed resources that are dynamically or temporarily combined, to produce and manage the requested virtual machine population or other resources.","In embodiments, the cloud management system  can generate a resource aggregation table that identifies the various sets of resource servers that will be used to supply the components of the virtual machine or process. The sets of resource servers can be identified by unique identifiers such as, for instance, Internet protocol (IP) addresses or other addresses. The cloud management system  can register the finalized group of servers in the set of resource servers  contributing to an instantiated machine or process.","The cloud management system  can then set up and launch the initiation process for the virtual machines, processes, or other resources to be delivered from the cloud. The cloud management system  can for instance transmit an instantiation command or instruction to the registered group of servers in the set of resource servers . The cloud management system  can receive a confirmation message back from each participating server in the set of resource servers  indicating a status regarding the provisioning of their respective resources. Various sets of resource servers may confirm, for example, the availability of a dedicated amount of processor cycles, amounts of electronic memory, communications bandwidth, or applications or other software prepared to be served.","As shown for example in , the cloud management system  can then instantiate one or more than one set of virtual machines , or other processes based on the resources supplied by the registered set of resource servers  (shown in ). In embodiments, the cloud management system  can instantiate a given number, for example, 10, 500, 1000, or other numbers of virtual machines to be made available to users on a network , such as the Internet or other public or private network. Each virtual machine can be assigned an instantiated machine ID that can be stored in the resource aggregation table, or other record or image of the instantiated population. Additionally, the cloud management system  can store the duration of each virtual machine and the collection of resources utilized by the complete set of instantiated virtual machines .","In embodiments, the cloud management system  can further store, track, and manage a user's identity and associated set of rights or entitlements to software, hardware, and other resources. Each user that populates a set of virtual machines in the cloud can have specific rights and resources assigned and made available to them. The cloud management system  can track and configure specific actions that a user can perform, such as provision a set of virtual machines with software applications or other resources, configure a set of virtual machines to desired specifications, submit jobs to the set of virtual machines or other host, manage other users of the set of instantiated virtual machines  or other resources, and other privileges or actions. The cloud management system  can further generate records of the usage of instantiated virtual machines to permit tracking, billing, and auditing of the services consumed by the user. In embodiments, the cloud management system  can for example meter the usage and\/or duration of the set of instantiated virtual machines , to generate subscription billing records for a user that has launched those machines. Other billing or value arrangements are possible.","The cloud management system  can configure each virtual machine to be made available to users of the network  via a browser interface, or other interface or mechanism. Each instantiated virtual machine can communicate with the cloud management system  and the underlying registered set of resource servers  via a standard Web application programming interface (API), or via other calls or interfaces. The set of instantiated virtual machines  can likewise communicate with each other, as well as other sites, servers, locations, and resources available via the Internet or other public or private networks, whether within a given cloud , or between clouds.","It may be noted that while a browser interface or other front-end can be used to view and operate the set of instantiated virtual machines  from a client or terminal, the processing, memory, communications, storage, and other hardware as well as software resources required to be combined to build the virtual machines or other resources are all hosted remotely in the cloud , . In embodiments, the set of virtual machines  or other resources may not depend on or require the user's own on-premise hardware or other resources. In embodiments, a user can therefore request and instantiate a set of virtual machines or other resources on a purely off-premise basis, for instance to build and launch a virtual storefront or other application.","Because the cloud management system  in one regard specifies, builds, operates and manages the set of instantiated virtual machines  on a logical level, the user can request and receive different sets of virtual machines and other resources on a real-time or near real-time basis, without a need to specify or install any particular hardware. The user's set of instantiated machines , processes, or other resources can be scaled up or down immediately or within a short period of time on an on-demand basis, if desired. In embodiments, the various sets of resource servers that are accessed by the cloud management system  to support a set of instantiated virtual machines  or processes can change or be substituted, over time. The type and operating characteristics of the set of instantiated virtual machines  can nevertheless remain constant or almost constant, since instances are assembled from abstracted resources that can be selected and maintained from diverse sources based on uniform specifications.","In terms of network management of the set of virtual machines  that have been successfully configured and instantiated, the cloud management system  can perform various network management tasks including security, maintenance, and metering for billing or subscription purposes. The cloud management system  of a given cloud , can, for example, install or terminate applications or appliances on individual machines. The cloud management system  can monitor operating virtual machines to detect any virus or other rogue process on individual machines, and for instance terminate the infected application or virtual machine. The cloud management system  can likewise manage an entire set of instantiated virtual machines  or other resources on a collective basis, for instance, to push or deliver a software upgrade to all active virtual machines. Other management processes are possible.","In embodiments, more than one set of virtual machines can be instantiated in a given cloud at the same, overlapping, or successive times. The cloud management system  can, in such implementations, build, launch, and manage multiple sets of virtual machines based on the same or different underlying set of resource servers , with populations of different instantiated virtual machines  such as may be requested by different users. The cloud management system  can institute and enforce security protocols in a cloud , hosting multiple sets of virtual machines. Each of the individual sets of virtual machines can be hosted in a respective partition or sub-cloud of the resources of the main cloud , . The cloud management system  of a cloud can for example deploy services specific to isolated or defined sub-clouds, or isolate individual workloads\/processes within the cloud to a specific sub-cloud. The subdivision of the cloud , into distinct transient sub-clouds or other sub-components which have assured security and isolation features can assist in establishing a multiple user or multi-tenant cloud arrangement. In a multiple user scenario, each of the multiple users can use the cloud platform as a common utility while retaining the assurance that their information is secure from other users of the overall cloud system. In further embodiments, sub-clouds can nevertheless be configured to share resources, if desired.","In embodiments, and as also shown in , the set of instantiated virtual machines  generated in a first cloud can also interact with a set of instantiated virtual machines or processes generated in a second, third or further cloud . Further, the cloud management system  of the first cloud can interface with the cloud management system  of the second cloud , to coordinate those domains and operate the clouds and\/or virtual machines or processes on a combined basis. The cloud management system  of a given cloud , can track and manage individual virtual machines or other resources instantiated in that cloud, as well as the set of instantiated virtual machines or other resources in other clouds.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["300","300","305","307","305","305","305","312","314","316","312","305","314","305","316","305","305"]},"As shown in , the network configuration  can comprise a cloud data distribution (CDD) service  configured to interface with the cloud . In embodiments, the CDD service  can be configured with a distribution management module  and storage . The CDD service  can stage and\/or otherwise store data from the user network  intended to be delivered to the cloud . For example, the CDD service  can store data received from the user network  in the storage  to be delivered or provided to a repository  associated with the cloud . In some embodiments, the storage  can be a data center, set of servers, repositories, or any other type and combination of storage devices. In embodiments, resources of the CDD service  can be physically located within or in proximity to resources of the cloud . For example, the CDD service  can be connected or coupled to the cloud  via a connection  such as, for example, high speed and\/or bandwidth cables, fiber optics, and\/or other high bandwidth connections. In some embodiments, the resources of the CDD service  can be a part of the cloud management system . In further embodiments, the network configuration  can support multiple CDD services , multiple clouds , multiple resources thereof, and multiple combinations thereof.","According to embodiments, the administrator  of the user network  can desire to migrate data, applications, appliances, instances, images, and\/or the like associated with the user network  to the cloud . For example, a bank can desire to migrate its customer and account data into cloud-based storage. In embodiments, the data of the user network  can be transferred to the CDD service  via a set of dedicated channels  such as, for example, a wide area network (WAN), a metropolitan area network (MAN), or other network connections. In embodiments, the set of dedicated channels  can be a public network connection such as, for example, the Internet.","In embodiments, the CDD service  can manage or operate components associated with the set of dedicated channels . For example, the CDD service can lease out connections, pipes, cables, and other like components to customers that desire to migrate data to the cloud  via the CDD service . In embodiments, the CDD service  can charge various rates for various components of the set of dedicated channels , at various times of the day or year, or on various days. For example, the rate for leasing out the set of dedicated channels  can be more during peak hours of the day (e.g. 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM) than off-peak hours (e.g. 5:00 PM to 8:00 AM). For further example, the rate for leasing out half of the components of the set of dedicated channels  can be less than leasing out all of the components of the set of dedicated channels . For further example, the rate can be dependent on a data rate (e.g. 1 gigabyte\/minute) over the set of dedicated channels . It should be appreciated that multiple combinations of rates and prices are envisioned depending on times, amount and\/or multiplicity of components, and\/or other factors.","The administrator  or other entity associated with the user network  can desire to obtain various recommendations or options for migrating data to the cloud  via transmitting the data to the CDD service . In embodiments, the administrator  or other entity can compile a set of specifications  associated with transmitting the data. For example, the set of specifications  can indicate that it is preferential that the data be transmitted during off-peak hours. For further example, the set of specifications  can indicate that it is preferential that a specified amount of the data must be transmitted within a 2 hour time window. It should be appreciated that other combinations or specifications and multiples thereof are envisioned.","The administrator  or other entity can provide the set of specifications  to the CDD service . In embodiments, the set of specifications  can be provided in conjunction with a request for price options for transmitting the data of the user network  to the CDD service . In embodiments, the set of specifications  can be provided in any way, for example physically or over a network connection, such as a network . The distribution management module  can be configured to examine the set of specifications  and the components of the set of dedicated channels  to determine options, recommendations, and the like associated with transmitting the data of the user network  via the set of dedicated channels . In embodiments, the distribution management module  can run a simulation, projection, model, analysis, assessment, breakdown, evaluation, or the like based on any available data. In some embodiments, the distribution management module  can calculate the options based on parameters specified in the set of specifications  and the components of the set of dedicated channels . For example, the distribution management module  can determine that the data can be transmitted in two (2) hours using half of the components of the set of dedicated channels . For further example, the distribution management module  can determine that all of the requested data can be transmitted during off-peak hours for a reduced rate. It should be appreciated that other options are envisioned.","The distribution management module  can provide the options to the administrator  or any other entity associated with the user network . In embodiments, the administrator  can review the options and select one or more of the options based on time constraints, costs, or other factors. Once the one or more options are selected, the distribution management module  and\/or the administrator , or other entity, can initiate and manage the transmission of the data of the user network  to the CDD service  via the set of dedicated channels  and according to the selected one or more options. In embodiments, the data of the user network  can be stored in the storage , or can be transmitted to the cloud  via the connection , or a combination thereof. In other embodiments, the data at the CDD service  or in the storage  can be transferred back to any resources of the user network  in any way, and according to any set of specifications or requirements. In embodiments, the distribution management module  can provide, to the administrator  or other entity of the user network , a status report of the data transmission to the CDD service , the cloud , or a combination thereof, at various times during or after the transmission process.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["400","400","305"]},"As shown in , the chart  can comprise an option number column , a components needed column , a transfer time column , a time frame column , and a cost column . In embodiments, the options as shown in the chart  and as specified in the option number column  can fulfill specifications of the administrator. In other embodiments, the options as specified in the option number column  can be close to fulfilling the specifications of the administrator. In embodiments, the components needed column  can indicate an amount, listing, or specification of the components of a connection (e.g. set of dedicated channels ) that are needed to transfer data to the CDD service. For example, option #2 requires the use of 1 main pipe and 2 secondary pipes to transfer the data.","In embodiments, the transfer time column  can indicate the amount of time needed to transfer the amount of data specified in the specifications of the administrator. For example, if the administrator requires the transfer of 100 terabytes, the CDD service can calculate that the transfer will take, for example as indicated by option #3, one (1) hour. In embodiments, the time frame column  can indicate the time of day at which the transfer would take place. For example, as indicated by option #4, the transfer requested by the administrator would take place between the hours of 08:00 and 16:00. In some embodiments, the options can indicate which days of the week the transfer would take place, if the transfer would take place at different times on different days, and other arrangements.","In embodiments, the cost column  can indicate how much the CDD charges for the transfer. For example, option #1, if selected, would cost the administrator $1,400. In embodiments, the administrator or other entities associated with the user network can weigh the benefits and drawbacks of each of the options returned by the analysis. For example, if the administrator values transferring data in a short amount of time, at off-peak hours, and cost does not much matter, the administrator may select option #3. For further example, if cost is a significant factor to the administrator and the amount of time to transfer the data is not a big factor, the administrator may select option #4. In embodiments, the administrator can select one or more of the presented options, can request further options, can reject the options, and other responses.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 3"],"b":["310","102","305","310","130","132","136","136","130","138","130","134","106"]},"Processor  can also communicate with computer readable storage medium  and the distribution management module , to execute control logic, generate recommendations for data transfer as described herein, and execute a data transfer from the user network  to resources in cloud .

In embodiments, the component data and the specification can be analyzed according to the connection specifications, the transfer rates requested and available, and any other metrics associated with the component data and the specification. In , a set of options for transferring the data from the user network to the CDD resource can be generated based on the analysis. In embodiments, the set of options can fulfill the specification or can detail options that are close to, or do not quite fulfill, the specification. In other embodiments, each of the set of options can detail the needed components of the connection, the necessary transfer time, the cost, and other elements.","In , the set of options can be provided to an administrator of the user network.

In embodiments, an entity associated with the CDD can provide status reports to the administrator at any point before, during, or after the transfer of data. In further embodiments, the CDD resource can locally store the received data or transfer the received data to a cloud network. In , processing can end.","The foregoing description is illustrative, and variations in configuration and implementation may occur to persons skilled in the art.
