title: Acoustic receiver for underwater digital communications
abstract: A system and method and system for receiving communications signals coded at transmission in a frequency hopping waveform includes a sensor that receives acoustic data. A detector joined to the sensor receives the data and separates signals from background noise. Logic determines when the signal ends. Clusters of signals are processed and grouped into combinations of symbols. A computer translates these symbols into messages using a codebook. When multiple possibilities exist, the message is selected from the codebook that maximizes a similarity score. Additional logic is provided to handle situations where unwanted signals are mixed into an otherwise valid symbol sequence, to find the best subset of signals forming a valid message. Selected messages are provided as output to users. In further details, the detector filters the acoustic data and transforms it to the frequency domain. A power spectrum is calculated for detecting signals in specific frequency bands. Integrations are performed over groups of frequencies. A detection is indicated when one integrator has a large variation from the expected background level.

A signal source  is joined to a transducer  to produce an encoded acoustic signal through water . The acoustic signal A, B and C travels through the water  to a sensor , such as a hydrophone, joined to a receiver .","As shown, the acoustic signal can follow several paths. A direct path A through an acoustic channel  is preferred. Acoustic channel  is the region of water  defined by thermal boundaries A and B. The acoustic signal can also travel in path B where it bounces off water  surface  or in path C where it bounces off water  bottom . Other paths are also possible. Each of these paths will arrive at sensor  at a different time. Some paths may interfere with later transmitted acoustic signals.","The acoustic signal can be spread across multiple acoustic frequencies in a technique known as frequency hopping. In this technique, a signal is transmitted at several different frequencies. For example, four fixed length signals positioned sequentially in time at frequencies 1000 Hz, 1040 Hz, 1020 Hz and 1010 Hz are detected and values are assigned to represent the numbers 0421 by sequence of transmission and frequency variation. The numbers correspond to a message in a codebook shared between the transmitter and the receiver.","A standard method for decoding messages transmitted by frequency hopping is by correlating the entire data sequence with replicas of all possible time-frequency combinations that represent possible messages. The method then picks the time-frequency combination that best corresponds with a message. Best correspondence can be determined by correlation magnitude, signal strength or some other metric. Distortion from source\/receiver motion and complex acoustic propagation can be handled by estimation of channel properties and pre-filtering with inverse transfer functions. Under benign circumstances such as with white noise, this approach may allow message decoding at a low signal-to-noise ratio. However, performance can be limited in the presence of interference from other sources that may overlap with communications waveforms.","As can be seen, there is a need for an acoustic receiver for underwater digital communications that provides robust performance in the presence of multipath signal propagation and clutter.","In one aspect of the present disclosure, a system of detecting communications signals can include a sensor configured to detect a plurality of individual communication signals, and a processing device attached to the sensor. The processing device can be configured to separately filter each of the individual signal detections such that they are within a specified bandwidth range, a duration range, a frequency range and time separation range. Here the term filter indicates a selection process where signals within the specified ranges are kept and all others outside the range are rejected from further processing. The processing device can be configured to assign one of a plurality of predetermined values to each of the filtered individual detections based upon the estimated frequency of the signal that is associated with each detection. For example, four fixed length signals positioned sequentially in time at frequencies 1000 Hz, 1040 Hz, 1020 Hz and 1010 Hz are detected and values are assigned to represent the numbers 0421 by sequence of transmission and frequency variation. Combinations of the assigned values may be compared with a codebook of predetermined messages. These values can be associated with a sequence of symbols. The comparison process involves exhaustive enumeration of all possible combinations of values in sets equal to a symbol sequence length and detected within a specified time window to each of the messages in the codebook. The comparison is complete when at least one message matches a combination of assigned values. If multiple messages in the codebook match, the message with the highest similarity score is selected.","In one other aspect of the present disclosure, a method includes detecting a plurality of individual communication signals. Each of the individual signal detections may be separately filtered based on the signals associated with the detections being within a specified bandwidth range, a time duration range, a frequency range and a time separation range. One of a plurality of predetermined values can be assigned to each of the detected individual communication signals based on the estimated frequency of the signal. Upon detection of an expected set of values, the set may be compared with a collection of predetermined messages in a codebook. The set of newly detected values corresponding to a specified time period can include extra bits generated by detection of overlapping clutter signals. In this instance the method may compare all possible combinations of bits making up candidate messages against the message templates in the code book and select the message that produces the highest similarity score.","These and other features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become better understood with reference to the following drawings, description and claims.","The following detailed description is of the best currently contemplated modes of carrying out the invention. The description is not to be taken in a limiting sense, but is made merely for the purpose of illustrating the general principles of the invention, since the scope of the invention is best defined by the appended claims.","The present disclosure relates generally to detecting and decoding received acoustic communication signals in the presence of clutter. Received signals may be processed while rejecting interference from man-made or biologic clutter that may overlap in time and frequency with the received communication signals.","The present disclosure, more specifically, relates to methods of detecting and decoding low bit rate, acoustic communication signals received in the presence of clutter. Undesirable signal detections within a sequence of received signals may be rejected using parametric filters based on bandwidth, duration, frequency and time separation of incoming signals. Decoding the signal may involve evaluating all combinations of expected signal sets and selecting a bit sequence with a highest similarity score to an optimum quantity.","The invention may be implemented with either hardware, such as a computer processor, computer, application specific chip or other processing device, or with software on a general purpose computing device. The invention may further be implemented with a combination of hardware and software.","Referring now to the figures wherein the drawings are for purposes of illustrating embodiments of the present disclosure only, and not for purposes of limiting the same.  is a block diagram  of an acoustic receiver for underwater digital communications. Acoustic communications receiver  can include a sensor , a sensor beamformer  and a processing device . The sensor  can be, for example, an array of hydrophones. The sensor beamformer  provides acoustic data received on sensor  and related acoustic data received at known bearings from sensor . Beamformed acoustic data can include both signals and noise. This data can originate from an acoustic projector such as transducer  from  and can arrive at sensor  through an underwater channel such as  of . Acoustic data can be, for example, an array of data channels that respond best to certain directions of arrival and attenuate noise arriving from other directions.","The processing device  is configured to detect individual incoming communication signals contained in the beamformed acoustic data. Processing device  can be, for example, a computer processor, a signal processor, a computer or another device that includes a computer processor.","Processing device  can be configured to separately filter each beam of beamformed acoustic data such that individual communication signals within the acoustic data are within a predetermined bandwidth range, a time duration range, a frequency range and time separation range. Filtering the individual communication signals may include measuring the number of signals at discrete frequencies found in each of the individual communication signals, and measuring a time separation between the start of signals at each frequency. Filtering can also compare a number of the individual communication signals with a predefined expected number of individual communication signals. Filtering can further be performed by choosing detection parameters that support a processing gain required for particular sender\/receiver geometries. Frequencies of the individual communication signals can be measured or estimated. (Estimation could be necessary because of frequency changes that can occur because of the Doppler effect when sources and\/or receivers are in motion. In the case when more than the expected number of individual communication signals are detected within a certain time window, the decoding process is based on the evaluation of all combinations of the plurality of individual communication signals and comparison of symbol sets associated with the detected signals to a codebook of messages. Examples of the predetermined symbols may include hexadecimal symbols, numeric sequences, letters of the English alphabet, and symbols or characters of other languages or cryptographic systems.","When the number of symbols associated with detected signals exceeds an expected amount within a specified time period, all combinations of the symbols may be compared to a codebook of symbol sets to identify the message with the highest similarity score. The similarity score may be calculated based on a similarity of the bandwidth, frequency, duration and start time separation of the detected signals, to values expected for the predetermined symbols in the codebook. A symbol sequence with a highest similarity score may be selected as the decoded message corresponding to the received communication signals. In addition, an optional parity value can be transmitted, received and used to validate correct reception of the individual communication signals by comparing the parity value frequency with an expected frequency determined by the message portion of the communication signals.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1","FIG. 4","FIG. 5","FIG. 6","FIG. 7"],"b":["40","36","38","34","42","42","44","46","46","48","48"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 2"],"b":["42","42","50","52"]},"In more particular detail, the first stage is signal processing and predetection logic.

The value of \u03b1 in equation (14) can range from 0 to 1. A larger value for \u03b1 reduces the asymptotic variance of the noise background estimate but has the deleterious effect of slowing adaptation to a changing background. Therefore, the value for \u03b1 should be chosen to represent a compromise between these factors. The coefficient \u03b1 can be defined by its desired time constant \u03c4. This time constant is analogous to the time it takes a single-pole, resistive-capacitive filter to decay to 1\/e of its value when stimulated with an impulse of unity amplitude.

The Gaussian assumption is nearly true after normalization because a background estimate effectively \u201cwhitens\u201d the measurements when signal is not present. Moreover, integration of many nearly independent data variables forces a summation to be closely Gaussian by the central limit theorem.

Using a bank of integrators to detect temporary changes in the statistics of a Gaussian time series is known in the art. An intuitively appealing aspect of the decision logic is that it is based on recognizing when the second-order statistics of a new set of measurements have significantly changed compared with the measurement history leading up to the event. Since we have the opportunity to estimate the statistics (mean and variance) of the noise, the detector can take the form of a test that measures how many standard deviations the prospective signal energy is away from the noise After normalization, the measurements z(from equation (15b)) are zero mean and unit variance. For any partial sum, the mean will be zero because the mean was removed in equation (15a). In the noise-only case, normalization of each partial sum k by its standard deviation \u03c3yields a simple measure of deviation from the expectation. The final set of statistics can be maximized in step  across a set of duration hypotheses and compared with a threshold as in step . A threshold exceedance indicates the onset of a signal.

After normalization, both the mean and the standard deviation 1\/\u03bb should be approximately unity. Because the measurements are assumed to be independent and identically distributed, the variance of the sum is the sum of their individual variances. Therefore, the standard deviation is ordinarily \u221a{square root over (k)}. However, in our case, the power spectra are created by overlapping and weighting the input data with a window function prior to the Fourier transform. By the convolution theorem of the Fourier transform, the window function applied in the time domain can be analogously interpreted as a local weighted average of adjacent frequency bins. This slightly reduces the variance and requires a scale factor \u03b3 to align the model with actual data.

If the comparison  of the average cluster frequency is within the boundaries of a data bit frequency, then step  saves a frequency of a data cluster that has been matched with one of the expected signal frequencies.","Step  saves a cluster identifier and saving the bit number of the message sequence detected so far. Step  calculates an initial similarity score that represents how similar the data cluster frequency parameter is to the expected values of a possible message, and returns to step  to determine if all data bits in a received data cluster group are found. If all data bits are found at step , a step  checks that each signal start time in the message sequence is separated by the expected amount. If any of the start time differences in the sequence are outside required bounds the process will return to step . If the start time differences are all within acceptable bounds, the similarity score is further updated in step  to represent how similar the measured start time differences of clusters are to expectations.","Step  checks the remaining clusters for a parity bit. The parity bit can have a specific expected frequency that is based upon the modulo summation of all frequencies of the data bit frequencies. The value of the parity bit frequency gives the decoder a method of validating correct reception of the message sequence. The value of a parity bit frequency is offset from frequencies in the data bit signals to minimize interference from multipath arrivals. A detected cluster group that arrives after the data bit signals with the proper start time difference and other expected signal characteristics such as duration and bandwidth is a candidate parity bit. The signal sequence is accepted if the frequency of a parity bit matches the value expected by modulo summing the indexes of data bit frequencies. In this way, the parity bit may validate correct reception of the cluster group.","Step  checks an average frequency of signals in a candidate parity bit cluster against all the allowed parity bit frequencies. Step  returns to step  if the candidate parity bit cluster does not match any expectations.","Otherwise step  saves a frequency and frequency index of the cluster identified as the parity bit. Step  checks if the difference between the parity bit cluster start time and the last data bit cluster group start is within the specified time difference bounds. If not, control is transferred to step . If so, then step  computes an expected parity bit value may be stored in a buffer memory. Step  determines if the parity bit value corresponds to a value expected from the modulo sum of frequency indexes of the data bits. If so, then a step  returns to the message decoding logic at step . If the parity bit value equals the expected value, then step  updates a similarity score which previously represented similarity of frequency and start time values of the clusters in the cluster group.","After assembly of the cluster group, the group must be translated into a symbol. In step , a message table is searched for a symbol similar to a received bit sequence or cluster group. Step  checks to see if a message has been completely decoded. If so, a message may be formatted and output in step . In step , a flag may be set indicating that the message has not been decoded, and processing can return to the beginning of the pre-detection logic .","It should be understood, of course, that the foregoing relates to preferred embodiments of the invention and that modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the following claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIGS. 6A and 6B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIGS. 7A and 7B","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIGS. 8A and 8B","FIG. 3"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
