computing environment.","In accordance with additional aspects of this particular exemplary embodiment, the may further comprise sharing, using the backup data bank system, at least a portion of the second data in accordance with one or more security settings defined by the user.","In accordance with additional aspects of this particular exemplary embodiment, the techniques may be realized as at least one non-transitory processor readable storage medium for storing a computer program of instructions configured to be readable by at least one processor for instructing the at least one processor to execute a computer process.","In another particular exemplary embodiment, the techniques may be realized as an article of manufacture for providing data management using a backup data bank system, the article of manufacture comprising: at least one non-transitory processor readable storage medium, and instructions stored on the at least one medium, wherein the instructions are configured to be

particular exemplary embodiment, the protection scheme may be applied in accordance with one or more protection policies.","In accordance with other aspects of this particular exemplary embodiment, the protection scheme may indicate how often the second data is backed up.","The present disclosure will now be described in more detail with reference to exemplary embodiments thereof as shown in the accompanying drawings. While the present disclosure is described below with reference to exemplary embodiments, it should be understood that the present disclosure is not limited thereto. Those of ordinary skill in the art having access to the teachings herein will recognize additional implementations, modifications, and embodiments, as well as other fields of use, which are within the scope of the present disclosure as described herein, and with respect to which the present disclosure may be of significant utility.","Currently, an Internet user may generate or store web data (e.g., personal data, business data) on one or more websites. For example, one Internet user may store picture data (e.g., one or more pictures) on a social networking website (e.g., www.Facebook.com), video data (e.g., one or more video clips, one or more movies) on a video sharing website (e.g., www.youtube.com), and blogging data (e.g., one or more blog posts) one a blogging website (e.g., www.huffingtonpost.com). In an attempt to protect such web data from data loss, the Internet user may utilize the cloud computing services of one or more cloud service providers to ensure that the web data stored on the one or more websites is periodically backed up. Current cloud service providers, however, may focus the majority of their innovative resources on innovating robust technologies that are designed to protect database content stored on a cloud provisioned computing resource (e.g., for a small business) as opposed to web data generated or stored on websites. Accordingly, current cloud service providers may not provide an Internet user with flexible data protection configuration options (e.g., options defining how the web data is backed up, options defining how often the web data is backed up, options defining where the web data is backed up). Furthermore, an Internet user that enlists such cloud computing services may not be compensated (e.g., monetarily) in the event of a data loss (e.g., a data loss that occurs as a result of a backup failure).","In one embodiment, certain techniques for providing data management using a backup data bank system are provided. In such an embodiment, a backup data bank system may be coupled to one or more computing resource systems and one or more client devices (e.g., associated with one or more users) in a cloud computing environment. Accordingly, a user may enlist the cloud computing services of the backup data bank system to control and manage the protection of web data stored on one or more computing resource systems (e.g., one or more websites) in the cloud computing environment for a subscription fee (e.g., a monthly fee, an annual fee).","In certain embodiments, during an account activation stage (e.g., a registration stage), a backup data bank system (e.g., backup data bank server) may create and store a backup data bank account on behalf of a user in response to user input. As a result, the backup data bank system may provide the user with a unique backup data bank account number that may be used to identify the user's backup data bank account.","In certain embodiments, the backup data bank system may generate and store a data directory for each data bank account number maintained on the backup data bank system. A data directory may include data that indicates at least one pointer to data owned by a corresponding user on one or more computing resource systems. For example, a first user with a first backup data bank account may be associated with a data directory that points to web data stored on a first computing resource system and web data stored on a second computing resource system. In another example, a second user with a second backup data bank account may be associated with a data directory that points to web data stored on the first computing resource system and web data stored on a third computing resource system. In yet another example, a third user with a third backup data bank account may be associated with a data directory that points to web data stored on the second computing resource system, web data stored on the third computing resource system, and web data stored on a fourth computing resource system.","During the account activation stage (or later), the backup data bank system may allow a user to define one or more security settings, a protection scheme, or a combination of both. In one embodiment, a security setting may indicate how data associated with a data directory (e.g., owned by a user) may be shared. For example, a user may define a security setting such that a portion of data associated with a data directory is allowed to be shared with one or more pre-authorized medical professionals. In another example, a user may define a security setting such that data associated with a data directory is allowed to be shared with employees of the user.","In another embodiment, a protection scheme may define any, or a combination, of how web data associated with a user is backed up, how often web data is backed up, and where web data is backed up. For example, a user may define a protection scheme that indicates a portion of data associated with a data directory is to be backed up daily, while another portion of the data associated with the data directory is to be backed up weekly.","When a user rents or buys computing resources from a computing resource system, a user may input their unique data bank account number. A backup data bank agent stored on the computing resource system may add a new entry to the corresponding data directory stored on the backup data bank system using an Application Programming Interface (API). If, for example, the corresponding data directory is not associated with a pre-defined protection scheme, the backup data bank agent may apply a default protection scheme to the data associated with the data directory. Otherwise, the pre-defined protection scheme may be applied to data associated with the corresponding data directory.","In the event a user requests a data restore from the backup data bank system, the backup data bank system may notify a computing resource system storing the data. In the event a computing resource system requests a data restore from the backup data bank system, the backup data bank system may request approval to provide the restored data to the computing resource system from a user that owns the data.","If a data loss occurs, the backup data bank system may compensate a user that owns the data loss. For example, the backup data bank system may monetarily compensate the user based on the amount of data loss. In another example, the backup data bank system may monetarily compensate the user based on the amount of productivity lost as a result of the data loss.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["100","100","100","110","120","140","140","200","110","120","140","140","150","140","160","1","140","160","1","140","142","144","146","140","140","170","170","180","1","140","140","110","120","150","140","190","120","122","124","126","128"]},"With reference to computer system  of , modem , network interface , or some other method may be used to provide connectivity from one or more of client  and client  to network .
