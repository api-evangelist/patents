{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["Websites incorporate active toolbars into their web pages. An active toolbar includes buttons that run scripts, which pass information to other websites. Providers of different websites use different architectures and\/or implementations for different toolbars. A service provider (e.g., an Internet service provider (ISP)) can add active toolbars to web pages. The service provider has to support different architectures of the different toolbars. However, the different architectures are difficult to manage and exhaust considerable resources of the service provider. Furthermore, the service provider is unable to use a single, uniform architecture to provide different toolbars, for different websites, to different types of computing devices.","The following detailed description refers to the accompanying drawings. The same reference numbers in different drawings may identify the same or similar elements.","An implementation, described herein, may provide a uniform architecture for including toolbars in different web pages that are provided to user devices, such as mobile devices. For example, a management system, of an ISP, may receive, from a user device, a request for a web page of a website. The management system may retrieve the web page and subscriber data associated with a user of the user device. The management system may include a toolbar in the web page based on the subscriber data and information associated with the web page. The management system may transmit the web page with the toolbar to the user device. The toolbar may allow the user to keep the toolbar for other web pages in exchange for opting-in for targeted advertising.","In the description to follow, reference will be made to web pages and websites. A web page, as used herein, is to be broadly interpreted to include any machine-readable and machine-storable work product, including a document. A document may include, for example, an e-mail, a file, a combination of files, one or more files with embedded links to other files, a news group posting, a blog, a web advertisement, a Uniform Resource Locator (URL), etc. In the context of the Internet, a common document is a web page. Web pages often include textual information and may include embedded information (such as meta information, images, hyperlinks, etc.) and\/or embedded instructions (such as Javascript, etc.). A website, as used herein, is to be broadly interpreted to include a collection of related documents, such as documents associated with a same host or organization. For example, the collection of related documents might include all or a subset of the documents associated with a traditional website, directory, or sub-directory, or some other set of documents that are related to each other (e.g., on the same host or associated with the same organization).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","110","120","130","140","150","120","122","124","126","110","122","124","126","130","140","150","110","122","124","126","120","130","140","150","100","100"]},"Furthermore, two or more of the components, of , may be implemented within a single device, or a single component may be implemented as multiple, distributed devices. Also, components of environment  may interconnect via wired and\/or wireless connections. In other words, any two components, of environment , may communicate via a wired connection, a wireless connection, or a combination of a wired connection and a wireless connection.","User device  may include any computation or communication device, such as a communication device that is capable of communicating with web server  via CDS  and network . In one implementation, user device  may take the form of any mobile device, including a smart phone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a handheld computer, a personal media player, etc. Alternatively, or additionally, user device  may take the form of any computer, including a web service terminal, a personal computer, a laptop computer, or any other device capable of transmitting and\/or receiving data.","In one example, user device  may enable a user to utilize an Internet browser to request a web page of a website provided\/hosted by web server . User device  may receive the web page with a toolbar from CDS . User device  may display the web page with the toolbar. The user may use user device  to interact with the web page and\/or the toolbar.","CDS  may include one or more devices that gather, process, search, store, and\/or provide information in a manner similar to that described herein. CDS  may represent an in-line network element of network , and may, for example, intercept any requests transmitted from user device  to web server . In another implementation, CDS  may include additional components, fewer components, different components, and\/or differently arranged components than are shown in . For example, CDS  may include toolbar server .","CDS  may receive a request for a web page (e.g., a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) GET request) from user device . CDS  may retrieve the web page from web server  based on the request. In one implementation, CDS  may identify a location of the web page (e.g., stored at web server ) by using a reverse IP look-up. Alternatively, or additionally, CDS  may identify the location of the web page (e.g., stored at web server ) by using a domain naming system (DNS) query evaluation.","CDS  may identify a subscriber (e.g., determine an identifier of the subscriber) associated with user device  based on the request for the web page. CDS  retrieve subscriber data (e.g., based on the identifier) associated with the subscriber and\/or user device .","CDS  may transmit a request for a toolbar, including the subscriber data and\/or information associated with the web page, to toolbar server . CDS  may receive code (e.g., HMTL code) for the toolbar and an insertion point that specifies where to insert the code for the toolbar in code of the web page (e.g., at a specific line). CDS  may insert the toolbar into the web page, and transmit the web page with the toolbar to user device .","Alternatively, or additionally, CDS  may receive a request from user device  to keep the toolbar, as a browser toolbar, for other web pages. In response, CDS  may provide options to user device  for keeping the toolbar as the browser toolbar. In one example, the options may require the subscriber to opt-in for targeted advertising in exchange for keeping the toolbar as the browser toolbar. CDS  may receive a selection of one of the options and an acceptance by the user to opt-in for the targeted advertising. Thereafter, CDS  may provide the browser toolbar, based on the selected option, to user device .","CDS  may collect analytical and reporting (AR) information associated with traffic being sent to and\/or received from user device . CDS  may, for example, obtain AR information associated with traffic flows between user device  and web server  and\/or one or more other web servers, which may include a quantity of communications with each of the web servers, a type of content associated with the communications, a type of content genre, etc. CDS  may obtain AR information associated with communications (e.g., instant message, email, calls, social networking, etc.) between user device  and other user devices (not shown in ) (e.g., quantity, duration, bandwidth, etc.). CDS  may collect AR information associated with network performance when user device  communicates with the web servers and\/or the other user devices. CDS  may use the collected AR information to ascertain usage behaviors associated with user device  and\/or to identify preferences associated with user device  (e.g., preferred content genres, purchase habits, calling habits, browsing patterns, etc.). CDS  may provide information associated with the usage behaviors and\/or the preferences to toolbar server  in toolbar requests.","EPC device  may include a network device that, receives, processes, switches, routes, and\/or transmits packets associated with traffic being transported to and\/or from network . For example, EPC device  may take the form of a routing device, a switching device (e.g., an Ethernet switch, etc.), a multiplexing device, or a device that performs a combination of routing, switching, and\/or multiplexing functions. In one example implementation, EPC device  may be a digital device. In another example implementation, EPC device  may be an optical device. In yet another example implementation, EPC device  may be a combination of a digital device and an optical device.","EPC device  may generally function to connect user device  to CO server  and\/or web server . For example, EPC device  may transfer traffic, received from user device  (e.g., via network ) to CO server . In another example, EPC device  may receive, from network  and via CO server , traffic that is destined for user device  and EPC device  may send the traffic to user device  via network . EPC device  may transfer DNS queries, received from user device  via network , to a domain name system (DNS) cache to obtain an IP address associated with web server  and\/or a particular a content distribution network (CDN) caching server from which content is to be retrieved. EPC device  may forward, to CO server , the obtained IP address that enables the content to be retrieved from web server  and\/or the CDN caching server.","The DNS cache may be a memory device, in DCS , that stores one or more IP addresses for one or more web servers, including web server , and\/or one or more CDN caching servers from which content can be obtained. The CDN caching server, in DCS , may process a variety of types of content that is downloaded from the one or more web servers (e.g., as streaming media, progressive streaming, progressive download, etc.) for storage by CDN caching server. CDS  may retrieve content from the CDN caching server instead of retrieving the content from one of the one or more web servers.","AR server  may include one or more server devices, or other types of computation or communication devices, that gather, process, search, store, and\/or provide information in a manner similar to that described herein. In one example implementation, AR server  may monitor and\/or collect AR information associated with traffic being sent to and\/or received from each of user devices .","For example, AR server  may, based on the monitoring, obtain information associated with user habits of each of user devices . AR server  may, for example, obtain information associated with a time (e.g., total time, peak time, average time, etc. per second, day, week, etc.) and\/or at what cost (e.g., based on minutes used and\/or rate per minute, etc.) that a particular user device  communicates with web server  and\/or one or more other web servers (herein, collectively referred to as the one or more web servers). AR server  may obtain information associated with a quantity of content that is downloaded (e.g., total quantity of bytes per second, week, month, etc.), a quantity of bandwidth used (e.g., total, peak, average, etc. per second, week, month, etc.), and\/or a quantity of purchases made (e.g., total, average, etc. per day, week, month, etc.) as a result of communications with the one or more web servers.","AR server  may obtain information associated with content that is accessed and\/or downloaded from the one or more web servers, which may include a method of download (e.g., via streaming media, progressive download, etc.), a type of content (e.g., movies, video, music, audio, games, documents, images, etc.), a genre associated with the content (e.g., sports, science fiction, news, etc.), etc. Based on the information associated with the content, AR server  may generate a report that identifies a preferred content provider (e.g., top one, top five, top , etc.), a preferred type of content, a preferred genre of content, etc. for user device . Additionally, or alternatively, AR server  may generate another report that identifies a quantity of content that user device  is likely to download, a type of product that user device  is likely to purchase, a likelihood that user device  may purchase the type of product, etc. AR server  generate reports for other user devices  and\/or may generate an aggregate report for service provider network  based on the reports for user device  and\/or the other user devices .","AR server  may monitor flows (e.g., traffic) associated with user devices  that are transported via network  and may store information, associated with the flows, in a flow data record (FDR). The information, associated with the flows, may include information associated with a quantity of concurrent flows (e.g., total, average, peak, etc.), types and\/or quantities of IP addresses (e.g., IP version four (IPv4) addresses, IP version six (IPv6) addresses, etc.), a time associated with peak flows, a time associated with peak quantities of each type of IP addresses, a quantity of DNS queries (e.g., from user device  to DNS cache ), information associated with a duration of sessions (e.g., peak, average, minimum, etc.), etc. Additionally, or alternatively, the information associated with the flows may include information associated with data transfer rates (e.g., peak, average, minimum), trends associated with data transfer rates (e.g., increasing, decreasing, etc.), and\/or upload to download ratios (e.g., based on a type of user device , location, etc.). AR server  may generate a report that includes information associated with the flows that originate from user device .","AR server  may collect information associated with network performance based on traffic flowing between user devices  and web server  and\/or one or more other web servers. The information associated with the network performance may include information associated with a download time (e.g., peak, average, etc.), a quantity of latency and\/or jitter per flow (e.g., peak, average, etc.), a quantity of lost and\/or delayed packets (e.g., total, average, peak, etc.), etc.","Additionally, or alternatively, AR server  may, for example, correlate user habits, preferred content, preferred web server , etc., associated with user device , with user habits, preferred content, preferred web servers, etc. associated with other user devices that user device  communicates with.","AR server  may send all or a portion of the information, associated with user device , to toolbar server  (e.g., via CO server ) that permits toolbar server to provide a toolbar, to user device , in a manner that is tailored and\/or customized to the user habits associated with a subscriber of user device .","CO server  may include one or more server devices, or other types of computation or communication devices, that gather, process, search, store, and\/or provide information in a manner similar to that described herein. In one example implementation, CO server  may perform content optimization operations on content being served to user device . For example, CO server  may process content, destined for user device , to maximize throughput and\/or avoid congestion while being transported over network . CO server  may, in another example, convert the content to a format, based on a type of user device , that enables the content to be received, processed, and\/or rendered on user device  within a period of time that is less than a threshold.","CO server  may perform network access translation (NAT) operations on traffic being sent to and\/or received from user device . For example, CO server  may translate an internal Internet protocol (IP) address, obtained from traffic that is received from user device , to a corresponding public IP address that can be used by network web server  during a communication session with user device . In another example, CO server  may translate the public IP address, associated with traffic received from network  that is destined for user device , to a private IP address that can be used by EPC device  and\/or network  to send the traffic to user device . CO server  may store, as information associated with NAT bindings, information associated with one or more private IP addresses that are associated with user device  in a manner that corresponds to one or more public IP addresses associated with user device .","CO server  may extract and\/or remove information that permits the identity of user device  to be determined based on traffic and\/or other information that is sent to web server . For example, CO optimization server may remove and\/or extract information, associated with user device  (e.g., packets, data contained within packets and\/or headers, etc.), included within the traffic being sent to web server . The information, associated with user device , may include an identifier associated with user device  (e.g., a mobile directory number (MDN), an electronic serial number (ESN), a subscriber identity module (SIM) universal resource identifier (URI), an international mobile subscriber identifier (IMSI), and\/or other identifiers). In another example, CO server  may extract and\/or remove information associated with a location of user device  (e.g., when a user, of user device , has not authorized dissemination of the location of user device ).","CO server  may process the content in a number of ways. For example, CO server  may process the content, received from the CDN caching server and\/or web server  by resizing packets, associated with the content. Resizing the packets may enable the content to be more efficiently served to user devices . For example, CO server  may process the packets in a manner that conforms to a maximum transmission unit (MTU) associated with network . Processing the packets in the manner that conforms to the MTU may permit the content to be served at a maximum data transfer rate (e.g., greater than a threshold) while avoiding congestion within network .","CO server  may process the packets by performing packet and\/or header compression. The packets may be resized and\/or compressed to achieve a maximum bandwidth and\/or data transfer rate while avoiding congestion and serving the content to user device . CO server  may accelerate data delivery associated with the content by reducing the quantity of packets associated with transporting and\/or serving content to user devices . For example, CO server  may perform acknowledgement packet thinning by delaying the transport of acknowledgment packets, which may reduce a quantity of redundant acknowledgement packets being transported between network  and CO server  while sending the content to user device .","In another example, CO server  may repackage one or more smaller packets into larger packets (e.g., up to the MTU) to increase a transfer data rate and\/or bandwidth associated with the content. In yet another example, when lost packets are detected, CO server  may use selective acknowledgement packets, that identify packets that were received from content provider , which informs web server  to resend only those packets identified as missing.","CO server  may use one or more application programming interfaces (APIs) that permit CO server  to receive location-based services (LBS) from network . For example, CO server  may use an API, associated with the LBS (hereinafter referred to as an \u201cLBS API\u201d), to obtain, from network , information associated with a location of user device . The information associated with a location may include information associated with latitude and\/or longitude information, a grid location, a geographic area, an address, etc., associated with each of user devices . CO server  may send the location information, associated with all or a portion of user devices , to toolbar server  and\/or web server  if authorized by a subscriber associated with user devices . CO server  may not send the information, associated with the location, to toolbar server  and\/or web server  if the subscriber has not authorized the dissemination of the location information.","CO server  may reduce processing time associated with user devices  for which content is being served. For example, CO server  may convert content, received from the CDN caching server and\/or web server , into a format that can easily be received, processed, and\/or rendered on user device . CO server  may, for example, use information associated with a type of user device  (e.g., a model identifier, information associated with an operating system being used by user device , etc.) to convert the received content into the format that causes a time, associated with mobile page rendering on user device , to be reduced (e.g., below a threshold). CO server  may identify user device  based on NAT bindings (e.g., described above with respect to EPC device ) and may obtain information, associated with the type of user device , from information associated with a user profile for user device  (e.g., from a home subscriber server (HSS) associated with network ).","Toolbar server  may represent a single server device or a collection of server devices and\/or computer systems. Toolbar server  may store and\/or have access to rules for selecting formats and components of toolbars based on subscriber data (e.g., a type of user agent, such as a browser, used by a user of user device ) and\/or information associated with web pages (e.g., addresses of the web pages). For example, one of the rules may specify that a particular format and particular components are to be selected for a toolbar when the toolbar is for a particular web page (e.g., corresponding to www.example.com) and user device  has a particular type of browser (e.g, a mobile device browser). A format of a toolbar may include one or more of a size, a layout of components, a color, a style (e.g., a font), an orientation (e.g., horizontal or vertical), and\/or one or more other features associated with an appearance of the toolbar.","Alternatively, or additionally, toolbar server  may also store and\/or have access to rules for identifying insertion points based on the subscriber data and\/or the information associated with the web pages. For example, one of the rules may specify a particular insertion point in a HTML code of the particular web page when user device  has a particular type of browser.","Toolbar server  may receive a request for a toolbar from CDS . Toolbar server  may select components and\/or a format for the toolbar, generate code for the toolbar, and\/or identify an insertion point, of a web page, for the toolbar based on information provided by CDS  in the request for the toolbar. Toolbar server  may transmit the code for the toolbar and the insertion point to CDS .","CDS  and\/or toolbar server  may transfer information between one another by using an Internet Protocol (IP), a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), an IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) protocol, a HTTP, a User Datagram Protocol (UDP), and\/or any other method for transferring structured data from one device to another. Alternatively, or additionally, CDS  and toolbar server  may be combined into a single system.","In one example, toolbar server  may include an analytics engine (not shown in ). The analytics engine may receive information from AR server  of CDS . The information may include, for example, browsing history of the user, which may be collected based on web page requests received from user device  of the user. The analytics engine may adjust rules and\/or create new rules for selecting components of toolbars based on the collected information.","Web server  may represent a single server device or a collection of server devices and\/or computer systems for hosting a website. Web server  may receive a request (e.g., an HTTP GET request) for a particular web page of the website. Web server  may retrieve code (e.g., Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) code) of the particular web page. Web server  may transmit the web page, in the form of the code, to user device  via CDS  and\/or network .","Network  may include a single network, multiple networks of a same type, or multiple networks of different types. For example, network  may include one or more of a direct connection between devices, a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN) (e.g., the Internet), a metropolitan area network (MAN), a wireless network (e.g., a general packet radio service (GPRS) network), a telephone network (e.g., a Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) or a cellular network), a subset of the Internet, an ad hoc network, a fiber optic network (e.g., a fiber optic service (FiOS) network), or any combination of the aforementioned networks.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","110","120","122","124","126","130","140","110","120","122","124","126","130","140","200","200"]},"As shown in , device  may include a bus , a processor , a memory , an input component , an output component , and a communication interface .
