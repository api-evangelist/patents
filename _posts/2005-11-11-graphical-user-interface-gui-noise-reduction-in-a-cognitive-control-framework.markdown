title: Graphical user interface (GUI) noise reduction in a cognitive control framework
abstract: Reducing graphical user interface (GUI) noise maybe achieved by recording a first execution scenario for control of operation of an application program having a GUI during a recording phase of operation of a cognitive control framework system, setting soft conditions for a search for the application program for the first execution scenario, playing back the application program according to the first execution scenario during a playback phase of operation of the cognitive control framework system, updating the first execution scenario to form a second execution scenario to reduce GUI noise conditions observed during playback, including updating recorded images originally generated by the GUI during the recording phase and updating coordinates for user input data, setting stronger conditions for the search for use in subsequent playbacks; and playing back the application program according to the second execution scenario with the stronger conditions for search.

Field","The present invention relates generally to automatic control of software application programs and image analysis and, more specifically, to analyzing graphical user interface (GUI) images displayed by an application program for automatic control of subsequent execution of the application program.","2. Description","Typical application program analysis systems capture keyboard input data and mouse input data entered by a user. The captured input data may then be used to replay the application program. These systems rely on playback of the application program on the same computer system used to capture the input data, and thus are not portable.","Some existing application program analysis systems use image recognition techniques that are dependent on screen resolution and\/or drawing schemes, or have strong dependencies to the underlying operating system (OS) being used. Such systems typically rely on dependencies such as Windows32 or X-Windows application programming interfaces (APIs). This limits their portability and usefulness.","Hence, better techniques for analyzing the GUIs of application programs are desired.","Embodiments of the present invention comprise a cognitive control framework (CCF) for automatic control of software application programs that have a graphical user interface (GUI). Examples of such applications programs may be executed on current operating systems such as Microsoft Windows\u00ae and Linux, for example, as well as other operating systems. An embodiment of the present invention creates a system simulating a human user interacting with the GUI of the application program and using the GUI for automatic control of the application program without relying on dependencies such as specific graphical libraries, windowing systems, or visual controls interfaces or implementations. The CCF comprises an easy-to-use cross-platform tool useful for GUI testing based on pattern recognition. By being independent of any OS-specific controls and graphical libraries, the CCF may be used for interaction with non-standard graphical interfaces as well as with well known ones. The system provides for recording any kind of keyboard and mouse actions the user performs while working with the GUI of the application program and then providing playback of the recorded scenario. In the present invention, image analysis of captured display data (such as screen shots, for example) is performed to identify actions of the application program corresponding to user input data. These actions and input data may be stored for use in future playback of the same user scenario for automatically interacting with the application program.","Embodiments of the present invention comprise operating on two phases: a recording phase and a playback phase. During the recording phase, the system is \u201clearning\u201d how to control the application program. The system registers and captures input actions supplied by the user (such as a mouse click or entering of text via a keyboard, for example) and display data (e.g. screen shots) of images displayed by the application program in response to those actions. The user actions, the time interval between actions, resulting display data of the GUI of the application program, and possibly other data and\/or commands form an execution scenario. By following the execution scenario, during the playback phase the system provides the same but fully automatic execution of the application program (simulating the user control but without the real presence of the user). Automatic execution is made possible due to a plurality of image analysis and structural techniques applied correspondingly to images during the recording and playback phases.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","102","104","106","108","110","106","108","112"]},"At a later point in time, during the playback phase the playback component  may be initiated. At block , simulated user activity may be generated based on the execution scenario. That is, saved inputs and commands from the execution scenario may be input to the application program for purposes of automatic control using the CCF system. While the application program processes this data, display data may be changed on the display as a result. At block , the CCF system performs image analysis on the playback display data currently being shown as a result of application program processing and the display data captured during the recording phase. At block , recorded time conditions may be checked to take into account possible variations in playback. For example, the time when an object appears may be within a time interval based on a recorded time. For example, in one embodiment a lower bound time (time to start the search) may be extracted from the saved data in the execution scenario and an upper bound time may be the lower bound time plus 10%, or some other appropriate value. Processing of blocks , , and  each result in data being stored in report . At block , the CCF system controls execution of the application program based on the results of the image analysis. Blocks ,  and  may be repeated for each in a sequence of user input data items from the execution scenario.","The time interval between sequential actions is a part of the captured execution scenario. However, while following the execution scenario in the playback phase, one should not expect that the time interval between any two actions at playback will be equal to the time interval between the same two actions during the recording phase. There are a number of objective reasons why this interval could be different on playback than during recording. For example, the application program during recording and playback may be executed on different computer systems having different processor speeds, or an application program could require different times for the same actions during playback due to accesses of external data or resources. This indicates a requirement in the CCF system to handle flexible time conditions, e.g. handle some tolerance for the time interval between actions during the playback phase. During that time interval at playback, the system checks the recorded display data to the playback display data several times to determine if the playback display data is substantially similar to the recorded display data. A finding that the two are substantially similar indicates that a previous user action has completed and the system can progress to the next action in the execution scenario. This activity may be similar to the situation where the user is interacting with the application program and pauses periodically to view the display to determine if the expected visible changes to the display have been made by the application program based on previous actions. If so, then a new action may be performed. If at the end of a higher bound of the time interval the application program has not produced an image on the display that the CCF system expected according to the execution scenario, then the CCF system may interrupt the playback of the execution scenario and generate an error report describing how the execution scenario has not been followed. In one embodiment, the scenario may be corrected and the CCF system may be required to use other branches to continue.","The cognitive control framework (CCF) system of embodiments of the present invention performs image analysis and object detection processing on display data from the GUI of the application program. The CCF system includes comparing an image captured during a recording phase (called IR) to the corresponding image captured during the playback phase (called IP). One task of the system is to detect an object in the IR to which the user applied an action, find the corresponding object in the IP, and continue progress on the execution path of the execution scenario by applying the action to the detected object. These steps may be repeated for multiple objects within an image, and may be repeated across multiple pairs of IRs and IPs over time. An object that the user has applied an action to may be called an \u201cobject of action.\u201d Absence in the IP of the object of action corresponding to the one found at IR means that one should capture the IP again at a later time and try to find the object of action again. Finally, either an object of action may be found in the IP or execution of the scenario may be halted and a report generated describing how the wrong state was achieved and the scenario may not be continued. In embodiments of the present invention, this detection of objects of action may be done in real time during the playback phase, progressing from one action to another. Thus, the image analysis process employed must have good performance so as to introduce only a minimal disturbance to the time conditions at playback.","The CCF system of embodiments of the present invention comprises an image analysis and detecting process. Such a process has at least two requirements. First, the process should be able to overcome some variations in the captured images such as different color scheme, fonts, and the layout and state of the visual elements. In one embodiment, comparison constraints for checking these items (color scheme, fonts, etc.) may be set to specified parameters in accordance with specific needs. Overcoming these variations is desirable because recording and playback might be executed in different operating environments such as different screen resolutions, different visual schemes, different window layouts, and so on. Additionally, there could be insignificant differences in corresponding IR (usually captured after an action was applied to an object of interest) and IP pairs (captured after a previous action was completed). Second, the implementation of the image analysis and object detection process should be fast enough to introduce only minimal disturbances and delay of application execution during playback.","By processing captured images, the system builds descriptions of the images in terms of the objects presented on them. Each display object may be represented by its contour and a plurality of properties. Table I enumerates some possible contour properties for use in the present invention. In other embodiments, other properties may also be used.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Contour properties"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"182pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Property","Description"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Location","Coordinates (on the image) of the contour center."]},{"entry":["Image size","Characteristic contour size.

At block , the CCF system filters contours by size to determine contours that may become hypotheses for active objects and contours that connect them. At block , the CCF system filters the objects by basic space layout in the IP to determine subsets of hypotheses for active and additional objects. For example, filtering criteria for space layout may include tables, wizards, and menus. In one embodiment, the user (or CCF schema with a cascade search) could set both strict (e.g. \u201cas is\u201d) and fuzzy (e.g. \u201cobject could be near each other\u201d) conditions. At block , the CCF system filters the objects by content to produce further subsets of hypotheses for active and additional objects. For example, the filtering criteria by content may include images and text. Moreover, in one embodiment, the user (or CCF schema with cascade search) could set both strict (e.g. \u201cimage should have difference in a few points and text should have minimal differences on a base of Levenstein distance\u201d) and fuzzy (e.g. \u201cimage could be stable to highlighting and have insignificant structural changes and text could have noticeable differences on a base of Levenstein distance without consideration of digits\u201d) conditions. At block , the CCF system performs structural filtering of the objects to produce a best hypothesis for active objects.","Finally, at block , the CCF system recalculates old actions for a new object by applying the action according to the execution scenario. For example, suppose the user selected (via the mouse) the screen location at (X=70, Y=200), and that a button is displayed at the rectangle denoted (X1=50, Y1=150, X2=100, Y2=100). In the IP, the button may be represented as a rectangle denoted (X1=250, Y1=300, X2=200, Y2=100). For a general view, coordinates of the top left corner and the size of the rectangle may be changed. The mouse click (user selection) may be recalculated based on the position of the button and the scaled size (for X and Y coordinates). The calculation gives the new mouse click coordinates (e.g., X=290, Y=350).","Table II shows the input data and output of the image analysis process for .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"259pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE II"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Image Analysis Processing"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},{},"Input parameters"]},{"entry":["Step","Input Data","Result","and Description"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["1.

These figures show applying the process blocks of  to a first image from the recording phase (IR) and a corresponding image from the playback phase (IP).  is an example display of the GUI of an application program captured and saved during a recording phase. This IR screen shot shows that the item \u201cTuning Activity\u201d was selected by the user using a mouse.  is an example display of the GUI of an application program captured during a playback phase.

These contours were identified after performing blocks  and  of  on the image from . The contour with the text labeled \u201cTuning\u201d has been determined in this example to be the current object of activity.  is an example image illustrating objects identified during contouring operations of the playback phase according to an embodiment of the present invention. This image is output from performing block  of  on the sample image of . Finally,  is an example image illustrating a hypothesis during the playback phase according to an embodiment of the present invention.  shows hypotheses from  for the \u201cTuning Activity\u201d object of activity from . Size, space, content, and structural filtration of blocks - has been performed. The ellipse represents the contour which was selected as the best hypothesis from performing block  of . A new point for the mouse click is recalculated relative to the given object (i.e., the \u201ctuning\u201d display object).","In some scenarios, filtration according to blocks  through  still result in many hypotheses to consider. The term hypothesis as used herein means a contour of an object on the playback image which corresponds to a contour of an object on the recorded image at a point in time. This means the previously applied filters didn't reject this correspondence of objects. When the number of hypotheses is large, more computational resources are needed. In one embodiment of the present invention, a methods for hypotheses filtration may be used to reduce the number of GUI hypotheses for objects in space (two dimensional (2D) for screen shots and multidimensional in the general case).","These methods comprise a search scheme that is simple yet powerful to select the right hypotheses despite the presence of several GUI noise conditions. In embodiments of the present invention, the noise conditions may comprise changeable color schemes, highlighting of items, noise from video devices, anti-aliasing, and other effects. GUI noise has two sources. The first source is the difference in GUI representation from run to run of the CCF system for a given application program. Between runs, for example there could be different positions of rows in a table, additional controls in a new product version, and so n. These differences result in changes in the playback images in comparison to the recorded images, as shown in the example images of . The second source correlates with points of time when recorded and playback images are captured, especially if the user used a computer system's mouse for the user inputs to the application program under test. Briefly, when a recorded image is captured during a mouse action (such as clicking on the \u201cNew\u201d item of ), it is correlated with a captured playback image representing the results of the previous user action (such as clicking on the \u201cFile\u201d menu header in ). During the recording phase, the user moving the mouse from the \u201cFile\u201d command to the \u201cNew\u201d command activates a highlighting operation that is captured. During the playback phase, the CCF system doesn't move the mouse from the \u201cFile\u201d position in the previous step because the position of the \u201cNew\u201d command is not yet known (and must still be determined). These things change the view of the playback image in comparison with the corresponding recorded image.","Similar noise conditions are evident in . Movement of a mouse results in generation of animation of the \u201cclam\u201d icon in . A similar situation is shown in . Movement of the mouse generates the \u201cResource Perspective\u201d tool tip during the recording phase on . Movement of the mouse from the previous step on the playback phase generated a \u201cVTune\u2122 Performance Tools Perspective\u201d tool tip to be displayed, and the CCF system captured this event in the playback image as shown in .","In one embodiment of the present invention, the Cognitive Control Framework system reduces GUI noise after the recording phase for more effective play back. This embodiment correlates well with changes to the application program during product evolution. If an execution scenario is run several times, the CCF system will typically have problems with the search every time. One goal is to modify screen shots from the recording phase using new images from the playback phase and correct the scenario (e.g., point at new coordinates for mouse clicks). After this processing, the playback images will have fewer differences (GUI noise) than they had with initial screen shots from the recording phase. This allows users to select stronger conditions for playback, resulting in better performance and improved testing quality.","For clarity of presentation, let's consider specific real examples of GUI noise during the recording phase.  is an example image illustrating a highlighted object in an image captured during the recording phase according to an embodiment of the present invention. The user clicked the \u201cNew\u201d item in the \u201cFile\u201d menu. Detailed behavior for a given activity could be the following (let's consider mouse activity, but the use of hot keys is also possible). The user moved the mouse from the \u201cFile\u201d menu header to the \u201cNew\u201d item and clicked on the \u201cNew\u201d item. Highlighting for selected item is visible on the captured recorded image. On the other hand, a screenshot which could be captured during the play back phase (as shown in ) will not show this highlighting because the CCF system task is searching for the corresponding item and the mouse will be situated at another position. This difference in images is a simple example of GUI noise after the recording phase.","The next example shows a more difficult GUI problem.  is an example image illustrating an active object according to an embodiment of the present invention.  presents an animated button which was pressed by mouse.  is an example image illustrating an inactive object according to an embodiment of the present invention.  shows the usual view of the button when it is not animated.","A similar noise situation is illustrated on .  is an example image illustrating a tool tip in a recorded image according to an embodiment of the present invention.  is an example image illustrating a tool tip in a playback image according to an embodiment of the present invention. The recorded image shows a tool tip for a currently selected object but the playback image shows a tool tip for a previously pressed button.","Sometimes GUI changes during product evolution may be considered as a GUI noise.  is an example image illustrating an index structure in a first version of a GUI according to an embodiment of the present invention.  is an example image illustrating another index structure in a second version of a GUI according to an embodiment of the present invention. For example,  shows an additional item \u201cQuick Copy & Move . . . \u201d in dialog and new icons for a new product version, but the old \u201csignificant\u201d item still exists there also. New objects could be considered in this situation as GUI noise in accordance with a previous recorded image as shown in . This situation could be considered as evolution of the product with requirements to adapt to the new changes.","In some situations there are more complex examples for GUI behavior and more significant differences between the recording phase and the playback phase screenshots. One possible way to solve these problems with a search of objects is to create a new complex algorithm, with a huge knowledge base. This is a very difficult task because the software marketplace continually produces new versions of application program having new controls and different GUI behavior. Embodiments of the present invention comprise a more effective way to solve this problem.","Usually, search conditions for the playback phase are rather strong, especially for scenarios and tests where one of the general aims is to check for a stable product state at the current time. In this situation, the recorded execution scenario couldn't be successfully run in noisy environment. It will encounter significant differences between the recorded and playback screenshots from the point of strong conditions. It's possible to set less strict limits for the search. However, this decreases the potential for verification of bugs and it has a very negative effect on using effectiveness of the present invention. If recorded screenshots correspond to the correct and the current images it allows conditions to be kept without changes. Thus, the general problem is how to obtain \u201cclear\u201d screenshots with the right data about activities for further use in CCF system processing.","Let us assume a stable application program or controlling the program's execution and the ability to indicate a valid run of the CCF system for it. The execution scenario could be recorded, \u201csofter\u201d conditions set for playback, and the execution scenario run again in a self registration mode with control for valid execution. This means that the system captures screenshots and tries to find objects with more adaptive rules for search. The CCF system then saves the screenshot and new information about objects (for example, new coordinates for mouse actions). The CCF system should be able to save additional information from the executed scenario for its integrity. In other words, a new execution scenario should have updates for information correlated to screenshots (it could include coordinates, areas, images and text content, updated dynamical information, etc). Finally, visual information may be obtained which has better correspondence with the real images during further playbacks. This allows the CCF system to return to \u201cstrict\u201d conditions to control application programs for bug verification and other tasks.","Methods for GUI noise reduction could be complex, but this complexity is less than the corresponding complexity for investigation and development of a search scheme in a GUI noise environment. Moreover, knowledge about an application program that is valid for execution could help to automate refreshing of the execution scenario through multiply runs in case of playback faults.","Embodiments of the present invention include methods which make effective refreshing of the execution scenarios. In other embodiments, additional methods may be used to improve GUI noise reduction that leads to easy portability and updates for scenarios between different operating systems and versions during product evolutions. An embodiment of the present invention includes a hierarchy of methods (e.g., algorithms, schemas, \u201cstrict\u201d conditions, etc.) as shown below.","1. At first, use \u201cstrict\u201d methods. The playback images typically don't have significant differences with the recording images, so it makes sense to use narrow bounds for each parameter, e.g., size of contours, text content, layout, etc.","2. Use stable to highlighting methods because this is the usual situation for GUI dialogs, menus, etc. The simplest change which could take place is highlighting, and a method which is stable may be used for handling highlighting.","3. Use environment information because this data usually has less noise than a searched active object. The simplest example of this is animation: an active object on the playback image (such as in ) is different from one on the recording image (such as in ); additional objects are similar.","4. Use text information because action changes could be only in the fonts used. A simple change which could take place is another text font and a method may be used which is stable for handling font changes.","5. Use additional delays during tests execution (but save old test runs) because this helps avoid trouble with early \u201csoft\u201d searching. An additional load on the operating system could affect execution time for the application program, so it's possible to use delays when capturing the screenshot and search objects during playback to promote obtaining a good result.","6. Use a complex search and the best hypothesis chosen through corresponding methods, e.g., \u201cfuzzy\u201d ones. Sometimes the application program could provide a different view on every run, so the user could provide his or her own complex methods to find active objects. For example, an iterative search procedure may be used.","7. Divide the execution scenario into modules because this helps refresh and tune the execution scenario over multiple runs. Some steps (row of steps) could be replayed with one type of search parameters and others with different search conditions; it's easier to split a task into sub-tasks and solve them individually.","8. Use \u201cas is\u201d play back scheme and\/or manual updating for screenshots and recorded information in very difficult situations. Manual correction for the scenario could help, and the playback may be processed with \u201cpoint-to-point\u201d conditions (e.g., manually select the same point with the mouse during playback as it took place during the recording phase).","In at least one embodiment of the present invention, at a first stage of processing, the recorded image and the execution scenario are obtained for every step of operation of the application program under test. Next, \u201csoft\u201d search conditions may be set. Soft search conditions include a first set of bounds for differences in shapes of contours, text and image content, layout, etc. Then, the execution may be played back automatically using the CCF system.  is an example image illustrating a recorded image according to an embodiment of the present invention. It is a result of a valid execution and soft conditions being applied. For every step of the operation of the application program, a new playback image may be generated. Soft search conditions allow the CCF system to attempt to find the right active object in spite of GUI noise. The recorded and newly generated playback images are saved again and the execution scenario may be modified with new coordinates for mouse (or other user input) activity. Typically, this is the only change done to update an execution scenario.  is an example image illustrating a playback image according to an embodiment of the present invention. In this example,  does not quite match .","At a second stage of processing, the search conditions may be set to \u201cstronger\u201d or \u201cstricter\u201d search conditions for applying the execution scenario to verify execution of the application program. Strict search conditions include a second set of bounds for differences in shapes of contours, text and image content, layout, etc. The first set of bounds of differences is different than the second set of bounds of differences. At this time, the recorded images are screenshots obtained from playback processing using \u201csoft\u201d search conditions as in . Thus,  is an example image illustrating another recorded image according to an embodiment of the present invention. This recorded image was copied from the previously generated playback image. For every step of the execution scenario, a new playback image may be generated during playback, such as is shown in . This playback image, in the case of the right workflow of the application program, is similar to the recorded image of . This processing allows the CCF system to better adapt to any inconsistencies in the application program.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0072"},"figref":"FIG. 21","b":["300","302","304","306","308"]},"An advantage of embodiments of the present invention is that it is applicable to any application program exposing a visual interface on any platform and operating system, and is not dependent on a specific API, or architecture of visual system implementation (like Win32 or X-Windows API), or specific operating system.

All other known systems are dependent to a small or large extent on system APIs while working with visual elements.
