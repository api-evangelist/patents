{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The invention relates to providing network-based services to users with high availability, and, in particular, to providing Microsoft\u00ae SharePoint\u2122 services.","Microsoft\u00ae SharePoint\u2122 may be a rich enterprise server application that provides full content management features, implement business processes, and\/or provide access to information related to organizational goals and\/or processes.","High availability may be a system design protocol that ensures a certain degree of operational continuity. Conventional configurations of Microsoft\u00ae SharePoint\u2122 may be challenged to meet high availability standards for a variety of reasons. For example, conventional configurations of servers providing redundancy involve a one-to-one standby server to online server set up that is costly in terms of hardware, bandwidth, and\/or other resources. As another example, a server farm configuration database for a server farm serving the server application distributed by Microsoft\u00ae SharePoint\u2122 may not be readily accessible to all of the servers in the farm. This may interfere with efficient switchover and\/or failover to standby server(s).","One aspect of the invention relates to a system and method providing a suite of network-based services, such as the services corresponding to the server application distributed by Microsoft\u00ae SharePoint\u2122, to users with high availability. The suite of network-based services may include browser-based collaboration functions, process management functions, index and search functions, document-management functions, help and help search functions, and\/or other functions. The system and method may enable a plurality of computing devices functioning as servers to serve the server application to users to be backed up by a single computing device, may centralize server farm administration through a website that communicates with servers serving the server application through application programming interfaces of the server application, and\/or provides other enhancements.","In some implementations, the system may include a first online server, a second online server, a third online server, a standby server, and\/or other components. The system may leverage one or more external information sources. Users may interface with the system and\/or the external information sources via client computing platforms. The first online server, the second online server, the third online server, and\/or the standby server may form a \u201cserver farm\u201d configured to provide the server application services of the server application. For example, the first online server, the second online server, the third online server, and\/or the standby server may host the network-based services over the network to the client computing platforms.","In order to provide the network-based services with high availability, the standby server may be configured as a back-up to the first online server that replaces the first online server, the second online server, and\/or the third online server in case of failover or switchover. For convenience, the term \u201cchangeover\u201d will be used herein to refer to switching services from one server to another for either of failover or switchover.","Each of the first online server, the second online server, the third online server, and the standby server may be configured to execute a server application module. The server application module may be configured to provide one or more server application services associated with a server application. As used herein, the term \u201cserver application\u201d may refer to one or more software elements that cause the processors of the servers to provide a suite of network-based services to users in a coordinated and cooperative manner.","The standby server may further be configured to execute computer program modules comprising one or more of a monitoring module, a classification module, a service configuration module, changeover module, and\/or other modules.","The monitoring module may be configured to obtain the set of server application services being executed by the first server. The set of server application services may be obtained through querying the first server (e.g., through application programming interfaces, through a farm configuration database, through an administrative website, and\/or via other mechanisms for obtaining information. The set of server application services may include a first service, a second service, and\/or other services.","The classification module may be configured to determine whether individual ones of the server application services being provided by the production server are a primary service or a secondary service. A primary service may include a service which, if configured and then left offline (even if there is another instance of the service online in the farm), may cause complication within the server farm. A secondary service may not be subject to such complications.","The service configuration module may be configured to configure the set of server application services being provided by the first server on the standby server for changeover. The service configuration module may be configured such that, responsive to a determination that the first service is a secondary service, the first service may be configured on the standby server without waiting for receipt of a command to change the set of server application services over to the standby server. Responsive to a determination that the first service is a primary service, configuration of the first service on the standby server may be delayed until receipt of a command to change the set of server application services over to the standby server.","The changeover module may be configured to change the set of server application services over from the first server to the standby server responsive to a changeover event. At a changeover event, the changeover module may be configured to remove the set of server application services from the first server in the farm configuration database. The changeover module may bring the previously configured secondary server applications services online for the standby server. The changeover module may trigger configuration of the primary server application services to the standby server, and then may bring the primary server application services online for the standby server.","These and other objects, features, and characteristics of the present invention, as well as the methods of operation and functions of the related elements of structure and the combination of parts and economies of manufacture, will become more apparent upon consideration of the following description and the appended claims with reference to the accompanying drawings, all of which form a part of this specification, wherein like reference numerals designate corresponding parts in the various figures. It is to be expressly understood, however, that the drawings are for the purpose of illustration and description only and are not intended as a definition of the limits of the invention. As used in the specification and in the claims, the singular form of \u201ca\u201d, \u201can\u201d, and \u201cthe\u201d include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","10","12","14","16","18"]},"The system  may leverage one or more external information sources . Users may interface with system  and\/or external information sources  via client computing platforms . The components of system , external information sources , and\/or client computing platforms  may be operatively linked via one or more electronic communication links. For example, such electronic communication links may be established, at least in part, via a network such as the Internet and\/or other networks. It will be appreciated that this is not intended to be limiting, and that the scope of this disclosure includes implementations in which system , external information sources , and\/or client computing platforms  are operatively linked via some other communication media.","A given client computing platform  may include one or more processors configured to execute computer program modules. The computer program modules may be configured to enable one or more users associated with the given client computing platform  to interface with system  and\/or external information sources , and\/or provide other functionality attributed herein to client computing platforms . By way of non-limiting example, the given client computing platform  may include one or more of a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a handheld computer, a NetBook, a Smartphone, and\/or other computing platforms.","The external information sources  may be configured to provide information to system . This information may include content, user information, information related to achievements or accomplishments of users, and\/or other information.","As is described further below, first online server , second online server , third online server , and\/or standby server  may cooperate to provide the network-based services of the server application to users of client computing platforms  via the network. As such, first online server , second online server , third online server , and\/or standby server  may form, at least in part, a \u201cserver farm\u201d configured to provide the server application services of the server application. For example, first online server , second online server , third online server , and\/or standby server  may host the network-based services over the network to client computing platforms . In order to provide the network-based services provided by first online server  with high availability, standby server  may be configured as a back-up to first online server  in case of failover or switchover. Failover may include situations in which a server (or one or more individual services hosted by a server) fails in an unexpected manner. Switchover may include situations in which the switch from first online server , second online server , and\/or third online server  to standby server  is performed intentionally. For example, switchover may be executed to perform maintenance, to test one or servers, and\/or for other purposes. For convenience, the term \u201cchangeover\u201d will be used herein to refer to switching services from one server to another for either of failover or switchover.","Although first online server , second online server , third online server , and standby server  are each illustrated as a single entity in , this is not intended to be limiting. For example, two or more of these servers may implemented in a single computing device, or each of these servers may be implemented in a separate computing device. If two or more of the servers , , , and\/or  are implemented in a single computing device, the processors and storage described herein as being associated with the different servers may actually be the same physical components.","The first online server  may include electronic storage , one or more processors , and\/or other components. Electronic storage  may comprise electronic storage media that electronically stores information. The electronic storage media of electronic storage  may include one or both of system storage that is provided integrally (i.e., substantially non-removable) with first online server  and\/or removable storage that is removably connectable to first online server  via, for example, a port (e.g., a USB port, a firewire port, etc.) or a drive (e.g., a disk drive, etc.). Electronic storage  may include one or more of optically readable storage media (e.g., optical disks, etc.), magnetically readable storage media (e.g., magnetic tape, magnetic hard drive, floppy drive, etc.), electrical charge-based storage media (e.g., EEPROM, RAM, etc.), solid-state storage media (e.g., flash drive, etc.), and\/or other electronically readable storage media. Electronic storage  may store software algorithms, information determined by processor , information received via the network, and\/or other information that enables first online server  to function properly. Electronic storage  may be a separate component within first online server , or electronic storage  may be provided integrally with one or more other components of first online server  (e.g., processor ).","Processor  may be configured to provide information processing capabilities in first online server . As such, processor  may include one or more of a digital processor, an analog processor, a digital circuit designed to process information, an analog circuit designed to process information, a state machine, and\/or other mechanisms for electronically processing information. Although processor  is shown in  as a single entity, this is for illustrative purposes only. In some implementations, processor  may include a plurality of processing units. These processing units may be physically located within the same device, or processor  may represent processing functionality of a plurality of devices operating in coordination.","As is shown in , processor  may be configured to execute one or more computer program modules. The one or more computer program modules may include a server application module , and\/or other modules. Processor  may be configured to execute module  by software; hardware; firmware; some combination of software, hardware, and\/or firmware; and\/or other mechanisms for configuring processing capabilities on processor . The description of the functionality provided by modules  described below is for illustrative purposes, and is not intended to be limiting, as module  may provide more or less functionality than is described.","The server application module  may be configured to provide one or more server application services associated with a server application. As used herein, the term \u201cserver application\u201d may refer to one or more software elements that cause processor  to provide a suite of network-based services to users in a coordinated and cooperative manner with first online server , second online server , third online server , and\/or standby server . For example, the server application may include the collection of software elements available from Microsoft\u00ae SharePoint\u2122. The server application module  may be configured such that the server application provides application programming interfaces through which server application module  communicates with other computer program modules that are not an integral part of server application module .","In cooperating with second online server , third online server , and\/or standby server  to provide the server application services to users, the server application module  may provide one or more of the server application services. Server application services provided by server application module  may be provided solely by server application module , or one or more individual server application services may be provided jointly by server application module  with one or more of second online server , third online server , and\/or standby server . The server application services may include one or more of a web front-end service, a database service, a web-app server service, an indexing service, a query service, a spreadsheet calculation service, a help search service, a farm configuration database service, and\/or other sub-modules.","The web front-end service may be configured to perform the functionality of a front-end web server in serving content over the network via a network communication protocol (e.g., HTTP and\/or other protocols). The content may include webpages to be served to users (e.g., via client computing platforms ). A webpage may include a document or resource that is accessible via a browser. These documents may be formatted in a mark-up format (e.g., HTML, XHTML, XML, and\/or other mark-up formats). Serving the content may include receiving requests for content, receiving instructions for altering or calling content, and\/or receiving other requests or instructions from client computing platform(s) , and then responding by providing the requested content (or locations of the requested content) to the requesting client computing platform(s) .","The database service may be configured to provide database services to users of client computing platforms  via the network. This may include processing database commands, queries, content, and\/or other information related to a database, performing the requested actions and\/or obtaining the requested information, and providing the results to the requesting client computing platform(s) .","The web-app server service may be configured to provide web application server functionality to client computing platforms . This may include executing a plurality of different information processing tasks at the request of client computing platforms , and then returning the results to client computing platforms .","The indexing service may be configured to provide an indexing service to the server application. As such, the indexing service may index information served by first online server , second online server , third online server , and\/or standby server , metadata related to information served by first online server , second online server , third online server , and\/or standby server , and\/or other information. The indexing service may crawl content, logs, and\/or other information sources associated with first online server , second online server , third online server , standby server , and\/or other information and create an index in an ongoing manner. This index may be referenced to respond to queries and\/or searches by users, administrators, and\/or for other purposes.","The query service may be configured to provide a query service to the server application. As such, the query service can receive index information sent from all index services which may be deployed on any online servers and standby server. The query service responds the requests from online web front-end servers after processing the received index information.","The spreadsheet calculation service may be configured to enable farm users to load, calculate and display Excel workbooks by using web browsers. This service may be configured on all online servers and backup server for server application. All workbooks processed by this service are stored as farm content.","The help search service may be configured to handle the search tasks for SharePoint Help system. This service may be configured on online servers and backup server. The service replies on only indexes of SharePoint help content.","The farm configuration database service may be configured to maintain a farm configuration database related to the configuration of the first online server , second online server , third online server , and\/or standby server  in executing the server application. The farm configuration database may include information related to current services being provided by the different servers, information related to jobs being performed by the servers in the server farm, information related to backup roles of the servers, information related to distribution of user contents, the information related to service status in the server farm, and\/or other information.","The second online server  may include electronic storage , one or more processors , and\/or other components. Electronic storage  may comprise electronic storage media that electronically stores information. The electronic storage media of electronic storage  may include one or both of system storage that is provided integrally (i.e., substantially non-removable) with second online server  and\/or removable storage that is removably connectable to second online server  via, for example, a port (e.g., a USB port, a firewire port, etc.) or a drive (e.g., a disk drive, etc.).

The description of the functionality provided by the different modules  and\/or  described below is for illustrative purposes, and is not intended to be limiting, as any of modules  and\/or  may provide more or less functionality than is described. For example, one of modules  and\/or  may be eliminated, and\/or some or all of its functionality may be provided by other ones of modules  and\/or . As another example, processor  may be configured to execute one or more additional modules that may perform some or all of the functionality attributed below to one of modules  and\/or .","The server application module  may be substantially the same as server application modules  and\/or , and may be configured to provide one or more of the server application services associated with the server application in coordination with modules  and\/or .","The administration website module  may be configured to host a website configured to provide information to and receive information from first online server , second online server , third online server , and\/or standby server . The website may communicate with first online server , second online server , third online server , and\/or standby server  via application programming interfaces of the server application. The information provided to and received from first online server , second online server , third online server , and\/or standby server  by the website may enable configuration of server roles and\/or permit farm level application settings to be accessed, set, and\/or adjusted by and\/or for any of the servers in the farm (e.g., first online server , second online server , third online server , and\/or standby server ). At least some of these functions are discussed further below.","The standby server  may generally be configured to backup first online server . The second online server  and\/or third online server  may be backed up by other standby servers (not shown). The standby server  may include electronic storage , one or more processors , and\/or other components. Electronic storage  may comprise electronic storage media that electronically stores information.

Further, in some implementations, some or all of the functionality of modules , , , , and\/or  described below may be performed by another server.","The server application module  may be substantially the same as server application modules , , and\/or . As such, server application module  may be configured to function as a backup for first online server  for the server application services provided by server application module . Backing up first online server  may include being configured to handle switchover and\/or failover of sets of one or more server application services being currently provided by individual ones of first online server .","For some server applications, such as the server application distributed by Microsoft\u00ae SharePoint\u2122, individual server application services may be provided by a plurality of servers (e.g., the web front-end service may be provided by a plurality of servers to facilitate load-balancing), and\/or individual server application services may be provided by a single server in the farm (e.g., the indexing service may typically be provided by a single server). Similarly, an individual server may be dedicated to providing a single server application service (alone or in conjunction with other server(s)), or an individual server may be used to provide a plurality of server application services.","In some implementations, first online server , second online server , third online server , and standby server  may be separate computing devices. The first online server  may be executing server application module  to provide a first set of server application services to users. The first set of server application services may include a first service, a second service, and\/or other services. The standby server  may be configured to backup the first set of server application services.","The monitoring module  may be configured to obtain a set of server application services being provided by first online server  via server application module . This information may be obtained from the website administered by administration website module , from the farm configuration database maintained by the configuration database service, from first online server  (e.g., via an application programming interface associated with server application module ), and\/or from other information sources. The set of server application services may include a first service, a second service, and\/or other services.","The classification module  may be configured to determine whether individual ones of the server application services being provided by server application module  are a primary service or a secondary service. A primary service may be a service which, if left inactive in the server farm, causes complications that may inhibit operation of other services. Primary services may perform tasks required for internal collaboration with other services. Take the query service as an example. In order to maintain consistent content among the servers, all servers participating in performing the query service must be online to receive index files from the index service. The help search service also may restrict farm wide WSS DB backup operations so that if all help search services are not online, a backup tool provided by the server application (e.g., the \u201cstsadm\u201d tool provided by SharePoint) and\/or 3rd party tools may hang up when executing a task. Secondary services, on the other hand, may include server application services which may have servers that are offline. These may include, for example, web front-end service, an index service, a spreadsheet calculation service, based on current SharePoint architecture, we don't have to add any more, and\/or other services. The classification module  may determined the classifications of the services based on a look-up table, from an identifier associated with the services, and\/or via other mechanisms.","The service configuration module  may be configured to configured to configure the server application services (e.g., the first, second, and\/or third services) to server application module . In conventional systems, this may include configuring all the server applications on server application module  in anticipation of a changeover from server application module  to server application module , and then keeping the backed up server application services offline until they are needed. However, in some server applications, such as the server application provided by Microsoft SharePoint\u2122, performing such activities with respect to primary services may cause failure, and\/or other complications, for the server application. In system , for primary server application services, standby configuration module  may delay configuring until a changeover to server application module  has actually been initiated. While this may increase the amount of time that the primary server application services are offline during the changeover, it may avoid the issues caused by taking the primary server application services offline to configure them on server application module  without changing them over to server application module . This is because if a changeover has not been initiated, the server farm (e.g., including first online server , second online server , and\/or third online server ) may expect the primary server application services to be online. Whereas, if a changeover has been initiated, the server farm does not expect the primary server application services to be online (e.g., because the previous servers are no longer indicated as providing the services in the farm configuration database for the reasons discussed below).","By way of example, responsive to the first service of the set of server application services provided by server application module  being a secondary server application service, service configuration module  may be configured to configure server application module  to back up server application module  with respect to the first service without waiting for initiation of a changeover from first online server  to standby server . As another example, responsive to the second service of the second set of server application services being a primary server application services, service configuration module  may be configured to delay configuring server application module  to back up server application module  with respect to the second service until a changeover from first online server  to standby server  has been initiated.","The changeover module  may be configured to change server application services from server application module  over to server application module  responsive to a changeover event (e.g., a failover or switchover event). For a given server application service, this may include removing the given server application service from server application module  in the farm configuration database. This may be performed by directly interfacing the farm database service (e.g., via an application program interface), through the administrative website maintained through administrative website module , and\/or via other mechanisms. The changeover module  may then enter the given server application service for server application module  in the farm configuration database. The changeover module  may be configured to only enter the given server application service for server application module  in the farm configuration database responsive to the given server application service being configured by service configuration module  on standby server .","Responsive to the given server application service being a primary service, changeover module  may be configured to trigger configuration of the given server application service to server application module  by service configuration module . This may occur after changeover module  has removed the given server application service the farm configuration database. Thus, as the given server application service is being configured to server application module , the given server application service may not be shown as online or offline in the farm configuration database. Responsive to configuration of the given server application service on server application module  being completed, changeover module  may enter the given server application service for server application module  in the farm configuration database, bringing the given server application service online for the server farm.","Responsive to the given server application service being a secondary service, changeover module  may be configured, at changeover, to remove the given server application service for server application module  from the farm configuration database. Then changeover module  may then bring the given server application service, which would have already been configured and taken offline by service configuration module , online.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["80","80","80","80"]},"In some embodiments, method  may be implemented in one or more processing devices (e.g., a digital processor, an analog processor, a digital circuit designed to process information, an analog circuit designed to process information, a state machine, and\/or other mechanisms for electronically processing information).

The set of server application services may include a first service. In some implementations, operation  may be performed by a monitoring module similar to or the same as monitoring module  (as shown in  and described above).","At an operation , a determination may be made as to whether the first service is a primary service or a secondary service. A primary service may include a server application service that is relied upon by other server application services such that the server application service being offline may cause failure and\/or other complications for the server application. In some implementations, operation  may be performed by a classification module similar to or the same as classification module  (as shown in  and described above).","Responsive to a determination at operation  that the first service is a secondary service, the first service may be configured on the standby server in anticipation of a changeover at an operation . This may include configuring the first service on the standby server without waiting for initiation of a changeover to the standby server. In some implementations, operation  may be performed by a service configuration module similar to or the same as service configuration module  (as shown in  and described above).","Responsive to a determination at operation  that the first service is a primary service, configuration of the first service on the standby server may be delayed at an operation  until initiation of changeover of the first service to the standby server. While this may require a longer delay during the changeover, it will prevent, or inhibit, operation of the server application being negatively impacted by an offline instance of the first service. In some implementations, operation  may be performed by a service configuration module similar to or the same as service configuration module  (as shown in  and described above).","At an operation , changeover to the standby server may be accomplished. This may include bringing secondary server application services that have previously been configured (e.g. at operation ). Operation , for primary server application services, may include removing the primary server application services from the server being brought offline, triggering configuration of the primary server application services on the on the standby server, and\/or bringing the primary server application services online on the standby server. In some implementations, operation  may be performed by a changeover module similar to or the same as changeover module  (shown in  and described above).","This hybrid approach for configuring primary and secondary server application services on the standby server may enhance operation of the server application with respect to conventional and\/or unified approaches. The anticipatory configuration of secondary server application services reduces down time of the server application and\/or the server application services during changeover, while the delay of configuring the primary server application services enhances server application operation in advance of any changeover.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["92","92","92","92"]},"In some embodiments, method  may be implemented in one or more processing devices (e.g., a digital processor, an analog processor, a digital circuit designed to process information, an analog circuit designed to process information, a state machine, and\/or other mechanisms for electronically processing information).

If the online server currently serving the server application service is performing method  (e.g., if it is the \u201clocal\u201d server), operation  may include issuing an unprovision instruction to the online server that removes the online server from currently serving the server application service. If the online server currently serving the server application service is not the local server, operation  may include generating instructions for transmission to the server farm configuration database (e.g., through the website via an application programming interface of the server application) to remove the online server from serving the server application service. The instructions may further include instructions to the server farm configuration database removing the job by which the online server is removed from serving the server application service.
