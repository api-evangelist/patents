No. 7,099,885 entitled \u201cMethod and System for Collaborative Ontology Modeling.\u201d","The present invention relates to enterprise information unification and collaborative enterprise data modeling.","One of the difficult challenges faced by enterprise information technology is that of managing diversity. Data sources for large enterprises can be substantially different from one another, and are often comprehensible only by special purpose application programs. Sales data, accounting data, inventory data, purchasing data, human resources data\u2014all of these data sources inter-relate to some extent, but cross-data processing requires much manual effort and development of special purpose adaptors to bridge each pair of data sources.","Moreover diverse data sources typically use diverse data structures, including for example COBOL record systems, relational database systems, XML document systems, and in many cases custom proprietary data schema.","Making the challenge of managing diversity even more difficult, individual data sources typically have their own lexicon for business entities. For example, purchasing data may be keyed on an enterprise's SKU classification, sales data may be keyed on model numbers, and payroll data may be keyed on social security and income tax based systems. For an accounting program to determine profit based on sales revenue vs. cost of goods and cost of labor, it is necessary to bridge the three lexicons.","The older the enterprise, and the larger the enterprise, the more diversity likely exists among its data sources. How does such diversity arise? Some of it arises by legacy\u2014electronic data processing systems have been around for well over fifty years, and as computer technology advances new systems supplant older ones. Some of it arises by growth, through mergers and acquisitions. Some of it arises by use of proprietary data processing systems, perhaps for reasons of security or customization.","There is thus a pressing need for enterprise information integration solutions.","A general reference on database systems is Garcia-Molina, H., Ullman, J. D. and Widom, J., \u201cDatabase Systems: The Complete Book,\u201d Prentice-Hall, Upper Saddle River, N.J., 2002.","Another challenge that arises in modeling enterprise data is collaboration. In the past, development of a data schema such as a relational database schema or an XML schema was generally performed by a single person. Today, with enterprise data models becoming ever more complex and with networked computer architectures prevalent, effective collaborative data modeling is a challenge. Among the problems to be overcome, evolution and versioning are prominent.","A recent development in collaborative data modeling is the recent Semantic Web initiative for semantic management of data. The Semantic Web represents a new trend\u2014managing information, rather than managing data. A general reference on the Semantic Web is Noy, N. F. and Klein, M., \u201cOntology Evolution: Not the Same as Schema evolution,\u201d available on the Internet at http:\/\/smi-web.stanford.edu\/pubs\/SMI_Abstracts\/SMI-2002-0926.html.","The present invention provides a method and system for enterprise unification, which overcomes the problems of diversity among data sources. Using the present invention, a central information model with a single business-oriented data structure and a single business-oriented lexicon is generated; and the diverse data structures, referred to as physical data assets, for the diverse enterprise data sources, are mapped into the central model\u2014a processed referred to as rationalization. Enterprise information is thus unified\u2014not by moving or transforming all of the physical data assets into a single data source, but rather by keeping the physical data assets intact and mapping them into the central model.","As such, the present invention serves as a unified data thesaurus, translating diverse schema and data lexicons into a common data model and lexicon, respectively. This feature of the present invention enables enterprises to visualize the totality of their data sources, thereby understanding \u201cwhat's out there.\u201d Using the present invention, enterprises can identify data overlap, data inconsistency and missing data, and perform effective data cleansing.","In addition to unifying diverse data sources, the present invention enables enterprises to perform cross-data processing tasks by translating data processing instructions from the common lexicon of the central information model to data processing instructions for each of the diverse physical data asset lexicons. For example, an enterprise can use the present invention to generate queries for its physical data sources from a central query about the central information model. Integration across the diverse physical data assets is thus made transparent\u2014as if all of the enterprise data actually resided in a single data source conforming to the central information model.","The present invention provides a unified navigator for interactively viewing a multiplicity of business concepts, including the central information model, the physical data assets, mappings, queries and transformations relating to the physical data assets, and instances of the information model and the physical data assets.","The present invention includes a distributed method and system, whereby many users can collaborate on modeling enterprise data via the central information model and the mappings of the physical data assets thereto. The present invention controls concurrency among users by enforcing a locking mechanism, whereby a user must obtain a lock on a portion of the central model in order to modify it, and other users cannot obtain such lock until the user having the lock releases the lock.","There is thus provided in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention an enterprise information unification system including an information modeler for modeling business entities and their properties as an information model, the information model being comprised of business constructs, a data rationalizer for generating mappings from physical data assets to the information model, the physical data assets being comprised of data asset constructs, and a data thesaurus for automating tasks of

PRESENT INVENTION\u2014this phrase means at least one exemplary embodiment which is described herein and does not mean that any of the claims are to be limited to that particular embodiment.","The present invention concerns collaborative modeling of enterprise data and semantics therefor, and enterprise data unification. The present invention provides a method and system for generating a central information model that serves as a global central schema for an enterprise's business entities and their properties. The central information model is based on a central lexicon that crosses many diverse business units, such as sales, purchasing, manufacturing and accounting.","Schemas for physical data sources of the enterprise are rationalized within the central information model by mapping them into the central model. Such mappings identify constructs of the central model that correspond to constructs of the mapped schemas. Such mappings are used for translating between lexicons of the physical data assets and the lexicon of the central information model, and for providing thesaurus services.","The present invention uses the central information model and the mappings to provide a unified navigator for interactively viewing a multiplicity of business concepts, including the central information model and its constructs, the physical data assets and their constructs, mappings, queries and transformations relating to the physical data assets, and instances of the central information model and the physical data assets.","The present invention enables automation of data processing tasks across the physical data sources by translating instructions phrased in the central lexicon into equivalent instructions paraphrased in the lexicons of the physical data assets. When an enterprise application executes the translated instructions transparently, it appears to the user as if all of the enterprise data is located in a single central data source conforming to the central information model. Using the present invention, tasks such as data query, data migration, data transformation, data cleansing and data location, across multiple inter-related data sources, are performed through the single central information model and its lexicon.","The present invention also provides a method and system for collaborative generation of the central information model, over a distributed computing environment. Through use of version control and locking mechanisms, the present invention enables multiple users to work concurrently on the central model.","The present invention includes two general client-side architectures for collaboration. The first architecture, referred to as a \u201cthin client\u201d is designed for remote users to work directly on the central information model residing on a server computer. The thin client preferably operates through a standard web browser on a \u201cclient\u201d computer system, and most of the application logic is performed on the server computer system. The second architecture, referred to as a \u201cthick client\u201d is designed for remote users to work on their own local copies of the central information model. The thick client performs most of the application logic. A computer system is generally any system (e.g. general purpose desktop computer, or handheld computer or PDA (personal digital assistant) or cell phone (e.g. web enabled cell phone)) which includes a processor and memory which store software instructions which can be executed by the processor. In the case of a client system, a computer system may include a \u201cdumb\u201d terminal which can display data and receive user input. See U.S. Pat. No. 6,222,549 for examples of computer systems and networks. It will be appreciated that the information models and mappings and other data structures or instructions may be stored in physical memory (e.g. RAM or non-volatile storage) in such computer systems.","The present invention enables an enterprise to know where its data is, understand what its data means, and unify its data sources into a coherent asset. Reference is now made to , which is a high-level logical architecture diagram of an enterprise information unification system, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. As shown at the top of , enterprise information unification preferably involves three types of activities. The first activity is data modeling; i.e., development of an information model for enterprise data encompassing the enterprise business entities and their properties. The second activity is data management; i.e., management of enterprise data, similar to database administration. The third activity is data deployment; i.e., using the enterprise data for analysis and forecasting.","The diagram in  includes the following seven main components: a user interface , a metadata interface , a data semantics module , a metadata module , a data management module , a thesaurus module , a run-time interface  and a platform . User interface  is preferably used to provide thick and thin web clients with role-based views specialized to integration engineers, database administrators, application developers, data managers and business users. User interface  preferably enables publication of the central information model and the overall enterprise information as linked HTML documents.","Metadata interface  serves as an interface for importing schemas and metadata of physical data assets, and for keeping the metadata inside the EIU environment synchronized with the physical data assets are changes occur over time. Preferably, metadata interface  also functions to import and reuse existing data models that are incorporated into the central information model.","Data semantics module  preferably includes a central information model for the enterprise, and semantic mappings that map physical data assets into the central information model. It may be appreciated by those skilled in the art that use of semantic mappings from physical data assets into the central information model obviates the need to maintain point-to-point mappings between each pair of physical data assets. New and changed data sources need only be mapped once to the central information model. Data semantics module  enables the enterprise to make its data unambiguous with explicit semantics. Data semantics module  serves to capture the precise and agreed-upon meaning of data in business terms, referred to as rationalization.","Metadata module  preferably stores data about the physical data assets, and enables the enterprise to centrally catalog its data assets and message formats.","Data management module  preferably includes sub-modules for authoring and editing, for data discovery, for data administration, for reports and statistics, for testing and simulation and for impact analysis, as described hereinbelow. Thesaurus module  preferably includes sub-modules for query generation, transformation generation, schema generation and data cleansing scripts. Schema generation refers to generation of a schema from an information model. Data cleansing refers to various operations designed to eliminate inconsistencies between overlapping data sources, decommission outdated data sources, and eliminate data redundancies and unwanted data. As such, thesaurus module  is preferably used to automate development of data translation scripts, queries, data cleansing scripts and schemas. Together, data management module  and thesaurus module  enable the enterprise to:\n\n","Platform  preferably includes the infrastructure necessary for versioning, collaboration, security and configuration. Platform  enables multiple users to use the present invention collaboratively within a secure environment, with access and version control.","Reference is now made to , which is a high-level diagram of an enterprise information technology (IT) architecture, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Within enterprise information technology there are typically many diverse schemas for storing and transmitting data. Storage of schemas is indicated at the bottom of , and transmission of schemas is indicated in the middle of .","Using the present invention, formal semantics can be captured for each schema by mapping to a central information model. Enterprise data is often transformed. Using the present invention, data transformations, as indicated by arrows in , can be inferred based on understanding of the semantics, and such transformations can be maintained accurately and automatically.","It is noted that  is divided into information and operational modules, a user interface, and business-to-business applications.","Shown in  is an enterprise information unification system  including modules for data semantics, metadata, data management and thesaurus services as in . Scripts auto-generated by enterprise unification system  are preferably deployed by relational database management systems (RDMS), enterprise application integration (EAI) systems, and extract, transform and load (ETL) systems for use at run-time.","A central information model  within enterprise information unification system  preferably provides semantics for messages, and enables the various enterprise databases and message formats to interoperate. For example, central information model  is used to generate and maintain translation scripts necessary for business-to-business messages  within a supply chain application, SOAP messages , and messages  within an enterprise application integration system, to interoperate.","Central information model  preferably also provides semantics for data stores, including flat files , legacy data  and relational databases  within the enterprise. Central information model  as also preferably used by a data warehouse .","It may thus be appreciated from  that the present invention:\n\n","Reference is now made to , which is a simplified block diagram of an enterprise information unification system  in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Shown in  is a business modeler , used by an enterprise for generating an information model that encapsulates the enterprise's business entities and their properties. Preferably, the information model generated by business modeler  is akin to a schema in that it does not include actual business data, but rather serves as a template or skeleton to govern a data structure.","In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the information model generated by business modeler  is an ontology model, whose constructs include classes, properties, inheritance relationships and business rules, as described in detail hereinbelow.","Business modeler  includes a test instance generator , for generating instances of the information model. As pointed out hereinabove, the information model is akin to a schema, and the test instances are likewise akin to actual data that is structured accordingly. Preferably test instance generator  populates data that can be used to simulate actual enterprise data, as described in detail hereinbelow.","Business modeler  also includes a model validator , for validating an information model. Preferably model validator  checks test instance data for correctness and consistency vis a vis constraints of the information model including inter alia data typing and business rules, as described in detail hereinbelow.","Also shown in  is a data rationalizer , used by an enterprise for generating mappings from physical data assets into the information model. Physical data assets are preferably schema for data sources, and may include inter alia relational database schema, XML schema and COBOL copy books. The mappings generated by data rationalizer  associate to constructs of the physical data assets corresponding constructs within the information model, as described in detail hereinbelow.","As indicated in  by a dashed arrow, the physical data assets may optionally be used as inputs to business modeler , thus ensuring that the generated information model includes constructs corresponding to the constructs within the external data assets. In this way the information model may be \u201creverse engineered;\u201d i.e., inferred from the structures of the physical data assets.","Also shown in  is a data thesaurus , used by an enterprise for automating tasks of data management. Preferably data thesaurus  uses the mappings generated by data rationalizer  to translate business instructions for the information model into corresponding data processing instructions for the physical data assets.","Data thesaurus is preferably used inter alia for translating messages between applications or between enterprises, for comparing databases for consistency, and for migrating data between versions of a database.","Data thesaurus  includes a transformation generator , for generating transformations used to carry out various data processing tasks. Preferably, transformation generator  generates queries and\/or transformations for the physical data assets, including inter alia SQL and Xquery queries, and XSLT transformations. Such queries and\/or transformations may be used, for example, to transform data among physical data assets or to populate physical data assets with data, as described in detail hereinbelow.","Data thesaurus  also includes a data locator , for locating sources of data among physical data assets related to prescribed constructs in the information model. Preferably, data locator  identifies constructs of physical data assets that hold information in one form or another about the prescribed constructs, as described in detail hereinbelow.","Data thesaurus  also includes a query processor , for converting queries for the information model into corresponding queries for one or more physical data assets. For example, query processor  may convert a query for the information model into an SQL query for a relational database and an Xquery for an XML database, as described in detail hereinbelow.","In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, results of data thesaurus , including inter alia queries and\/or transformations generated by transformation generator , are passed to one or more enterprise applications  for execution. Specifically, an SQL query is preferably embedded within in an enterprise application or used in extract, transform and load (ETL), to transform data when loading a data warehouse. Alternatively, an SQL query is executed directly on a relational database management system for migrating, moving or comparing data. When the SQL query crosses multiple databases, it is preferably run on a query engine, or a virtual warehouse referred to as enterprise information integration (EII). In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, XSLT is used, instead of SQL, with a transformation engine or for enterprise application integration (EAI).","Business Modeler ","Business modeler  is used to generate an information model incorporating business entities and their properties. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the information model is an ontology model.","Briefly, an ontology model provides a way to model things that exist. Basic constructs of an ontology model are classes, properties thereof, inheritance and business rules. Classes are sets, the elements of which are referred to as instances of the class. For example, a class People is a set of instances that represent specific people. A property, p, of a class is a function p: C\u2192D from a class C, referred to as the source of p, to a class D, referred to as the target of p. The classes C and D may be the same class or different classes. When it is important to distinguish between properties defined on different classes, the longer notation C.p is also used to denote a property, p, defined on C. For example, a property People.age is used to designate a person's age.","Properties may be composed, so that if p: C\u2192D and q: D\u2192E, then the composition q\u2218p: C\u2192E has source C and target E. The composition is also denoted by the longer notation C.p.q.","A class C is said to be a subclass of D if CD, in which case D is also said to be a superclass of C. In this case, every instance of C is also an instance of D, and properties defined on D are also defined on C by inheritance. For example, a class named Passengers may be a subclass of a class named People. A property such as firstName, defined on People is inherited by Passengers.","A special class named Being is defined in an ontology model as a universal class that contains all classes as subclasses thereof. Properties defined on Being are thus inherited by all classes in the ontology model.","Certain properties, referred to as \u201crepresentations,\u201d take on concrete fundamental alphanumeric values. The significance of representations is that they are properties one can reason about using arithmetic, logical and string operators, since their type corresponds to the types of mathematical expressions and programming language expressions.","In order to accommodate and provide values for representations, a special class Values is preferably created, so as to include all possible fundamental values a property may have. In addition, a special class Formats is also created, to include formats in which instances of Values can be expressed. Formats include inter alia conventional integer formats, real number formats, character string formats and date and time formats. A function representation: Values\u00d7Formats\u2192Alphanumerics, converts a value into an alphanumeric string according to a specific format. For example, if lastName: People\u2192Values, then representation(person.lastName, title Case)=\u201cSmith\u201d (a character string), for an instance, person, of People corresponding to John Smith. Observe that lastName is a representation, and titleCase is a format.","Alternatively, various formats can be modeled as properties on the class Values, or subclasses thereof. With respect to this alternative model design choice, the last name of John Smith represented as a character string in title case is denoted person.lastName.titleCase. Observe that lastName and titleCase are both representations in this alternative model.","Properties can be constrained to be unique; i.e., one-to-one. Unique properties can be used as identifiers for class instances.","Properties of an ontology class may be inter-related, and such relationships can be modeled using business rules. Business rules may specify inter alia that one property is an inverse of another, or that one property can be expressed in terms of other properties using a look-up table, formula or algorithm.","General ontology models can be represented by XML documents conforming to an XML schema for ontologies.

Local project builders  preferably operate on local copies of the central project, and include local instruction generators  for generating instructions for modifying the central project. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, local project builders  maintain a history of modification instructions, which may be forwarded to central project editor  for implementation. Maintaining a history of modification instructions is similar to operation of word processors, which enable a user to undo previous modifications while processing a document.","Local project builders  also include local lock processors  for requesting and releasing locks on packages of the central project.

For example, classes, properties, inheritance relationships and business rules are related. Modifying a class may impact inter alia (i) properties having the class as source or target, and (ii) inheritance relationships for which such class is a subclass or superclass. Modifying a property may impact inter alia (i) business rules in which such property participates, and (ii) properties that are inherited from such property. Moreover modifying constructs of a business model may impact inter alia mappings of external assets into the business model. Similarly, modifying mappings of physical data assets into the information model may impact inter alia transformations and queries that were generated based on such mappings.","In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, when a local project builder  requests a lock from central lock manager  on designated constructs of the information model, central lock manager  provides a lock on one or more packages of the central project that include the designated constructs as well as other constructs potentially impacted by modifications to the designated constructs. For example, when a local project builder  requests a lock on a designated property of the information model, central lock manager  may provide a lock on a package of the central project that includes (i) the designated property, (ii) the source class of the designated property, (iii) mappings that map constructs of physical data assets to the designated property, and (iv) business rules in which the designated property participates.

A thick client architecture is a client-side architecture in which a client computer performs most of the required application logic. Thick client architectures are generally characterized by large sizes of client-side software such as dynamic link libraries (DLLs). A thin client architecture is a server-side architecture in which a client computer performs little of the required application logic, most of which is performed by a server computer.

Action B corresponds to the client checking out a package of the central project and modifying its local copy of the package. Action C corresponds to the client checking-in its local modified package of the central project.","At step  the client downloads the central project from the server. Alternatively, client  may navigate the central project residing at the server computer instead of downloading the project. At step  the client requests check-out of package X of the project, in order to modify constructs of the project within package X. At step  the server receives the check-out request and at step  the server determines whether or not package X of the central project is already locked. If so, then at step  the server denies the check-out request and returns to step  to process additional check-out requests. In the meantime, the client again requests check-out of package X at step , at a later time.","If it is determined at step  that package X of the project is unlocked, then at step  the server grants a lock on package X to the client. At step  the server sends the latest version of package X to the client, and returns to step  to process additional check-out requests. It is noted that although the client may have downloaded the project at step , nevertheless the server sends package X to the client at step  since it may have been changed in the interim, between steps  and . At step  the client receives the latest version of package X. At step  the client modifies package X of the project by adding, deleting and changing constructs of the project included within package X.","At step  the client requests check-in of package X, in order to commit the changes to the central project, and sends the modified package X to the server. At step  the server receives the modified package X and at step  the server merges the package portion X with the latest version of the central project. The merge operation is described in detail hereinbelow. At step  the server releases the lock on package X. At step  the server uses the merged project as its latest version, and returns to step  to process additional check-ins.","It may be appreciated by those skilled in the art that although steps  (),  ( () indicate the client requesting check-out of package X of the central project, or a lock on package X of the central project, the client may instead request check-out or lock of specific constructs of the central project, in which case the server determines the appropriate package(s) of the project for check-out or locking. Thus it may be appreciated that it is not necessary for the client to know the manner in which the central project is divided up into packages.","Merging an Updated Package into a Project","The systems illustrated in ,  and  include a project merger, which merges an updated package X of a project with the rest of the project. As mentioned hereinabove, constructs of a project are divided into packages. For an information model that is an ontology model, such constructs include inter alia classes, properties, inheritance relationships, business rules, mappings of physical data assets into the ontology model, queries and transformations.","These constructs are inter-related. Thus a class is related to its properties. A property is related to its source and target classes. An inheritance relationship is related to the subclass and the superclass. A business rule relating properties of the ontology model is related to those properties included therein. A mapping of a physical data asset into the ontology is related to the classes and properties into which constructs of the physical data asset are mapped. Transformations and queries are related to the mappings of the physical data assets into the ontology model.","Thus when a modified package of the project is merged with the rest of the project, typically modifications made to the package impact constructs included within other packages of the project. And this can result in inconsistencies. Preferably, to handle such inconsistencies, the present invention includes data structures to represent (i) constructs which belong to other constructs, and (ii) constructs that lack referential integrity, as described in what follows.","In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a construct X \u201cbelongs to\u201d a construct Y if Y cannot exist without X. Specifically, regarding an information model which is an ontology model, for a given class C of an ontology, the following constructs all belong to C:","1. properties having class C as source class;","2. inheritance relationships having class C as the subclass;","3. business rules relating properties of class C; and","4. test instances of class C.","Similarly, for a given physical data asset A, the mapping of A into the information model belongs to A. Similarly, for a given mapping M of constructs of a physical data asset into a class C, the mappings of constructs of the physical data assets into properties of class C belong to M.","In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, organization of a project into packages is managed so that whenever a construct X belongs to a specific package, all constructs that belong to X also belong to the same package. Moreover, when a construct X is deleted from a project, constructs belonging to X are also deleted therefrom. This assures that a project does not contain a construct Y belonging to a construct X, when construct X no longer exists.","In addition, when a construct X is copied from one project to another, the constructs belonging to X are copied along therewith.","A construct X lacks \u201creferential integrity\u201d if the construct has not been deleted, but has a dangling reference associated therewith. Examples of constructs that lack referential integrity include:\n\n","In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, each construct of a project is assigned a unique ID. Use of a unique ID enables an internal data structure for the project to identify:\n\n","As described in applicant's co-pending application U.S. Ser. No. 10\/104,785, filed on Mar. 22, 2002, entitled \u201cRun-Time Architecture for Enterprise Integration with Transformation Generation,\u201d determination of which constructs of a project are in the orange state is based on impact analysis. Impact analysis recursively identifies constructs of the project that are impacted by a change made to a given construct.","Regarding the merge operation, the present invention preferably performs a merge by generating a merged project. The merged project is generated by copying constructs from the user's local updated package X and from the other packages of the central project. Copied constructs preferably retain their unique ID, thus making it possible to preserve references from one construct to another in the merged project. For example, if class C is the target of property P in the user's local updated package X, then this dependency is preserved within the merged project. Because the packages preferably comply with the restriction that for each construct that they contain, they also contain the constructs belonging thereto, the merged project will not suffer from a condition whereby a construct Y belonging to a construct X is present, without X being present.","However, the merged project may suffer from constructs that lack referential integrity. As such constructs are encountered, they are put into the orange state.","In addition, the merged project may suffer from invalidities whereby an inherited property no longer exists. An inherited property is not considered as belonging to the property from which it inherits. The rationale for this is that an inherited property and the property from which it inherits belong to different classes, and different classes are not required to be in the same package. Thus, situations can arise in a merged project whereby an inherited property is present without the property it inherits from existing. In such cases, the present invention preferably deletes such inherited properties from the user's updated package X, and puts the appropriate constructs depending on such property into the orange state.","Further in addition, the merged project may suffer from data type inconsistencies, whereby use of a property within a business rule becomes ill-defined when the target class of the property is changed. For example, a business rule relating two numeric properties Pand P, each with target class RealNumber, becomes inconsistent if the target of Pis changed to class String. For another example, a business rule may involve a composite property PoP. The composition of Pand Pis only defined when the target of Pis a subclass of the source of P; as such, modification of the target class of Pmay make such composition ill-defined.","However, it may be appreciated that data type inconsistencies generally do not arise in a merged project, since a business rule generally relates properties of the same class and, as such the business rule belongs to such class. Since the business rule and the class to which it belongs reside within the same package, a user modifying the package is generally able to ensure data type consistency within the business rule.","Preferably, where updates performed by a user result in inconsistencies, say, one or more constructs being in the orange state, or inherited properties being deleted or business rules becoming type inconsistent, the user is issued an advisory warning in advance. Preferably, the user is also given the opportunity to cancel the offending modifications, or further modify the updated package X so as to rectify the inconsistencies.","Delete, Purge and Garbage Collection","In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, when a user editing a project deletes a construct, the construct is initially moved into a \u201cdeleted\u201d state, but not yet purged from memory. The deleted construct preferably still appears in a GUI as being \u201cgrayed out,\u201d as is often the appearance used for inactive controls within a GUI. The deleted construct still maintains its unique ID, as described hereinabove, and references to the deleted construct are maintained until modified by the user. For example, if the target class for a property is deleted, then the target class is moved into the deleted state, and the property references a deleted class as its target.","In the course of evolution of a project, at various appropriate times, as described hereinbelow, garbage collection is applied to the project, at which times deleted constructs may be purged from memory. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, garbage removal follows a \u201cmark and sweep\u201d algorithm, whereby a graph including constructs of the project as nodes and their inter-dependencies as directed edges is marked, followed by a sweep that purges un-marked constructs. The \u201cmark\u201d preferably proceeds by traversing the graph beginning with a chosen root element, and marking each construct that is referenced by a previously traversed construct. The \u201csweep\u201d preferably traverses all constructs, and purges those that are un-marked. An unmarked construct corresponds to a construct that is not referenced by any other construct within the connected component of the graph emanating from the root element.","In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the graph of project constructs and their inter-dependencies is preferably augmented within a special \u201croot element\u201d that has a directed edge to each construct that is not in the deleted state. Using the augmented graph ensures that only deleted constructs are purged during the \u201csweep.\u201d","Reference is now made to , which is an illustration of an augmented graph used to purge project constructs, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Shown in  is a graph with nodes numbered - designating constructs, and directed edges indicating inter-dependencies. Nodes ,  and  are indicated as having been deleted from the project.","A root node is augmented to the graph, with directed edges from the root node to the non-deleted nodes - and . The augmented root node and the edges emanating therefrom are indicated in  with dashed lines. Beginning with the root node, the graph is preferably traversed in the directions of the edges and each node encountered is marked. As can be seen in , this results in all nodes being marked, except for node . After the marking is performed, a sweep is made of all nodes and the un-marked nodes are purged from memory. With respect to , node  is thus purged from memory.","Regarding the \u201cmodified mark and sweep\u201d method described hereinabove, it is noted that the only nodes purged are those that are both deleted and not referenced by any non-deleted nodes. It is further noted that had the graph in  not been augmented with the root node, then, using node  as the root node would result in both nodes  and  being purged, even though node  was never deleted from the project. It is further noted that in general the graph of project constructs and inter-dependencies does not have closed cycles, since there is a hierarchy of dependencies. Specifically, with regards to a central model that is an ontology model such a hierarchy includes inter alia: (i) dependencies of transformations and queries upon mappings of physical assets into the ontology model and upon constructs of the ontology model; (ii) dependencies of mappings of physical assets into the ontology model upon the ontology model constructs; (iii) dependencies of business rules of the ontology model upon properties of the ontology model; (iv) dependencies of properties of the ontology model upon classes of the ontology model and their inheritance relations; (v) dependencies of inheritance relations of the ontology model upon classes of the ontology model.","As mentioned hereinabove, garbage collection is preferably applied to the project only at appropriate times. Such an appropriate garbage collection time occurs when a copy of the project residing on a specific computer is known to be current; for example, if the entire project is checked out to a single user. Another such appropriate garbage collection time occurs when a user working on a part of the project is ready to export his part of the project. In such a case, garbage removal is preferably applied to the part of the project on the user's computer prior to export.","Reference is now made to , which is an illustration of a user interface for a navigator that interactively views a multiplicity of business concepts, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. As shown in the upper left pane of the user interface, concepts and tasks including model, test instances, queries, external assets, data discovery, data sources, logical models, search and impact analysis are organized together as a single project within a common navigator.","As may be appreciated from , the present invention preferably provides a single integrated environment for metadata, modeling, data semantics\/rationalization, data management and automated thesaurus services.","In reading the above description, persons skilled in the art will realize that there are many apparent variations that can be applied to the methods and systems described.","In the foregoing specification, the invention has been described with reference to specific exemplary embodiments thereof.
