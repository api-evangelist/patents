{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","COPYRIGHT NOTICE","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application is a regular utility application filing claiming priority to prior filed U.S. provisional patent application number 61\/422,753 filed Dec. 14, 2010 and titled \u201cA Gaming System, Method and Device for Generating Images Having a Parallax Effect Using Face Tracking\u201d and prior filed U.S. provisional patent application number 61\/540,659 filed Sep. 29, 2011 and titled \u201cA Gaming System, Method and Device for Generating Images Having a Parallax Effect Using Face Tracking\u201d.","A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material that is subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure, as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent files or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.","The field of the invention relates to systems, methods and apparatus for the rendition of graphics at a display for a gaming device which produces a three-dimensional effect through the use of viewer-position tracking. The present invention additionally relates to using viewer position tracking to provide gesture input control of the gaming device and to determine or approximate motion parallax to provide a 3 dimensional (3D), virtual reality effect. The present invention also relates to incorporation of touch screen functionality for such gaming devices. More particularly it relates to such systems, methods and apparatus where such effects are incorporated into game play.","Gaming devices such as casino gaming devices, e.g. slot machines, have been popular for over a century. Initially such devices were mechanical devices presenting one or more mechanical spinning reels to randomly select and display winning or losing outcomes at a single pay line. Modernly such devices are computer controlled and some include video displays, electro-mechanical stepper controlled physical reels or combinations thereof. Typically these devices display game features of a base game and perhaps one or more bonus or secondary games. For example, for a video device, the game may present a base game depicting video images of five reels each with three display positions, i.e. coordinates producing a 3\u00d75 matrix of positions for symbols. One or more pay lines are provided. Under control of the computer processor the video display depicts the reels spinning and stopping to arrange the game symbols in the matrix and where a predetermined winning combination of symbols is obtained on a wagered upon (i.e. enabled) pay line or pay arrangement the player receives a prize. Of course the foregoing description should not be deemed to be limiting since awards may be issued for symbols scatted in the matrix, i.e. a \u201cscatter pay\u201d and some symbols may trigger additional features such as a secondary game.","In the prior art casino device games the secondary game may include free spins of the base game, alteration of the base game for a number of spins, e.g. making one or more symbols wild or altering the symbol sets for the reels, a game where a player makes selections to reveal one or more prizes or otherwise interacts with a game feature to produce, or try to produce, an additional award.","A drawback of these prior art gaming devices is that the game graphical images at the game video game display are two dimensional. Recently software-based graphics engines have been produced which can produce a 3D effect at an auto-stereo electronic display such as an LCD, plasma, OLED or other electronic display. One type of auto-stereo display uses lenticular or shuttering technology in combination with generation of different views for each of the left and right eye as described, for example, in Rhodes, U.S. Pat. No. 7,697,751 filed Dec. 29, 2005 and titled \u201cUse of Ray Tracking For Generating Images For Auto-Stereo Displays\u201d, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference. Auto-stereo displays are believed to be currently commercially available from Vortex Immersion Media, Inc., of Las Vegas, Nev.","At http:\/\/johnnylee.net\/projects\/wii\/ there is shown and proposed a conversion of a Nintendo Wii\u00ae device to provide a virtual reality effect by reversing the infrared sensor bar to the player's head (for head tracking) and the control wand to the display. Movement of the sensor bar detects movement of the player's head relative to the display and display software renders the images accordingly to produce a 3D, virtual reality, effect. Seeing Machines Inc. of Acton, Mass. at http:\/\/www.seeingmachines.com has also proposed using their head tracking software (face API) in lieu of the infrared sensors of the Wii\u00ae arrangement to provide the same effect. This technology demonstrates that using head tracking to detect head motion and rending graphics according to the determined motion parallax such that 3D, virtual reality displays can be created without using the auto-stereo techniques of \u201clensing\u201d or shuttering.","It would be advantageous to incorporate the features of such technology into a gaming device. It would further be advantageous to selectively activate such features to enhance the play of the game. It would be advantageous to activate such features in connection with a bonus or feature game to increase the entertainment value of the game. It would be advantageous to activate such features relative to portions of a game or bonus display such as one or more game symbols, pay line markers, bonus game images or the like. The activation may be coordinated to the desired effect such as related to winning symbol combinations, jackpot symbols, scatter symbols or other symbols which the game designer wishes to highlight. The effect may be pronounced for some symbols and lessened for others as desired. For example, a symbol may be subject to the effect such that it appears to \u201cextrude\u201d or extend from a virtual reel strip.","It would be advantageous to apply a default condition to the gaming device when no player is present, i.e. the controlling electronics assumes a default head position to avoid \u201csearching\u201d for a non-existent player. When a player sits at the gaming machine and their head position is detected there is a lag in producing the desired effects from the default condition to the real-time position of the player's head which may introduce an unpleasant or distracting jarring or jerking effect to the 3D feature. If a player turns their head, bends over or otherwise temporarily moves their head from the target acquisition zone, similarly there is a lag until the system catches up to the movement again likely introducing a jerking effect. It would be advantageous in this regard to provide, under certain conditions, a \u201csmoothing\u201d of the effect to reduce the effects which may be introduced by the first acquisition of a player's face from a default condition and where the player moves their head.","It has been known to provide gaming machines with touch screen or touch sensitive displays. As is known these displays can be of various types; resistive, surface acoustic, capacitive, surface capacitance, projected capacitance or any other type. Using such a display a player can interface with the gaming device (and system) by touching appropriate areas of the display. During the play of a game the player may have to make selections such as picking cards, making wager selections or selecting between displayed icons.","It would be advantageous to provide a game where one or more features are displayed with the aforementioned 3D virtual reality effect coordinated with reconfiguration of the touch screen display to permit the player to enter prompts such as selects based upon the images rendered to the player. That is, as the images are altered by motion parallax, additional touch screen prompts can be revealed and proved to the player.","It would be advantageous to provide a game where, by movement of the player's head the player can \u201czoom\u201d in on the image. For example, if a player had poor eyesight it would be advantageous for the player to simply lean toward the display to zoom in on the selected scene.","There is also a need to provide a system, apparatus and method which enables a player to enter prompts and make selections based upon sensed gestures such as movement of the head, hands or arms and which can combine this functionality with providing the aforementioned 3D effects.","There is also a need to provide a community gaming experience which incorporates the virtual reality technology.","In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention there is provided a gaming device presenting a game to be played by a player. The gaming device includes a video display and apparatus for generating data corresponding to at least the approximate position of at least a portion of the player's body relative to the display, the relative position changeable during operation of the gaming device by relative movement (actual or virtual) between the player and the display, i.e. either the player moving, movement of the display or use of a controller to effect virtual motion parallax. In this embodiment the apparatus may be a digital camera operating in the visible or infrared spectra or any other device operating in the electromagnetic spectrum or may be an acoustical position sensing device. A processor, such as a processor at the gaming device or located remotely but operatively coupled to the gaming device through a suitable communication network, is configured to receive the data from the apparatus, to render an image at the display in connection with the game based upon motion parallax, actual or virtual, between the player and the display and to detect and process at least predetermined changes to said relative position to control one or more features and\/or images of the gaming device based upon the motion parallax. For example, if the apparatus senses that the player has moved their head to the right the processor renders the image so as to provide the player with a view simulating a 3D effect. The sensor can also sense this movement as a control input to control a feature of the game such as steering or moving a displayed object. As a non-limiting example, during the game the player may have to navigate through a field of images by moving the head from right to left. As they do so the processor renders the images to provide a 3D effect based upon motion parallax and the player's movement or gesture to display the navigation through the field. The relative motion may be provided by the player moving their head, nodding their head, moving their head closer to or away from the display or a combination of those movements that is sensed by the apparatus to provide input to the processor to control or operate a feature of the game. Alternatively the player may be provided with a control to move the display, e.g. physically rotate it from one side to the other or tilt it forward and back or which provides an input which does not physically move the display but controls the display to display resultant images as though the display were moved without physically moving the display, i.e. virtual or \u201cinduced\u201d motion parallax.","In another embodiment the processor is configured to render the view of an image of the game in conventional 2D form (including high definition if desired) and based upon a predetermined event or a command render an image or a portion of the image having the aforementioned 3D effect based upon motion parallax. As but a non-limiting example, if the player obtains a certain outcome during the play of a base game such as a spinning reel slot machine-style game, one or more symbols may be displayed having the aforementioned 3D effect based upon motion parallax. Using gestures such as head movements or other relative movement the player may change the presentation of the image based upon the motion parallax to reveal hidden or obscured images such as images appearing to be behind, beneath, above, or to one side or the other of a game symbol. Revealing such images based upon motion parallax provides a 3D visualization of such images. The player may interact with the images through gesture or by the processor configuring a touch screen input device based upon the sensed movement of the player's head to enable the player to provide a touch screen input for the images.","In a related embodiment the processor maybe configured to provide several degrees of the aforementioned 3D effect for example one being an attenuated version providing a minimal 3D motion parallax effect for example during normal play of the game and one which is more pronounced during, for example, during a bonus or award feature. Several degrees of the effect may be applied to one or more images or image segments to confer the desired effect.","In a further embodiment a gaming device to provide a game to a player includes a video display having a first video display overlaying at least a portion of a second display. The first display is configured to have at least a portion thereof changeable between a transparent condition and a lenticular condition where at least a portion thereof displays spaced vertical lenticular lines. An apparatus is provided for generating data corresponding to at least the approximate position correlated to the position of the player's head relative to the display, the changes to said relative position changeable during operation of the gaming device. A processor is configured to control the first display between the transparent and lenticular conditions and the second display to display images related to the play of the game in a first, two-dimensional, state and in response to a command or event and using said data from said apparatus, control the first display to display said vertical lenticular lines and one or more images at said second display to display a lenticular image based upon said data to produce a three-dimensional effect to the player for the image. As but a non-limiting example, the first and second display may be video displays. During a base game the first display is controlled to a transparent condition and the second display displays game symbols such as symbols for a reel based slot machine presentation. Upon a controlling event or condition, an image on the second display such as a slot machine symbol, is displayed in coordination with the control of the first display to the lenticular condition. The image and vertical lines of the first display are further controlled based upon the sensed relative position of the player's eyes to produce a lenticular effect for the image. If the player moves their head and eyes from one side to the other, up or down or nearer or further relative to the display the processor controls the image and lenticular line configuration to produce the aforesaid lenticular effect. The player may interact with the images through gesture or by the processor configuring a touch screen input device based upon the sensed movement of the player's head to enable the player to provide a touch screen input for the images. The relative motion may be provided by the player moving their head, nodding their head, tilting their head, moving their head closer to or away from the display or a combination of those movements that is sensed by the apparatus to provide input to the processor to control or operate a feature of the game. Alternatively the player may be provided with a control to move the display, e.g. physically rotate it from one side to the other or tilt it forward and back.","The apparatus may be a digital camera operating in the visible or infrared spectra or any other device operating in the electromagnetic spectrum or may be an acoustical position sensing device.","In a further non-limiting embodiment the gaming device may be linked to a system. At the request the gaming device, player or system related or provided images at the gaming device display(s) such as a service window are displayed to the player. The system service window may be adapted to occupy the entire real estate of the display(s) or a portion thereof such as, for example, occupying the left-side one-third of the display(s). These system related displays provide for player interaction with the system such as for playing a system provided game, uploading and downloading funds, inquiries concerning their account status and any loyalty points they may have earned, redeeming system related awards and the like. In this embodiment the gaming device or system may display one or more of the system messaging related images such as the service window with the aforementioned software or lenticular driven 3D effect. The processor would likewise recognize gesture inputs an alternatively or additionally configure an input device such as a touch screen to enable the player to input information and respond to prompts from the system.","In yet another embodiment a gaming device includes a video display and apparatus disposed at the gaming device to acquire data representing the position of the first player's eyes. The apparatus may be a digital camera or other device as referenced above. A source such as a memory or real time data from a remote digital camera provides data representing a scene. The scene may be, for example, a scene of the surroundings for the gaming device, a scene related to advertising, a scene related to a facility of a casino resort or the like. A processor is configured to display the images for the game or service window superimposed over images of the scene, to detect movement of the player's eyes and render at least one of said images of the game and\/or of the scene at said display based upon motion parallax. That is, where movement of the player's eyes is detected the images are manipulated by the processor to provide the 3D effect referred to above. In a related embodiment a plurality of displays may be provided to provide the effect created by lenticular shuttering as described above.","In yet another embodiment of the present invention at least a pair of gaming devices arranged for play by first and second players. The gaming machines may be arranged in a bank such as by being side-by-side or back-to-back. A first gaming device includes a video display for displaying game content for a base game to the first player. The base game may include a video representation of slot machine reels or cards of a card game. A digital camera is arranged at the first gaming device to acquire data representing the image of the first player and background and data corresponding to the position of the first player's eyes relative to the display. For example a digital camera may be disposed on the first gaming device above, below or to one side of the video display. The first gaming device also includes a data input apparatus which may be, for example, buttons, a touch screen input device at the video display or as referenced above apparatus for detecting gestures of the first player, i.e. movement of the hands or head.","A second gaming device also includes a video display for displaying game content for a base game to the second player (if any) and a digital camera to acquire data representing the image of the second player and background and data corresponding to the position of the second player's eyes relative to the display. Also provided is data input apparatus.","At least one processor is configured to, in response to triggering of an event such as a group or community gaming event, control the display for the first gaming device to display to the first player a game with images acquired by the camera of the second gaming device. In one embodiment the game may be images relating to a matrix of selections or a spinning reel game superimposed with the images of the second gaming device camera. Where the first and second gaming devices are arranged back-to-back the superimposition gives the impression to the first player that he\/she is looking through their gaming device to the scene beyond the second gaming device. At least the first player inputs data to play the game to produce an outcome. The processor also controls the display of the second gaming device to display to the second player the game with images acquired by the camera of said first gaming device to a similar effect. In one embodiment the images for the game are displayed to the second player as a mirror image of the display to the first player. Where the first and second gaming devices are arranged back-to-back and during the game event the impression given to the first and second players is that they are looking through their gaming devices and the display of the game is suspended between them.","In a further embodiment the aforementioned 3D effects are, when no player is detected in the image target area, displayed based upon a default position. This default position may be based upon a hypothetical position of a player of average height and position relative to the display. For example, where the display is a gaming machine display, the default condition may display an attract image routine including the 3D effects but based upon the default position of a player. When a player is detected, according to this embodiment of the invention, a smoothing routine may be executed which smoothly transitions between the 3D effects based upon the default condition to the condition where a player is actually detected to prevent the effect from appearing to jerk or jump to the condition configured to the actual player.","Referring now to the drawings, wherein like reference numbers denote like or corresponding elements throughout the drawings, and more particularly referring to , there is shown an embodiment of a gaming device  which may be employed according to apparatus, system and methods of the present invention.

The player may further control the operation of the gaming device  by way of other peripherals , for example, to select the amount to wager via a player interface such as the buttons . The game starts in response to the player operating a start mechanism such as the handle , button such as a SPIN\/RESET button touch screen icon or depressing a button  or pulling the handle . The game program includes a random number generator to provide a display of randomly selected indicia on one or more of the primary and\/or secondary displays. In some embodiments, the random number generator may be physically separate from gaming terminal ; for example, it may be part of a central determination host system which provides random game outcomes to the game program. Finally, processor board  under control of the game program and OS compares the final display of indicia to a pay table. The set of possible game outcomes may include a subset of outcomes related to the triggering of a feature or bonus game. In the event the displayed outcome is a member of this subset, processor board , under control of the game program and by way of I\/O Board , may cause feature game play to be presented on the primary game display  or a display constituting all or a portion of the top glass .","Predetermined payout amounts for certain outcomes, including feature game outcomes, are stored as part of the game program. Such payout amounts are, in response to instructions from processor board , provided to the player in the form of coins, credits or currency via I\/O board and a pay mechanism, which may be one or more of a credit meter, a coin hopper, a voucher printer, an electronic funds transfer protocol or any other payout means known or developed in the art.","In various embodiments, the game program is stored in a memory device (not shown) connected to or mounted on the gaming motherboard. By way of example, but not by limitation, such memory devices include external memory devices, hard drives, CD-ROMs, DVDs, and flash memory cards. In an alternative embodiment, the game programs are stored in a remote storage device. In one embodiment, the remote storage device is housed in a remote server such as a downloadable gaming server. The gaming device  may access the remote storage device via a network connection, including but not limited to, a local area network connection, a TCP\/IP connection, a wireless connection, or any other means for operatively networking components together. Optionally, other data including graphics, sound files and other media data for use with the gaming device  are stored in the same or a separate memory device (not shown). Some or all of the game program and its associated data may be loaded from one memory device into another, for example, from flash memory to random access memory (RAM).","In one or more embodiments, peripherals may be connected to the system over Ethernet connections directly to the appropriate server or tied to the system controller inside the gaming device  using USB, serial or Ethernet connections. Each of the respective devices may have upgrades to their firmware utilizing these connections.","GMU  includes an integrated circuit board and GMU processor and memory including coding for network communications, such as the G2S (game-to-system) protocol from the Gaming Standards Association, Las Vegas, Nev., used for system communications over the network. As shown, GMU  may connect to a player card reader  (component  in ) through bus  and may thereby obtain player card information and transmit the information over the network through bus . Gaming activity information may be transferred by the EGM Processor Board  to GMU  where the information may be translated into a network protocol, such as S2S, for transmission to a server, such as a player tracking server, where information about a player's playing activity may be stored in a designated server database.","PID  includes an integrated circuit board, PID processor, and memory which includes an operating system, such as Windows CE, a player interface program which may be executable by the PID processor together with various input\/output (I\/O) drivers for respective devices which connect to PID , such as player interface devices , and which may further include various games or game components playable on PID  or playable on a connected network server and PID  is operable as the player interface. PID  connects to card reader  through bus , player system interface display  through video decoder  and bus , such as an LVDS or VGA bus.","As part of its programming, the PID processor executes coding to drive system interface display  and provide messages and information to a player. Touch screen circuitry  interactively connects display  and video decoder  to PID ; such that a player may input information and cause the information to be transmitted to PID  either on the player's initiative or responsive to a query by PID . Additionally soft keys  connect through bus  to PID  and operate together with the display  to provide information or queries to a player and receive responses or queries from the player. PID , in turn, communicates over the CMS\/SMS network through Ethernet switch  and busses ,  and with respective servers, such as a player tracking server.","Player interface devices , i.e. devices of the player tracking module , are linked into the virtual private network of the system components in gaming device . The system components include the iVIEW\u00ae device (\u201ciView\u201d is a registered trademark of Bally Gaming, Inc.) processing board and game monitoring unit (GMU) processing board may provide the functionality of the player tracking module . These system components may connect over a network to the slot management system (such as a commercially available Bally SDS\/SMS) and\/or casino management system (such as a commercially available Bally CMP\/CMS). The player interface devices  may also include the digital camera(s)  in lieu or in addition to providing the digital cameras on the gaming housing .","The GMU system component has a connection to the base game through a serial SAS connection and is connected to various servers using, for example, HTTPs over Ethernet. Through this connection, firmware, media, operating system software, gaming machine configurations can be downloaded to the system components from the servers. This data is authenticated prior to install on the system components.","In an alternative embodiment the player system interface including the player tracking display  may instead be presented, upon command or request by the player, as all or a portion of the primary game display  as what is referred to a system interface window or service window. Where the primary game display  has touch screen functionality, upon command or a request, the content at the primary game display  such as a video reel game display is sized to accommodate the service window display at the primary game display . The touch screen functionality for the primary game display  is configured to enable the player to interact with the interface through touch screen controls (buttons, sliders, arrows, etc.).","Turning to  is a functional block diagram of a gaming kernel  of a game program under control of processor board , uses gaming kernel  by calling into application programming interface (API) , which is part of game manager . According to the present invention the API  may include the software module(s) such as the faceAPI (referenced above) for face tracking as well as the software module(s) for rendering the 3d virtual reality images based upon detected motion parallax. These software applications may be stored in a suitable memory device such as a flash memory, thumb drive or the like. The components of game kernel  as shown in  are only illustrative, and should not be considered limiting. For example, the number of managers may be changed, additional managers may be added or some managers may be removed without deviating from the scope and spirit of the invention.","As shown in the example, there are three layers: a hardware layer ; an operating system layer , such as, but not limited to, Linux; and a game kernel layer  having game manager  therein. In one or more embodiments, the use of a standard operating system , such a UNIX-based or Windows-based operating system, allows game developers interfacing to the gaming kernel to use any of a number of standard development tools and environments available for the operating systems. This is in contrast to the use of proprietary, low level interfaces which may require significant time and engineering investments for each game upgrade, hardware upgrade, or feature upgrade. The game kernel layer  executes at the user level of the operating system , and itself contains a major component called the I\/O Board Server . To properly set the bounds of game application software (making integrity checking easier), all game applications interact with gaming kernel  using a single API  in game manager . This enables game applications to make use of a well-defined, consistent interface, as well as making access points to gaming kernel  controlled, where overall access is controlled using separate processes.","For example, game manager  parses an incoming command stream and, when a command dealing with I\/O comes in (arrow ), the command is sent to an applicable library routine . Library routine  decides what it needs from a device, and sends commands to I\/O Board Server  (see arrow ). A few specific drivers remain in operating system 's kernel, shown as those below line . These are built-in, primitive, or privileged drivers that are (i) general (ii) kept to a minimum and (iii) are easier to leave than extract. In such cases, the low-level communications is handled within operating system  and the contents passed to library routines .","Thus, in a few cases library routines may interact with drivers inside operating system , which is why arrow  is shown as having three directions (between library utilities  and I\/O Board Server , or between library utilities  and certain drivers in operating system ). No matter which path is taken, the logic needed to work with each device is coded into modules in the user layer of the diagram. Operating system  is kept as simple, stripped down, and common across as many hardware platforms as possible. The library utilities and user-level drivers change as dictated by the game cabinet or game machine in which it will run. Thus, each game cabinet or game machine may have an industry standard processor board  connected to a unique, relatively dumb, and as inexpensive as possible I\/O adapter board, plus a gaming kernel  which will have the game-machine-unique library routines and I\/O Board Server  components needed to enable game applications to interact with the gaming machine cabinet. Note that these differences are invisible to the game application software with the exception of certain functional differences (i.e., if a gaming cabinet has stereo sound, the game application will be able make use of API  to use the capability over that of a cabinet having traditional monaural sound).","Game manager  provides an interface into game kernel , providing consistent, predictable, and backwards compatible calling methods, syntax, and capabilities by way of game application API . This enables the game developer to be free of dealing directly with the hardware, including the freedom to not have to deal with low-level drivers as well as the freedom to not have to program lower level managers , although lower level managers  may be accessible through game manager 's interface  if a programmer has the need. In addition to the freedom derived from not having to deal with the hardware level drivers and the freedom of having consistent, callable, object-oriented interfaces to software managers of those components (drivers), game manager  provides access to a set of high level managers  also having the advantages of consistent callable, object-oriented interfaces, and further providing the types and kinds of base functionality required in casino-type games. Game manager , providing all the advantages of its consistent and richly functional interface  as supported by the rest of game kernel , thus provides a game developer with a multitude of advantages.","Game manager  may have several objects within itself, including an initialization object (not shown). The initialization object performs the initialization of the entire game machine, including other objects, after game manager  has started its internal objects and servers in appropriate order. In order to carry out this function, the kernel's configuration manager  is among the first objects to be started; configuration manager  has data needed to initialize and correctly configure other objects or servers.","The high level managers  of game kernel  may include game event log manager  which provides, at the least, a logging or logger base class, enabling other logging objects to be derived from this base object. The logger object is a generic logger; that is, it is not aware of the contents of logged messages and events. The log manager's  job is to log events in non-volatile event log space. The size of the space may be fixed, although the size of the logged event is typically not. When the event space or log space fills up, one embodiment will delete the oldest logged event (each logged event will have a time\/date stamp, as well as other needed information such as length), providing space to record the new event. In this embodiment, the most recent events will thus be found in the log space, regardless of their relative importance. Further provided is the capability to read the stored logs for event review.","In accordance with one embodiment, meter manager  manages the various meters embodied in the game kernel . This includes the accounting information for the game machine and game play. There are hard meters (counters) and soft meters; the soft meters may be stored in non-volatile storage such as non-volatile battery-backed RAM to prevent loss. Further, a backup copy of the soft meters may be stored in a separate non-volatile storage such as EEPROM. In one embodiment, meter manager  receives its initialization data for the meters, during start-up, from configuration manager . While running, the cash in  and cash out  managers call the meter manager's  update functions to update the meters. Meter manager  will, on occasion, create backup copies of the soft meters by storing the soft meters' readings in EEPROM. This is accomplished by calling and using EEPROM manager .","Progressive manager  manages progressive games playable from the game machine. Event manager  is generic, like log manager , and is used to manage various gaming device events. Focus manager  correlates which process has control of various focus items. Tilt manager  is an object that receives a list of errors (if any) from configuration manager  at initialization, and during game play from processes, managers, drivers, etc. that may generate errors. Random number generator manager  is provided to allow easy programming access to a random number generator (RNG), as a RNG is required in virtually all casino-style (gambling) games. RNG manager  includes the capability of using multiple seeds.","A credit manager object (not shown) manages the current state of credits (cash value or cash equivalent) in the game machine, including any available winnings, and further provides denomination conversion services. Cash out manager  has the responsibility of configuring and managing monetary output devices. During initialization, cash out manager , using data from configuration manager , sets the cash out devices correctly and selects any selectable cash out denominations. During play, a game application may post a cash out event through the event manager  (the same way all events are handled), and using a call back posted by cash out manager , cash out manager  is informed of the event. Cash out manager  updates the credit object, updates its state in non-volatile memory, and sends an appropriate control message to the device manager that corresponds to the dispensing device. As the device dispenses dispensable media, there will typically be event messages being sent back and forth between the device and cash out manager  until the dispensing finishes, after which cash out manager , having updated the credit manager and any other game state (such as some associated with meter manager ) that needs to be updated for this set of actions, sends a cash out completion event to event manager  and to the game application thereby. Cash in manager  functions similarly to cash out manager , only controlling, interfacing with, and taking care of actions associated with cashing in events, cash in devices, and associated meters and crediting.","In a further example, in accordance with one or more embodiments, I\/O server  may write data to the gaming machine EEPROM memory, which is located in the gaming machine cabinet and holds meter storage that must be kept even in the event of power failure. Game manager  calls the I\/O library functions to write data to the EEPROM. The I\/O server  receives the request and starts a low priority EEPROM thread  within I\/O server  to write the data. This thread uses a sequence of 8 bit command and data writes to the EEPROM device to write the appropriate data in the proper location within the device. Any errors detected will be sent as IPC messages to game manager . All of this processing is asynchronous.","In accordance with one embodiment, button module  within I\/O server , polls (or is sent) the state of buttons at the user interface  every two milliseconds. These inputs are debounced by keeping a history of input samples. Certain sequences of samples are required to detect a button was pressed, in which case the I\/O server  sends an inter-process communication event to game manager  that a button was pressed or released. In some embodiments, the gaming machine may have intelligent distributed I\/O which debounces the buttons, in which case button module  may be able to communicate with the remote intelligent button processor to get the button events and simply relay them to game manager  via IPC messages. In still another embodiment, the I\/O library may be used for pay out requests from the game application. For example, hopper module  (where a coin\/token hopper is provided) must start the hopper motor, constantly monitor the coin sensing lines of the hopper, debounce them, and send an IPC message to the game manager  when each coin is paid.","Further details, including disclosure of lower level fault handling and\/or processing, are included in U.S. Pat.

One or more digital cameras  are provided as described above. In one embodiment only a single digital camera  may be disposed on the gaming device  and configured to capture data representing the position of at least the player's head and eyes. Where gesture control is desired the digital camera  may be configured to capture the upper torso of the player as well as by using a wider angle lens. The data from the digital camera  is provided to a processor such as CPU  which may be the EGM processor board  or GMU  described above or a separate processor located at the gaming device , player tracking module  or remotely where remote processing is desired. As shown the CPU  is in communication with the GMU  as well as a graphics processing unit , memory device  and image generation module or engine . The engine  for generating the 3D virtual reality images as described herein may be, as discussed above, programmed as one of the libraries  of the gaming kernel  and stored in a suitable memory.","As described in detail below when the 3D virtual reality functionality is enabled, the peripherals such as the primary game display , digital camera  and the touch screen may be configured to provide additional functionality to the game according to the present invention.","In many cases the gaming device  will be connected to one or more systems.  illustrates a casino gaming system  that may include one or more gaming devices  and one or more servers. Networking components facilitate communications between a backend system  and game management units  that control displays for carousels of gaming devices  across a network. Game management units (GMU's)  ( in ) connect the gaming devices  to networking components and may be installed in the gaming device housing  or external to the gaming device . The function of the GMU  is similar to the function of a network interface card connected to a desktop personal computer (PC). Some GMU's  have much greater capability and can perform such tasks as presenting and playing a game using a display (not shown) operatively connected to the GMU . In one embodiment, the GMU  is a separate component located outside the gaming device . Alternatively, in another embodiment, the GMU  is located within the gaming device  as the player tracking module  (). Optionally, in an alternative embodiment, one or more gaming devices  connect directly to a network and are not connected to a GMU .","The gaming devices  are connected via a network to a network bridge , which is used for networking, routing and polling gaming devices, including slot machines. The network bridge  connects to the back end system . Optionally, the gaming devices  may connect to the network via a network rack , which provides for a few numbers of connections to the back end system . Both, network bridge  and network rack  may be classified as middleware, and facilitate communications between the back end system  and the GMUs . The network bridges  and network rack  may comprise data repositories for storing network performance data. Such performance data may be based on network traffic and other network related information. Optionally, the network bridge  and the network rack  may be interchangeable components. For example, in one embodiment, a casino gaming system may comprise only network bridges  and no network racks . Alternatively, in another embodiment, a casino gaming system may comprise only network racks  and no network bridges . Additionally, in an alternative embodiment, a casino gaming system may comprise any combination of one or more network bridges  and one or more network racks .","The back end system  may be configured to comprise one or more servers as hereinafter described. The type of server employed is generally determined by the platform and software requirements of the gaming system. In one embodiment, as illustrated in , the back end system  is configured to include three servers: a slot floor controller , a casino management server  and a casino database . As described with reference to  the casino resort enterprise may include other servers. The slot floor controller  is a part of the player tracking system for gathering accounting, security and player specific information. The casino management server  and casino database  work together to store and process information specific to both employees and players. Player specific information includes, but is not limited to, passwords, biometric identification, player card identification, and biographic data. Additionally, employee specification information may include biographic data, biometric information, job level and rank, passwords, authorization codes and security clearance levels.","Overall, the back end system  performs several functions. For example, the back end system  can collect data from the slot floor as communicated to it from other network components, and maintain the collected data in its database. The back end system  may use slot floor data to generate a report used in casino operation functions. Examples of such reports include, but are not limited to, accounting reports, security reports, and usage reports. The back end system  may also pass data to another server for other functions. Alternatively, the back end system  may pass data stored on its database to floor hardware for interaction with a game or game player. For example, data such as a game player's name or the amount of a ticket being redeemed at a game may be passed to the floor hardware. Additionally, the back end system  may comprise one or more data repositories for storing data. Examples of types of data stored in the system server data repositories include, but are not limited to, information relating to individual player play data, individual game accounting data, gaming terminal accounting data, cashable ticket data, sound data, and optimal display configurations for one or more displays for one or more system game. In certain embodiments the back end system  may include game download functionality to download and change the game played on the gaming devices , provide server based gaming or provide some or all of the data processing (including if desired graphics processing as described herein) to the gaming devices .","Of course, one will appreciate that a gaming system  may also comprise other types of components, and the above illustrations are meant only as examples and not as limitations to the types of components or games used in a casino gaming system.","According to a feature of the present invention the camera  is configured to capture the image of the player to determine or approximate the position of the player's eyes relative to the primary game display  for the purpose of rendering 3D graphical images. The camera  may be positioned at various locations on the gaming device ; however in a preferred embodiment is offset from the center of the primary game display  as by being located between the display  and top glass  or to one side or the other of the primary game display  in the event the primary game display  is oriented in a portrait mode. As such the determination of the position of the player's eyes must take into account the offset from the center of the primary game display . This may be done by one or more of calculation or empirical alignment. For example, based upon the location the digital camera  measurements may determine the amount of offset. Preferably even though the compensation for offset can be mathematically calculated and accounted for empirical adjustment may be required to make sure the effect is not warped by misalignment and hence erroneous determination of the position of the player's eyes. For example, upon installation a standard target at a standard position corresponding to the position of a typical player's eyes may be used to configure the offset and focus the digital camera  to the desired field for the desired capture of data.

The gaming devices may be of similar or different appearance and construction. Each gaming device has a cabinet supporting a primary game display and a secondary display . The primary game display and secondary display may be mechanical or video\/mechanical displays such as a window or glass for viewing a number of electro-mechanical stepper reels as is known in the art or employment of a wheel for displaying\/selecting either a primary game outcome or a bonus game outcome. In a video embodiment, the primary game display and\/or the secondary display is, typically, a CRT or a flat-panel display in the form of, but not limited to, liquid crystal, plasma, electroluminescent, vacuum fluorescent, field emission, laser or any other type of panel display known or developed in the art.

For example, the event may be after players have wagered a qualifying amount and have obtained a qualifying outcome, the community game is triggered. Assuming for purposes of discussing that the player of gaming device has qualified for the community game and a community gaming event has been triggered. In such a case the display of  or  may be triggered.

Further the scene to be used as the background can be imported such as a scene from the restaurant, pool area or any other real time or recorded scene.","Turning to  further features and embodiments of the invention will be described. According to these embodiments selected symbols or image portions may be controlled to provide the 3D, motion parallax effect to enhance those symbols or portions to the player. In one example, as shown, symbols may be accorded the 3D motion parallax effect to appear to the player to extend or \u201cextrude\u201d from the reel strip.  shows a video game display  which includes five reels -arranged in a typical side-by-side arrangement simulating mechanical reels. As stated above, the display  may have a selected degree of 3d motion parallax effect applied as suggested in  such that movement of the player's head confers a degree of 3D effect. Additionally one or more symbols such s the \u201c777\u201d symbols  may be displayed to have a lesser or greater 3D greater to appear to the player to extend outward from the reel strip. As the reel strip is displayed to appear to rotate from top to bottom of the display , the effect would be, for example, to the greatest degree near the top and bottom of the display  and attenuated or removed as the 777 symbol  approaches the center of the display . This affect may be applied to a lesser degree to other symbols of the display, symbols that are part of a winning combination, higher pay symbols or other symbols or the applied effect may be related or proportional to the value of the symbol, i.e. the award based upon the symbol. The 3D effect may be intermittently applied to give the symbols the appearance of \u201cpulsing\u201d away from and back into the reel strip. This affect can be applied to other portions of the game such as images in a bonus feature to enhance the display effects. The effect may not be fixed such as it may be based upon factors such as outcomes, anticipated outcomes, bonus features, symbols or graphics introduced into the display  or the like.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0119","num":"0118"},"figref":["FIGS. 21A","FIGS. 22A","FIG. 23","FIG. 24"],"b":["2014","2014","2100","2014","2200","2300","2400","2014","2014"]},"Turning to  another feature of the invention is shown. When the gaming machine  is idle or in a condition where the cameras  do not detect a player is present for a period of time, e.g. the player is turned around, preferably the system is controlled by the software to use a default (assumed) position of a player's eyes to render the image. This position may be referred to as the virtual camera position, i.e. the position if a camera viewing the image were positioned at the player's eyes. For example, it may be desirable in an attract mode when no player is present, to apply the 3D effects described above, which includes the extrusion effect, to the display to attract players. It has been found, however, than when a player does sit at the gaming machine  and the cameras  first acquire the player's face, there is a jarring discontinuity as the software adjusts from the default position to the actual position of the player's eyes. There is currently a time delay on the order of one second for the software to acquire the player's face and the software adjusts to produce the desired 3D effect. This jarring or discontinuity can be disconcerting and annoying to the players.","To overcome this drawback the present invention according to one or more embodiments applies a smoothing of such discontinuities. According to these various embodiments \u201cSlerp\u201d may be selectively used. \u201cSlerp\u201d is an animation algorithm developed by Ken Shoemake and a description of the mathematics can be found at, for example, http:\/\/en.wikiopedia.org\/wiki\/Slerp. \u201cSlerp\u201d is an algorithm that interpolates steps between two orientations of an object in a 3D generated scene-be it a virtual model, camera or light. Slerp is useful because it provided for constant speed motion which, when combined with interpolation of position, allows two arbitrary virtual cameral positions and orientations to be interpolated between over any given numbers of steps with a pleasing smooth effect.","While Slerp has been used for interpolating virtual cameral orientation in 3D PC and console games, i.e. the orientation of a viewed of the scene, it is believed that is have not been used before the present invention in conjunction with real time face tracking as a means for interpolating between virtual camera orientations because of the problem that Slerp, by its nature, is an interpolation and thus requires two endpoints to interpolate between a number of steps. It has been found that simply using Slerp to interpolate between virtual camera orientations produces a negative effect of adding latency of multiple frames of graphic rendering to the tracking. So while the player sees a smooth change of orientation of the 3D rendition, this change lags behind their head movement at least by one or two frames. This small delay is enough to ruin the 3D effect as the virtual camera no longer accurately reflects the position of the player's eyes. At worst the delay can be nauseating similar to the use of primitive virtual reality headsets that tracked with a similar latency.","To overcome these problems algorithms have been developed to use Slerp for only certain scenarios. Turning to , at  the software is initialized such as at boot up. At  the software determines if a player's face was previously detected. If not at  the images captured by the cameras  is interrogated to see if a face is now detected. If no face is detected at , the software controls the display to display at  in a default orientation of the virtual camera, i.e. the player's eyes. This default orientation may be based upon the height of a statistically average sized player. If at  a face is now detected, at  the software slowly interpolates from the default position of the virtual camera to the current orientation as detected in real time by the cameras  using Slerp. The interpolation is ideally relatively slow, for example, on the order of one-half second and serves to smoothly introduce the face tracked view of the player. It also compensates for the acquisition time of the face tracking algorithm as the player doesn't see a discontinuous movement of the 3D rendering a few seconds after sitting down at the gaming machine . Instead, after a few seconds they have a smooth transition into face tracked 3D.","If at  a face was previously detected at  a determination is made if a face is still detected. If so, at  the difference between the orientations (previous face detection and current face detection) is made. If the differences are small (determined by, for example, known methods such as the dot product between the two orientation quaternions) then no interpolation is used and the current orientation is used as the virtual camera orientation at . This prevents any lag during normal face tracked play. It has been found that a 30 degree facial orientation different between the two image samples may qualify as a small difference. Other values may of course be used.","If at  the difference is not small, such as where the player has looked away, than at  a quick interpolation such as over 2-3 frames can be used. Tracking can still work with as much as a 45 degree variance from a \u201chead on\u201d view of the display.","If at  no face is detected then a timeout period of, for example, ten seconds is initiated. At  the software determines if a face has been re-acquired during the time out period. If at  the time out period is reached with no re-acquisition of a face, then at  a slow interpolation (using Slerp) is used from the previous orientation to the default orientation. If at  before the time out period expires a face is re-acquired at  a quick interpolation (again on the order of 2-3 frames) between the previous and current orientations is used. Ay  the process is finished.","The foregoing description, for purposes of explanation, uses specific nomenclature and formula to provide a thorough understanding of the invention.
