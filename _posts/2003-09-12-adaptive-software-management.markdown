title: Adaptive software management
abstract: Adaptive control techniques, such as power management techniques for use in managing power consumption in an electronic device, employ optimization analysis to generate power consumption/quality of service performance plots. The optimization analysis can include experiments that are performed for various settings of control factors that control the operation of the device. The performance plots relate power consumption in the device to quality of service levels for the device. During operation, aspects of the device are monitored. A control factor and a level for the control factor are automatically selected based on the monitored aspects, by using the performance plots to identify an experiment having the desired quality of service level and the corresponding control factor level. The control factor is then automatically set to that selected level to control the power consumption or quality of service of the device.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The invention relates to adaptive control of electronic, electromechanical and mechanical devices. More particularly, it relates to techniques for managing devices that are controlled using computer software.","2. Description of the Related Art","Computer controlled systems and devices are ubiquitous in today's society and there has been a long-felt need to optimize their operation to adapt to the needs of the individuals who use them. One such class of devices in which adaptive control is needed is portable battery powered devices. With the proliferation of battery powered devices, power management has become critical to the success of such products. Power drain effects all aspects of operation: size, weight, battery life. Adequately managing power allows for use of smaller and lighter batteries, other advanced power technologies (e.g., fuel cells, etc.), and other alternative portable power sources, each of which can support longer periods of operation of the devices. Although power management can be accomplished according to many approaches, none are known that are adaptive to a user's patterns of use or robust enough to optimize the power management in the presence of noise.","Designers of today's electronic devices attempt to reduce power consumption by concentrating their efforts on reducing the power drain required by the device or by using background processing tasks to determine if certain subsystems within the electronic device can be powered down. These devices often are described as being adaptive, since they feed back to a power management algorithm information concerning the power usage of the device to determine new values for adjustable power settings. However, the degree of adaptability of those device is very low since they employ only a mere feed back loop that does not account for system noise or provide control in dynamic situations.","Accordingly, there is a need for power management techniques that take into account system noise, user preferences, and patterns of use of the device. Power management systems are but one class of systems that are in need of adaptive control techniques. Many other types of systems can benefit from adaptive control techniques.","Therefore, in light of the above, and for other reasons that will become apparent when the invention is fully described, an aspect of the invention relates to a method of generating information for adaptively controlling a device.","For example, the power consumption of a device can be adaptively controlled according to the methods described here. One such method includes performing an optimization analysis based on a quality of service and power consumption of the device, and a plurality of control factors for controlling the device. A power management profile is generated that relates to the quality of service and power consumption of the device based on results of the optimization experiment. The power management profile is used to automatically determine a control factor to adjust, and a level to adjust it to, to minimize power consumption or achieve a certain quality of service level.","The above features and advantages of the invention will become apparent upon consideration of the following descriptions and descriptive figures of specific embodiments thereof. While these descriptions go into specific details of the invention, it should be understood that variations may and do exist and would be apparent to those skilled in the art based on the descriptions herein.","The embodiments described below are described with reference to the above drawings, in which like reference numerals designate like components.","The adaptive control techniques described here can be used in a wide variety of computer-controlled systems and devices. Virtually any system or device that is controlled by a computer and that is suitable for operating according to an individual operator's preferences or habits can benefit from the adaptive control techniques described here. For example, the adaptive control techniques described here can be applied to HVAC control systems, lighting control systems, home automation system, etc.","To illustrate the inventive techniques, embodiments that relate to power management are described here. For example, methods, devices and articles of manufacture are described here that can dramatically improve power management of electronic devices by optimizing the performance of the device in the presence of compound system noise. By using experiments, such as conventional Design of Experiments (DOE) experiments, Orthogonal Array experiments, Latin Square Design experiments, Taguchi style design of experiments, and full and fractional factorial style experiments, control factors can be chosen that control the device so that it performs in an optimal manner based on those chosen control factors, even in the presence of system noise. These experiments can be performed in an off-line mode to characterize the device's response for use when operating the device. Certain quality of service (QoS) performance metrics are selected to gauge the effect of changing a control factor, or design constraint. Anticipated use conditions, representing noise in the experiment, are factored into the experiments. The experiments are run resulting in a compilation of data that represents the effect on the QoS parameters as the control factors are varied, as well as the effect on power consumption. This data is analyzed to produce subsequent data typically in the form of plots and tables that describe how QoS varies as power consumption is varied, and vice versa.","A power management unit in the electronic device uses these QoS\/power consumption plots during operation to manage the device's power consumption. The power management unit operates according to a power management strategy that is either predetermined or designated by a user. The power management unit monitors the relevant QoS parameters and the power consumption status. Based on the QoS\/power consumption plots, generated in an off-line mode, the power management unit employs the selected strategy to vary a control factor to achieve a desired QoS or power consumption.","Alternatively, the QoS\/power consumption plots can be updated in an on-line mode by monitoring the real-time QoS and power consumption, and performing the experiments and subsequent data analysis while the device is operating based on the measured QoS and power consumption data. In this manner, an on-line control of the device is achieved.","Off-line power management typically is performed at either the design or manufacturing stages of development to provide a product with \u201cout of the box\u201d power management. For some products, such as pagers, non-configurable items, or items used by different people, this is the only practical type of power management available. Other products that have processing capability can be customized by the user using an on-line power management technique. On-line power management is performed continuously in the background, adjusting various controllable settings to minimize the power usage of the product.","Off-line power management is appropriate to determine the initial\/factory settings for power optimization for all products. For non user-configurable products, such as pagers or fire safety radios, where the user obtains equipment from a pool of radios, the off-line parameters would be used as the default power management settings and would be continuously monitored to provide either the best quality of service (QoS) or maximum battery life, depending upon the application.","In off-line power management, a series of analysis are performed that characterize the relationship between the static design parameters and desired output characteristics (e.g. QoS, power consumption, etc.). For battery powered devices these design parameters might include processor type, battery characteristics, RF settings, and option selection (back light, beep\/vibrate, auto power down, etc). Output characteristics include, but are not limited to battery life, quality of service, brightness, and other features available to the user.","Once the optimal design settings are determined they provided a fixed, but minimized, power profile.","On-line power management provides for continuous monitoring, optimization and updating of the design settings to minimize the in-use power consumption. Optimization of these settings is based on previously identified factory criteria, user preferences and actual in-use conditions. For example, in a personal digital assistant (PDA) design, the off-line experiments might determine that a light sensor has a significant effect on the back light power consumption. The online system would monitor not only this static level relationship but also would allow for the user to specify the amount of back light requirement for his or her particular comfort level. Thus, the user can choose the best quality of service for his or her particular environment. Having specified a particular user constraint, the system can vary other parameters to ensure the appropriate level of service. Various features can be disabled based on the user selections.","As another example, a laptop computer writing to disk consumes a great deal of power. The on-line power management technique monitors the battery usage and changes the caching technique to reduce disk access. Although this raises the risk of lost data, the user can select his or her level of risk, based on the criticality of information being stored.","In yet another example, military, police or fire protection radio users who are issued a radio for long term use typically want to set custom features that are unique for their application. Such users want to have pre-set frequencies and menus to reduce the time that the display is operational. How and when the display is powered down is a factor in the on-line power management. The user may require the device to remain powered on for an eight (8) hour operational mission, and that requirement would be a major factor in determining the QoS that can be delivered. For instance, the radio user might select a typical percentage of expected voice, video and data traffic. The on-line monitoring can alert the user if the pattern of use does not agree with the request, and optionally make run-time decisions to meet the required eight (8) hour mission. Thus, instead of running out of power unexpectedly, the device can adjust the QoS or alert the user as appropriate.","Cell phone users typically want to set custom features that are unique the user's preferred style of using the cell phone. For example, cell phone users typically want to set the update frequency for the voice mail or roaming ping messages to locate a nearby transmission tower. Using the power management techniques described here, the user can choose a longer acquisition time to provide longer battery life.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 1A","FIG. 1A"]},"The off-line adaptive power management system includes an off-line power management strategy analysis unit .

Each state disables certain functions of the DSP to reduce, by varying degrees, the power consumption of the DSP. By entering one of these power-down modes, the DSP will consume less than the amount of power consumed during normal operations. These power-down modes are often referred to as suspend modes or sleep modes. In this example, the DSP can be set to enter various dormant states by issuing, under software control, the instructions: IDLE_, IDLE_, or IDLE_ instructions.

In portable electronic devices that employ an liquid crystal display (LCD), a back light is often needed to enhance the readability of the display. However, using the back light can significantly decrease the life of batteries powering the device. Accordingly, users are often faced with a tradeoff in using the back light at the expense of depleting the charge on batteries that power the device.

The system is divided into two portions. The first is a design stage that relates to designing the power management strategies to be used in the device. It includes performing the offline power consumption\/QoS optimization experiments and generating the QoS and power consumption graphs or tables for use in adaptively controlling the device.","The second portion of the device includes the run-time processing components. This portion operates with the device to monitor the power consumption and certain QoS metrics. That information is used together with the power consumption\/QoS graphs generated offline to control the device based upon criteria a user designates as important, such as maximizing operation time, or ensuring a certain quality of service such as maintaining a certain degree of back light brightness.","Referring to , the design stage  includes performing optimization experiments  to optimize power consumption and quality of service measures. Examples of the type of optimization experiments are DOE experiments, Orthogonal Array experiments, Latin Square Design experiments, Taguchi style experiments, and full and fractional factorial style experiments, although it will be understood that other types of optimization experiments can be used. Prior to performing the experiments a power strategy designer must quantify static design constraints . At this stage, a designer determines the design constraints that can be used as control factors to the control the device to effect the appropriate quality of service. For example, design constraints, or control factors, that affect both power consumption and a quality of service parameter of interest are selected. In the example of the DSP, the design constraints that are chosen include the DSP's idle mode instructions and adjustable PLL clock speeds. Here, engineering judgement is exercised to select the most appropriate design constraints for the particular device to be controlled.","At stage , the designer specifies and quantifies anticipated user conditions. Here, the designer specifies how target users most likely will use the device in practice. For example, if the intended users primarily will be operating the device in a low-light environment, the designer can specify an anticipated use condition as one of a low-light environment.","In stage , the designer specifies and quantifies the appropriate quality of service and power performance metrics. Here, the designer identifies and characterizes the quality of service and power metrics according to an application of the device. For example, if the device is a radio for use in a military field operation, a long power life would be designated as having a high priority to ensure the radio can be powered while in the field for an extended period of time. However, the voice quality need only be set to have a discernable quality. Another application of the same radio might have different QoS and power performance metrics. For example, if the device is used in a firefighter's radio, long battery life extending over several days might not be as important as high voice quality.","These three inputs are supplied to the power\/QoS optimization experiments in stage . Here, any of a variety of well-known optimization experiments can be employed, such as Taguchi experiments; fractional factorial experiments; full factorial experiments; DOE experiments, Orthogonal Array experiments, Latin Square Design experiments, etc. The optimization experiments generate experimental data upon which a variance analysis  is performed, for use in characterizing the data. In stage  n-way plots and\/or tables are generated of the relation between the control factors and the QoS metrics, similar to the plot shown in . Similarly, in stage , the resulting data from the experiments is used to produce an n-way plot or table of the relation between the control factors and power consumption, similar to the plot shown in .","Stage  generates the QoS versus power consumption plot, and the power consumption versus QoS plots, such as the plots shown in , respectively, and , respectively.

Similarly, a smooth curve is fit to the data to characterize the QoS versus the power consumption plot and is made available in stage .","Based on the QoS and power consumption data generated in stage , default values of the power management design constraints are generated in stage .

This control also can be based upon other factors, such as the air humidity and the anticipated power loading to the power grid. Users who want to save money might choose to sacrifice comfort in exchange for cost savings during peak usage hours. By using an HVAC system controlled according to the techniques described here those tradeoffs can be accomplished in an automatic manner.","Lighting Systems","A lighting system can use motion sensors, such as those used in connection with the HVAC system described above, to provide an optimal lighting scenario based on individual desires. The lighting system, using the adaptive control techniques described here, adapts control of certain lights in the system by controlling the desired levels of light output for those lights with respect to, for example, time of day and room usage by the occupants.","Airline Jet Engines","An adaptive power management unit can use existing airframe sensors to optimize an airline engine's fuel efficiency. Based on speed, environment, altitude, range to touch down, the engine control system throttles and controls the engine using the techniques described here to maximize the QoS, such as the range to touch down, for example. Alternatively, if the QoS measure is passenger comfort, as might be expected for a corporate jet, the adaptive control techniques might alter altitude and speed to improve the quality of the ride.","Also, the jet engines can be controlled over heavily populated areas to minimize the noise pollution while maintaining the touch down time and passenger comfort. The controller would have information about the airplane's location due to onboard GPS equipment, for example, and would use software executing on a computerized controller to automatically minimize jet engine noise as it approached heavily populated areas. For instance, the Concorde can be controlled so that it does not reach supersonic speeds until it is located over the ocean due to the sonic booms that it creates as a result of its super-sonic speed.","Motors, Pumps, etc","Motors and pumps can be optimized to control flow with respect to energy draw. Various pump parameters can be controlled using the techniques described here to maintain laminar flow, continuous ramp up, and consistent volume. The advantage of such a system is that it is adaptable to the users' needs as opposed to being fixed for all users irrespective of any specific user's QoS requirements. Such a motor control system also can be adapted to other factors, such as rain flow. Over a heavy period of rain, it might be more important to pump the water to prevent flooding, regardless of the energy costs. The motor control system using the adaptive control techniques described here can be configured to adapt to those types of conditions.","Having described embodiments of devices, articles of manufacture and methods for adaptively controlling power management in devices, it is believed that other modifications, variations and changes will be suggested to those skilled in the art in view of the teachings set forth herein. It is therefore to be understood that all such variations, modifications and changes are believed to fall within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims. Although specific terms are employed herein, they are used in their ordinary and accustomed manner only, unless expressly defined differently herein, and not for purposes of limitation."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 1A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 2A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 2B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 3A","FIGS. 2A and 2B"],"b":["1","2","4","5","7","8","9"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 3B","FIG. 3A","FIGS. 2A and 2B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 3C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 3D","FIG. 3C"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIGS. 5A and 5B","FIG. 1B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIGS. 4"],"b":["5","5"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 7"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
