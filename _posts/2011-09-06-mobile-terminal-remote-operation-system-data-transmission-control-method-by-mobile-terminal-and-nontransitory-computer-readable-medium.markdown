With the use of a remote operation system, setting and operations of a user terminal (e.g., mobile telephone terminal, personal computer and the like) or an application program installed in the user terminal can be performed from the support terminal which is remotely located. Accordingly, a remote operation system can be used for a remote support in which an operator remotely located supports a user who is not familiar with operations of a mobile telephone terminal, a personal computer or the like. The term \u201cremote operation\u201d in this specification includes performing an input operation on a remote terminal which is remotely located, monitoring a display screen of a remote terminal which is remotely located, changing setting of a remote terminal which is remotely located, or transferring data to a memory of a remote terminal which is remotely located.","In the remote support, in order to allow a remote operation of a user terminal from an operator who is remotely located (hereinafter referred to as a supporter), a procedure to authenticate the supporter by a user is used. In this authentication procedure, the user is required to operate the user terminal to input information for authenticating the supporter, and to transmit this information to a server. This procedure for authenticating the supporter by the user is to ensure security for preventing such a situation in which an unspecified third party remotely operates the user terminal.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0005","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":"Patent Literature 1: Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2009-232359"}},"However, users who require the remote support are expected to have low information literacy. For starting a remote support, it is typically performed to demand explicit permission by a user regarding a remote operation of the user terminal in order to ensure the security. However, since the user and the supporter are remotely located with each other, the user has to perform terminal operations including user registration for a remote operation, and input and transmission of permission data to receive the remote support, in a state where the user does not directly meet the supporter. However, people having low information literacy may feel anxiety about such a terminal operation in a state where the user does not directly meet the supporter, which inhibits the spread of use of the remote support service. Further, an erroneous terminal operation by the user may cause a remote operation performed by a third party different from the supporter intended by the user.","The present invention has been made in order to solve the aforementioned problems, and aims to provide a mobile terminal, a remote operation system, a data transmission control method by a mobile terminal, and a program, that are capable of preventing an unintended remote operation due to an erroneous terminal operation by a user, and improving security when starting a remote operation.","In a first aspect of the present invention, a mobile terminal includes a telephone function unit, a transmission unit, and a restriction unit. The transmission unit is configured to transmit, to a mediation server, registration data regarding a remote operation of the mobile terminal from a support terminal. The restriction unit is configured to allow transmission of the registration data on a condition that the telephone function unit is performing a telephone call.","In a second aspect of the present invention, a remote operation system includes a user terminal, a support terminal, and a mediation server. The mediation server is configured to execute a registration procedure to start a remote operation of the user terminal from the support terminal. The user terminal includes a telephone function unit, and is configured to allow transmission of registration data, regarding the remote operation, from the user terminal to the mediation server on a condition that a telephone call is being performed by the telephone function unit.","In a third aspect of the present invention, a data transmission control method by a mobile terminal includes allowing transmission of registration data, regarding a remote operation of the mobile terminal with a support terminal, to a mediation server on a condition that telephone function means included in the mobile terminal is performing a telephone call.","In a fourth aspect of the present invention, a program causes a computer to execute the method according to the third aspect of the present invention described above.","According to aspects of the present invention stated above, it is possible to provide a mobile terminal, a remote operation system, a data transmission control method by a mobile terminal, and a program, that are capable of preventing an unintended remote operation due to an erroneous terminal operation by a user, and improving security when starting a remote operation.","In the following description, specific embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the drawings. Throughout the drawings, the same components are denoted by the same reference symbols, and overlapping description will be omitted as appropriate for the sake of clarification of description.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["1","3","1","3","2","1","5","6","5","3"]},"The mediation server  is connected to the user terminal  and the support terminal  via a network . The mediation server  mediates a remote operation of the user terminal  from the support terminal . More specifically, the mediation server  executes a procedure for registering the user terminal  prior to the start of a remote operation. The mediation server  may further execute a procedure for registering the support terminal . When the registration of the user terminal  is completed and the authentication of the support terminal  is successfully performed, the mediation server  relays data, regarding a remote operation, between the support terminal  and the user terminal . Any known procedure used in Internet services or the like to register and authenticate terminals or users thereof may be used as the registration procedure performed by the mediation server .","The network  is a data transfer network such as an IP network, and includes, for example, a radio access network and a packet core network of a mobile operator, an IP dedicated line, or a public Internet.","Further, the user terminal  according to this embodiment includes a function of suppressing transmission of registration data, regarding a remote operation of the user terminal  from the support terminal , to the mediation server . The registration data here may be any kind of data that the mediation server  needs to obtain from the user terminal  prior to the start of a remote operation of the user terminal  from the support terminal . The registration data includes, for example, user information associated with the user terminal  or the user. The user information may be any kind of information that can identify the user terminal  or the user. For example, the user information may be a host name set in the user terminal , an IP address of the user terminal , the name, a nickname, a telephone number, or an e-mail address of the user, or the combination thereof. The registration data may include supporter information associated with the supporter or the support terminal . For example, the supporter information may be a host name set in the support terminal , an IP address of the support terminal , the name, a nickname, a telephone number, or an e-mail address of the supporter, or the combination thereof. The registration data may include any kind of user verification information transmitted from the mediation server  to the user terminal  in advance, such as a confirmation code specified by the mediation server , a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) for user registration, a one-time password, or the like. The user verification information is information transmitted from the mediation server  to the user terminal  in association with the procedure for registering the user terminal . For example, it can be determined that the user has authenticated the supporter by a reply of the user verification information from the user terminal . In this case, the mediation server  may perform registration of the user terminal  for a remote operation upon receiving the reply of the user verification information from the user terminal .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["1","10","2"]},"An operation\/setting data reception unit  receives data regarding remote operation\/setting with the support terminal  via the mediation server , and performs an operation, configuration update or the like of the user terminal  based on this data. At the phase of executing a remote operation after completion of the registration of the user terminal  and the authentication of the support terminal , the user terminal  and the support terminal  may directly transmit and receive data regarding the remote operation\/setting each other without passing through the mediation server . Specifically, a connection (e.g., TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) connection) may be established between the user terminal  and the support terminal .","A registration restricting unit  allows transmission of the registration data to the mediation server  from the registration data transmission unit  on a condition that a telephone function unit  is executing a voice call. The registration restricting unit  may perform the operation according to a transmission instruction by the registration data transmission unit .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["14","10","14","15","14","11","14","12"]},"According to this embodiment, the user makes a telephone call (typically a telephone call with the supporter), and performs a terminal operation while verifying such as a voice of the supporter. In this way, according to this embodiment, it is possible to suppress such a situation where the terminal  is operated by a third party when the user terminal  is lost and transmission of the registration data for a remote operation is performed, and to improve the security. In particular, in the remote support, there are many cases that users ask supporters questions about operations\/settings by telephone, and the supporters start remote operations according to the questions. Further, the user may face such a situation at any time in which he\/she does not know which operation to perform. Thus, the request by the user for the support and a remote operation by the supporter in response to the request are often close in time. Accordingly, even when the transmission of the registration data that is required to start a remote operation is limited only to time during which a telephone call is performed, this would not cause any further inconvenience for the user.","As a variant example of this embodiment, when the registration data includes supporter information, the telephone number of the call destination may be automatically set to the supporter information. Accordingly, it is possible to eliminate the need of input by the user, and to avoid an input error.","Further, when the registration data includes the supporter information, if the telephone number included in the supporter information input by the user is different from the telephone number of the call destination, the registration restricting unit  may warn the user by warning display or warning sound using the output device (display, speaker or the like) included in the terminal . In this way, it is possible to reduce the probability that an erroneous telephone number is transmitted as the registration data.","Further, as a variant example of this embodiment, the telephone function unit  may support a videophone, and the registration restricting unit  may allow transmission of the registration data on a condition that a videophone call is being performed by the telephone function unit . According to such a variant example, the user is able to visually verify a face of a person on the call using the videophone, which makes it possible to further prevent an erroneous operation by the user and to improve the security.","The functions of the registration data transmission unit  and the registration restricting unit  of the user terminal  described in this embodiment may be implemented by causing a computer including a microprocessor or a CPU (Central Processing Unit) to execute one or a plurality of programs.","These programs can be stored and provided to a computer using any type of non-transitory computer readable media. Non-transitory computer readable media include any type of tangible storage media. Examples of non-transitory computer readable media include magnetic storage media (such as flexible disks, magnetic tapes, hard disk drives, etc.), optical magnetic storage media (e.g. magneto-optical disks), CD-ROM (Read Only Memory), CD-R, CD-R\/W, and semiconductor memories (such as mask ROM, PROM (Programmable ROM), EPROM (Erasable PROM), flash ROM, RAM (random access memory), etc.). The program may be provided to a computer using any type of transitory computer readable media. Examples of transitory computer readable media include electric signals, optical signals, and electromagnetic waves. Transitory computer readable media can provide the program to a computer via a wired communication line (e.g. electric wires, and optical fibers) or a wireless communication line.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["1","105","106","107","108","109","103","104","102","101","100","104","101","10","14","13","15","100","105","106","107"]},"In this embodiment, a variant example of a remote operation system according to the first embodiment of the present invention will be described.

In the registration procedure described in this embodiment, the mediation server  receives a registration data including user information and supporter information from the user terminal . The mediation server  stores the supporter information received from the user terminal  in association with the user information according to successful authentication of the support terminal . For example, the mediation server  may perform authentication of the support terminal  as follows. The mediation server  generates supporter verification information according to the reception of the supporter information, and transmits the supporter verification information to the support terminal  or an address that can be accessed from the support terminal . The supporter verification information is information transmitted from the mediation server  to the support terminal  in association with the procedure for registering the user terminal . The mediation server  may accept the connection from the support terminal , which has received the supporter verification information, to the mediation server , and compare information transmitted from the support terminal  after the connection with information determined from at least one of the supporter verification information, the user information, and the supporter information.","As a specific example, the mediation server  may perform authentication by receiving a reply of the correct supporter verification information from the support terminal  which has received the supporter verification information. Further, the mediation server  may receive personal information regarding the supporter from the support terminal  which has received the supporter verification information, and perform authentication according to match between this personal information and the personal information included in the supporter information received from the user terminal .","The supporter verification information may be, for example, a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) for registering the supporter or a one-time password. The transmission of the supporter verification information may be performed by transmitting an e-mail including the supporter verification information to an e-mail address of the supporter. For example, the mediation server  may authenticate the supporter (support terminal ) by accepting, on a Web browser function of the mediation server , an access using a Web browser program from the support terminal  to the URL for registering the supporter, and receiving personal information of the supporter from the support terminal .","In the following description, configuration examples of the user terminal , the mediation server , and the support terminal  according to this embodiment will be described in order.  is a block diagram showing a configuration example of the user terminal according to the third embodiment.

The address information is able to reach the user terminal  via the network . For example, the address information may be an IP address assigned to the user terminal . In this case, a source address of a data packet including the user information may be used as the address information. As stated in the first embodiment, it is only required that the user information is information with which the user terminal  or the user can be identified.","The supporter information transmission unit  transmits to the mediation server  the supporter information associated with the support terminal  or the supporter which the user requests support by a remote operation. The supporter information may be transmitted together with the user information described above. It is only required that the supporter information is information with which the support terminal  or the supporter can be identified.
