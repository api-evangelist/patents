title: Apparatus and methods for managing network resources
abstract: Apparatus and methods are provided for managing network resources. A central unified services and device management framework is operated to simultaneously manage various types of resources on behalf of multiple organizations. Within the framework, a common management layer provides services (e.g., account management, event logging) common to multiple different services and devices. Within a specific management layer, separate subsystems are implemented for different devices or types of devices. The device-specific subsystems invoke device-independent functional modules through primitives exposed by the common management layer. A given organization may establish tiered logical constructs to group resources deployed at different physical locations (e.g., cities, offices) or within different subdivisions of the organizations (e.g., subsidiaries, departments).

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present application is related to co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/577,684, entitled \u201cApparatus and Methods for Protecting Network Resources\u201d, which was filed Oct. 12, 2009 and is incorporated herein by reference.","This invention relates to the fields of computer systems. More particularly, apparatus and methods are provided for virtualized and centralized management of network devices and\/or services.","The level of knowledge needed to effectively configure and operate computer system networks can be quite high. Large organizations typically maintain relatively large IT (Information Technology) staffs to configure and maintain equipment, assist users with operation of their equipment, apply security policies, monitor network security, etc. However, some organizations, particularly those that are smaller, cannot afford sufficient experienced full-time IT staff for performing all of these functions, and whoever may be tasked with IT responsibilities within such an organization may be unprepared for the myriad problems and challenges that may arise.","For example, securing an organization's network resources from unauthorized access is a critical task that can easily be performed in an incomplete or ineffective manner. Due to the complexity of the problem, the lack of effectiveness may not be apparent to the organization until the network has been breached. The amount of data stored electronically is prodigious and grows daily, and makes network security all the more important.","One reason it can be difficult to adequately secure network resources is the tension between the need to permit legitimate use of the resources without unreasonable difficulty, and the desire to prevent all illegitimate use. This tension increases as the number and type of resources deployed within an organization increases.","Each new type of resource may be configured in a different way to access permitted resources, apply a desired level of security, etc. Securing an organization's network resources is just one of many tasks and, without adequate IT staffing, this task may receive short shrift in the face of users' demands for real-time assistance. Thus, configuring and monitor network security must compete with tasks such as helping users configure their equipment for use within the organization.","Configuration of resources may be particularly difficult for an organization that employs multiple different types of equipment. In particular, a small organization that is cost-conscious may purchase the least expensive equipment for a particular operation, which may lead to a hodgepodge of components from different vendors and manufacturers. Thus, the organization may deploy multiple access points, switches or other communication components produced by different manufacturers.","Each different type or model of equipment typically has different configurable parameters or parameters that are configured in different manners. Although some parameters and methods of configuration may be identical across different devices, others will differ. Without sufficient familiarity or expertise in network components, an individual may easily configure a component incorrectly or waste time determining the correct configuration.","Some organizations choose to use automated provisioning to prepare new devices for use within their network. However, if an organization's security policies do not encompass the equipment for performing automated provisioning, or are not applied correctly during provisioning of the device, security vulnerabilities may be introduced into an organization along with the new device. Or, if the provisioning is performed in a haphazard or hurried manner, security policies may not be applied correctly or completely.","In addition, even after a given network component is initially configured, some parameters may need to be changed or updated as an organization's network evolves. Regular attention to the myriad network resources that may be deployed within an organization may be unrealistic, for an organization having a limited IT staff.","Existing solutions for managing an organization's networked devices and services tend to do so only for a single device or a single service. With no third party solutions to a small organization's need to manage multiple types of devices and\/or multiple network services, the organization is left to do so as best it can.","Thus, configuration of components to securely and effectively operate within an organization's network can be difficult and time-consuming. And, even after the components are successfully integrated into the network and the organization's security policies, they need to be managed on an on-going basis to allow the network to function well.","In some embodiments of the invention, apparatus and methods are provided for providing unified management of an organization's network devices and services, to cover configuration, deployment, operation and\/or other tasks as needed. One or more multiple organizations' resources may be managed by one entity.","In these embodiments, a unified services and devices management system is provided for managing the configuration, deployment and operation of physical devices and\/or specific electronic services. Multiple types of devices\/services may be managed, as well as multiple models or versions of a particular device type.","In some embodiments of the invention, tiered administrative or managerial domains are constructed to facilitate management of devices and\/or services within different locations or divisions of one organization, or within different organizations. Using these domains, responsibility for managing devices and\/or services can be delegated to various operators or managers.","The following description is presented to enable any person skilled in the art to make and use the invention, and is provided in the context of a particular application and its requirements. Various modifications to the disclosed embodiments will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, and the general principles defined herein may be applied to other embodiments and applications without departing from the scope of the present invention. Thus, the present invention is not intended to be limited to the embodiments shown, but is to be accorded the widest scope consistent with the principles and features disclosed herein.","In some embodiments of the invention, apparatus and methods are provided for centrally and virtually managing an organization's network resources. The centralized management is performed \u201cin the cloud\u201d without requiring dedicated management resources on the part of the organization.","More particularly, a management facility may be engaged by one or more organizations to manage their resources. For each organization, the facility maintains separate per-organization PKIs (Public Key Infrastructures) for securing access to each organization's network.","The facility receives and establishes connections with a myriad number of types and models of network equipment, such as access points, switches, routers, network-attached storage, and so on. In addition to promoting centralized and virtual management of a variety of devices, the facility can also be used to manage services offered within an organization's network.","Communications between the facility and a particular device or service transit a multi-layer framework. A received communication is normalized before being delivered to a specific management layer adapted to work with the service or the type\/model of equipment that originated the communication. That layer invokes a common management layer to accomplish a particular function (e.g., retrieve a security policy, log an event, access an account parameter).","The multi-layer framework thus allows management of multiple services and various types and models of network devices with a common set of functional modules. As an organization develops its network, the framework is able to continue effectively managing the network regardless of the mix of components.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"Central management facility  of  includes communication module(s) , common management layer (CML) , one or more specific management layer (SML) subsystems , optional user interface  and any number of device-independent functional modules . Any number of organizations may subscribe to the management services offered by the central management facility. The various modules of central management facility  may comprise hardware and\/or software elements, and may operate within one or more cooperating or peer computer servers.","Not shown in  are one or more storage components of facility  (e.g., disks), which may be used to store device parameters, event logs, policies, digital certificates and any other data that is described herein.","Devices that facility  may centrally manage illustratively include wireless access points, routers, switches, network-attached storage devices, computing devices (e.g., notebook computers, workstations), and so on. Services managed by the facility may include wireless (and\/or wired) network services, protection against viruses and\/or other malware, network data storage, etc.","Central management of these device and service resources at a location remote from the organization alleviates the individual organizations from having to dedicate its own equipment and time to such activity. Management of an organization's resources may include such responsibilities as facilitating configuration or re-configuration, deployment and\/or operation of the resources, application of a security policy, supervision of PKI certificates, user account management, user\/device authentication, context-aware logging, device\/service inventory, etc.","In the illustrated embodiments of the invention, individual resources within an organization's network are able to communicate with one or more communication modules . A communication module may be configured to receive connections via HTTP (Hypertext Transport Protocol), HTTPS (Hypertext Transport Protocol Secure), SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) and\/or other communication protocols. Thus, different communication modules may receive different types of connections, from the same or different types of devices.","A communication from an organization resource is passed from a communication module  to common management layer (CML)  in a standard format. For example, a message may comprise a header portion configured to identify a device from which the message was received\u2014possibly a particular device (e.g., including manufacturer, model and version), a general type of device (e.g., a network attached storage server), a specific type of device (e.g., Linksys wireless access point), a particular network service, etc.","A payload portion of the message may identify the resource's request or input. For example, the device or service may request operating parameters, a security policy, or some other information.","Common Management Layer  receives incoming messages from an organization's network resources, dispatches messages to the resources, provides an interface between device-independent functional modules  and both specific management layer subsystems  and user interface , and\/or performs other duties. The CML defines management attributes and services that apply system-wide, while SML subsystems  work with specific devices and network services.","CML  may also facilitate operation and maintenance of separate PKIs for each organization client of the central management facility. A \u201csecurity\u201d or \u201cPKI\u201d device-independent functional module  may assist the CML in this role, or actually perform the role itself.","More particularly, for each organization client, the central management facility maintains a root Certificate Authority (CA) that anchors a PKI specific to that organization. The root CA can issue certificates for resources operating within the organization's network, and\/or may issue one or more sub-root CA certificates to allow some of those resources (e.g., access points) to issue organization certificates to resource. The latter scheme allows new devices to be provisioned even if central management facility  is not currently available (e.g., in case the organization's internet access is disrupted).","Specific management layer subsystems  are associated with specific network devices, types of devices, or services. The device and service management subsystems adhere to a set of plug-in guidelines for providing specific management features. A registration process permits management subsystems to plug into the framework.","For example, a device-oriented SML subsystem may be implemented for one or more particular types of devices (e.g., access point, network attached storage server), models of a device (e.g., Linksys access point, Netgear access point), etc. A particular SML subsystem  is therefore adapted or configured to work with its associated network device(s), by setting or adjusting parameters of the device(s), logging events detected by the device(s), etc.","As for service-oriented SML subsystems, a WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network) management SML subsystem may offer management features such as an RF (radio frequency) coverage map, RF management, bandwidth assessment, radio transmit power adjustment, guest access policy features, detection of rogue access points, etc. A VPN (Virtual Private Network) SML subsystem may offer encryption methods, access policies and so on. Both service SMLs, however, call upon the same functional modules .","A new SML subsystem is registered with CML  via a registration API (Application Programming Interface) exposed by the CML. This allows the CML to know which SML subsystem to turn to for interaction with a particular network component.","When an SML subsystem  receives a message from a network device (via CML ), it determines what action or actions need to be taken and calls other appropriate APIs of the CML in order to invoke the appropriate device-independent function module(s) . The SML thus only needs to issue primitives to the CML to instigate its desired action. As a result, individual SML subsystems need not be programmed with all the hooks and entry points into the various functional modules\u2014only the CML needs these features.","Therefore, one difference between CML  and an SML subsystem  is that the CML defines management attributes and parameters that are applicable throughout the framework, while SML subsystems  define attributes and parameters that are specific to their associated devices and\/or services.","Illustratively, CML  accepts device\/service configuration requests (e.g., via user interface ), parses the requests and routes them to the corresponding SML subsystem . Any attributes or configuration parameters that must be passed to a specific device or network service are forwarded by the device's or service's SML subsystem, through the CML. Similarly, operational statistics, events and\/or other information are reported by specific devices\/services to their SML subsystems, via the CML.","Configuration records are versioned and stored at facility  (e.g., within SML subsystems and\/or functional modules), and a device's firmware can be automatically upgraded to a latest or specified version, or may be rolled back to a previous version. For example, in case of a fatal defect in a new firmware version or set of parameters, a device may be rolled back to default (e.g., factory) settings, or a last known good set of parameters may be applied.","Optional user interface  may be used to receive interactive communication sessions from representatives (e.g., system managers, administrators) of client organizations. For example, the user interface may comprise a web page from which an organization can subscribe to the facility's services, register equipment, purchase network components, etc.","In some embodiments of the invention, user interface  accesses device-independent functional modules  via CML , in order to create an account for an organization, register the organization's network resources, configure or store a security policy, review or retrieve logged events, etc. In other embodiments, the user interface may access the functional modules directly (e.g., without invoking the common management layer). Similarly, to effect action for a particular device or type of device, user interface  may interact directly with an SML subsystem (or interact via CML ).","In some embodiments of the invention, user interface  may be omitted or may be subsumed into another module (e.g., common management layer ). Illustratively, in these embodiments an organization may interact with central management facility  via an application program operating on a computing device, via a configuration utility of a network resource, or some other communication conduit other than a web page or other central, dedicated user interface. For example, CML  may publicly expose APIs for account creation\/management, configuring organization resources, and so on, and allow third-parties to provide software for invoking those APIs.","Device-independent functional modules  provide functionality that is common to multiple devices, types of devices and\/or organizations. For each organization, a separate set of data may be maintained regarding the organization's network, users, devices and services. Because separate PKI schemes are maintained for each organization, and each user\/device\/service of an organization must authenticate itself to the facility, each organization's data is protected against access by other organizations.","Policies module may be configured to store various security policies, firewall policies and\/or other operating policies that an organization may wish to apply to some or all of its devices and\/or services. A given policy may specify times\/days that particular components can or cannot operate, how an organization's access points are to be logically configured, which devices may be used with a particular service, etc.","Another illustrative policy for an organization may provide that if a particular network device connects to management facility  after it was reported as lost, stolen or compromised, the device is refused access. Further, the policy may specify that the device should be instructed to wipe (delete) its configuration data, which will make it unusable. The device may be identified by a digital certificate, serial number, MAC address or other identifier.","Yet another policy may be applied to set a topology of an organization's network. For example, if the organization employs multiple wireless access points, only one of them may be coupled to the Internet (or other external network). A policy may specify which access points can talk to which other access points. A policy for configuring the access points topology may be selected based on the types\/models of access points, their loads (e.g., number of client devices that connect to them) and\/or other factors.","Logging module is configured to contextually log events reported by organization's network resources. Thus, this module may record login\/logout times of users, security alerts, virus detections, use of a device\/service and so on. The logging module may offer text-based searching of device\/service logs, contextual hypertext capability and\/or other features. For example, a MAC address or other identifier (e.g., serial number, IP address) reported in a log may be clickable and lead to a management page showing further information of the logged event, a page for taking corrective or remedial action, etc.","Thus, a device MAC address reported on a rogue access point log can be selected to navigate to a rogue access point management page within the central management framework, while a MAC address reported in a guest logon event log may be used to navigate to a guest access management page.","Accounts module is configured to maintain organizations' and users' accounts. Thus, for each organization, one or more login accounts may be assigned to allow users and resources of that organization to access central management facility .","Security module is configured to help secure organizations' networks. For example, the security module may manage the organizations' PKIs and be responsible for authenticating users\/devices, issuing digital certificates within a PKI, etc.","To add a new functional module , only CML  needs to be programmed with the entry points, APIs or other methods of invoking the module. The CML will then publish the module's APIs or otherwise make the module's functionality available to SML subsystems .","Because the framework may be used to manage multiple organizations' networks, each organization registers its devices with device identifications (Dev_ID) and\/or group identifications that identify a set of the organizations' devices (Grp_ID). The registration process may be combined with a system for ordering network resources so that, for example, a particular Grp_ID could comprise a purchase order under which a set of devices was purchased.","When a purchased device is connected to an organization's network, it establishes a secure connection to central management facility  and presents its Dev_ID. The framework (e.g., an SML subsystem for the device) authenticates the device, binds it to the organization and downloads configuration data to the device. In some embodiments, devices shipped to the organization are preloaded with security credentials.","In other embodiments, an administrator within the organization may place a newly connected device on a list of devices pending approval to operate within the organization's network. Once the administrator accepts the device, it is then bound to the organization.","A device may have to initiate a network connection to facility  through a firewall. In this case, a preloaded security credential in the device can be used to establish a suitable secure connection, such as with secure hypertext transport protocol (HTTPS).","In some cases, a User Datagram Protocol (UDP) based heartbeat mechanism can be established to keep a communication channel open, at a firewall, between a device and the framework. The device periodically sends a heartbeat message over a UDP connection to facility . The heartbeat serves to advise the framework of the device's status and to keep the firewall open. Whenever central management facility  has some information for the device, it can send a short command over this UDP channel to instruct the device to establish another data channel to exchange additional information.","It is possible for a device to be deployed before the organization is created or registered at facility  or before the device's Dev_ID has been registered to the organization. In this case, the device may attempt multiple times to contact the facility.","Once a device has been authenticated and accepted into an organization with the framework, the framework retrieves corresponding device configuration and system policies and downloads them to the device. After the configurations and policies are implemented, the device enters normal operation state and starts providing its services.","In some embodiments of the invention, an organization may define one or more logical constructs associated with different offices or locations of a company, different companies within a conglomerate, different customers of one management provider, etc.","For example, when an organization subscribes to central management facility , it may specify that the organization operates three discrete offices (e.g., in different cities, with different internal networks). For each office, the organization may specify particular operating parameters for some or all devices at that location\u2014such as an SSID (Service Set Identification or Service Set Identifier) of its wireless network, a preferred security protocol for wireless devices, a routing table, addresses of preferred DNS (Domain Name Service) servers, etc. Subsequently, for a new network component assigned to that office, the specified parameters will be automatically applied, without anyone having to specifically associate the parameters with the new device.","Illustratively, the term \u201csite\u201d may be used herein to refer to a collection of parameters to be assigned to all relevant resources of an organization's network deployed within an office, branch, outlet or other location associated with the \u201csite.\u201d Above the site level, other logical constructs may be defined.","For example, just as multiple \u201csites\u201d may be defined, multiple logical \u201corganizations\u201d may be defined to pertain to different parts (e.g., divisions, departments, subsidiaries) of a multi-organizational entity (e.g., a conglomerate). If not part of a larger entity, an \u201corganization\u201d represents a discrete organization (e.g., one client of central management facility ).","In the same manner that operating parameters and data defined for a \u201csite\u201d construct are inherited by any compatible devices or components assigned to that site, so too parameters and data defined for an \u201corganization\u201d construct may be inherited by any subordinate sites. Thus, by the time an individual device or service is added to an organization's network, most or all operating parameters may already be defined. If those parameters are complete, no time or effort need be dedicated to determining the appropriate configuration of the new device or service.","An even higher level logical entity such as a \u201cmanager\u201d may be defined for an entity that is hired by multiple discrete organizations to manage their networks. Specifically, a \u201cmanager\u201d entity may represent a company or contractor hired by multiple organizations to manage their \u201corganization\u201d entities (and, by extension, any \u201csites\u201d within those organizations).","An organization may change managers, in which case the previous \u201cmanager\u201d entity loses the ability to access the organization's \u201corganization\u201d entity or entities, in favor of the new \u201cmanager\u201d. For example, any digital certificates issued to computer systems controlled by the old manager may be revoked, thereby preventing those systems from accessing the organization's network. In some embodiments of the invention, an organization always possesses the ability to manage its network (even if a separate \u201cmanager\u201d has been hired), and can assign that role to another entity or fire an existing \u201cmanager.\u201d","Thus, account management within central management facility  may be hierarchical to allow a single operator to manage one or more organizations. For example, the operator may be an employee of a single organization, or represent an entity that manages multiple organizations' networks.","A management\/organization account for an organization within facility  may therefore serve as a system management center for the configuration and\/or monitoring of the organization's network devices and services. An operator managing multiple organizations\/sites can open multiple instances to monitor or work within more than one organization\/site at a time, with the individual instances acting as dashboards and launch pads to assist their monitoring and configuration activities.","In order for an organization to allow another entity to exercise administration rights over its network resources, the organization may initiate a request to share the organization's administration with the entity. Only the organization itself can elect to share administration rights; the receiving organization cannot further share those rights. The organization terminates the arrangement by initiating a termination request.","In order for a new device or service of an organization's network to automatically interact with central management facility  to retrieve configuration parameters, it may be manufactured or configured to automatically request or determine a location (e.g., a Uniform Resource Locator or URL) from which it can obtain such information. For example, a particular firmware parameter of a device may be set to cause the device to automatically contact a specified entity (e.g., management facility ) or to request (at startup) a URL or other address of an entity from which it can receive configuration data. This parameter may be named \u201cEnable Network\u201d or \u201cReceive Remote Configuration\u201d or anything else.","When a device or service contacts the specified or identified entity, it will identify itself (e.g., model of equipment, version, serial number, MAC address, service name\/identifier) and possibly deliver a digital certificate it possesses. After being authenticated and confirmed as an authorized component of the organization's network, it will receive and apply a set of parameters.","As described above, even though central management facility  of  may be employed to manage multiple organizations' network within the same overall framework, strict access policies and data isolation prevent data migration between organizations. Specifically, per-organization PKIs are established to protect each organization's resources. Each organization has a root certificate authority at the facility, and subordinate certificate authorities and authenticators within the organization's network perform local client access authentication and enforcement of access policies.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0077"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},"In these embodiments, a unified services and device framework comparable to central management facility  of  provides to multiple organizations services such as user account management, user and device authentication, context-aware logging of events, device inventory, firmware management, PKI management\/administration, etc.","As described above, separate specific management layer subsystems are implemented to support different services, specific devices and\/or types of devices. Each such subsystem adheres to a set of plug-in standards for interfacing with a common management layer and thereby accessing device-independent functional modules. Additional device-specific subsystems may be added as needed to support additional devices or services.","In operation , an organization subscribes to the central facility's unified services and device management. Illustratively, the organization (e.g., a system administrator) may connect to a user interface at a computer server operated by the facility to submit a subscription request.","Alternatively, the organization (e.g., a network administrator) may execute an application or utility that automatically interfaces with the facility and provides the same or similar functionality as a dedicated user interface.","In operation , an account for the organization is configured to identify the organization, create one or more user accounts, identify devices presently deployed in the organization's network, identify specific services required by the organization, etc.","Operation  may entail defining multiple logical \u201csites\u201d and\/or \u201corganizations\u201d to allow for more particularized management of the organization's resources. As described above, different \u201csite\u201d constructs may correspond to different branches, offices or other locations of the organization, while different \u201corganization\u201d constructs may correspond to different divisions, subsidiaries, organizational units or other portions of the organization.","In operation , the organization purchases some number of resources (e.g., wireless LAN controllers, access points, network-attached storage units). The resources may be purchased from an operator of the central facility or some other source. Advantageously, however, the vendor may be authorized and equipped to pre-load the resources with security credentials that are sufficient to allow the resources to make initial contact with the central facility after they are connected to the organization's network.","Alternatively, a configuration device or utility (e.g., a client device enabler) may be provided with (or separate from) the purchased resources, and may be used to configure the resources for operation within the organization. This configuration effort may include loading security credentials.","Even though the organization will deploy multiple different devices and services, they will all be manageable through the central facility.","In operation , a set of operating parameters for some of or all the purchased network resources is submitted to the framework by the organization. Depending on the level of knowledge of the organization's representative performing this operation, that person may specify exact parameters for one or more devices or may allow the facility to determine suitable parameters.","For example, the representative may state that data security is very important to the organization, in which case the facility may select a more robust security protocol and a more stringent access control policy for the organization's wireless resources than it would if security were less of a concern. Similarly, the facility may select different operating policies, logging requirement and\/or other settings depending on the representative's input. Different templates may be applied to implement different sets of parameters.","As part of operation , configuration data specified by the organization representative and\/or selected by the facility for the devices\/services identified by the representative are parsed by the facility's central management layer (CML) and routed to the appropriate specific management layer (SML) subsystem. The SML may save the data within the subsystems or via one or more appropriate device-independent functional modules. These SML subsystems will be responsible for issuing the device configuration information to the organization's network resources.","One configuration effort the facility may perform is to load a security credential (e.g., a digital certificate) on a device prior to shipment to the organization and deployment within the organization's network. To facilitate initial deployment of some network devices (e.g., access points, client device enablers), the devices may be configured with a security credential issued within a PKI associated with the central management facility (e.g., instead of a PKI of the organization). After the devices are deployed, they may interact with the facility and receive new security credentials generated within the organization's PKI.","In operation , a device is deployed and connected to the organization's network. As part of its startup and configuration, the device establishes a secure connection (e.g., via https) with the facility, identifies itself (e.g., with a device ID, a MAC address) and may authenticate itself using a security credential preloaded onto the device.","In some embodiments, a client device enabler or other entity employed to configure a new device may help establish the initial connection to the facility.","If the device is accepted as valid (e.g., the facility may maintain a list of device IDs valid for the organization), it is bound to the organization. Then, configuration parameters, system policies, firmware and\/or other information for the device are downloaded and applied. As described above, the configuration parameters may be specified exactly by an organization representative, may be selected by the facility and\/or may be inherited from a \u201csite\u201d or \u201corganization\u201d logical construct.","In operation , the device is configured with policies and configuration parameters, and can begin normal operation within the organization's network. As described previously, these policies, attributes and parameters may be provided by device-independent functional modules and disseminated to specific devices and different types of devices by corresponding specific management layer subsystems.","In operation , during operation of the device, it submits contextual log events to the management framework. The events are transmitted to the framework via a communication module and a common management layer before being delivered to an SML subsystem associated with the device. That device then invokes functions\/services of a logging module via the common management layer. The logging module can thus log events for multiple different devices within the organization's network.","In some embodiments of the invention, a central management facility exposes RESTful APIs\u2014APIs that conform to the Representational State Transfer architecture. This allows easy retrieval of information from the facility\u2014such as network traffic statistics, radio signal coverage, etc.","A method such as that described in conjunction with  may be used to manage a device such as a WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network) controller. The controller acts as a centralized management point for some or all of an organization's access points (APs), and may be a dedicated device or may be embedded in another appliance (e.g., an Ethernet switch).","Illustratively, it provides AP management, user management, RF (Radio Frequency) management, WLAN access policy management, and so on. The WLAN controller is tied to a unified services and device management framework (e.g., facility  of ) via a WLAN specific management layer subsystem.","The common management layer of the framework provides common services such as user account management, client device provisioning, access policies, etc. The WLAN subsystem within the specific management layer of the framework provides device-specific services, such as rogue AP detection, RF management, WLAN bandwidth access assessment, AP configuration and monitoring, etc.","Once the WLAN controller subsystem is registered within the framework, it is available to all subscribers (e.g., not just the organization that first deployed a WLAN controller). For each subscriber, a separate WLAN controller services instance is created and added to the subscriber's account. Once the service is no longer needed, the instance can be destroyed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0102","num":"0101"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},"Management server  comprises communication mechanism(s) , common management mechanism , specific management mechanism(s) , functional mechanism(s) , and storage mechanism(s) . Any or all of these mechanisms may be combined or subdivided in other embodiments of the invention.","Communication mechanism(s)  are adapted to exchange communications with network devices (e.g., access points, network attached servers, switches). A communication mechanism may comprise or be coupled to a user interface manipulable to facilitate access to the management server.","Common management mechanism  is adapted to provide central management functions of management server .
