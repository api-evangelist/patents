{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATION","GOVERNMENT INTERESTS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application claims priority benefit of U.S. provisional patent application No. 60\/520,839 filed on Nov. 17, 2003.","This invention was made with government support under contract number W31PHQ04CR164, awarded by the United States Department of Defense. The government has certain rights in this invention.","This invention relates to improved current collection for solid oxide fuel cells and more particularly, to current collection for solid oxide fuel cells of lightweight design.","A solid oxide fuel cell (SOFCs) is a type of fuel cell which reacts a fuel gas with an oxidant to generate DC electric current. SOFCs comprises an anode, an electrolyte and a cathode, and have been made from a variety of materials and in a variety of geometries. Fuel processing is required to render hydrocarbon fuels (such as propane, butane, etc.) suitable for SOFCs. For example, known designs for fuel processors include those done with a separate external reactor where a catalytic substrate processes a hydrocarbon fuel such as butane (CH), propane (CH) or diesel fuel (JP-8 or JET-A) to a suitable fuel gas such containing carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H). CO and Hydrogen gas are then oxidized at an active area of a SOFC to carbon dioxide and water, with DC current generated. Non hydrocarbon fuels such as ammonia (NH) can also be transformed into SOFC fuel using one or more catalytic reactions.","Current collectors are used on known SOFCs to collect electric current generated by the fuel cell. Good electrical conductance is important for increasing recovery of the electrical energy generated by the fuel cell. However, the harsh environment of a fuel cell can make current collection difficult. Fuel cell current collectors must be chemically and thermally robust, as they are exposed to oxidative stresses, reductive stresses, and operating temperatures in the range of about 500-950\u00b0 C. Known current collectors used in tube-shaped SOFC designs include the so-called \u201cWestinghouse\u201d design where a strip of a lanthanum-chromite ceramic runs along the length of the fuel cell, and a nickel felt electrically connects an electrode of one tube to an electrode of another tube. This design is disadvantageous for several reasons, including the expense of the ceramic, the fact it is a relatively low strength and brittle material, and that each tube must be rigidly connected to its adjacent tube. Portable fuel cell designs can be subject to physical stresses and shocks, etc., and low strength, brittle materials are ill suited for such use.","It has also been known to use silver wires as current collectors, as they are capable of operating in high temperatures and are resistant to oxidation. Known designs have used silver wire wrapped around the cathode of a tubular SOFC in a spiral fashion. Such spiral wires, however, do not make reliable electric contacts as they can move with respect to the tube. This is true even if tightly attached when assembled, as elastically tight fits are relaxed at the high operating temperatures of fuel cells.","It would be desirable to provide a solid oxide fuel cell with a current collector of a simple, lightweight design which is also robust in construction and capable of withstanding thermal cycling and expected physical stresses.","In accordance with a first aspect, a solid oxide fuel cell stack comprises a plurality of tubes, each having an anode, electrolyte and cathode. Anode and cathode current collectors are mounted on the tubes. The anode current collector electrically connects to the anode and can have a contact with the anode. The cathode current collector electrically connects to the cathode and can have a contact with the cathode. An electrically conductive sealant may be positioned between the anode of one tube and the cathode current collector of another tube.","It should be understood that the appended drawings are not necessarily to scale, presenting a somewhat simplified representation of various preferred features illustrative of the basic principles of the invention. The specific design features of the solid fuel cell as disclosed here, including, for example, specific dimensions of the catalytic substrate will be determined in part by the particular intended application and use environment. Certain features of the illustrated embodiments have been enlarged or distorted relative to others for visualization and clear understanding. In particular, thin features may be thickened, for example, for clarity of illustration. All references to direction and position, unless otherwise indicated, refer to the orientation of the solid state electrochemical device illustrated in the drawings.","It will be apparent to those skilled in the art, that is, to those who have knowledge or experience in this area of technology, that many uses and design variations are possible for the fuel cells disclosed herein. The following detailed discussion of various alternative and preferred features and embodiments will illustrate the general principles of the invention with reference to current collection for use with a solid oxide fuel cell (\u201cSOFC\u201d). Other embodiments suitable for other applications will be apparent to those skilled in the art given the benefit of this disclosure.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","10","30","28","24","26","20","22","12","14"]},"The SOFC  generates significant heat during operation (on the order of 600-950\u00b0 C.) and is preferably mounted within the thermal enclosure . The SOFC is most efficient at these high temperatures, and therefore several design features have been incorporated to heat incoming fuel gas and incoming air at the thermal enclosure .  shows a schematic of the thermal enclosure of . The air pump pumps air from a cold air inlet  to a recuperator . The recuperator is essentially a heat exchanger which transfers some of the heat from exhaust to the incoming air supplied to the cathode. Ambient air for fuel processing is supplied to mix with the fuel in a fuel air mixer  in a predetermined ratio, preferably having a sub-stoichiometric quantity of oxygen so that processing of the fuel gas takes place at the catalytic substrate  as described in greater detail below. Processing is understood here to mean conversion of a fuel to a processed gas which can be used by the SOFC , typically containing carbon monoxide and hydrogen gas. The heated air circulates along the active area and participates in electrochemically transforming the fuel gas into electricity and exhaust gases.","The fuel-air mixture is introduced into the thermal enclosure through a series of tubes . The actual number of tubes depends in part on the desired power output of the SOFC. A plurality of tubes is preferably mounted on a manifold . As seen in , each tube  has an interior  and an exterior . Preferably an anode material is positioned on the interior, and an electrolyte  exteriorly surrounds the anode. The entire tube  may have an interior layer of anode and a layer of electrolyte circumferentially surrounding the anode, so that the anode is remote from the exterior  of the tube and the electrolyte is remote from the interior  of the tube. A cathode is positioned around the exterior  of the tube , defining an active area , also preferably remote from the interior of the tube. The anode and electrolyte may be formed together by coextrusion; alternatively, the anode may be formed first and the electrolyte and cathode added in later steps.","Fuel gas flows from the manifold , then to the catalytic substrate , and then to the active area  within each tube. The catalytic substrate may be positioned immediately preceding (in terms of fuel gas flow) the active area and within the thermal enclosure so that heat generated at the catalytic substrate helps preheat the fuel gases. That is, air from air inlet  passes through the recuperator  and is heated by an exhaust stream of gases moving separately through the recuperator. For further heating, the air travels through an air inlet tube  past the active areas  of the fuel cells to an area generally adjacent the catalytic substrates . Residual oxygen in the heated inlet air is used to completely combust any residual fuel in the exhaust stream at the burner region . A catalytic element may be positioned at the burner region to help with combustion. Once the reaction is complete, exhaust gas is routed through exhaust tube , through the recuperator , and out of the thermal enclosure. Thus, the major inlets and outlets to the thermal enclosure are air inlet , fuel gas inlet , and exhaust gas outlet .","Such fuel cell designs are advantageously relatively light in weight, and provide good power density to mass ratios. As an example of a lightweight design each tube  can comprise a 1 mm-20 mm diameter tube. Thin, lightweight tubes are also advantageous in that the tubes hold less heat, allowing the fuel cell to be heated rapidly. The tubes preferably have at least three layers, an inner layer of anode, a middle layer of electrolyte, and an outer layer of cathode. The anode comprises, for example, a porous cermet of nickel and yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ). The electrolyte can comprise a thin membrane of YSZ. The cathode can comprise, for example, a porous lanthanum strontium manganate (LSM). An example of a suitable fuel cell tube shaped anode, electrolyte and cathode is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,749,799 to Crumm et al, entitled METHOD FOR PREPARATION OF SOLID STATE ELECTROCHEMICAL DEVICE and hereby incorporated by reference. Other material combinations for the anode, electrolyte and cathode, as well as other cross section geometries (triangular, square, polygonal, etc.) will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art given the benefit of this disclosure.","Anode and cathode current collectors ,  may be mounted within and around the tubes , respectively, preferably at or near the active area  to capture electric current generated when the fuel gases traveling inside the tubes  are electrochemically reacted with oxidant gases outside the tubes (). Extending along the length of the tube  along its interior  is the anode , and extending circumferentially around the anode  is the electrolyte . Advantageously, the cathode  need only be positioned at the active area , shown in  positioned circumferentially around at least part of the tube. The catalytic substrate  is positioned within the tube and spaced upstream (as defined by flow of fuel gas) from the active area . A spacer element  may be provided which physically isolates the catalytic substrate  from the tube .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 10"],"b":["270","271"]},"As shown in  the cathode current collector  electrically connects the cathode  of one tube to the anode  of another tube. The cathode current collector is exposed to air (oxygen) and high temperatures, and therefore must not melt and must be resistant to oxidative stress. The cathode current collector  preferably comprises ribbons of metal or wires and a cathode contact . The tube  has a longitudinal axis , and in accordance with a highly advantageous feature, the cathode current collector comprises at least one wire  which has a linear segment  extending parallel to the longitudinal axis  of the tube. The linear segments  of several wires are snugly wedged against an entire length of the cathode contact  or cathode  (corresponding to the active area ) to increase current carrying capability. A wire  can be wrapped around the linear segments , and can help to hold the linear segments to the cathode contact and help collect current generated circumferentially. The wires can comprise, for example, fine gauge wire allowing the wires to be somewhat flexible. A single large gauge wire may be too stiff, as it is advantageous to allow for some play in the fuel cell to absorb energy when subjected to irregular stresses. Irregular stresses and shock loading would be expected with a portable, lightweight solid oxide fuel cell. An example of a suitable wire for use in such cathode current collector is 250 micron silver wire. The wires can also comprise, for example platinum, palladium, gold, alloys of the aforementioned metals and iron, nickel and cobalt-based alloys oxidation resistant at high temperatures, known to those skilled in the art as high temperature alloys.","In general it is desirable to reduce ohmic loss and cathode overpotential. Further, any materials applied over the cathode must be electrically conductive (so that electrons generated as a result of the electrochemical reaction of the fuel cell can be collected) and permeable to oxygen (so that oxygen can reach the active area and enter the electrochemical reaction). In accordance with a highly advantageous feature, it has been found that application of silver metal at the cathode reduces ohmic loss and cathode overpotential. One example of such a cathode contact  is the application of a SPI 5002 HighPurity Silver Paint from Structure Probe, Inc. silver paint over the active area  in a layer about 10 to 100 microns thick.  shows the cathode contact in cross section positioned on the cathode . The silver metal may also act to secure the wires to the cathode.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4","FIG. 6","FIG. 5","FIG. 8"],"b":["70","72","49","6","6","76","47","76","78","76","79","44","87","89","88","170"]},"In accordance with a highly advantageous feature, it has been found that current collection is enhanced when the anode current collector  further comprises an anode contact  which physically and electrically connects the anode  to the wires . The anode contact  can be porous to the fuel gas and can comprise, for example, a paint containing copper oxide which is applied to the wire or wires  prior to their insertion into the tubes. Alternatively, the anode contact may be intermittently applied to the wires to allow the processed gas to reach the anode. Upon heating in the fuel gas atmosphere, the copper oxide particles in the paint reduce to copper metal, creating a porous sintered metal contact  between the wires  and the anode . Other materials suitable for creating a porous contact include metal oxides such as nickel oxide.","Electrical connection is required between a current collector and the anode within the tube. However, the electrolyte is not electrically conductive, and forms an electrically nonconductive gap  around the exterior of each tube between the active area  and the interconnect area . Electrical connection between the anode and outside the tube is accomplished at the interconnect area , where a conductive sealant  is applied. In addition to being electrically conductive, the conductive sealant  must also be oxidative and reductive resistant, it must be relatively insensitive to high temperatures, it must be gas impermeable (not porous) and it must bind to the substrate below, the anode . As an example of a suitable material for the conductive sealant  a frit containing a noble metal or noble metal alloy may be used which extends circumferentially around the anode . An example is the platinum frit Conductrox 3804 Pt Conductor manufactured by Ferro Electronic Materials. Other materials suitable for use as a conductive sealant, include noble metals and their alloys, and conductive oxides, and high temperature alloys.","In operation, processed fuel gas flows through each of the tubes, arriving at the active area  first, then passing the insulating gap area . Gap  is insulating on the exterior of the tubes, as the anode and any conducting materials at the interior of the tube with respect to the electrically nonconducting electrolyte. From the gap area, the exhaust gases and remaining processes gases pass through the interconnect area  to the burner area  and ejected outside the tube where any remaining processed gas may be burned. Advantageously, the anode current collector wires need only extend from the burner region to the active area.","Whether the electrodes of the tubes are electrically connected in series or in parallel, the cathode and anode current collectors ,  are designed to collect current from all of the tubes and transmit that current out of the thermal enclosure . When connected in series, all but a last one of the cathode current collectors  connects the cathode of one tube to the anode of another tube. As shown schematically in , the anode current collector wire from the last anode and the cathode current collector wire from the last cathode in a chain of SOFC tubes connected in series are electrically connected to an external electrical load. Advantageously, only two sets of silver wires leave the thermal enclosure , reducing heat loss from the thermal enclosure, one set from the last cathode, and one set from the last anode, at the interconnect area.","From the foregoing disclosure and detailed description of certain preferred embodiments, it will be apparent that various modifications, additions and other alternative embodiments are possible without departing from the true scope and spirit of the invention. The embodiments discussed were chosen and described to provide the best illustration of the principles of the invention and its practical application to thereby enable one of ordinary skill in the art to use the invention in various embodiments and with various modifications as are suited to the particular use contemplated.
