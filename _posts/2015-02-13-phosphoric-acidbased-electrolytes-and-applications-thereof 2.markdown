title: Phosphoric acid-based electrolytes and applications thereof
abstract: A liquid electrolyte formed by reacting phosphoric acid (HPO) in the liquid state with silicon tetrachloride (SiCl), thereby forming a fluid suspension. The fluid suspension is heated to yield a liquid electrolyte including phosphoric acid (HPO), pyrophosphoric acid (HPO), and a particulate solid comprising a silicophosphoric acid, wherein the silicophosphoric acid is an acidic molecular compound including silicon and phosphorus. A concentrated silicophosphoric acid composition prepared by removing most of the liquid from the liquid electrolyte is dissolved in water to yield a homogeneous solution. The homogeneous solution is dried to yield a solid electrolyte. In some cases, the homogenous solution is dried on a substrate to coat at least a portion of the substrate with a proton conductive solid electrolyte. A fuel cell may include the liquid electrolyte, the solid electrolyte, or the coated substrate.

W911NF-07-G-0423 and W911NF-04-1-0060. The government has certain rights in the invention.","This invention relates to phosphoric acid-based electrolytes and applications thereof, including fuel cells having phosphoric acid-based electrolytes.","The phosphoric acid fuel cell is known as one of most researched, and commercially most advanced types of fuel cell. An advantage it holds over NAFION-based fuel cells is the higher temperature range of operation permitted by the electrolyte. Electrolytes in phosphoric acid fuel cells have been used up to 160\u00b0 C. before water loss, to form pyrophosphoric acid, leads to reduced conductivity and poorer performance.","Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) are under intense development as non-polluting power sources that in principle are the most efficient means of converting chemical energy to electrical energy and mechanical work. However, practical realization of this efficiency, even in the simple H\/Ofuel cell case, proves to be fraught with difficulties. NAFION fuel cells, based on sulfonated polytetrafluoro-ethylene proton conductive membranes, are favored for their high conductivities, but are limited to temperatures below 100\u00b0 C. because of loss, at higher temperatures, of the water needed for high conductivity\u2014which means the fuel cell is susceptible to catalyst poisoning by CO gas impurities. The NAFION-based cells also suffer from acute water crossover, hence water management, problems.","Attempts have been made to increase the operating temperature of the NAFION membrane cell by various methods. However, NAFION and other perfluorinated polymer electrolytes (i.e. FLEMION, and ACIPLEX) are limited in commercial applications because of the high materials costs, coupled with the reduced performance at high temperatures.","In a first general aspect, preparing an electrolyte includes reacting phosphoric acid (HPO) in the liquid state with silicon tetrachloride (SiCl), thereby forming a fluid suspension. The fluid suspension is heated to yield a liquid electrolyte including phosphoric acid (HPO), pyrophosphoric acid (HPO), and a particulate solid comprising a silicophosphoric acid, wherein the silicophosphoric acid is an acidic molecular compound including silicon and phosphorus.","A second general aspect includes a liquid electrolyte formed by the first general aspect.","In a third general aspect, a liquid electrolyte includes phosphoric acid (HPO); pyrophosphoric acid (HPO); and a particulate solid comprising a silicophosphoric acid, wherein the silicophosphoric acid is an acidic molecular compound including silicon and phosphorus.","A fourth general aspect includes a solid electrolyte formed by dissolving a composition in water to yield a homogenous solution, and drying the homogenous solution to yield the solid electrolyte. The composition is prepared by removing most of the liquid from a fluid suspension including phosphoric acid (HPO), pyrophosphoric acid (HPO), and a particulate solid comprising a silicophosphoric acid, wherein the silicophosphoric acid is an acidic molecular compound including silicon and phosphorus.","A fifth general aspect includes a proton conductive membrane formed by dissolving a composition in water to yield a homogenous solution, contacting a substrate with the homogeneous solution, and drying the homogenous solution to coat at least a portion of the substrate with a solid electrolyte. The composition is prepared by removing most of the liquid from a fluid suspension including phosphoric acid (HPO); pyrophosphoric acid (HPO); and a particulate solid comprising a silicophosphoric acid, wherein the silicophosphoric acid is an acidic molecular compound comprising silicon and phosphorus.","A sixth general aspect includes the liquid electrolyte formed as in the first general aspect.","Implementations of any of the first to sixth aspects may independently include one or more of the following features as applicable.","In some cases, the fluid suspension is creamy in appearance. The fluid suspension may scatter incident visible light. The phosphoric acid may be anhydrous phosphoric acid. In certain cases, the phosphoric acid is formed from pure anhydrous phosphoric acid in the solid state.","Heating the fluid suspension may include heating the fluid suspension to a temperature sufficient to yield a molar ratio of pyrophosphoric acid to phosphoric acid in the range between 0.1:1 and 0.8:1 or 0.3 and 0.7. This ratio may be assessed, for example, with P NMR spectroscopy.

In certain cases, the molar ratio of pyrophosphoric acid to phosphoric acid is in a range between 0.1:1 and 0.8:1.

The details of one or more embodiments are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, objects, and advantages will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.","As described herein, phosphoric acid (HPO) in the liquid state and silicon tetrachloride (SiCl) and are reacted to yield a fluid suspension, and the fluid suspension is heated to yield a liquid electrolyte including phosphoric acid, pyrophosphoric acid, and a particulate solid including a silicophosphoric acid. As used herein, a \u201csilicophosphoric acid\u201d is an acidic molecular inorganic compound including silicon and phosphorus. \u201cSiPOH\u201d is used herein to refer to a silicophosphoric acid or a mixture of two or more silicophosphoric acids, each having a different chemical formula. SiPOH dissolves in water to form a clear, homogenous aqueous solution. Upon standing, the homogenous solution forms a gel, and the gel is dried to form a solid electrolyte referred to herein as \u201cSiPOly.\u201d The solid inorganic electrolyte is has an elastic or \u201crubbery\u201d properties and is typically flexible and deformable.","The fluid suspension, or SiPOH-stabilized phosphoric acid electrolyte, can be used as a liquid inorganic electrolyte for hydrogen\/oxygen fuel cells. This liquid inorganic electrolyte demonstrates superior behavior to phosphoric acid in both open circuit voltage (OCV) and in current delivery, the efficiency of utilization of the gaseous fuel being particularly unexpected. This liquid electrolyte has an extended stability range, remaining substantially unchanged in properties as monitored by sensitive electrical conductivity criteria over 24 hours at 250\u00b0 C., far above the operating range of the standard phosphoric acid even when moderately pressurized, showing higher proton decoupling, higher thermal stability, and higher conductivity than anhydrous phosphoric acid. This liquid electrolyte extends the temperature range of fuel cell operation to temperatures where catalyst poisoning by such agents as CO and other platinum binders is no longer a factor. The efficiency of gas utilization, giving nearly 100% current efficiency, is notable. Thus, this electrolyte is suitable for use in fuel cells, either as a liquid electrolyte or, with further processing to SiPOly, as a solid electrolyte having a conductivity at ambient temperature and humidity exceeding that of NAFION 115 in its optimized form, and at 80\u00b0 C. exceeding that of NAFION 115 in its 100% humidified form under 3.5 atmospheres of pressure.","Electrolytes described herein showed increased temperature range without sacrifice of high temperature conductivity or open circuit voltage. This is achieved by introduction of the SiPOH, which inhibits decomposition or water loss to 250\u00b0 C., thus extending the temperature range of the phosphoric acid fuel cell to 250\u00b0 C. Conductivity data to 285\u00b0 C. and full H\/Ocell polarization curves to 226\u00b0 C. have been obtained. High current efficiency (current density per unit of fuel supplied per sec) is observed, and a power density of 184 mWcmis achieved at 226\u00b0 C. with hydrogen flow rate of 4.1 mL\/min.","The electrolytes described herein extend the temperature range of the phosphoric acid fuel cell to 250\u00b0 C., while improving its operating fuel efficiency. The current efficiency (i\/i, i=current) obtained with these electrolytes is believed to be higher than that reported to date for any other type of fuel cell operating at 1 atm pressure. Its voltage efficiency is also believed to be comparable to or better than that of known phosphoric acid-based fuel cells.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 1","sub":["3","4","4","3","4"],"b":"102"},"In , the fluid suspension is heated to yield a liquid electrolyte including phosphoric acid, pyrophosphoric acid (HPO), and a particulate solid including a silicophosphoric acid. In some cases, the suspension is heated to a temperature of at least 100\u00b0 C., at least 200\u00b0 C., or at least 250\u00b0 C. In certain cases, the suspension is heated to a temperature sufficient to yield a molar ratio of pyrophosphoric acid to phosphoric acid in the liquid electrolyte in the range between 0.1:1 and 0.8:1, or between 0.3:1 and 0.7:1. The liquid electrolyte is a stronger acid than phosphoric acid, and can serve as a liquid electrolyte for a fuel cell without further refinement. The HPO-insoluble components in the suspension can be increased in quantity, for example, by extended reaction times, using excess SiCland additional heating. The fluid suspension is a stable fluid suspension.","The silicophosphoric acid is an acidic molecular compound including silicon and phosphorus. The silicophosphoric acid typically includes oxygen and hydrogen. Heating the suspension also removes most, all, or substantially all (e.g., \u226799%) of the chlorine from unreacted silicon tetrachloride, generating hydrochloric acid gas. The liquid phosphoric acid-based electrolyte is a water-soluble suspension of SiPOH in a mixture of phosphoric acid and pyrophosphoric acid, and has a creamy white appearance. According to P NMR spectroscopic analysis of one liquid electrolyte sample, the phosphorus content of the phosphoric acid\/pyrophosphoric acid mixture is split approximately 2:1 between phosphoric acid and pyrophosphoric acid.

The reaction is carried out under mild conditions, under gentle flow of nitrogen gas, initially 45\u00b0 C. (Tof SiClis 57\u00b0 C.) and continuing with gradually rising temperature (reaching 100\u00b0 C.) for three hours until the liquid is saturated with reaction products (becoming creamy in color due to a fine precipitate of SiPOH), followed by gradually increasing temperature to 270\u00b0 C. over one hour that establishes a content of HPOin the liquid electrolyte.","SiPOH can be separated from the liquid electrolyte formed in  by methods such as: (i) centrifugation to yield a paste of solid with some excess solution or, (ii) by an (exothermic) acetone extraction process which dissolves the excess HPO, but not the SiPOH. Both yield the X-ray diffraction pattern shown in . In contrast, when ethanol is added to the centrifugation product and the temperature is raised (e.g., to 80\u00b0 C.) to expel the volatiles, SiPO, a white crystalline solid of known structure, insoluble in water, is formed.","In another implementation of the process shown in , the liberated HCl can be collected in an internal chemical trap. The reaction is performed in a \u201cclosed system\u201d comprised of a 3-neck Schlenk reaction flask. One of the joints contains a cold finger kept at about \u221220\u00b0 C. and the other attaches to a tube containing an HCl trap. In some embodiments, the HCl trap can be a liquid mixture of two amine\/aluminum chloride adducts. In some embodiments, the HCl trap is a liquid mixture of: diethylmethylamine\/aluminum chloride and 2-methylpyridine\/aluminum chloride. In some embodiments, the ratio of diethylmethylamine\/aluminum chloride and 2-methylpyridine\/aluminum chloride is about 7:3 by weight. Phosphoric acid and silicon tetrachloride are added to the Schlenk flask under nitrogen atmosphere, in a ratio of 7:3 by weight. The mixture is kept at 50\u00b0 C. for 2 h. The phosphoric acid melts completely with bubbles evolving continuously. The temperature is slowly increased to 120\u00b0 C. for 4 h. The final product is a white suspension, comprising SiPOH (white solid) and excess phosphoric acid. The excess phosphoric acid can be separated by centrifugation, and the remaining solid can be washed several times with a solvent that is insert with respect to SiPOH. In some embodiments, the solvent is pentafluoropropanol.","Water-soluble, light-scattering material isolated as a white powder by the acetone extraction (SiPOH) was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) chemical analysis technique (Optical Emission Spectrometer-Themo iCAP6300), with stock standards including a 998 ppm single element silicon solution and a 100 ppm solution of KHPO.  shows an X-ray diffraction pattern of the powder obtained using a high resolution X-ray diffractometer (PANALYTICAL X'PERT PRO). The powder is stable on heating to 285\u00b0 C. but then decomposes, losing about one mole of water per mole of SiPOH as described herein. The X-ray powder patterns of the product heated to 310\u00b0 C. and 650\u00b0 C. are shown in , respectively. The pattern of  is attributable to SiPO, and is believed to be that of a less stable configuration of the same compound.","The P NMR spectrum of SiPOH acid was determined in two conditions. The liquid product of the reaction of equimolar quantities of HPOand SiCl(externally referenced to triphenylphosphine) was used as the first NMR sample. The spectrum of the resulting SiPOH in a phosphoric acid medium is shown in  and includes two resonances, one at \u03b4=0.1881 ppm, known for phosphoric acid, and a second at \u03b4=\u221212.6968 ppm, which can be identified as the resonance for pyrophosphoric acid, HPO. This peak is more intense for a sample prepared with a larger ratio of initial SiClto HPO, and heated for longer times, as might be expected for HPO. The second NMR sample was obtained by dissolving some of the latter sample in DO, to give a solution approximately one molar in HPO, assuming this to be the majority component. The new resonance appears at \u22129.6250 ppm, as shown by  (enlarged). This is less downfield that in the first solution, presumably in response to the change in proton activity. The corresponding peak for HPOmoved to from 0.1881 of , to 1.7 in .","The proton NMR spectrum of the same reaction product that gave the P spectra of , shown in , shows a single sharp peak at \u03b4=9.1169 ppm from the external acetone-d6 reference, quite similar to, but more acidic than, that of a corresponding pure HPOsample. The latter shows a single peak at \u03b4=8.7681 ppm from the same external reference. Since SiPOH is a minority component and since the observed resonance is presumably an exchange average, it is implied that SiPOH is strongly acidic.","The 4-coordination for Si, double bridging to the phosphate group, suggests an explanation for the difference between the XRD of the initial dehydration product of SiPOH () and the pattern for the known SiPOstructure. The latter has six-coordinate Si, thought to require a more significant rearrangement than can be promoted at 300\u00b0 C. The structure of  is thought to retain 4-coordinate Si with double bridges (e.g., as depicted in chemical structure (2) above).","The chemical formula SiPOHwas further tested by titration of the acid protons using standard NaOH solution. 10 ml of a solution that was 0.1 molar in SiPOH according to the assigned molecular formula was found to require a little more than the expected 20 ml of standard 0.1 molar NaOH to reach neutral according to standard strong acid indicators. The excess 5.9 ml is thought to be due to HPOnot fully removed from the SiPOH sample preparation. This test does not distinguish between a strong diprotic acid and a strong hexaprotic acid.","SiPOH-containing phosphoric acid liquid electrolyte formed as described with respect to  is chemically table for long periods of time at temperatures up to 250\u00b0 C. For example, SiPOH-containing phosphoric acid liquid electrolyte remains unchanged in properties (monitored by sensitive electrical conductivity) over 24 hours at temperatures up to 250\u00b0 C. Above 285\u00b0 C., the SiPOH appears to precipitate solid SiPOin an unknown crystal form. While its presence leads to an increase in electrolyte viscosity, its conductivity above 150\u00b0 C. is superior to that of phosphoric acid, thought to be due at least in part to a superior \u201cfree\u201d proton contribution.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0069"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1"],"b":["500","502"],"sub":["3","4 ","4","2","7","3","4","3","4","4","2","7 "]},"In , the concentrated SiPOH composition is dissolved in water to yield a clear, homogenous solution.

The weight loss v. time function is shown in . The loss is rapid at first, but reaches a constant mass. About 90 wt % of the initial water content is lost in the drying process.","A comparison of the XRD pattern of SiPOH gel with that of conventional anhydrous silica gel, shown in , suggests that the SiPOH gel is a homogenous network of siloxy units that may be more correlated than in silica gel, yet loosely connected enough that the structure remains floppy and easily, but elastically, deformable.

A mesh or other porous substrate coated with SiPOly may be used as a proton conductive membrane.","Through process , SiPOly can be coated on or impregnated in a substrate (or both) without low temperature aqueous processing, thereby avoiding chemical modification of the electrolyte. The acidic nature of the solid electrolyte improves adherence to certain substrates, such as polybenzimidazole membranes.
