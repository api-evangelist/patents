title: Method for improving prompt dose radiation response of mixed-signal integrated circuits
abstract: A system and method for improving the prompt dose radiation response of mixed-signal integrated circuits is disclosed. An internal analog circuit inside a mixed-signal integrated circuit generates an internal analog reference voltage that has been used for various purposes in the integrated circuit. At least one external capacitor is added either internal or external to a device package of the integrated circuit. The external capacitor reduces any change in the internal reference voltage due to prompt dose radiation by stabilizing the internal reference voltage and thus improves prompt dose radiation response of mixed-signal integrated circuits. A much greater value of capacitance may be provided without increase in dielectric rupture suceptability or decrease in manufacturing yield which may be associated with added on-chip capacitance. This increased capacitance primarily reduce the amount of disturbance caused to the internal node during a prompt dose radiation event.

No. 61\/491,956 filed Jun. 1, 2011, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.","This invention was made with United States Government support under Contract No. NRO000-08-C-0358 awarded by the Naval Research Laboratory. The United States Government has certain rights in this invention.","Embodiments are generally related to semiconductor devices. Embodiments are also related to radiation hardening semiconductor devices. Embodiments are additionally related to an apparatus and method of hardening mixed signal Integrated Circuits (IC) having internally generated analog voltages. Embodiments are additionally related to an apparatus and method of improving the prompt dose radiation response of mixed-signal integrated circuits.","Radiation hardening is a method of designing and testing electronic components and systems to make them resistant to damage or malfunctions caused by ionizing radiation (particle radiation and high-energy electromagnetic radiation), such as would be encountered in outer space, high-altitude flight, around nuclear reactors, particle accelerators, during nuclear accidents or nuclear warfare. For example, gamma rays are produced in fission and as a result of other neutron reactions and nuclear excitation of the weapon materials. These rays appear within a second or less after a nuclear explosion. The radiations from these sources are known either as prompt or instantaneous gamma rays. Such radiations cause damage or malfunctions to semiconductor devices.","An integrated circuit with both analog circuits and digital circuits on a single semiconductor die is known as a mixed-signal integrated circuit. In a prompt dose radiation environment mixed-signal integrated circuits are particularly susceptible to functional disruption due to signal level changes induced during the radiation pulse. Various radiation hardening techniques are in use today to harden the mixed-signal integrated circuit.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","110","108","102","104","106","104","110"]},"Internally generated analog reference voltages, however, are more difficult to harden because there is a practical limit to the amount of in-circuit capacitance that can be added to the chip without affecting die size. Also an increase in on-chip capacitance typically also decreases defect driven yield and increases susceptibility to heavy ion induced dielectric rupture.","A need, therefore, exists for an improved way to radiation harden circuits having internally generated analog voltages.","The following summary is provided to facilitate an understanding of some of the innovative features unique to the disclosed embodiment and is not intended to be a full description. A full appreciation of the various aspects of the embodiments disclosed herein can be gained by taking the entire specification, claims, drawings, and abstract as a whole.","It is, therefore, one aspect of the disclosed embodiments to provide semiconductor devices.","It is another aspect of the disclosed embodiments to provide radiation hardening semiconductor devices.","It is yet another aspect of the disclosed embodiments to provide for an improved apparatus and method of hardening a mixed signal integrated Circuit (IC) having internally generated analog voltages.","It is a further aspect of the present invention to provide for an improved apparatus and method of improving the prompt dose radiation response of the mixed-signal integrated circuit by adding at least one external capacitor within a device package.","It is another aspect of the present invention to provide for an improved apparatus and method of improving the prompt dose radiation response of the mixed-signal integrated circuit by adding at least one external capacitor external to the device package.","It is a yet another aspect of the present invention to stabilize a change in a reference voltage generated by an internal analog circuit during prompt dose radiation.","The aforementioned aspects and other objectives and advantages can now be achieved as described herein.
