title: System and method for biometric protocol standards
abstract: An initial certificate is provided that enables an initial two-way secured communication session between a user computing device and a trusted server. An initial secured communication session is established by the trusted server with the user computing device after receiving the one-time certificate. The trusted server receives identification information associated with the user of the user computing device, wherein the identification information includes a representation of the user's identity that has been confirmed as a function of biometrics and further includes a representation of the user computing device. Moreover, a replacement certificate is generated that is unique to the combination of the user and the user computing device, and transmits the replacement certificate to the user computing device. Thereafter, a two-way secured communication session is established, by the trusted server.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","Example","Example"],"p":["The present application is a continuation of and claims priority to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14\/587,633, entitled \u201cSYSTEM AND METHOD FOR BIOMETRIC PROTOCOL STANDARDS\u201d filed Dec. 31, 2014, which claims priority to U.S. Patent Application Ser. No. 61\/922,438, entitled \u201cSYSTEM AND METHOD FOR BIOMETRIC PROTOCOL STANDARDS\u201d filed Dec. 31, 2013, the contents of each which is hereby incorporated by reference as if set forth expressly in its respective entirety herein.","The present invention relates, generally, to systems and methods for acquiring and characterizing biometric features and, in particular, to systems and methods for acquiring and characterizing facial biometric features using a mobile device for the purposes of identifying or authenticating a user.","Information of all kinds continues to be stored and accessed remotely, such as on storage devices that are accessible over data communication networks. For example, many people and companies store and access financial information, health and medical information, goods and services information, purchase information, entertainment information, multi-media information over the Internet or other communication network. In addition to accessing information, users can effect monetary transfers (e.g., purchases, transfers, sales or the like). In a typical scenario, a user registers for access to information, and thereafter submits a user name and password to \u201clog in\u201d and access the information. Securing access to (and from) such information and data that is stored on a data\/communication network remains a paramount concern.","Accordingly, a system and method are disclosed for providing secure communication between a user computing device and a trusted server. In one or more implementations, an initial certificate that enables an initial two-way secured communication session between the user computing device and the trusted server is provided. An initial secured communication session with the user computing device is established after receiving the initial certificate. During the initial secured communication, generation of a replacement certificate that includes identification information associated with the user of the user computing device, wherein the identification information includes a representation of the user's identity that has been confirmed as a function of biometrics and further includes a representation of the user computing device, is caused. The trusted server receives, during a subsequent communication session with the user computing device, the replacement certificate with encoded information that represents that the user's identity has been verified. The trusted server establishes, using the replacement certificate with the encoded information, a two-way secured communication session with the user computing device and, during the two-way secured communication session, a request to access an object is received. The trusted server determines an object security level associated with the object and a subject security level associated the user; and allows, for the user computing device, access to the object when the subject's security level is greater than or equal to the object's security level.","Other features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following description of the invention that refers to the accompanying drawings.","In accordance with one or more implementations, a new set of standards, referred to herein, generally, as Biometric Open Protocol Standards (\u201cBOPS\u201d) is provided that, collectively or at least partially, includes a framework for authenticating users. In accordance with BOPS, authentication occurs between a user and particular service, which is allocated by a computing device referred to herein, generally, as a \u201cBOPS server.\u201d This approach is more secure and practical than between user and an Internet website. In one or more implementations, the BOPS server allocates security details, and the user's presence is verified in an initial (referred to herein, generally, as \u201cgenesis\u201d) operation, which is described in greater detail, below.","In one or more implementations, the Biometric Open Protocol Standards provide identity assertion, role gathering, multi-level access control, assurance and auditing. In operation, the BOPS includes software running on a client device (e.g., running the ANDROID operating system, iOS, or other operating system), on a trusted BOPS Server, and on an intrusion detection system (\u201cIDS\u201d). The BOPS allows pluggable components to replace existing components' functionality by accepting integration into current operating environments in a short period of time.","In operation, the client\/device application loads a one-time 2-way SSL key for initial communications to the server. This one-time 2-way SSL key is replaced, in function, by the subject's two way SSL key that is provided during the identity\/Genesis phase.","By way of example only and for the purpose of overview and introduction, embodiments of the present application are described below, which include a system and method for recording a user's biometric features and generating an identifier representative of the user's biometric features, for example, using a mobile device such as a smartphone. The biometric identifier can be generated for the purposes of identifying\/authenticating (e.g., verifying) the user according to the biometric identifier.","In one or more implementations, a system is provided that can include a cloud-based system server platform that communicates with user computing devices such as laptops, tablets and mobile devices (e.g., smartphones). As the user accesses, for example, a website which requires a secure login, a secure request is made to the system server for the user's authentication. The system server can then query the user's mobile device to capture biometric information in the form of at least images of the user's eyes, periocular region and face or any combination of the foregoing (collectively referred to as the Vitruvian region), and encode the captured Vitruvian biometric information as a Vitruvian biometric identifier. Then the user can be verified according to the Vitruvian biometric identifier. Verification can be performed, for example, by the mobile device, the system server or a combination of the foregoing by comparing the Vitruvian biometric identifier to a Vitruvian identifier generated during the user's initial enrollment with the system.","It is to be appreciated that the present application provides significant convenience for users and one or more information providers as a function of biometrics-based access management. It is recognized by the inventor that consumers generally approve of biometrics for access to and management of information that is provided remotely, such as on-line over a communication network. Biometric technologies can provide consumer with a long-awaited convenience to securely enter into \u201ccyberspace\u201d on the frontend.","The Biometric Open Protocol Standards provided herein protects users' digital assets and digital identities on the \u201cbackend\u201d and can be a biometrics agnostic standard, and include an application programming interface (\u201cAPI\u201d) for developers to interface therewith. For example, the present application supports different procedural and security-based measures that may have been previously in place. Accordingly, an existing security authentication process that employs biometrics can be integrated thereby precluding disruption of an existing business practice.","Moreover, in one or more implementations a BOPS communication architecture is provided that enables a 2-way Secure Socket Layer (SSL) connection over the encryption mechanism to the BOPS server, which can employ an Intrusion Detection System (IDS).","The following is an alphabetical listing of terms and corresponding definitions in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present application. An additional glossary of terms is set forth herein.","Admin Console: an online portal that facilitates to the registration and enrollment with BOPS.","Application: a unique software\/system that is created using the BOPS Application Programming Interface (API) key.","BOPS Admin: a BOPS administrator, who sets up an environment and creates an Original Site Admin based on the enrollment information during the registration.","BOPS Cluster: a set of loosely or tightly connected computers, devices that communicate using BOPS.","BOPS Server: an instance of a server, such as in the client\/server paradigm, which supports BOPS architecture.","BOPS IDS: an instance of the Intrusion Detection System on the private cluster that supports BOPS architecture.","Client device IDS: an instance of the Intrusion Detection System running locally on a user device.","Jena Rules: syntax and a system of machine learning rules for inferencing.","IDS Cluster: a set of loosely or tightly connected Intrusion Detection Systems that supports BOPS.","Original Site Admin: an administrator created by BOPS administrator with the privilege to create other administrators within the same organization. The Original Site Administrator can assert his\/her unique identity according to the client requirements (see below, with reference to section regarding Genesis API\/Client Requirements Note).","Site Admin: an application administrator who is created by The Original Site Administrator.","Trusted Adjudicated Data: data stored in BOPS with Multilevel Secure adjudication in the BOPS server.","User: a unique user, whose identity is being asserted by BOPS that may have several devices.","User Device: a single device that has biometric-driven client software.","Referring now to the drawings, in which like reference numerals refer to like elements,  is a simple block diagram illustrating a plurality of client devices  and communication with a BOPS server  and components associated with an example implementation. In one or more implementations, Biometric Open Protocol Standards include rules governing secure communication between a variety of client devices  and one or more trusted servers. As will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art, the present application provides incentive values of BOPS and provides a comprehensive guidance to the BOPS implementation. BOPS conforms to the Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria, frequently referred as Orange Book, section B1; to the Director of the Central Intelligence Directive 6\/3 protection levels 3, 4, and 5 (PL3, PL4, PL5); and to the standards of Multiple Independent Levels of Security (MILS).","Security considerations include the security policies in place and unambiguously defined levels of security. One of the BOPS main functions is to provide authentication instead of authorization in a way such that the server does not retain the client information, but instead recognizes one client from another. As noted herein, key components of security considerations of the BOPS include identity assertion, role gathering, access control, auditing, and assurance. The present application, including via an implementation of BOPS, provides continuous protection to resources and assurance of the placement and viability of adjudication and other key features. Accountability is the mechanism that proves a service level guarantee of security.","The BOPS identity assertion provides a guarantee that named users are who they claim to be. The identity assertion implies reliance on human biometrics, however, the BOPS is an interoperable standard and can incorporate any identity asserter, or a number of asserters that provides this guarantee. The application of the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) provides active monitoring to prevent spoofing of the credentials set and blacklisting of a subject or device that makes malicious attempts.","In one or more implementations, role gathering is focused on data confidentiality and privileged access based on rules enforced by a known system. To determine whether a specific access mode is allowed, the privilege of a role can be compared to the classification of the group to determine whether the subject is authorized for confidential access. The objects structure can be defined by the access control. Role gathering occurs on the system's level or through the client\/server call. The BOPS server stores role gathering information to associate a unique user with a unique device.","With regard to access control, BOPS supports access control between the named users and the named objects (e.g., files and programs). A role-based adjudication mechanism includes and allows users and administrators to specify and control sharing of objects by named individuals, by defined groups of individuals, or by both. Moreover, a discretionary access control mechanism is provided to ensure that objects are protected from unauthorized access. Further, discretionary access control provides protection at the group or individual level across a singular or group of objects. The granularity ranges from individual to group.","In one or more implementations, BOPS can enforce a mandatory access control policy over all subjects and storage objects under its control (e.g., processes, files, segments, devices). These subjects and objects can be assigned sensitivity labels, which can be a combination of hierarchical classification levels and non-hierarchical categories, and the labels can be used in the adjudication as a basis for mandatory access control decisions.","In one or more implementations, the following requirements hold for all access between subjects and objects controlled by the BOPS: a subject can read an object only if the hierarchical classification in the subject's security level is greater than or equal to the hierarchical classification in the object's security level and the non-hierarchical categories in the subject's security level include all the non-hierarchical categories in the object's security level. A subject can write an object only if the hierarchical classification in the subject's security level is less than or equal to the hierarchical classification in the object's security level and all the non-hierarchical categories in the subject's security level are included in the non-hierarchical categories in the object's security level.","Identification and authentication data should be used by BOPS to authenticate the user's identity and to ensure that the security level and authorization of subjects external to the BOPS that may be created to act on behalf of the individual user are dominated by the clearance and authorization of that user.","The present application provides for auditing and review, referred to generally herein as assurance. The BOPS can support auditing requests at the Subject\/Object level or at the group level. The BOPS can use Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP) to ensure that all calls are safely written to an audit trail. Moreover, RESTFul web services and JSON interface can provide a mechanism to read the audit trail. Auditing may occur at the subject per action, the object per action or the group per action. For example, a group of users called \u201cAccounting\u201d may audit all writes to General Ledger; or a Chief Financial Officer may have audits for reads of the Income Statement. Furthermore, in one or more implementations JUnit tests are provided for all boundary conditions of the BOPS. The suite of tests includes testing all boundary components and conditions of the system.","As noted herein, the BOPS allow systems to meet security needs by using an API. The BOPS need not know whether the underlying system is a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS), a Search Engine or other system. The BOPS functionality offers a \u201cpoint and cut\u201d mechanism to add the appropriate security to the production systems as well as to the systems in development. The architecture is a language neutral allowing REST, JSON and Secure Socket Layers to provide the communication interface. Further, in one or more implementations the architecture is built on the servlet specification, open secure socket layers, Java, JSON, REST and Apache Solr. Another persistence engine can be supported, such as Cassandra. The tools can adhere to open standards allowing significant interoperability.","In one or more implementations, BOPS are usable through access control or added to identity assertion of already existing framework. The BOPS enables trusted processing by performing the minimum actions in the production environment and in the most cases does not require the change of any application software.","Moreover, in one or more implementations 2-way Secure Socket Layers (SSL) is provided that is built on a top of 1-way SSL, provides communication starting at the client. The initial or \u201cgenesis\u201d communication establishes the origin of the client's identity. Thereafter, a BOPS compliant 2-way certificate is passed that the client uses for a subsequent communication in conjunction with the session oriented Identity Assertion. In one or more implementations, the client application has a pre-loaded 2-way SSL key that allows subsequent identity Genesis.","In operation, a BOPS compliant server receives 1-way SSL communication with 2-way SSL identity. Communication is conducted both 1-way SSL and 2-way SSL. The server uses a data store to take trusted identity and gather the roles for processing on behalf of the identity. Auditing ensures the appropriate artifacts for continued verification and validation of the trusted access. The Assurance occurs through the simplification and documentation of the multi-level access control mechanism. The BOPS uses an Administration Console that is available after the registration process (See below, with regard to Registration), which allows dynamic modification of Users, Groups, and Roles.","In one or more implementations, BOPS is implemented with an active intrusion detection system that provides prevention of any form of brute-forcing or denial-of-service (distributed or single DOS) attacks. The standard contains a custom rule that identifies and tracks the attempts to forge 2-way SSL certificates impersonation, a session replay, forged packets, and variety of other attempts to circumvent the BOPS server.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","104","202","102","204","206","204","102","206","204","102","206"]},"The following is a description of an example implementation of the present patent application. A registration process initiates the BOPS adoption within an organization. Before a BOPS administrator sets up an environment, the organization registers to receive an API key, for example from an Internet web site. An individual developer may apply for an API key as well. At enrollment completion, the BOPS administrator original site administrator may create additional site administrators. In the future, the enrollment information will be associated with the API key of the organization. The API registration can pertain to two domains: the enrolled original site admin and the issued API key, which is based on the enrollment information, the organization, and use case. The registration process is complete when the application commencement is agreed. Thereafter, the BOPS admin creates original Site Admin, for an organization, the original site admin may create a site admin (see ). The steps after the registration are described below.  illustrates an instance of roles hierarchy in accordance with the present application.","In an example implementation, prior to the development process that utilizes the BOPS service, a developer register in a \u201cBOPS Admin Console.\u201d By providing the application name and using, for example, a rules bases question and answer tool, to identify the developer, the BOPS establishes a new account and creates the API key, which can be identified with the application name and associated with the application. The established API key can be included in all API calls to the BOPS server. The BOPS server validates the API key. If the key is expired or invalid, the BOPS server immediately rejects the service request.","As noted herein, in one or more implementations, the communication between the application and the BOPS server is established on the top of 2-way SSL. The Genesis mechanism provides for establishing the connection. Genesis specifies how the users identify themselves to the BOPS server, so that the server can generate a private key to set up the 2-way SSL communication between the user device  application and the BOPS server . Moreover, a unique ID can be provided that identifies the device of the end user. The device association API can be used to notify the BOPS server about the link between the user and the user's device.","The following example demonstrates communication between a client and a server. A request call to the BOPS server can have an API call, with the possible exception of CreateApplication, which creates the API Key. The request can originate from a client device to a secure server. The initial call receives 2-way SSL certificate and creates a user. The user can be created in a clustered persistent environment. The sums that prevent playback can be one-way encrypted using SHA1. Switching SHA1 with any suitable algorithm does not change the algorithm.","An example format of an initial call would be to the:","https:\/\/xyz.domain.com:8443\/{BOPS_Instance_Server}\/?val1=<n1>&val2=<n2>&si teId=<client>&username=<username>&password=<password>&newPassword=<newpassword>","For val1=<n1>, n1 is a SHA1 sum of an integer between \u221259 and 59 added or subtracted from the current time in ISO-8601 format. For val2=<n2>, n2 is a SHA1 sum of an integer between \u221259 and 59 and is greater than the plaintext value of n1. The values for username and password are client dependent and used to reach the current identity asserter. Similar mechanisms exist for SAML, LDAP, ActiveDirectory in conjunction with a variety of mechanism for Asserting Identity and Role Gathering.","The following represents the consequence of a Genesis Request:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"7"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"Session",{},{}]},{"entry":["username","Email","val1","val2","Timeout","roles","siteId"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["scott","scott@sample.com","5","40","3600","Admin","businessCustomer"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"The user scott has an email scott@sample.com. The first replay value in a plain text is 5 and the second is 40. The sessionTimeout exists at the sessionId, siteId pairing. For an administrator of the business customer website the sessionTimeout exists one hour.","In the greater detail the example works as follows, with the current time as 2013-12-22T17:46:03.647Z. A calculation is made to move back to the five minute interval and get 2013-12-22T17:45:00.007Z with an SHA1 sum of fa8e14cf7f80f885084ee0e3cb256182bb6a4e40","https:\/\/xyz.domain.com: 8443\/{BOPS_Instance_Server}\/genesisval1=fa8e14cf7f8 0f885084ee0e3cb256182bb6a4e40&val2=fa8e14cf7f80f885084ee0e3cb256182bb 6a4e40&newPassword=gasol","The values associated with val1 is fa8e14cf7f80f885084ee0e3cb256182bb6a4e40 is a 5 offset and for val2=fa8e14cf7f80f885084ee0e3cb256182bb6a4e40 which happens to be the same for 40. The newPassword is the password for the 2-way SSL key, which is preferably not stored on the BOPS server.","To execute this operation the BOPS Server must have the SHA1 sum for all integers between \u221259 and 59 to decipher the sums.","The following represents subsequent API calls. For example, at 2:18 pm Zulu time user scott uses a client device (Android phone) to create a session. The call contains deviceId for a session, as well as the following parameters:","val1=<SHA1sum of current time rolled back to the nearest 5 minute interval>&val2=<SHA1sum of current time rolled forward to the nearest 20 minuteinterval>&command=<SHA1sum of an a low level operating system such as fopen>&version=<version of command>&val3=<SHA1sum for the command file>","To prevent the replay of a previous session or a replacement the key kernel object files, the BOPS server can contain SHA1 sums for commands names and the files on a version-by-version basis. Using the BOPS protocol in a conjunction with the BOPS intrusion detection system can prevent a replay attack. The IDS updates the list of the blacklisted objects, as threats and attacks, on the further attack recognition level.","The following discussion regards an overview of an API in accordance with one or more implementations of the present application. In one or more implementations, API names are in RESTful JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format.","With regard to identity assertion API, individual developers can apply for an API_Key for their applications that will use BOPS. Once individual developers have their own API_Keys, API calls that are made by their applications can insert this API_Key as one of parameters. The LDAP can verify the API_Key at that API level. Furthermore, application identification creates an application for use by a development team.","A discussion of an example application creation process in accordance with an example implementation is now provided. After application commencement is agreed upon, the overall BOPS admin creates a user with the special role of orirginalSiteAdmin. Once the original site admin exists, the first action of the person with the originalSiteAdmin role associates his\/her biometrics with identity. Thereafter, actions have genesis and API. Additionally, the originalSiteAdmin role can create users of siteAdmin role.

These rules can include: 1) the client authentication device does not require additional devices; 2) false negatives must be below a pre-defined percentage (e.g., <1%); false positives must be below a pre-defined percentage (e.g., <0.5%). Other rules can include 4) the client software blacklists itself if the user fails more than a predefined number (X) of consecutive times. Further, the client can have a client intrusion detection system capable of seeing patterns of trial and error and blacklisting itself. Applications designed for use with BOPS can include some form of Intrusion Detection, whereby the software can detect spoofing attempts and restrict access to the backend system, defined, for example, as X amount of tries, which then causes the client application to stop working for X period of time or indefinitely until the device can be properly assured that it is safe and valid. In addition, rules can include 5) Liveness, in that applications which intend to comply with BOPS include some form of Liveness detection or the ability to ensure that the user being enrolled or authenticated is an actual person and not an image or other representation of the user. For face recognition systems this can be something as simple as blink detection, the point is that some form of anti-spoofing exist to prevent false access to the system. In one or more implementations, an enterprise organization determines which use case is most suitable for a particular implementation.","In one or more implementations, role gathering is retrieved from an authoritative Role Source, e.g., Active Directory, LDAP or relational database Big Data server, or is conducted through an additional API call on a BOPS server to find the list of Roles.

The BOPS client software validates the biometric. The biometric status is sent to the BOPS Server. In one or more implementations, the biometric data itself is not sent to the BOPS Server, to satisfy privacy concerns. Thereafter, the device scans biometric and a sessionID is created. In one or more implementations, the session status sessionId returns sessionNotReady, validationInProgress, userAuthenticated, userRejected, sessionTerminated, sessionExpired. sessionLogoff, and userLogoff. Session Termination brings a logoff notification. Once received, the session can be closed for a future activity as defined by the sessionLogoff in SessionID. SessionID creation failures can be governed by an IDS which can then take appropriate actions to terminate the sessionID creation, this may be blocking IP addresses, blacklisting domains, blacklisting users, or other means. The blacklisting has a hierarchy of restricting access to the system based on the complex machine learning rules.","Turning now to an example access control API, given sessionId, the data label and the access are allowed. In one or more implementations, the set of data in JSON format (JSONArray of JSONObjects) is a securityLabel field. The security label field is matched against the roles associated with the user through the session. If the data (JSONObject) is a subset of the roles, then the data is returned. Otherwise, the partial data of JSONObject is not returned. As the API redirects the call, the returned data becomes restricted. At the redirect API call a getJSON call is intercepted.","The following describes an example implementation in which the access control algorithm is applicable for each user at the session construction time flattened the hierarchies.
