title: System, method and apparatus to allow communication between CICS and non-CICS software applications
abstract: A system, method and apparatus to facilitate the invocation of existing CICS BMS transactions and deliver the executed transaction output to a requesting application as a standardized XML document. Building upon a facility which intercepts the flow of control between a user transaction and BMS, the instant invention replaces the use of terminal-oriented data streams with XML documents. In doing so, the instant invention eliminates the use of prior art techniques, such as “screen scraping”.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["REFERENCE TO PENDING APPLICATIONS","REFERENCE TO MICROFICHE APPENDIX","TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT","Illustrated Of Use"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/262,903, filed Jan. 19, 2001, and incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.","This application is not referenced in any microfiche appendix.","In general, the present invention is directed to a middleware tool to allow communication between two or more disparate and distinct computer operating platforms and applications. In particular, the present invention is directed to a middleware tool to facilitate access to, and execution of, existing CICS transactions from a disparate platform requesting application with output from the executed transaction communicated to said requesting application as an XML document.","The instant invention is a comprehensive software driven solution which provides business enterprises with a quantum leap forward when integrating their existing CICS transactions into scalable e-Business applications. As such the instant invention is believed to be the first solution for invoking existing CICS BMS transactions and delivering their output as an XML document\u2014not a highly restrictive 3270 screen as provided for in today's prior art systems. \u201cXML\u201d refers to Extensible Markup Language and allows designers to create their own customized tags, enabling the definition, transmission, validation, and interpretation of data between applications and between organizations.","The term \u201ctag\u201d refers to a command inserted in a document that specifies how the document, or a portion of the document, should be formatted. Tags are used by all format specifications that store documents as text files. This includes SGML and HTML.","CICS transactions, running on IBM enterprise servers, are the most common category of host-based e-Business transactions. Enterprises have typically extended these transactions to the web using \u201cweb-to-host\u201d products that rely on terminal emulation, screen scraping, proprietary development tools and scripting languages. As corporations continue making the transition from \u2018bricks-and-mortar\u2019 enterprises to \u2018clicks-and-mortar\u2019, they must provide employees, partners, and customers with better access to enterprise data via intranets, extranets and the Internet. This requires a more robust, scalable and cost-effective approach to legacy application and data integration than is afforded by existing art systems. Succinctly stated, industry standards like XML are key to e-Business enablement, but are of no benefit to industry if one of the most common categories of e-Business transactions can not take advantage of its benefit. By replacing terminal-oriented data streams with an XML document containing simple name\/value pairs, the instant invention advances the art and drastically reduces the complexity of integrating CICS data with e-Business applications.","\u201cToday, IBM customers use CICS to process over 30 billion transactions per day with a commercial value of several trillion dollars per week,\u201d says Dr. Geoff Sharman, senior consultant with IBM Transaction Systems. \u201cBy allowing these customers to XML-enable existing transactions without code changes, the instant invention demonstrates how easily CICS transactions can be integrated into rapidly deployed and highly scalable e-business applications.\u201d The instant invention facilitates this integration by providing a platform-neutral, XML pathway from CICS transactions to client application irrespective of the computing platform on which they execute. In doing so, the instant invention completely circumvents the use of 3270 data streams and the many, layered components associated with the screen scraping-based solutions of the present art.","\u201cMany enterprises that are using web-to-host solutions which rely on screen scraping techniques are finding they have difficulty scaling,\u201d says Darcy Fowkes, research director of Internet services for the Aberdeen Group. \u201cThis is unacceptable to organizations that have a large investment in CICS\/BMS applications that are running in high volume, production environments.\u201d These organizations need an alternative to terminal emulation and screen scraping-based technologies to \u201ce-enable\u201d these production environments. The instant invention provides a more direct, XML pathway to middle-tier application servers and the present invention allows the web-enabling of legacy CICS transactions, replacing web-to-host solutions that rely on screen scraping.","The instant invention expresses output from an existing CICS\/BMS transaction as an XML document containing order independent, name-value pairs rather than a fixed format, 3270 screen buffer. This eliminates the client application's dependence on screen formats as well as the need to synchronize changes to the host and client applications. The instant invention is insensitive to changes in the location of fields on a 3270 screen that would cause screen scraping solutions to fail because it intercepts data into, and out of, a CICS transaction before a 3270 data stream is generated as output or expected as input. In fact, using the instant invention, a 3270 data stream is never created. This is possible because the instant invention interacts with CICS applications through the 3270 Bridge interface, a standard feature of CICS Transaction Server version 1.3 (or later). Consequently, no modifications to CICS applications are required; no per-transaction setup is required either.","The instant invention is compatible with any client application or middle-tier application server that can send a request to an IBM mainframe and receive an XML document. This includes, without limitations, IBM WebSphere\u2122, BEA WebLogic\u00ae and SilverStream Application Server. The instant invention also compliments, without limitation, the broad range of evolving middleware technologies based upon XML, including Microsoft BizTalk and SilverStream eXtend\u2122. To paraphrase Fred Holahan, VP & General Manager \u201cAlthough major application software vendors are embracing XML as their eBusiness interoperability standard, the application portfolios of many enterprises include host-based legacy systems. To succeed in eBusiness integration, enterprises need a range of choices for XML-enabling their host-based applications. The instant invention's technology provides a unique approach for XML-enabling CICS terminal-oriented applications, one that complements SilverStream's legacy integration strategy. Once CICS transactions have been XML-enabled using the instant invention, they can be accessed by eXtend to support real-time integrations with Web portals, trading exchanges, vendor packages and non-CICS legacy applications.\u201d","The present invention is directed to a middleware tool that allows access to, and execution of, existing CICS transactions from a desperate and distinct operating system and application. The present invention embodies a system, method and apparatus to facilitate the invocation of existing CICS transactions and deliver said transactions' output to a requesting application as a standardized XML document via interception of the flow of data into and out of a CICS transaction before a 3270 data stream is generated as output or expected as input. This approach preserves the business logic of the CICS applications and provides an industry-standard means of exchanging data between CICS and any other XML-enabled applications.","XML is a data format for structured document exchange between applications. Like HTML, it is a markup language derived from SGML. However, unlike HTML, which the Internet community created to format information and display it across multiple platforms, XML is best suited to organize data for structured document exchange between applications. While HTML specifies how a document should appear, it does not describe what kind of information the document contains or how it is organized. XML allows you to organize information in a standard way that can enable disparate systems to conduct business transactions in a known format. For example, business partners can standardize on specific XML syntax to describe purchase orders and can then automate the transfer of that information across otherwise incompatible systems. The key benefit of retrieving host data in XML is that the information is completely independent of how you wish to display it. Because XML is an industry-standard markup language, it can be used for multiple purposes. For example, an eXtensible Style Language Transformation (XSLT) allows you to map XML tags and transform them to any other format.","The present invention runs on the mainframe under OS\/390. It is built on the foundation of a feature that IBM has recently added to CICS Transaction Server. The 3270 Bridge makes it possible to intercept the flow of data into, and out of, a CICS transaction before a 3270 data stream is generated as output or expected as input. 3270 Bridge works by intercepting the flow of control between the user transaction and BMS, thereby allowing another software component, such as the present invention, to handle input\/output operations for the transaction.","The present invention provides a flexible, scalable, and easy-to-use solution that makes CICS applications usable in e-Business by converting application data to XML. Unlike current art solutions that rely on \u201cscreen scraping\u201d, there is no need to identify field locations on a screen. As a result, if CICS developers make changes to their applications by adding or removing fields on a screen, web applications that use the present invention to access the CICS applications will not be affected. This saves time and money for development staff and reduces the chances that users will receive errors when they access your web applications.","Many current host application access solutions run on intermediate UNIX or NT web servers. Running alongside an SNA stack and a web server, these products receive a 3270 datastream, parse it, and then convert the datastream to HTML for presentation in web browsers. Because so much work is done on the single UNIX or NT machine, these products are unable to scale. They are sufficient for simple business-to-consumer (B2C) applications where occasional users logon to check account status or to see if a library book is on the shelves, but when it comes to the needs of B2B applications that produce thousands of transactions each day, traditional web-to-host technology simply cannot keep up.","The present invention is a solution that allows other applications to access legacy data and use it in innovative ways to reduce training costs, improve business efficiency, and unlock the valuable data companies spend years accumulating in their mainframes.","Consequently, it is an object of the instant invention to accept a request from a client program which specifies the name of a CICS transaction and any required input data; cause said transaction to be executed; intercept the input and output commands; and format said output as an XML document to be returned to the client.","A further object of the instant invention is to allow enterprises to integrate existing CICS transactions into scalable e-business applications.","An additional object of the instant invention is to facilitate communication between CICS and non-CICS platforms and applications absent screen scrapping requirements attendant to prior art systems.","A further object of the instant invention is to provide for XML based communication between CICS transactions and client applications absent need for CICS application transaction or system modification.","Other objects and further scope of the applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description to follow, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings wherein like parts are designated by like reference numerals.","While the making and using of various embodiments of the present invention are discussed in detail below, it should be appreciated that the present invention provides for inventive concepts capable of being embodied in a variety of specific contexts.

The specific form of the input request is unimportant. By way of example, the input request could be an expressed as an XML document, or as delimited URL data from an HTTP query string . Given that the specific form of the input request may vary, it is interpreted and converted into a standard form: the Request Information structure. The purpose of this structure is to put the request information into a form that is consistent across all requests and utilizes native computer data formats for efficiency . The Request Information structure is queried to see whether this is an initial request or a subsequent request. This is determined based upon the presence of a \u2018token\u2019 parameter received with the request. If there is not a token, then it considered to be an initial request. If there is a valid token, it is considered to be a subsequent request . The Context Manager is a data storage device that holds information that is keyed for later retrieval. The Context Manager allows information to be kept independently of the requests. Information stored concerns the context and state of requests. By way of example, the Context Manager is used to save information required to associate a request with CICS resources which may not have the same lifetime . A query is next performed using the request's token as the key, which retrieves the context from the prior request . For a new request, no context exists in the Context Manager. Generate a unique token for this request. Initialize the context data using the token to identify the new context . In order to invoke the requested transaction, the Terminal I\/O Intercept Facility needs certain pieces of information. By way of example, the 3270 Bridge requires information such as the transaction identifier, user identification and password credentials, and the input data required to satisfy any initial input commands issued by the transaction. This information also includes parameters which tell 3270 Bridge how the input and output operations are to be intercepted . On subsequent requests, data received with the client request is used to satisfy input commands issued by the transaction. By way of example, the most common input command issued by a CICS BMS transaction is RECEIVE MAP. The RECEIVE MAP command expects input data to be presented to it in the form of an ADS. The instant invention must formulate the ADS such that it contains all input data received with the client request and\/or required by the application. A 3270 terminal\/controller has a data buffer which can be used to store field data between requests. In order to simulate this behavior, the instant invention uses the ADS's and ADSD's received with previous SEND MAP commands to formulate the ADS expected by a RECEIVE MAP command . The instant invention requests that the Terminal I\/O Intercept Facility begin execution of the requested transaction, and provides it with any required input data or parameters. By way of example, 3270 Bridge requires that the instant invention issue a CICS START command . The instant invention requests that the Terminal I\/O Intercept Facility continue execution of the requested transaction. The ADS formulated in step # is provided to the Terminal I\/O Intercept Facility to satisfy the transaction's input command. By way of example, 3270 Bridge requires that the instant invention issue a CICS START command to continue execution of a pseudo-conversational transaction. For a conversational transaction, a CICS START command is not issued . The instant invention waits for one of three conditions: (1) the transaction issues an output command; (2) the transaction ends normally or abnormally; (3) the transaction issues an input command which needs to be satisfied . When the transaction issues an output command, the instant invention saves the output command and related information (e.g., ADS and ADSD) and returns to step #. Transactions can terminate normally or abnormally. The instant invention uses status information provided by the Terminal I\/O Intercept Facility to determine if the transaction ended normally or abnormally . The abnormal end information is used to generate an XML document which describes the error condition . Save all output commands and associated data in Context Manager. This information is used in step # for purposes of simulating the behavior of a 3270 terminal . CICS transactions can request that another transaction be started immediately. This causes the current transaction to end. By way of example, a CICS transaction can start another transaction by issuing the command RETURN IMMEDIATE or START (using the same terminal identifier). CICS will terminate the current transaction and start the specified transaction . The information provided about the transaction to be started is converted into the Request Information structure. This is the format also produced by Step # and expected by Step #. A standard format for describing transaction requests allows them to be queued and processed more easily (there is no advanced information about how many transactions may ultimately be started) . In step #, all the data from the output commands was collected and stored into a buffer. Now the instant invention will loop through the collected output commands and data, processing each in sequential order. In order to simulate the behavior of a 3270 terminal, the ADS may be created or modified during this process in steps #, #.  and #... This step queries the output command to see if it includes an ADSD. In most cases, the ADSD is provided with the output command. There are exceptions. By way of example, one case is when the SEND MAP command specified the MAPONLY option. The other case is when the map generation process did not specify that an ADSD was to be created and included in the physical map . If the ADSD was not included with the output command, then the instant invention will attempt to retrieve it from the physical map (the ADSD is an optional part of the physical map). By way of example, a BMS transaction specifies the name of the physical map using the MAPSET and MAP options of the SEND MAP command. The physical map is acquired through the use of the CICS LOAD command. Once acquired, the instant invention examines the physical map to determine if the ADSD is present . Check to see if Step # was successful in retrieving the ADSD from the physical map . If the ADSD is successfully retrieved in step # it is added to the output command so that it now contains a valid ADSD. The output command now has an ADSD but no ADS. This step calls a procedure that creates an ADS using the physical map and ADSD . This step assesses the output command to determine what information the transaction wants to be sent to the terminal (or simulated terminal): either the static data from the physical map, variable data from the ADS, or both. By way of example, a BMS transaction can specify a data indicator flag on a SEND MAP command. Valid values for this flag are MAPONLY and DATAONLY. If MAPONLY is specified, only static data from the physical map will be sent to the terminal. If DATAONLY is specified only variable data from the ADS will be sent to the terminal. If neither option is specified, both static and variable data will be sent to the terminal .. The output command indicated that both the static data from the physical map and the variable data from the ADS are to be sent to the terminal. This step calls a procedure which merges information from the physical map into the ADS .. In order to correctly simulate the behavior of a 3270 terminal, the instant invention must manage the contents of a composite ADS. This step calls a procedure which manages the composite ADS and merges it into the current ADS .. Generate the XML document describing the transaction output. The detailed process is diagramed starting at Step #. The ADSD was not found in the physical map. An XML document is generated which describes the error condition and possible solutions . The XML document is sent in response to the client request received in step #. The instant invention waits for the next request to arrive. Once a request arrives, it begins processing at step #.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0090","num":"0089"},"figref":"FIGS. 8 and 8A","b":["8","31","32","33","33","5","34","37"]},"<transaction> . The status element at this level of the XML document conveys information about the success or failure of the requested transaction. Any error is described using a decimal numeric code as well as a human readable description. The parameters element describes the input parameters received with the client request. The parameters element contains dependent elements which describe the individual parameter names and values specified . Return to point from which this procedure was invoked . The instant invention ends the transaction element with the tag: <\/transaction> . The command element of the XML document contains one dependent element for each output command issued by the transaction. This step begins the command element using the tag: <command> . For each output command issued by the transaction, the instant invention will perform the steps beginning at Step #. The cursor position has three possible modes: none\u2014no cursor position was specified; positional\u2014a zero based numeric value was specified which represents the offset into the screen buffer of a 3270 terminal'; and symbolic Cursor Positioning\u2014one of the fields was flagged as containing the cursor. The cursor type and its associated data are expressed as XML .. The instant invention ends the command element using the tag: <\/command> . Each output command issued by the transaction is described by an element. This step ends the element started in step #. The instant invention uses the name of the BMS command issued by the transaction as the name of the element. For example, if a SEND MAP command is issued by the transaction, the element will be named send_map and ended with the tag: <\/send_map> . The fields element started in step # is closed with the end tag: <\/fields> . Start the XML Fields element. By way of example, this element is started by including the <fields> tag in the XML document. The fields element will contain zero or more field elements (one field element for each field in current map) . For each field in the current ADS, a field element will be included in the XML document . Different clients may have preferences for how field elements are named. By way of example, the instant invention supports two naming conventions. Field elements can be generated either as <field> or as the actual field name used in the BMS MAP (e.g., <lastname>). The instant invention relies upon a flag, referred to as \u201cUse BMS Field\u201d, to determine which convention to use. This flag is controlled by means of an optional parameter provided with the request . The \u201cUse BMS Field\u201d flag was not specified. As a result, the instant invention uses a generic identifier for the field element, such as <field> . The \u201cUse BMS Field\u201d flag was specified. As a result, the instant invention now generates the field element using the name of the BMS field as the element name. By way of example, for a field named \u201clastname\u201d, the field element would be generated as: <lastname> . Since the BMS field name was not used as the name of the field element, a name element is generated. The value of the name element will be the BMS field name. By way of example, for a field named \u201clastname\u201d the name element would be generated as: <name>lastname<\/name> . The value element is used to contain the current value of a field. By way of example, for a field whose current value is \u201csmith\u201d, the value element would be generated as: <value>smith<\/value>. The attr element is used to specify the current attributes of a field. Field attributes are expressed as attributes of the <attr> element (e.g., <attr byte=\u201c60\u201d justify=\u201cl\u201d disp=\u201cy\u201d prot=\u201cy\u201d num=\u201cn\u201d int=\u201cn\u201d mdt=\u201cn\u201d\/>) .","The extattr element is used to specify the current extended attributes of a field. Extended attributes are expressed as attributes of the <extattr> element (e.g., <extattr color=\u201cblue\u201d hlt=\u201cdef\u201d\/>) . Symbolic cursor positioning may be used by a transaction to denote in which field the cursor is to be located. This step queries the current field in the ADS to see if the symbolic cursor positioning flag is on. This flag indicates that the cursor should be placed in this field when displayed on a 3270 terminal . Generate the cursor_flag element within the current field element. The cursor_flag element is expressed as a null element (no value); for example, <cursor_flag\/> . The tag generated to end the field element depends on how it was started. If the \u201cUse BMS Field\u201d flag was not specified, then the field element will be ended with the tag: <\/field>. If the \u201cUse BMS Field\u201d flag was specified, the field element will be ended with a tag based upon the name of the current field. By way of example, for a field named \u201clastname\u201d, the field element would be ended with the tag <\/lastname> .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0093","num":"0092"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["70","71","72","74","75","76","77","79"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0094","num":"0093"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["80","81","82","83","84","85","86","87","88","89","91"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0095","num":"0094"},"figref":"FIG. 11","b":["100","100","101","103","104","105","35","107","108"]},"By way of example and instruction, we now illustrate and compare the invocation and use of a sample CICS BMS transaction using both a 3270 terminal and the instant invention.","The CICS BMS transaction used in this illustration is one that simulates a stock trading application. The Share Trading Demonstration transaction, or TRAD, guides the end user through a sequence of screens that allows them to first select a company, and then select the action to be performed (i.e., obtain a quote, buy shares, or sell shares). Once these items are specified, it will then display the requested information on the terminal screen. The CICS transaction uses the BMS commands SEND MAP and RECEIVE MAP to communicate with the terminal.","First, we will illustrates how to use a 3270 terminal to obtain a stock quote for the Casey Import Export Company using the sample transaction.","The first step in executing any CICS transaction from a terminal is entering the transaction name on the screen.

(An HTTP query string begins with a \u201c?\u201d, and individual parameters are separated by an \u201c&\u201d).
