{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Computer software in the form of application programs may be distributed to consumers through online storefronts or libraries that are accessible by consumers via communication networks such as the Internet. Some application programs request data from information services that run on remote servers to provide functionality. However, these application programs may suffer degraded operation if these information services are no longer responsive to the application programs or no longer provide suitable responses to requests made by the application programs. For example, a software developer may discontinue support for an application program some time after the application program has been made available to consumers through online storefronts or libraries. Following such discontinuation of support, consumers that have purchased these application programs, may find that the application programs suffer from degraded operation. Further, other consumers may unknowingly purchase an application for which support has been discontinued, only to find that it does not work properly.","Implementations for automated testing of application programs from an application program ecosystem are disclosed. As one example, a server system is disclosed that includes an application program management service executed at the server system. The application program management service may be configured to identify one or more networked components of a target application program of a plurality of application programs accessible at an application program data store by clients via a communication network. The application program management service may be configured to test the one or more networked components of the target application program, and output an indication of a result of the test of the target application program. Claimed subject matter, however, is not limited by this summary as other implementations may be disclosed by the following written description and associated drawings.","Automated testing of application programs from an application program ecosystem is disclosed in a variety of contexts. An application program management service of a server system may evaluate the health of application programs of an application program data store. The application program data store may be exposed to clients of a communication network via an online storefront or library, for example. In at least some implementations, the application program management service may execute an instance of a target application program at a test bench that simulates a client. In other implementations, the application program management service may utilize test result data and\/or test parameter data obtained from one or more clients of the communication network to evaluate the health of the application programs. Implementations for obtaining test result data and\/or test parameter data from clients are disclosed. Application program health values may be associated with application programs to enable filtering of the application programs and publication of the application program health values.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","110","110","112","112","124","126","128","110","110","118"]},"Application program management service  may be configured to identify one or more networked components of a target application program. A target application program may be one of a plurality of application programs  accessible by clients at application program data store  of server system  or application program data store  of remote server system via communication network . Communication network  may comprise one or more of a local area network or a wide area network such as the Internet, for example. An example client  is depicted in . Client  refers to a client device such as a mobile device, personal computer, or other suitable electronic device that may be operated by a human user.","In at least some implementations, the one or more networked components of the target application program may include one or more respective network resources. A network resource may comprise any suitable element of information that may be accessed by an application program over a communication network. Each network resource may be referenced by the target application program via a corresponding hyperlink (e.g., referring to a network address of the network resource) or an application programming interface. For example, the one or more networked components of a target application program may refer to one or more network resources  residing at an application services server . An instance of an application program that is executed at client  or at server system  may request network resources , and may receive responses to such requests from applications services server . An application program that is unable to obtain suitable access to network resources may suffer degraded operation or performance due to the unavailability of the network resources.","Application program management service  may be configured to test the one or more networked components of a target application program, and associate an indication of a result of the test with the target application program, for example, at application program data store  or application program data store . In , the result of the test may correspond to the depicted test result data .","In at least some implementations, application program management service  may be configured to identify the one or more networked components of the target application program by executing an instance of the target application program. For example, application program management service  may execute an instance of a target application program, and may traverse or attempt to traverse each hyperlink (e.g., of a graphical user interface) or application programming interface of the target application in an attempt to access respective networked components of the target application program. Application program management service  may be configured to send requests to each networked component of the target application program, and monitor response traffic for success messages (e.g., an HTTP 200 OK message) or error messages (e.g., an HTTP 404 Not Found message) received in response to such requests.","Application program management service  may be configured to output, for example, by presenting an indication of a result of the test, or transmitting the indication of the result of the test to one or more clients via communication network  for presentation at the one or more clients, or otherwise publishing the indication of the result of the test to a network location accessible by one or more clients via communication network . The sharing of the results of the tests among clients may enable consumers to make more informed decisions regarding purchasing or acquiring such application programs, and may enable administrators of online storefronts or libraries to exclude application programs that have failed the tests.","In at least some implementations, application program management service  may be configured to filter a target application program relative to the plurality of application programs  of application program data store  based, at least in part, on the indication of the result of the test associated with the target application program. As one example, application program management service  may be configured to filter the plurality of application programs  of the application program data store  to obtain a subset of acceptable application programs from the plurality of application programs of the application program data store. The acceptable application programs may have at least a threshold ratio of success responses relative to error responses. Application program management service  may be configured to exclude one or more application programs not included in the subset of acceptable application programs from being accessed by requesting clients over the communication network, or may otherwise reduce availability of the application programs not included in the subset of acceptable application programs.","In at least some implementations, application program management service  may be configured to test the networked component of the target application program by applying an automated test framework of a test harness program to the target application program, and may be configured to receive the result of the test from the test harness program. The test harness program may provide a test bench that simulates a client of communication network . However, in other implementations, application program management service  may be configured to deploy a test harness program such as deployable testing module  to a client having an instance of the target application program via the communication network to cause the client to execute the instance of the target application program, identify the networked component of the target application program, and test the networked component of the target application program.","For example, application program management service  is depicted with deployable testing module , and client  is depicted with testing module  that may correspond to an instance of deployable testing module . In this implementation, the test harness program (e.g., testing module ) may be executable by client  to send a response from client  to server system  via communication network  that includes the indication of the result of the test performed by the client. In at least some implementations, testing module  may form part of operating system  or browser program  of client . As previously described, testing module  may be deployed to client  by server system  in at least some implementations. As one example, testing module  may be provided as a plug-in, or other suitable set of instructions that are executable by client . A processor  of client  may execute instructions  held in storage device , including testing module  and application programs .","In at least some implementations, application program management service  may be configured to, for each application program of the plurality of application programs  including at least the target application program: identify the one or more networked components of the application program by executing an instance of the application program; test the one or more networked components of the application program; and associate an indication of a result of the test with the application program (e.g., as test result data ). In at least some implementations, application program management service  may be configured to rank the plurality of application programs  based, at least in part, on the respective indication associated with each application program of the plurality of application programs . The rank of the plurality of application programs may be presented to a user via browser program  of client , for example.","In at least some implementations, test result data may be obtained from clients. For example, testing module  of client  may be configured to monitor response traffic received at client  via communication network  that are responsive to respective requests made by one or more application programs  executed at client . Testing module  may be configured to, for a given response message of the response traffic, associate an indication of whether the response message includes an error message or a success message with an application program identifier corresponding to a target application program of the plurality of application programs. Testing module  may be configured to send a reporting message from client  to server system  via communication network . The reporting message may include an application program identifier for the target application program, and may include the indication of whether the response message includes an error message or a success message. In at least some implementations, the reporting message may further include an indication or identifier of a networked component corresponding to the response message. The networked component may include a network resource referenced by the target application program via a corresponding hyperlink or an application programming interface, for example.","In at least some implementations, testing module  may be configured to send the reporting message from client  to server system  via communication network  responsive to client  registering with an application program storefront or library provided by the server system . As one example, application program management service  may require that testing module  provide test result data to server system  in order to gain access to an online storefront or library for application program data store , or may provide increased functionality to clients within the online storefront or library in response to the clients providing test result data to server system .","Application program management service  may be configured to receive the reporting message from client  at server system . Test result data of the reporting message may be stored as server system  as depicted by test result data . In at least some implementations, application program management service  may be configured to combine the indication of whether the response message includes an error message or a success message with other indications associated with the application program identifier received from client  or other clients via communication network  to obtain a combined application program health value for the target application program corresponding to the application program identifier. Application program management service  may be configured to present an indication of the combined application program health value, or transmit the indication of the combined application program health value from server system  to one or more clients (e.g., another client) via communication network  for presentation, or publish the indication of the combined application program health value to a network location accessible by one or more clients (e.g., one or more other clients) via communication network . The sharing of application program health values with other clients may enable users to make more informed decisions regarding purchasing or acquiring application programs.","In at least some implementations, testing module  may be configured to combine at client , the indication of whether the response message includes an error message or a success message with one or more other indications associated with the application program identifier of whether one or more other response messages of the response traffic include an error message or success message. In these implementations, testing module  may be configured to send the reporting message from client  to server system  via communication network  by sending the combination of the indication and the one or more other indications from client  to server system  via communication network .","In at least some implementations, test result data and\/or test parameter data may be obtained from clients. Test parameter data may enable server system  to independently obtain test result data for a target application program residing at a client. For example, testing module  may be configured to identify one or more networked components of each of a plurality of application programs residing at client . Each networked component may have a corresponding network address and testing code. The testing code may be obtained by testing module  from network resources  of application services server  via communication network  or may be generated by testing module  from information contained within the target application program.","Testing module  may be configured to send a test parameter message containing test parameter data from client  to server system  via communication network . The test parameter message may include one or more network addresses and one or more testing codes corresponding to the one or more networked components of a target application program of the plurality of application programs , and may further include an application program identifier for the target application program. An example of test parameter data received from client  is depicted at server system  as test parameter data .","In at least some implementations, testing module  may be configured to send a test parameter message from client  to server system  via communication network  responsive to client  registering with an application program storefront or library provided by the server system . As one example, application program management service  may require that testing module  provide a test parameter data to server system  in order to gain access to an online storefront or library for application program data store , or may provide increased functionality to clients within the online storefront or library in response to the clients providing test parameter data to server system .","Application program management service  may be configured to receive the test parameter message at server system  via communication network . Application program management service  may be configured to send one or more request messages including the one or more testing codes from server system  via communication network  to one or more network addresses corresponding to the one or more networked components. For example, application program management service  may be configured to send one or more testing codes to network resources  of application services server . Server system  may simulate a client requesting network resources for a target application. Application program management service  may be configured to monitor response traffic received at server system  via communication network  responsive to the one or more request messages. Application program management service  may be configured to, for a response message of the response traffic, associate an indication of whether the response message includes a success message or an error message with the application program identifier for the target application program.","As previously described, application program management service  may be configured to combine two or more indications of whether response messages include error messages or success messages to obtain a combined application program health value for the target application program corresponding to the application program identifier. Application program management service  may be configured to filter the target application program relative to other application programs based, at least in part, on the combined application program health value as previously described. Application program management service  may be configured to present an indication of the combined application program health value, or transmit the indication of the combined application program health value from server system  to another client via communication network  for presentation at the another client, or publish the indication of the combined application program health value to a network location accessible by one or more other clients via communication network . Again, the sharing of application program health values with other clients may enable users to make more informed decisions regarding purchasing or acquiring application programs.

For example, a user may operate a browser program of a client to request information relating to an application program, or to request purchase or download of an application program via application program browser module .","Application program delivery module  may be configured to receive and respond to requests for a plurality of application programs of an application program data store (e.g., application program data store ) from a plurality of clients via a communication network. For example, application program browser module  may be configured to pass requests for an application program to application program delivery module  once a client has purchased the application program. Application program delivery module  may be configured to send an instance of the application program to the client via a communication network.","Application program health identification module  may be configured to identify the one or more networked components of a target application program, test the one or more networked components, and associate the indication of a result of the test with the target application program at the application program data store accessible by the clients via the communication network as previously described.

As previously described, a networked component may include a network resource referenced by the target application program via a corresponding hyperlink or an application programming interface as previously described with reference to .","At , the method may include testing the one or more networked components of the target application program. For example, the one or more networked components may be tested by sending a request message to each networked component of the target application and monitoring response traffic to identify whether a response message received from a networked component includes a success message (e.g., an HTTP 200 OK message) or an error message (e.g., an HTTP 404 Not Found) responsive to the request message. A response message may be received from each networked component in some scenarios. In at least some implementations, testing the one or more networked components may include applying an automated test framework of a test harness program to the target application program, and receiving the result from the test harness program.","In at least some implementations, a result of a test of a target application program may comprise one or more values corresponding to the response message received from each of the one or more networked components of the target application program. For example, a target application program that includes seven networked components may have a test result that comprises seven values. Each value of the test result may indicate whether a response message that was received in response to a request for a networked element of the target application program included a success message or an error message. Two or more values of a test result may be combined in any suitable manner to provide a test result having a combined value that is indicative of the individual values of the networked components that were tested.","At , the method may include associating an indication of the result of the test with the target application program.
