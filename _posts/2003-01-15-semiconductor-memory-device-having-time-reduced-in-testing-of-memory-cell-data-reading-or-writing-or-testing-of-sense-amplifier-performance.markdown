title: Semiconductor memory device having time reduced in testing of memory cell data reading or writing, or testing of sense amplifier performance
abstract: In a read out mode, a NAND circuit to which latch data of both bit lines are input provides an L output when potentials of the bit line pair are constantly identical, and provides an H output when the potentials of the bit line pair change, even when the word line rendered active is switched. In a writing mode, the NAND circuit provides an L output. In a reading mode, H is applied to the gate of a first transistor that connects a bit line BL with the NAND circuit. In a writing mode, H is applied to the gate of the first transistor or a second transistor that connects a bit line /BL with the NAND circuit. Potential change occurs at the bit line pair according to an output of the NAND circuit.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to semiconductor memory devices, particularly to a semiconductor memory device with testing capability.","2. Description of the Background Art","Reflecting the increased scale of integration of semiconductor memory devices, the testing time required to confirm the operation has becomes longer. The time required for testing is extremely increased if the pass\/fail determination of memory cells are effected in units of 1 bit each. An approach to reduce the testing time is taken by carrying out the pass\/fail determination for a plurality of memory cells at the same time. This method of testing in the units of several memory cells is called \u201cmultibit testing\u201d.","Multibit testing is described in detail in, for example, \u201cUltra LSI Memory\u201d, pp. 183\u2013185 by Kiyoo Ito, published by Baihukan, 1994. A method of multibit testing will be described based on this document.","Referring to  showing the concept of multibit testing, a memory cell array  includes X\u00d7Y memory cells. Memory array  is divided into subarrays #1\u2013#q. Each subarray includes a data input\/output line pair GPIO , a write driver , and a preamplifier . One bit line pair is connected to GPIO for every subarray.","In a write operation, all write drivers  are rendered active. Test data sent from a terminal DQ is transferred to the bit line pair connected to GPIO. Accordingly, test data is written into all the q memory cells located at respective crossings between the bit line pair and activated word line. This is conducted on all word lines and bit line pairs.","In contrast to the general method in which test data is written for each memory cell (for each 1 bit) requiring a writing process of X\u00d7Y times, a writing process of only X\u00d7Y\/q times is required in multibit testing. The writing time of test data can be reduced to 1\/q.","In a read mode, all preamplifiers  are rendered active at the same time. Test data of the same value are read out simultaneously from the q memory cells located at the crossings of the bit line pair connected to GPIO and the activated word line. The read out test data are transferred to a NOR circuit . NOR circuit  outputs an H level (logical high) at a terminal DQ when all the transmitted data match, and outputs an L level (logical low) at terminal DQ when at least one does not match.","In contrast to the general method of reading out test data for every memory cell (for every 1 bit) requiring a read process of X\u00d7Y times, the read process is required only X\u00d7Y\/q times in multibit testing. The time required for reading out test data can be reduced to 1\/q.","In such a multibit testing, the time required for testing can further be reduced by increasing the number q of divided subarrays.","However, increasing the number q of subarrays will require a corresponding number of preamplifiers, write drivers, and GPIOs, whereby the circuit scale will become larger. According to the aforementioned document, it is estimated that the value of q in a memory array of X\u00d7Y=256 Mbits is 128 at most. With the ever increasing scale of integration in the field of semiconductor memory devices, the need to significantly reduce the testing time is noted.","When data is read out from a memory cell, the potential difference between paired bit lines is amplified by a sense amplifier. The potential difference between the bit lines applied to the sense amplifier may become small due to variation caused by noise or the like. It is desirable that the sense amplifier can properly amplify the potential difference even when of a small level caused by such variation. The need arises for the performance evaluation of whether the sense amplifier can amplify a small potential difference with a simple configuration.","An object of the present invention is to provide a semiconductor memory device of a simple structure that can write test data into a memory array in a short processing time, and a semiconductor memory device that can check whether test data has been properly read out from the memory array.","Another object of the present invention is to provide a semiconductor memory device that can conduct performance evaluation on a sense amplifier with a simple structure.","A semiconductor memory device according to an aspect of the present invention operates in a test mode to conduct testing of reading out memory cell data, includes a first circuit provided corresponding to a bit line pair having data of both bit lines of a relevant bit line pair respectively input for a plurality of times to output a first logic value when the data of each bit line input for the plurality of time are the same data, and output a second logic value when the data differ; a first control circuit sequentially rendering active a plurality of word lines connected to a plurality of memory cells such that data of a bit line pair corresponding to a memory cell is sequentially applied to the first circuit; and a second control circuit transferring an output of the first circuit to one bit line of a bit line pair, and providing data according to a potential of the relevant bit line pair outside the semiconductor memory device when processing under control of the first control circuit ends. Identification can be made whether the value output from the first circuit indicates a first logic value or a second logic value depending on the data provided outside the semiconductor memory device. Determination can be made whether the stored test data has been properly read out or not. Also, checking whether test data has been properly read out from the memory array can be conducted with a simple structure and in a short period of processing time.","According to another aspect of the present invention, a semiconductor memory device includes a first circuit provided for every bit line pair; and a control circuit sequentially rendering active a plurality of word lines to apply an output of the first circuit to one bit line of a bit line pair according to the arrangement of the word line rendered active to alter the potential of the bit line pair from a precharged voltage such that test data is written into a memory cell connected to the relevant word line that is rendered active by the potential of the altered bit line pair. Thus, test data can be written into the memory array with a simple structure and in a short period of processing time.","According to a further aspect of the present invention, a semiconductor memory device includes a first circuit provided corresponding to a bit line pair to output a predetermined logic state; a second circuit provided between the first circuit and one bit line of the bit line pair, formed of a switch that conducts in response to activation of a control signal; a first control circuit rendering the control signal active in response to a row active designation after activation of a sense amplifier, and rendering the control signal inactive when a predetermined external signal attains a predetermined logic value; and a second control circuit in response to a bit line pair read out designation to provide data outside the semiconductor memory device according to a potential of a relevant bit line pair amplified by the sense amplifier. Thus, a status in which the potential difference of paired bit lines is set small is intentionally produced to evaluate the performance of the sense amplifier with a simple structure.","The foregoing and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the present invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.","First Embodiment","Referring to , a DRAM  according to a first embodiment of the present invention includes an internal power supply potential generation circuit , a row address buffer , a column address buffer , a row decoder , a column decoder , a memory array , a memory array peripheral circuit group , an input\/output circuit , and a control circuit .","Internal power supply potential generation circuit  generates internal power supply potential VDDS, VBL, VPP, VCP, VBB and the like based on externally applied power supply potential VCC and ground potential VSS to supply the generated internal power supply potential to other elements in DRAM .","VDDS is supplied to a control circuit, a sense amplifier, or the like as an operating power supply voltage, and is generated by down-converting external power supply voltage VCC.

Each memory cell is specified by a row address and a column address. It is assumed that memory array  of the present embodiment has the so-called half pitch cell arrangement structure.","Referring to the half pitch cell arrangement of the memory array in , a pair of memory cells MCP is arranged periodically at a crossing of two word lines WL and one bit line BL or \/BL.

Accordingly, NAND circuit  provides an H output.","(3) ACT","Internal signal generation circuit  responds to externally applied \/RAS=L, \/CAS=H and WE=H to output INTZRAS=L, INTZCAS=H, and INTZWE=H.","Command decode circuit  responds to INTZRAS=L, INTZCAS=H, and INTZWE=H to output a row active signal RXT of an H level. WL activation circuit  does not pull up word line WLi to an H level by SAMBTOUT=H.","Test execution control signal generation circuit  responds to row active signal RXT of an H level to pull up sense amplifier activation signal SON to an H level. Test execution control signal generation circuit  responds to row active signal RXT=H, SAMBTOUT=H and \/RAS=L to pull up SALATOUT to an H level (one shot pulse) before sense amplifier activation signal SON is pulled up to an H level. SALATOUT attains an L level when \/RAS=L. Therefore, the pulse width of SALATOUT=H can be adjusted by adjusting time width \u0394t of \/RAS=L.","Since NAND circuit  provides an H output, N channel MOS transistor  is rendered conductive by SALATOUT=H. Bit line BL attains the level of VDDS\/2+\u0394V. A shorter pulse width of SALATOUT=H will reduce the conducting duration of N channel MOS transistor . Therefore, \u0394V becomes smaller.","By sense amplifier activation signal SON=H, sense amplifier  is rendered active. If potential difference \u0394V is large enough, sense amplifier  amplifies potential difference \u0394V, whereby bit lines BL and \/BL are driven to an H level and an L level, respectively. However, sense amplifier  cannot properly amplify the potential difference \u0394V if potential difference \u0394V is too small. As a result, BL=H and \/BL=L may be achieved which are different results from the original results.","(4) READ Mode","Internal signal generation circuit  responds to externally applied \/RAS=H, \/CAS=L and \/WE=H to output INTZRAS=H, INTZCAS=L, and INTZWE=H.","Command decode circuit  responds to INTZRAS=H, INTZCAS=L and INTZWE=H to output a read operation designation signal \/RE of an H level.","Column decoder  responds to read operation designation signal \/RE of an H level to accept internal address signals INTA\u2013 from column address buffer . Column decoder  pulls up the potential of column select line CSLj (j=0\u201332767) to the selected level of H according to the logic states of the 15 bits of internal address signals INTA\u2013. Accordingly, N channel MOS transistors  and  of column select gate  connected to that column select line CSLj are rendered conductive, whereby the bit line pair BL and \/BL connected to that column select gate is coupled with data input\/output line pair GPIO (GIO and \/GIO).","In response to \/RE=H, preamplifier  is rendered active. Since BL=H and \/BL=L when sense amplifier  amplifies properly, a signal of an H level is provided to input\/output terminal DQ. In the case where sense amplifier  has amplified erroneously, BL=L and \/BL=H are achieved, whereby an L output is provided to input\/output terminal DQ.","(5) The above process of (4) is repeated 32768 times with the value j of column select line CSLj (j=0\u201332767) altered.","(6) PRE Mode","Internal signal generation circuit  responds to externally applied \/RAS=L, \/CAS=H and \/WE=L to output INTZRAS=L, INTZCAS=H, and INTZWE=L.","Command decode circuit  responds to INTZRAS=L, INTZCAS=H, and INTZWE=L to latch row active signal RXT=L.","Test execution control signal generation circuit  responds to row active signal RXT=L to pull up bit line equalize signal BLEQ to an H level. In response, equalizer  is rendered active. As a result, the potentials of bit lines BL and \/BL attain a fixed state of the level of VBL (=VDDS\/2).","Test execution control signal generation circuit  also pulls down sense amplifier activation signal SON to an L level by row active signal RXT of an L level.","Examples of the performance test results of sense amplifier  will be described with reference to , B and C that represent the data provided to input\/output terminal DQ, i.e. the data read out when \u0394t is altered.","It is appreciated from the results of sense amplifier A of  that all the levels read out are H (correct results) at 10 ns\u22121 ns with sense amplifier A. Therefore, evaluation can be made that sense amplifier A is of good performance.","It is appreciated from the results of sense amplifier B shown in  that the read out data attains an L level (erroneous result) when \u0394t becomes as small as 2 ns. Therefore, evaluation can be made that sense amplifier B is of inferior performance.","It is appreciated from the results of sense amplifier C shown in  that the data read out varies between an H level (correct result) and an L level (erroneous result) when \u0394t becomes as small as 2 ns. Therefore, evaluation can be made that the performance of sense amplifier C is inferior.","In the second embodiment, the potential change of a pair of bit lines is intentionally made small based on a structure similar to that of the first embodiment to evaluate the performance of the sense amplifier.","The present invention is not limited to the above embodiments, and may include modifications set forth below.","(1) Although the DRAM of the present embodiment includes a sense amplifier performance evaluation capability in addition to the test data writing and reading capability of the first embodiment, the DRAM of the second embodiment may include only the sense amplifier performance evaluation capability.","(2) SALATOUT may be rendered active by a boosted voltage VPP, likewise the first embodiment.","Although the present invention has been described and illustrated in detail, it is clearly understood that the same is by way of illustration and example only and is not to be taken by way of limitation, the spirit and scope of the present invention being limited only by the terms of the appended claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":"100"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":"120"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":"150"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":"130"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":"160"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 11","b":"140"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 12","b":"170"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIGS. 13 and 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIGS. 15 and 16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 18","b":"400"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 19","b":"640"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 20","b":"410"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 21","b":"12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIGS. 22A","b":["22","22"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 23"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
