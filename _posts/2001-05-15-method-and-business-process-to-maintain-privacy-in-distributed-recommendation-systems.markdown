title: Method and business process to maintain privacy in distributed recommendation systems
abstract: A distributed recommendation system and method are disclosed that provides greater privacy for the user's private data. The method distributes the tasks of a recommendation system between wireless devices and network servers, so as to protect the privacy of end users. The system and method provide greater privacy for context-sensitive, adaptive, user interfaces for Internet service usage by wireless devices. The users wireless device sends a current context-activity pair to a network server in response to either the user's selection of an activity or automatically. The server then responds an appropriate recommendation. Recommendations received from the server by the wireless device are filtered to identify new or significant information. As the system makes new recommendations to users in response to context-activity pairs submitted by their wireless devices, the server gathers the new context-activity pairs and recommendations and adds them to its context-activity pair database.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DISCUSSION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The invention disclosed broadly relates to methods for providing Internet services and more particularly relates to improvements in mobile device accessing of Internet recommendation services.","2. Background Art","Mobile phones and wireless personal digital assistants (PDAs) are able to access the Internet using I-Mode protocol, mobile IPv6 protocol or the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP). WAP-enabled wireless devices can now access Internet applications such as headline news, exchange rates, sports results, stock quotes, weather forecasts, multilingual phrase dictionaries, personal online calendars, online travel and banking services, or download distinctive ringing tones. Broadband wireless networks make it possible for WAP-enabled wireless devices to exchange multimedia messages that combine conventional text with much richer content types, such as photographs, images, voice clips, and video clips. WAP-enabled wireless devices can be used to pay bills online using the wireless device as a virtual wallet. WAP-enabled wireless devices can deliver useful and informative advertising and transaction services from online merchants. WAP-enabled wireless devices now also provide entertainment services, such as interactive adventure games, quizzes, and chess tournaments.","Recommendation systems use information of the activity histories or preferences of numerous users to produce useful recommendations for a single user. Existing recommendation systems use collaborative filtering methods to produce recommendations for an individual user by analyzing the actions and preferences of a group of individuals. As the use of information technology has become widespread in all areas of human life, the concerns of individuals over their privacy have increased. Specifically, most distributed recommendation systems were developed for wireline Internet services, and the privacy concerns will significantly increase as the services are adopted for use by more personal, wireless devices.","What is needed is a distributed recommendation system that provides greater privacy for the user's private data. What is needed is a way to distribute the tasks of a recommendation system between wireless devices and network servers in a way that protects the privacy of end users. What is needed is a way of creating greater privacy for context-sensitive, adaptive, user interfaces for Internet service usage by wireless devices.","The invention is a distributed recommendation system that provides enhanced privacy for the user's private data. The invention distributes the tasks of a recommendation system between wireless devices and network servers, so as to protect the privacy of end users. The invention provides enhanced privacy for context-sensitive, adaptive, user interfaces for Internet service usage by wireless devices.","The invention enables a mobile phone or wireless PDA to use context inference techniques to sense the user's environment and in response, to provide a recommendation to the user that is appropriate to the user's perceived environment.","One aspect of the invention is a method that includes the steps of receiving sensor signals characterizing a current environment of a user's wireless device; processing the sensor signals with a context inference engine; outputting a current context result from the processing by context inference engine; and providing a recommendation to the user in response to the current context result. The step of providing a recommendation is embodied as programmed instructions executed in a network server. In accordance with the invention, context-activity pair information is sent to the server without any user identification.","The sensor signals characterizing the current environment of the user's wireless device can be, for example, positioning signals, touch signals, audio signals, compass signals, ambient light signals, ambient temperature signals, three-axis acceleration signals, time signals, or the device's operational mode signals.","In another aspect of the invention, the step of providing a recommendation is embodied as programmed instructions executed within a separate network server in response to context-activity pair signals received from the user's wireless device. A context-activity pair database is maintained by the server which associates context-activity pair information with appropriate recommendations made in the past to many users. As the system makes new recommendations to users in response to context-activity pairs submitted by their wireless devices, the server gathers the new recommendations and adds them to its context-activity pair database. No user personal data is included in the context-activity pair database. In this manner, the variety, quality and pertinence of the recommendations in the context-activity pair database grows as the recommendation system is used. As an added benefit, the server compiles statistical usage information about the recommendations and stores this in the context-activity pair database.","Another aspect of the invention is providing the current context-activity pair to the server in response to either the user's selection of an activity or automatically, and then receiving an appropriate recommendation from the server. In accordance with the invention, recommendations received from the server by the wireless device are filtered to identify new or significant information. The filtering can be done using statistical usage information associated with the recommendations, user ratings associated with the recommendations, or other factors distinguishing one recommendation from another.","In an alternate embodiment of the invention, the current context information accompanying the activity information sent by the wireless device to the network server, is a metadata representation of the sensor signals characterizing the current state of the wireless device. A context inference engine in the network server is embodied as programmed instructions executed within the server. Where the processing power or memory capacity of the wireless device may be limited, the network server can make a more accurate determination of the mobile user's current context. The resultant current context computed by the server and the activity information received from the wireless device constitute the current context-activity pair. The context-activity pair database maintained by the server associates current context-activity pair with appropriate recommendations made in the past to many users. As the system makes new recommendations to users in response to context-activity pairs submitted by their wireless devices, the server gathers the new recommendations and adds them to its context-activity pair database. No user personal data is included in the context-activity pair database. In this manner, the variety, quality and pertinence of the recommendations in the database grows as the recommendation system is used. As an added benefit, the server compiles statistical usage information about the recommendations and stores this in the context-activity pair database.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","140","180","130","100","114","116","120","120","130","140","100","100","102","102","100","116","102","100"]},"The Nokia WAP Client Version 2.0 is a software product containing the components necessary to implement the WAP client  on the wireless device . These components include a Wireless Markup Language (WML) Browser, WMLScript engine, Push Subsystem, and Wireless Protocol Stack. The Nokia WAP Client is a source-code product that can port and integrate into wireless devices such as mobile phones and wireless PDAs. Application programs  stored in the wireless device  interact with the WAP Client  to implement a variety of communications applications. Details of the Nokia WAP Client Version 2.0 can be found in the online paper: 2.0, Product Overview, Nokia Internet Communications, 2000, www.nokia.com\/corporate\/wap.","The WAP Client  includes the Wireless Public Key infrastructure (PKI) feature, providing the infrastructure and the procedures required for authentication and digital signatures for servers and mobile clients. Wireless PKI is a certificate-based system that utilizes public\/private key pairs associated with each party involved in a mobile transaction. Wireless Identity Module (WIM) is a security token feature of the WAP Client , which includes security features, such as the public and private keys and service certificates, needed for user authentication and digital signatures. Additionally, it has the ability to perform cryptographic operations to encrypt and decrypt messages.","The wireless device  of  also has a plurality of sensors for sensing the mobile user's ambient conditions. The sensors shown include POSITIONING SENSOR , TOUCH SENSOR , AUDIO SENSOR , COMPASS SENSOR , AMBIENT LIGHT SENSOR , AMBIENT TEMPERATURE SENSOR , and THREE-AXIS ACCELERATION SENSOR . The audio sensor  can be a microphone, for example, which can detect speech or environmental sounds. The positioning sensor can be, for example, a GPS receiver integrated in the device. The positioning sensor can also be, for example, a radio beacon triangulation sensor that determines the location of the wireless device by means of a network of radio beacons, base stations, or access points, as is described for example, in Nokia European patent EP 0 767 594 A2, entitled \u201cMobile Station Positioning System\u201d. These sensors provide inputs which are sampled by the wireless device  to infer a current context, as will be described below.","The WAP protocol gateway  links the Internet  and the wireless network . The WAP protocol gateway  includes the Wireless Public Key infrastructure (PKI) feature to help provide a secure Internet connection to the wireless device . The WAP protocol gateway  enables the WAP-enabled wireless device  to access Internet applications such as headline news, exchange rates, sports results, stock quotes, online travel and banking services, or to download distinctive ringing tones.","The user's WAP-enabled portable wireless device  communicates with the radio tower  and can exchange messages for distances up to several kilometers. The types of wireless networks  supported by the WAP standard include Cellular Digital Packet Data (CDPD), Code-Division Multiple Access (CDMA), Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), GPRS, 3G-Broadband, and the like.","The overall process of communication between the user's WAP-enabled wireless device (the client) , through the WAP protocol gateway , to the server  resembles the way Web pages are served on the Internet using the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) or World Wide Web protocol:","[1] The user presses a phone key on the user's device  related to the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) of the server .","[2] The user's device  sends the URL, via the radio tower  and the wireless network , to the gateway  using WAP protocols.","[3] The gateway  translates the WAP request into an HTTP request and sends it over the Internet  to the server , via Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol (TCP\/IP) interfaces.","[4] The server  handles the request just like any other HTTP request received over the Internet. The server  either returns a WML deck or a HyperText Markup Language (HTML) page back to the gateway  using standard server programs written, for example in Common Gateway Interface (CGI) programs, Java servlets, or the like.\n\n[5] The gateway  receives the response from the server  on behalf of the user's device . If the response is an HTML page, it gets transcoded into WML if necessary. Then the WML and WMLScript coding is encoded into a byte code that is then sent to the user's device .\n\n[6] The user's device  receives the response in the WML byte code and displays the first card in the deck on the microbrowser  to the user.\n","In , the protocol gateway  includes a WAP protocol stack organized into five different layers. An application layer is the wireless application environment, which executes portable applications and services. A session layer is the wireless session protocol, which supplies methods for the organized exchange of content between client\/server applications. A transaction layer is the wireless transaction protocol, which provides methods for performing reliable transactions. A security layer is the wireless transport layer security, which provides authentication, privacy, and secure connections between applications. The transport layer is the wireless datagram protocol, which shelters the upper layers from the unique requirements of the diverse wireless network protocols, such as CDPD, CDMA, GSM, etc. Additional information about the WAP standard and the WAP protocol stack can be found in the book by Charles Arehart, et al. entitled, \u201cProfessional WAP\u2032 \u201d, published by Wrox Press Ltd., 2000 (ISBN 1-861004-04-1).","In , the user's portable wireless device  includes the microbrowser  displays the Recommendation Web Services menu, to enable the user to navigate through the cards being displayed and to select options that are programmed by the application programs . The user's device  also includes the WAP client program  which has been previously discussed.","The microbrowser  and the user's wireless device displays a recommendation web services menu. The recommendation web services menu provides the user with options to select: (A) UPDATE PRIVACY FEATURES; (B) MANAGE CONTEXT-ACTIVITY PROFILE; AND (C) REQUEST A RECOMMENDATION.","The user's wireless device  includes application programs , the WAP client program , context-activity pair and service history log , current context state  and recommendation algorithms .","The network server  includes recommendation algorithms , context-activity pairs database , and context inference engine .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIGS. 1A and 1B","FIGS. 1A and 1B","FIGS. 1C and 1D"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"154pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"(1)","AUTOMOBILE"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"140pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"(a)","day time radio preferences"]},{"entry":[{},"(b)","night time radio preferences"]},{"entry":[{},"(c)","map display preferences"]},{"entry":[{},"(d)","service station preferences"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"154pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"(2)","DINING"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"140pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"(a)","restaurant preferences"]},{"entry":[{},"(b)","food preferences"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"154pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"(3)","ENTERTAINMENT"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"140pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"(a)","movie preferences"]},{"entry":[{},"(b)","sports preferences"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"154pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"(4)","TRAVEL"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"140pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"(a)","weather forecasts"]},{"entry":[{},"(b)","airline preferences"]},{"entry":[{},"(c)","hotel preferences"]},{"entry":[{},"(d)","car rental preferences"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"If the user selects the option of (c) REQUEST A RECOMMENDATION, from the recommendation web services menu of , then the REQUEST A RECOMMENDATION sub menu is displayed on the wireless device, as is shown in .

As is seen in , the user selected activity of \u201cDINING-restaurant\u201d is coupled with the context that the wireless device  determines to exist at the present time in the vicinity of the wireless device . The activity coupled with a description of the current context, is transmitted from the wireless device  to the network server .

There are two ways that the user's device  can initiate sending the current context-activity pair to the server . The first way is shown in step  of , where the user's device  is programmed to automatically get the current context state  from the context inference engine , and to select an appropriate activity from the history log , and to send the current context-activity pair to the server . The second way that the device  can send a context-activity pair is shown in step , where the user inputs a selection of an activity onto the request a recommendation sub menu shown in  or F.

An important feature of the invention is that the information transmitted to the network server  is without any user identification, in order to preserve the privacy of the user's information. Often instead of single context-activity pair  a sample filtered by recommendation algorithm  of representative context-activity pairs and related service history items from log  is transmitted to recommendation algorithm . That is, message  is often a set of context-activity pairs and related service history items.","In an alternate embodiment of the invention shown in , Step \u2032 sends to recommendation algorithm  in server , a sample of representative context-activity pairs filtered by algorithm  and related service history items from log  as a set of context-activity pairs and related service history items.","In step  of , the network server  receives the context-activity pair  from the device , and processes the context-activity pair with the recommendation algorithms . The recommendation algorithms  match the context-activity pairs stored in the database  which are similar to the context-activity pair which was received from the device , and it accesses the associated recommendations for the matched context-activity pairs from the database . This can be seen to better advantage in  which shows the context-activity pairs and associated services database  in the server .","Referring for a moment to , the user has selected at the wireless device , the activity of \u201cdining\u2014restaurant\u201d. The current context is a particular local time and location, a particular light level, ambient temperature, speed and acceleration. This current context information, values sent from the recommendation algorithms  in the device , and optionally the corresponding metadata vector , are sent as the context-activity pair information  to the network server .","Referring now to  showing an example of the contents of the database , the first row in the context-activity pairs column gives a range of times, a range of locations, a range of temperatures and a range of speed and accelerations for context-activity pairs which are to be matched with the current context-activity pair being transmitted from the wireless device . The corresponding associated service recommendations are shown in the middle column. For each respective service recommendation in the middle column, there is a corresponding number of times that that particular recommendation has been made to other users in the past, as shown in the right-hand column of FIG. B. The current context is 8:00 PM at night and therefore the service recommendations seen to be different from the service recommendations that would be made from the second row of the database  in FIG. B. In the second row it can be seen that the context-activity pairs deal with a morning timeframe at the same location. There, it can be seen that in the middle column for the second row, the recommendations are not the same as they were for the nighttime recommendations for the first row. Similar to the previous description, the right-hand column of  gives the number of times that each respective service recommendation has been made to prior users. The recommendation algorithms  in the network server  perform the matching operation and identify the first row in  as a match for context-activity pairs. Accordingly, the recommendation algorithms  in the network server  return the recommendations  to the user's wireless device . Those recommendations are the service recommendations shown in the upper row middle column of FIG. B. The number of times each recommendation has been made can also be transmitted in the recommendations . This is performed in the step  of the process diagram of FIG. A. The \u201cnumber of times recommended\u201d is only one of the measures which can be used to generate new recommendations. Other measures include parameters based on feedback.","Step  of  receives the recommendations  at the wireless device , and the recommendation algorithms  apply a filtering operation to the received recommendations to identify any new or significant information. New information can be determined by reference to the context-activity pairs and service history log  in device , which is shown in greater detail in FIG. C. There it can be seen that in the past, this particular wireless device  has received old recommendations for two entries which are also part of the set of recommendations  now being received from the server . The recommendation algorithm  removes the two old recommendations shown in the top row middle column of  so that only the new recommendations received in the recommendations  from the network server  are to be displayed to the user in the wireless device . The recommendations algorithms  can make other determinations, for example it can examine the user's rating of the respective old recommendations as shown in FIG. C and can take the user's rating into consideration in the display of current recommendations to the user. The recommendation algorithms  in the wireless device  can also take into consideration the number of times that each respective recommendation has been previously recommended to other users, that information having been transmitted in recommendations  to the wireless device . Then in step  of , the wireless device displays the filtered recommendations to the user. Alternately, the wireless device can transfer the filtered recommendations to an application program for further processing. In some embodiments the wireless device  provides feedback to the server  after step . The feedback is used to enhance the quality of later matching operations in step .","At the network server , as shown in , step  transitions to step  in which the new context-activity pairs and recommendations are added to the database . An important feature of this invention is that there is no user identification which is included in the database . Then step  of  computes usage statistics for the context-activity pairs in the database  and associates the usage statistics with the respective recommendations stored in the database . This information can have economic value to third party service providers such as the service provider . As is seen in , step  shows the third party service provider  purchasing selected data sets from the database  to be used for market research.","An alternate embodiment of the invention is shown in FIG. D. In the alternate embodiment, the context-activity pair information  sent by the wireless device  in  to the network server , includes the metadata vector . Where the processing power or memory capacity of the wireless device  may be limited, the network server  can make a more accurate determination of the mobile user's current context by assisting in the further processing of the metadata vector . The metadata vector , which is discussed in greater detail below, represents the current sensor signals and characterizes the current state of the wireless device . A context inference engine  in the network server  of  is embodied as programmed instructions executed within the server . The resultant current context computed by the server  and the activity information received from the wireless device  in the context-activity pair , constitute the current context-activity pair. The context-activity pair database  maintained by the server  associates a current context-activity pair with appropriate recommendations made in the past to many users. As the system makes new recommendations to users in response to context-activity pairs submitted by their wireless devices, the server  gathers the new recommendations and adds them to its context-activity pair database . No user personal data is included in the context-activity pair database . In this manner, the variety, quality and pertinence of the recommendations in the database  grows as the recommendation system is used. As an added benefit, the server  compiles statistical usage information about the recommendations and stores this in the context-activity pair database .","The network process flow diagram of the alternate embodiment of  begins with either step  or step  in the user's wireless device . In step , the user's device  is programmed to automatically get the current metadata vector  from the context inference engine , and to select an appropriate activity from the history log . In alternate step , the user can make an activity selection from the request a recommendation sub menu shown in  or F. Both steps  and  flow into step  in the user's wireless device . In step , the context inference engine  contacts the context inference engine  of the network server  shown in , and sends the metadata vector  and activity as the context-activity pair  to server . The process then flows to step  in the network server . The context inference engine  at network server  uses user information stored in the server in the user database  to make a more accurate determination of the wireless device's current context. Step  then flows to step , and the rest of the steps in the flow diagram of  are substantially the same as those described above for FIG. A. In this manner, the network server  can then assist the wireless device  in determining the wireless device's current context, as well as the server  sending the resultant service recommendations back to the wireless device .","Context Sensitive Web Services","The context sensitive web services feature enables a mobile phone or wireless PDA to use context inference techniques to sense the user's environment and in response, to provide recommendations to the user that is appropriate to the user's perceived environment. The feature offloads some of the computationally intensive computing necessary in context inference techniques, from the mobile user's wireless device to a server and to web sites on the Internet. The context sensitive web services feature maintains a personal profile of the mobile user's personal preferences in an online server or web site. The mobile user is provided with the ability to control access by application programs in the wireless device, to the user's private data. The context sensitive web services feature provide the mobile user with the ability to control any access to the user's profile by the online server or web site.","The mobile user's wireless device is equipped with a context inference engine for providing and awareness of the mobile user's context to application programs, including third party applications. Since the processing power and storage capacity is limited in typical wireless devices, the computational load and storage requirements of the context inference engine are distributed to a context inference server capable of processing the context data. The feature enables the mobile user to control which application programs in the wireless device are granted access to the user's private context information. A privacy control block in the wireless device grants or revokes access by application programs to the private context information, based on the mobile user's preferences stored in a privacy profile. The same privacy control and privacy profile is extended to the context inference server, thereby enabling the extension of the user's privacy control to any web server connected to the context inference server. The feature thus enables building an infrastructure for context sensitive applications and services within the wireless device and the server, while providing to the mobile user control over the privacy user's context information.","The Recommendation Web Services menu displayed by the microbrowser  in  is rendered by the WAP client program  under the control of the application programs , which are shown in .

If an application program A, B, X, or Y has been verified for its acceptability by a trusted authority, then the trusted authority will have issued a digital certificate on a message authentication code (MAC) it has computed for the application program, which can be checked by the privacy control . As long as the privacy control  trusts the trusted authority issuing the digital certificate, authentication of the application program is straight forward.","Once the mobile user has verified the program's digital certificate and is satisfied that the application program will not subvert the integrity or security of the user's private data, the user can register the program. Registration is the granting by the user of access permission to the program, to access the current context of the user's wireless device and\/or to access other portions of the user's private data. There are several levels of permission that can be granted by the user in two categories, [a] when can the accesses take place and [b] what data can be accessed.","Option [4] of REGISTER A PROGRAM, leads to a another sub-menu shown in , which has the following options:","[4] REGISTER A PROGRAM","[a] When can the accesses take place","[b] What data can be accessed","For the first category of [a] when can the accesses take place, the highest level of permission in this category is that access can occur anytime and without notice. The lowest level of permission in this category is that access can only occur at specified times or under specified conditions, and only after notice to the user and specific authorization by the user. For the second category of [b] what data can be accessed, the highest level of permission in this category is to access unlimited datasets in the user's private data, including current context information, personal data entered by the user, the user's Internet usage history data, the user's Internet cookie data, and the user's application program usage data. The lowest level of permission in this category is that access of any data can only occur after notice to the user and specific authorization by the user. The user can configure any levels of permission in between the highest and lowest and make that the basis for the registration. The user can include the terms of registration in a digital certificate signed by the user and appended to the application program. This registration certificate can be presented by the program to the privacy control  prior to a proposed access event, the privacy control  to automatically verify the registration status of the program. The registration certificate can be constructed as follows.","The privacy control  can compute a message authentication code (MAC) and its own digital signature and append it as a certificate to an acceptable application program A, B, X, or Y. The privacy control  can include the terms of registration in the digital certificate. Then when the program requests access to the user's private data, the privacy control  can automatically check the MAC and its own digital signature to verify that the program has not been changed and the privacy control  can also automatically verify the registration status of the program. This is achieved by the privacy control  computing a hash value for the entire application program A, B, X, or Y (or some portion of it) and the terms of registration, and then forming a message authentication code (MAC) from the hash value. The privacy control  then uses its PKI private key to digitally sign the message authentication code (MAC). The terms of the registration, the MAC and the privacy control's digital signature are appended to the application program A, B, X, or Y as a registration certificate.","Then, whenever the application program A, B, X, or Y requests access to the user's context data or private data, the privacy control  will require the application program to present the registration certificate so that the privacy control  can check that the presented MAC compares with a computed MAC and that the presented digital signature is genuine. The privacy control  can then automatically grant access permission to the application program, in accordance with the terms of the registration.","Methods to generate and evaluate message authentication codes to insure the integrity of data are described in the book by Stephen Thomas entitled \u201cSSL and TLS\u201d, published by John Wiley and Sons, 2000. Two example algorithms for message authentication are RSA's Message Digest (MD5) and the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA), both of which are described in the book by Stephen Thomas.

For instance the inferred current context of the device  may be \u201cIN THE USER'S POCKET\u201d, when a certain set of sensors input a specific combination of signals having a specific value range. As an example, the resulting inference of the current context by the Context Interference Engine  could be expressed in XML language format as follows:","<Context Inference Engine in Device>","<device placement> pocket <\/device placement>","<User Interface state> sleep mode <\/User Interface state>","<device location> in elevator 5 building 1 floor 2<\/device location>","<API active actions> meeting starting on floor 3 room 322<\/API active actions>","<\/Context Inference Engine in Device>","The Context Inference Engine  in the wireless device  can perform the context inference process with any of several methods. Different input information from the sensors can be weighted according to their relative value of importance appropriate for each environment condition or situation to be analyzed. Each sensor has it's own weight value. Alternatively, the weight values for each sensor for each environment condition can be learned from training sessions using, for example artificial neural networks (ANNs), self-organizing maps (SOMs), decision trees, fuzzy rule-based systems, or model-based systems such as Hidden Markov Modeling (HMM). Combinations of two or more of the alternate methods can be used, depending on the application.","The Context Inference Engine  can continuously adapt its weights through adaptive and continuous learning methods, where the user teaches the wireless device  new environment conditions and names them. Hidden Markov Modeling (HMM) can be used, for example, to implement an adaptive and continuous learning method for the Context Inference Engine . Alternately, the wireless device  can be programmed to spontaneously recognize a changed scene by comparing it with known scenes. The user can teach the wireless device new environmental conditions and name them, using the adaptive and automatic learning capability of neural networks. Adaptive and continuous learning methods are computationally intensive and are appropriate candidates to place on the network server , which assists the wireless device , as discussed below.","The field of context inference has applied the principles of automated pattern recognition to processing diverse types sensor inputs. Speech recognition has been applied to processing speech signals and handwriting recognition has been applied to processing hand force and accelerometer signals. In the field of robotics, image recognition has been applied to processing digitized still and motion images, mechanical location recognition has been applied to processing laser and sonar range finder signals, and mechanical motion recognition to has been applied to processing inertial, acceleration, and heading signals. In the field of prosthetic devices, touch recognition has been applied to processing tactile sensor signals. In the field of medicine, automated diagnostic programs recognize various pathologies by processing bioelectric field signals, as well as the more traditional pulse, respiration rate, and body temperature signals. These diverse sensor signal recognition processes have the common feature that an initial training stage is conducted where sampled signals are equated with a statistical model for those signals.","The principles of automated pattern recognition for these diverse sensor inputs are exemplified by the techniques for recognizing speech patterns. A common technique used in speech recognition is Hidden Markov Modeling (HMM). The term \u201cHidden\u201d refers to the probabilistic and not directly observable events which underlie a speech signal. HMM speech recognition systems typically use realizations of phonemes which are statistical models of phonetic segments having parameters that are estimated from a set of training examples. Models of words are made by chaining or linking appropriate statistical models of phonetic segments. The statistical models serve as standards which are to be matched with the unknown voice signals to be recognized.","Recognition of unknown voice signals requires sampling and digitizing the speaker's spoken phonemes. These digitized phonemes are then processed into metadata. The metadata is then compared with the standard statistical models of phonemes. The most likely matches are then the inferred speech recognition result.","Recognition consists of finding the most likely path through the set of word models for the input speech signal. HMM speech recognition decoding systems first need to be trained through an iterative process. The system must be exposed to training examples or words of a particular speaker's voice. A training word is analyzed to generate a framed sequence of acoustic parameters or statistical models. A valid or \u201cgood\u201d recognition occurs when the most likely path through the set of word models for the training word results in recognizing the correct training word.","Some useful references discussing the principles of Hidden Markov Models are:","Rabiner, L. R., \u201cA tutorial on hidden Markov models and selected applications in speech recognition\u201d, volume 77, number 2, 1989, pages 257-286.","Rabiner, L. R. and Juang, B. H., \u201cAn introduction to hidden Markov models\u201d, January 1986, pages 4-15.","Fraser, Andrew M. and Dimitriadis, Alexis, \u201cForecasting Probability Densities by Using Hidden Markov Models with Mixed States\u201d, Addison-Wesley, editor Weigend, Andreas S. and Gershenfeld, Neil A., 1994.\n\nChamiak, Eugene, MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass., 1993.\n","To illustrate how Hidden Markov Modeling (HMM) can be extended beyond speech recognition, an example is given here for touch recognition. In the training stage for touch recognition, tactile sensor signals are input from touching a tactile transducer to a rough texture, such as for example sandpaper. The tactile sensor signals are transformed into a statistical model of the input signal. The statistical model is stored as a standard in a computer memory under the handle \u201crough_texture\u201d. To expand the range of sensor signals that are included in the model for \u201crough_texture\u201d, several training sessions can be conducted, each with a different direction or pressure for touching the sandpaper, resulting in several different samples of the statistical model. The set of samples of the statistical model are stored as a standard under the handle \u201crough_texture\u201d. Other training sessions are conducted with a smooth texture, such as glass. The tactile sensor signals input from touching the tactile transducer to the smooth texture are transformed into a statistical model of the input signal and stored as a standard under the handle \u201csmooth_texture\u201d. Later, in the recognition mode, an unknown object is touched by the tactile transducer resulting in a sample tactile sensor signal. Recognition of unknown touch signals requires sampling and digitizing the touch transducer's signals. These digitized sensor signals are then processed into metadata. The metadata is then compared with the standard statistical models of \u201crough_texture\u201d and \u201csmooth_texture\u201d. The most likely match is then the inferred touch recognition result.","Combinations of two or more types of sensors can have their signals combined into an input metadata vector that characterizes a composite sampling event. The composite sampling event can be recognized using the principles of Hidden Markov Modeling (HMM). An example composite sampling event can be the state of the health and fatigue of the user of a wireless device . For example, a wireless device  can be equipped with a tactile transducer which outputs tactile sensor signals in response to the hand force and pulse rate of the user who is gripping the wireless device . The wireless device  can be equipped with a temperature sensor which outputs body temperature signals in response to the user gripping the wireless device . Hidden Markov Modeling (HMM) can be used to recognize a force\/temperature input metadata vector that characterizes the combination of the hand force and the temperature sensor signals resulting from a sampling event. A composite sampling event in this example can have an extended duration so that the force sensor can transduce the pulse rate of the user over a period of time.","In the training stage, the tactile sensor signals and the force sensor signals are output while the user is in a condition of good health and resting normally. The tactile sensor signals and the force sensor signals are combined into a force\/temperature input metadata vector which is transformed into a statistical model of the input signals. The statistical model is stored as a standard in the computer memory of the wireless device  under the handle \u201cgood_health_resting_normally\u201d. Other training sessions are conducted with the user in different states of health and fatigue. For example, the user may be training the wireless device  while working late at night at the office. The tactile sensor signals and the force sensor signals resulting from holding the wireless device , are combined into a force\/temperature input metadata vector for the user in the condition of being in good health but fatigued. The force\/temperature input metadata vector is transformed into a statistical model of the input signals and stored as a standard under the handle \u201cgood_health_fatigued\u201d.","Later, in the recognition mode, as the user holds the wireless device , the tactile sensor signals and the force sensor signals are sampled. The Health\/Fatigue_State recognition consists of sampling and digitizing the touch transducer's signals. These digitized sensor signals are then processed into a metadata vector. The metadata vector is then compared with the standard statistical models of handle \u201cgood_health_resting_normally\u201d and \u201cgood_health_fatigued\u201d. The most likely match is then the inferred touch recognition result.","In accordance with the feature, this recognition result can be used by a health maintenance application program in the wireless device , to provide useful and appropriate information to the user. For example, a health maintenance program can process the recognition result, and in response, signal an alarm to the user and provide suggestions for medications to palliate the sensed fatigue. One problem with automatic recognition programs is that they are either relatively large or they call databases that are relatively large in comparison to the memory capacity of the wireless device .","Another aspect of the feature is the recognition result can be used by a supplementary application program in a remote server, to provide additional and more detailed useful and appropriate information to the user. For example, the server can access a large database of suggestions for medications to palliate the sensed fatigue of the user. The results of the search of the database can be returned to the wireless device . The server can also maintain a personal profile of the user's characteristics and preferences and it can use that profile in automatically formulate its query to the database. For example, the user's drug allergies can be stored in the server's database, to insure that recommendations are not made that will result in an allergic reaction by the user to the suggested medication.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0118","num":"0119"},"figref":"FIG. 2A","b":["100","140","160","138","150","138","150","138","150"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0119","num":"0120"},"figref":"FIG. 2A","b":["100","100","138","142","140","100","160"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0120","num":"0121"},"figref":["FIG. 2A","FIG. 2A"],"b":["100","140"],"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003","list-style":"none"},"li":["1.
