In particular, the invention relates to elevation mechanisms for controllably raising and lower ammunition into a magazine.","Reversible (i.e., bi-directional) ratchets are utilized to great extent in hand wrenches allowing for the tightening and loosening of nuts and bolts. A ratcheting wheel engages a pawl, both having a saw-tooth groove, and is rotated in either direction with a detent coming in contact with a ball plunger to prevent unintended backwards rotation. Reversible ratchet wrenches of the type discussed above and other similar wrenches are disclosed by U.S. Pat. Nos. 260,834, 376,584, 2,542,241, 2,701,977, 3,713,356, 4,485,700, 4,631,988, 6,543,316 and 6,644,148. Ammunition lifts are used for lifting ammunition from one height to another. These were first used around 1930 to lift ammunition to the weapon system.","The United States Navy has commissioned two class prototypes for a Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) intended for close shore fire support with inter-changeable weapons modules for select plug-and-fight missions. The Gun Mission Module (GMM) as an example for the surface warfare module package includes two turret-mounted, axis-stabilized chain guns that protrude above deck from a module cover, below which personnel can supply ammunition from storage containers.","Conventional ammunition lifters yield disadvantages addressed by various exemplary embodiments of the present invention. In particular, various exemplary embodiments provide for a ammunition elevator device is provided for raising and lowering ammunition. The device includes a housing, a crank assembly, a pawl mechanism, and a transfer linkage. The housing has a chamber within which to elevate the ammunition flanked by first and second flanges.","In various exemplary embodiments, the assembly, rotatably disposed between the flanges, has a crank axle, first and second sprockets mounted to the axle for elevating the ammunition, and a ratchet gear mounted to the axle adjacent to the first flange. The pawl mechanism connects to the first flange and includes a pawl, a toggle and a pin spreader. The toggle connects to the pawl and mounts to the spreader.","In various exemplary embodiments, the transfer linkage has a rotatable bar pivotably connected to the second flange, a rod that radially shifts relative to the crank axle in response to the sprockets, and first and second rotatable joints. The first joint connects to the bar to the rod. The second joint connects the rod to the spreader. The ratchet gear connects to the axle adjacent the first flange, wherein the gear cyclically pivot the pawl for raising the toggle.","In the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the invention, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific exemplary embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Other embodiments may be utilized, and logical, mechanical, and other changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims.","Various exemplary embodiments enable safely transporting ammunition connected via links vertically from one height to another in either direction with a ratcheting mechanism. The conventional method for lowering ammunition for involves disengaging the ratchet. This practice leaves the operator exposed to a potential large mass, depending on the length of the chute, traveling at fast speeds, and thus constitutes a distinct hazard. Moreover, confinement of the spaces within a naval war vessel impedes movement therein. Various exemplary embodiments alleviate these ambulatory restrictions for raising ammunition to be loaded.","The Gun Mission Module (GMM) for the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) incorporates an ammunition lift that provides bi-directional raising of ratchet wrenches. Various exemplary embodiments comprise a ratchet wheel secured to a rotating shaft via a woodruff key as well as a nut and washer. The ratchet wheel engages a pawl, of mirrored proportions rotating about a pin a fixed distance from the shaft and secured in like manner as the ratchet wheel and having a spring affixed atop its center, thus acting in a ratcheting motion when rotated in either direction.","Two sprockets of equal size and shape having grooves to fit the diameter of the desired ammunition are fixed on the shafts in the manner as the ratchet wheel. As the shaft rotates the sprockets lift or lower the linked ammunition. The ammunition is kept free of jamming by guiding rails spaced at intervals dependent on the geometry of the ammunition.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","110","120","130","140","150","160","165","170","175","180","150","190"]},"The axle assembly, discussed in further detail below, represents a right-hand version, with the wheel  disposed at the distal end of the frame weldment .

By lifting the ratchet toggle handle  (e.g., via an operator), the ratchet lock  pushes upwards, disengaging the toggle pawl assembly  from the ratchet gear , . Gravity then pulls the ammunition rounds downward, which engages the uni-directional damper  to apply friction that retards the descent of the rounds. The ammunition  then can be lowered at a controlled rate to the lower level without potential injury to the operator. The ratchet gear ,  engaged with the pawl  provides for improvements in safety by restricting motion to the intended (descent) direction.","Another advantage from various exemplary embodiments constitutes the mirror design features. In particular, the assembly for the crank axle  can be installed within the weldment  with the wheel  mounted on either the distal plate  in the right-hand configuration  or else on the proximal plate  in the left-hand configuration , as a reversal to the right-hand configuration . This enables the operator to lift ammunition  from either end, such as a munitions round forward (as shown in view ), or alternatively a clip forward, thereby augmenting versatility.","This mirror complimentary feature may be necessitated due to the dual canister mirror loading style of the Mk46 chain gun for the GMM, and as such reduces operator reloading time and potential confusion. The transfer rod  and the extender bar  attach to the ratchet lock  so that the ammunition lift device  operates as shown in the assembled configuration. Typically, the pawl assembly  pivots about the hole  in the distal plate , although mounting to the corresponding position on the proximal plate  can also be accomplished.","While certain features of the embodiments of the invention have been illustrated as described herein, many modifications, substitutions, changes and equivalents will now occur to those skilled in the art.
