{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The present invention is directed to methods and systems for providing workspace mobility and hoteling. More particularly, methods and systems are provided for managing and providing telephony services to particular individuals whose workspace location can change from time to time.","2. Discussion of Related Art","There are a variety of tools and techniques for managing and providing telephony services in a workplace environment. Organizations have long used private branch exchanges (PBXs) to deploy and maintain telephone service to employees at a particular physical location, for example, a work site such as an office building. By connecting individual phones to the public switched telephone network via a trunk line, the organization could route an individual employee's extension to wherever the employee was located at the work site, and could reroute the extension as appropriate.","However, the PBX is of little use when a user needs telephony services in a location physically distant from the location of the PBX system. Furthermore, the PBX requires too much manual intervention to be efficient when a user frequently moves locations, or when a particular work location, for example, a cubicle, will host a number of different users in the course of a relatively short period of time.","\u201cHoteling\u201d is a term given to the practice of providing unassigned workspaces that can be reserved or claimed by different users at different times. Specifically, a user may reserve a workspace, such as a cubicle or office, for a particular duration of time. During that time, she may be provided telephony or other custom services at that location. Hoteling thus allows mobile workers to have access to a shared workspace at one or more locations as needed without requiring a dedicated workspace for each mobile worker at each location.","As noted above, automated methods for managing telephony services and other workplace assets have been developed. Specifically, systems have been developed that allow users to make advance reservations that will cause their telephony services to be activated at a particular workspace at a particular time. However, these systems may be limited in that they carry out the activation or termination of telephony services regardless of the user's actual location. Thus, there is a need for telephony management methods and systems that accepts reservations for telephony services for a particular user at a particular workspace and time, and that activate those telephony services only upon confirmation that the user is physically present at that workspace.","The present invention is directed to methods and systems configured to accept reservations for telephony services for a particular user at a particular workspace and time, and to activate those telephony services only upon confirmation that the user is physically present at that workspace. These telephony services may include directing all calls for the user to a telephone in that workspace, and providing outgoing telephone service on the telephone. Additional personalized telephony features may be deployed to the phone at the workspace as well, including the user's speed dial settings, personalized greeting, custom ringer settings, or other options.","According to one aspect of the present invention, a method is provided for directing calls placed to a telephone number associated with a user according to a reservation identifying the user, a workspace, and a start time.

Examples of such user data and metadata include, among others, the user's name, a unique user ID associated with the user, the user's default workspace, home region, default telephone number, email address, other methods of contacting the user, and the user's privileges for creating, modifying, or deleting reservation data or user data for that user or other users. The \u201chome region\u201d of the user  may be assigned based on the geographic region where the user  works most often, or it may be based on any other criteria, for example, the region in which the user  lives. The home region may correspond to a particular state, part of a state, corporate campus, or telephone area code.","In some embodiments, the user detail structure  retains only data for those users who have actively signed up for an account, while in other embodiments it may be pre-populated with a universe of possible users, for example, all employees of an organization. The use of the unique user IDs and may be used to link a reservation in the reservation data structure  to one or more users about whom information is stored in user detail structure . It should be appreciated that only one of unique user IDs and may be used. For example, in some embodiments, the reservation data and user data may be stored in the same data structure and accessed by a unique user ID that is the same for both.","Referring still to , in various embodiments the reservation database  may further incorporate a workspace detail structure  for holding at least one record having location data about a workspace  associated with the system, for example, a workspace  having a telephone  configured to operate with the system. The workspace detail structure  may further hold metadata about the record. Examples of such workspace data and metadata include, among others, a unique workspace ID associated with the workspace , the MAC address or other physical or logical address of the at least one telephone configured to operate with the system at the workspace , the address or other geographic descriptor of the workspace , the building, floor, and aisle information, the time zone in which the workspace  is located, and the accessibility of the workspace  for users with disabilities or other special needs. The workspace detail structure  may be configured to identify those users who are allowed to reserve any particular workspace. For example, a record corresponding to an executive suite may identify a group of executive-level users as being able to reserve the workspace , but may prevent others from doing so. The workspace detail structure  may further be configured to store contact information, such as phone numbers or email addresses, of personnel that should be contacted when an emergency, power outage, or other unexpected or scheduled disruption occurs at the workspace .","The workspace detail structure  may further be configured to store the availability of the workspace  for a set or range of particular time periods. For example, the workspace detail structure  may be configured to indicate whether the workspace  is available to be reserved for a particular span of dates or times at a desired granularity, for example, days or hours. The workspace detail structure  may be configured to be updated as reservations are made, modified, or canceled. The use of the unique workspace IDs and may be used to link a reservation in the reservation data structure  to a workspace  about which information is stored in workspace detail structure . It should be appreciated that only one of unique workspace IDs and may be used. For example, in some embodiments, the reservation data and workspace data may be stored in the same data structure and accessed by a single workspace ID.","Referring still to  and in a particular embodiment, the reservation database  may further incorporate a near-term reservation detail structure . The near-term reservation detail structure  may be a table, view, or other data structure known in the art, and may be populated with a subset of records from reservation detail structure , or may be populated with some subset of the fields of those records. In one embodiment, these records may correspond to reservations having a start time occurring within a predetermined period of time, for example, the current day, and are referred to hereinafter as \u201cnear-term reservations.\u201d In another embodiment, near-term reservations may further include those records that correspond to a reservation for a workspace for which there are multiple reservations for a particular period of time, for example, the current day. The near-term reservation detail structure  can be examined frequently for reservations scheduled to begin imminently, in order to ensure that all reservations can be activated without requiring a time- and resource-intensive full examination of the reservation database , which may contain some amount of historical and future data of little relevance to the activation of present reservations. In some embodiments, the unique user ID and the unique workspace ID may be stored in the near-term reservation detail structure , and may be used to link a reservation to a user record in user detail structure  and to a workspace record in workspace detail structure  in the same manner described above in relation to the reservation detail structure . These may be used as an alternative to or in conjunction with the unique user ID and the unique workspace ID in the reservation detail structure . It will be understood that any reference to a record relating to a reservation stored in the reservation database  may be stored in one or both of the reservation detail structure  or the near-term reservation detail structure .","Referring still to , in various embodiments a profile database  may be provided for holding at least one record storing a telephony profile  describing the telephone configuration preferences of the user , as well as metadata about the record. This profile data and metadata may include, among others, a unique user ID identifying the user associated with the telephony profile , the user's long distance calling privileges, and the user's phone settings, such as speed dial configuration, personalized greeting, custom ringer settings, or other options. For example, if a user  has stored his mother's phone number in a first speed dial position, his home phone number in a second speed dial position, and has chosen a particular ringtone, this information can be sent to the server  and stored in the profile database . This information can then be sent to any other telephone  for which the user  has checked in to a reservation, and the information can be used to configure the telephone  according to the user's preferences. The use of the unique user IDs and may be used to link a user associated with a reservation in the reservation data structure  to that user's preferences stored in profile database . In some embodiments, some or all of the information in reservation database  and profile database  may be duplicated. In some embodiments, for example as seen in , reservation database  and profile database  are separate entities. In other embodiments the profile database  is incorporated as a table in the reservation database . For example, a user's telephone configuration information may be stored in a separate table of the same database. In a different example, a user's telephone configuration information may be stored with the user's other information in user detail structure .","As will be known to those of ordinary skill in the art, the use of one or more relational databases to represent the reservation detail structure , the near-term reservation detail structure , the user detail structure , the workspace detail structure , and the profile database  is for exemplary purposes only. The data can be stored in any suitable manner in any number of configurations. For example, the data represented in these embodiments as being stored among those various structures may be stored in a single table structure. However, it will be appreciated that a relational database structure is suited to storing and quickly retrieving information about a large number of items, for example, users, reservations, and workspaces.","Referring again to , the reservation database  can be accessed in a number of ways. In various embodiments, a user  may be able to access the reservation database  through the use of a user terminal . The user terminal  may allow the user  to make reservations through one or several guided forms. It may further allow the user  to directly query or view the reservation database  through use of a graphical or command line database program. In some embodiments, the user terminal  may support a web browser or other program running on a user's remote computer system, mobile phone, PDA, or other network-enabled device. This may allow the user  to create, modify, or cancel reservations in advance, or it may allow a reservation agent or other system administrator to do so on behalf of the user . In some embodiments, the user  may be able to access raw historical data or generate summary or statistical data from the reservation database . In some embodiments, the user terminal  may be a system located remotely from the server  but capable of interacting with the server  by use of a network connection. In various embodiments, the user terminal  may be a physical kiosk located at or near the location of the workspace . For example, the user terminal  may be located near the entrance to a building having at least one workspace , in order that the user  may make a reservation for the workspace  on relatively short notice. Alternately, the user terminal  may be physically remote from the workspace , or may be portable, for example, a laptop computer used by the user .","In various embodiments, the reservation database  is accessible by the server . For example, the server  may periodically query the reservation database  to validate information about upcoming reservations. As a further example, the server  may regularly access the reservation database  to determine if there are any \u201cimminent reservations\u201d (defined herein as reservations having a start time occurring within a predetermined amount of time from the present time, for example, one minute) and take action accordingly. In various embodiments, a user  may be able to access the server , either directly or through a remote connection, and perform some or all of the same functions on reservation database  as described above in conjunction with the user terminal .","In various embodiments, the reservation database  may be capable of storing and running stored procedures as are known in the art. For example, as will be described in more detail below, a stored procedure may be scheduled to run each night and return a list of telephones  that are reserved for a different user than the day before. The user associated with the previous day's reservation can be checked out of the earlier reservation for the telephone  via the switching server , or some other action can be taken.","In various embodiments, the reservation database  may be configured to grant users a set of privileges corresponding to tasks that can be performed on the reservation database . For example, some users, such as system administrators, may be able to create, modify, and delete reservations for any user as desired. By way of further example, a different group of users, such as reservation agents, may have the same set of privileges as a system administrator, or they may be modified; for example, privileges could be set whereby a reservation agent is not able to modify reservations after the time at which the reservation was to begin. As a further example, personnel managers may have privileges to create, modify, and delete reservations on behalf of themselves and their subordinates. As yet another example, end users, such as employees, clients, or contractors, may have privileges to create, modify, and delete reservations on their own behalf, or alternately they may be prevented from deleting reservations once they have been created, for example. In some embodiments, some users may be allowed to create simultaneous reservations for more than one workspace. In one embodiment, users may be assigned individual privilege levels. In another embodiment, users may be assigned to groups for which all members have a defined set of privileges. In yet another embodiment, a hybrid of these approaches is employed.","In one embodiment of the reservation database , business rules as are known in the art can be applied to the reservation database . For example, users or their departments may be charged when a user creates a reservation, or when a user cancels a reservation without sufficient advance notice. In a different example, some users may be prioritized such that they can pre-empt other users' reservations should they need a space that is already booked.","Referring to , in various embodiments, a switching server  is provided to run a service that actively monitors incoming requests from the server  to activate or deactivate telephony services on a particular telephone . The switching server  may execute software capable of activating or deactivating telephony services in response to requests and may, for example, be based on an existing known and commercially-available product, such as Unified Communications Manager sold by Cisco Systems of San Jose, Calif. In other embodiments, some aspects of activating or deactivating telephony services may be carried out by hardware components. The switching server  may activate or deactivate telephony services at a telephone , for example by routing all phone calls to a user's assigned telephone number to the telephone , and by providing access to outgoing telephone lines through telephone . In various embodiments, the switching server  is further configured to poll the telephone  to ensure that it exists, is connected, and is capable of communicating with one or both of the server  and the switching server . The switching server  may be configured to report the results of this polling to the server , so that additional steps may be taken when warranted.","In various embodiments, the switching server  is configured to communicate with the profile database . As will be described in detail below, the profile database  may store information on the preferences of the user  with respect to the telephone , for example, the user's speed dial configuration, personalized greeting, custom ringer settings, or other options. The switching server  may retrieve these preferences from the profile database  and send them to the telephone  so that the telephone  may be configured according to these preferences. In certain embodiments, the switching server  or the server  may update the profile database  with new information retrieved from the telephone .","In some embodiments, the server  may be configured to request or receive from the profile database  a telephony profile , which is delivered to the telephone . In an alternative embodiment, it may be the switching server  that is configured to request or receive from the profile database  the telephony profile  and deliver it to the telephone . This alternative embodiment is represented by the dashed connection between the switching server  and the profile database  seen in . The telephony profile  is used to configure the telephone  according to the user's preferences, for example by configuring the user's speed dial settings, personalized greeting, custom ringer settings, or other functionality provided with the telephone .","Referring still to , in various embodiments a telephone  is provided at a workspace . The telephone  may be configured to receive and send data to and from the server  and the switching server . The telephone  may be provided with at least one button or other input device, for example soft keys on a touch screen, in order that the user  may interact with one or both of the server  and the switching server . In various embodiments as described above, the telephone  may be configured to receive a telephony profile  representing the preferences of user  regarding the functionality of telephone  and update its configuration accordingly. In various embodiments, the telephone  may provide limited functionality even when no user  is checked into the telephone . For example, the telephone  may provide the option of contacting emergency services, or may further provide the ability to speak to a reservation agent and make a reservation for that workspace  and telephone .","In various embodiments, the telephone  may be configured to send status information about the telephone  to the server  or to the switching server . This information may be sent periodically or in response to polling or requests by the server  or the switching server .","In various embodiments, the server  and the switching server  may not exist as separate physical entities, but may be implemented as executable code running on one or more processors  as seen in .","In one embodiment, the system  is configured to operate under heavy load and high traffic volume conditions. The connections provided between the various system components described above in relation to  may be of a bandwidth or speed many times greater than that needed under ordinary operating conditions.","In one exemplary embodiment, threading may be employed, wherein several threads within a process may be run concurrently by any of the computer systems described in relation to . The threads may share memory and other system resources, in order to alleviate bottlenecking and other undesirable processing behavior. For example, each thread may correspond to requests for telephony service originating at a particular site. In this way, requests from each site can be handled concurrently to avoid system outages or undue delays.","In another embodiment, the server  may be configured to queue multiple check-in and check-out requests from the telephone  and pass them all at once to the switching server  upon satisfaction of a condition, for example, the accumulation of a certain number of requests, or at a specified time interval. In this way, communication between the server  and the switching server  is minimized, reducing network traffic.","In yet another embodiment, part of which can be seen in , multiple servers  and one or more load balancers  may be employed to handle the processing load associated with check-in requests from multiple telephones . The load balancer  may be configured to receive check-in requests from the multiple telephones  and distribute the requests among the servers  in a balanced manner to efficiently utilize system resources without overwhelming any individual server . In another embodiment, a similar configuration including a load balancer  may be used to provide redundancy and high availability in the event that one server  fails. The load balancer  may be a software program running on a computer system similar to those described in relation to , or it may be a hardware device such as a multilayer switch.","Having described various aspects of a reservation system in accordance with the present invention, operation of such a reservation system is now described.","Creating a Reservation","Referring to , in various embodiments facilities may be provided allowing users to create reservations. These reservations identify a user  associated with the reservation and a start time for the reservation. In some embodiments, the reservation may identify a particular telephone  by a unique physical or network address, such as a MAC address, IP address, or URL. In other embodiments, the reservation may identify a workspace  in which a telephone  is located. The duration of the reservation may be indicated by either a numerical duration, for example, in hours, or may alternately be indicated by an end time. The start time and end time may denote the local time where the workspace  is located, or alternately may denote a universal time associated with the system, for example, Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).","For purposes of these examples, \u201cadvance reservations\u201d are those reservations created earlier than the day of the start time of the reservation. \u201cSame-day reservations\u201d are those reservations created on the same day as the start time of the reservation \u201cImmediate reservations\u201d are a subset of same-day reservations, and are reservations having a start time corresponding to the time the reservation is made; that is, a user can check into the reservation system  as soon as the immediate reservation is created.","Referring again to , in various embodiments the user  can create a reservation by interacting with either of the user terminal  or server . The system may be configured such that advance reservations may be created for any time in the future, or alternately so that reservations may be created only for a particular time period, for example, the current year, or a window of 12 months from the current date. In some embodiments, one or both of immediate reservations and same-day reservations may be allowed.","In other embodiments, the user  telephones a system coordinator, reservation concierge, or other third party, who may interact with a user terminal  or server  to create a reservation in accordance with the scheduling needs and preferences of the user . In some embodiments, the telephone  in the workspace  that the user  wishes to reserve may provide functionality for the user  to reach a system coordinator, reservation concierge, or other third party and create a current or advance reservation in this manner.","In some embodiments, business rules may be applied such that the user  or the department or team associated with the user  is billed upon creation of a reservation. These rules may be set such that the user  is billed different amounts for immediate reservations, same-day reservations, advance reservations in the near future, and advance reservations occurring farther in the future. In some embodiments, an individual billing amount may be set for each workspace .","In various embodiments, during the reservation creation process, the user  is presented with a textual or graphical list of workspaces  that are available to the user  for the time and location desired. For example, a map of a facility may be presented to the user , who may then select the workspace  of her choosing.","In other embodiments, the user  may simply enter reservation parameters and preferences, for example, the desired city, state, date, and start time of the reservation, and the system may automatically choose the workspace  from a pool of available workspaces based on those parameters and preferences. In a further embodiment, the system may apply business rules in assigning a workspace  from the pool of available workspaces to maximize efficiency and minimize costs. For example, the system may sequentially assign adjacent workspaces as reservations are created in order to consolidate the workspaces in use at any given time, which may reduce building operating costs such as those associated with electricity, HVAC, and janitorial services.","In various embodiments, an assigned telephone number is associated with the user  at the time the reservation is created. For example, if the user  has reserved a workspace  in her home region, her default telephone number may be assigned. In various embodiments, the assigned telephone number will always be the user's default telephone number, regardless of whether the workspace  is in her home region or not. In other embodiments, if the user  has reserved a workspace  outside of her home region, a guest or temporary extension may be assigned. In some embodiments, the user  may have a permanently assigned guest extension at each work location. In other embodiments, the user  may be assigned a guest extension selected randomly from a pool of available guest extensions. In one embodiment, the assigned telephone number is generated at the time the reservation is created and displayed to the user . In other embodiments, the assigned telephone number is generated at the time the user  checks in to the reservation. In various embodiments, the assigned telephone number may be a phone number within the exchange of the telephone , an internal extension, or an internal tie line.","In various embodiments, a user  may be allowed to create several simultaneous reservations for different workspaces. \u201cSimultaneous reservations\u201d are two or more reservations having the same start time or otherwise having a start time and duration such that, for at least some amount of time, the reservations cover the same time period. For example, a user  may know he needs to reserve a workspace for particular day and time, but he may not be sure whether he will working in Boston or Hartford at that time. The user  may be allowed to create simultaneous reservations for workspaces  in Boston and Hartford. As will be described in more detail below, the telephones  in either of the workspaces  will allow the user  to check into the reservation system  at the start time. Once the user  checks in to his reservation at one of the telephones , the system in some embodiments may immediately cancel the reservations at the other workspaces , allowing those workspaces  to be available for reservation by other users.","Pre-Validation of Reservations","Referring still to , in various embodiments one or more of the details of the reservation stored in the reservation database  are validated prior to the start time of the reservation. In some embodiments, the details of the reservation may be checked against one or more sets of data to ensure that the reservation can be checked into by the user  on or after the start time. For example, a component of the system, such as the reservation database  or the server , may confirm that the user ID and default telephone number or assigned telephone number associated with the reservation are uniquely associated with a known user  having appropriate privileges. As a further example, the system may confirm that the workspace ID uniquely identifies a valid workspace , and that the unique hardware address of the telephone associated with the reservation corresponds to a valid telephone  configured to work with the system. As yet another example, the system may confirm that the profile database  contains a telephony profile  associated with the user .","In other embodiments, the server  or switching server  may attempt to contact the telephone  at one or more times before the start time of the reservation to ensure that the telephone  is connected to the network and is capable of receiving data or carrying out instructions sent to it. For example, the server  may ping or otherwise poll the telephone  for its status at regular intervals or at set times. In some embodiments, a copy of the telephony profile  stored in the profile database  may be sent to the telephone  prior to the start time of the reservation, with the telephone  not being configured according to the telephony profile  until the start time of the reservation.","Referring still to , in various embodiments the system is configurable such that, if one or more of the details associated with the reservation cannot be validated in the manner described above, one or more of the user , a system coordinator, a reservation concierge, or other third party may be notified to take further action. For example, if the server  or switching server  cannot contact the telephone  after one or more failed attempts, the server  or the reservation database  may flag the reservation and notify a system administrator having access to the workspace  and telephone  so that maintenance or repairs can be performed. In some embodiments, the user  may be notified and given instructions or assistance on the steps to be performed in order to modify the reservation as necessary.","In some embodiments, the reservation may be canceled or suspended if one or more reservation details cannot be validated at some time before the start time of the reservation. In other embodiments, default values may be assigned for one or more parameters that are not populated with reservation details. For example, if no default telephone number is stored for the user  associated with the reservation a temporary or guest telephone number or extension may be assigned. As a further example, if the user  is not associated with any telephone profile in the profile database , a default profile may be created for the user .","Reservations may be validated at different times in their life cycle depending on the length of time between the creation of the reservation and the start time of the reservation. For example, same-day and immediate reservations may be validated during the creation of the reservation or shortly thereafter. Advance reservations may be validated at some later scheduled time. For example, all advance reservations may be validated in a nightly batch process within a day of their creation. This batch process may be scheduled for some time when the system typically experiences low utilization, for example, in the early morning hours. Additionally or alternatively, in some embodiments reservations may be validated in a batch process shortly before their start time.","In various embodiments, one or more reservations may be manually validated, that is, the reservations may be validated immediately in response to an event or user input at user terminal , server , or reservation database . For example, a system administrator, system coordinator, reservation concierge, or other party having the necessary privileges may be provided with an interface where they can select one or more reservations to be immediately validated by the system. This may be desirable in situations where an imminent reservation has not yet been validated, or when a reservation failed to be validated during an earlier validation attempt. In other embodiments, a reservation may be validated immediately after it is created by user , that is, creation of the reservation is an event that triggers manual validation.","Check-In Process","A representation of an interface  of a telephone in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention can be seen in . The interface  is a graphic-based and user-interactive display, and provides the user  with an information region , a display region , and an interactive region . The information region  provides general information to the user , for example, the local date and time, the name of the site in which the workspace  is located, and the assigned telephone number that is currently associated with the telephone . The display region  displays information relating to the current activity of the user . For example, the display region  may provide instructions to the user  when the user  is attempting to check into the reservation system , or may be used to display information for confirming the identity of the user .","The interactive region  may provide functional elements such as soft keys allowing the user  to interact with the server , the switching server , or other components of the system.","It will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that the information region , the display region , and the interactive region  may be arranged in any suitable manner on the interface . Further, it will be appreciated that one or more of the regions may be combined. For example, the display region  and the interactive region  may be combined, so that the name of the user associated with a reservation can be displayed to the user , and the user  can touch the name to confirm her identity and check into the reservation system .","When the server identifies that a workspace  has an imminent reservation, the system directs the telephone  in workspace  to enter a \u201cready state.\u201d In one embodiment, this means that the telephone  provides and configures the interface  to allow the user  associated with the reservation to check into the reservation system . While in the ready state, the interface  is configured to allow the user  to signal their physical presence at the telephone . The telephone interface  may provide some further functionality for controlling the telephone  or making telephone calls.","An example of the appearance of the interface  in the ready state in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention can be seen in . In one embodiment, the display region  displays a message instructing the user  to touch the interactive region  to check into the reservation system . The interactive region  may provide the user  with one or more interactive components, such as soft keys, allowing the user to perform several functions. For example, the interactive region  may allow the user  to do one or more of the following: to check into the reservation system ; to contact a reservation concierge; to contact emergency services; to check voicemail; to make local, internal, or long distance telephone calls; or to activate or change functionality of telephone , such as change the volume of the ringer. This functionality may be provided by sending one or more pieces of information to the server  in response to user input via the interactive components.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0119","num":"0118"},"figref":["FIGS. 5B-5D","FIG. 6"],"b":["500","200","200","600","610"]},"In act , the telephone  in the workspace  detects the physical presence of the user  at the telephone . In one embodiment, this is achieved by providing the user  with an input device for signaling her intent to check into the reservation system  on the telephone . This may be done, for example, through the use of a soft key located in the interactive region . The soft key may display an appropriate caption, such as \u201cCHECK IN,\u201d as depicted in . The telephone  sends a first message to the server  in response to the user input at the telephone . The first message may contain data explicitly identifying the telephone , or the server  may be configured to otherwise identify the telephone . The first message, and any other messages sent from the telephone  to the server , may be received at the server  by a check-in script, for example, an ASP.NET script running as a service on the server .","In act , the server  determines if a reservation exists for the workspace  and requests the user  to confirm her identity. In one embodiment, the server  queries the reservation database  to determine if there is a reservation associated with the telephone . If there is not a reservation associated with the telephone , the telephone  may enter an error state and indicate through the interface  that an error has occurred, specifically that no reservation exists for the telephone .","The appearance of the interface  in the error state in one embodiment of the present invention can be seen in . In some embodiments, after a certain amount of time or after the user  acknowledges the error, the telephone  may return to the ready state. In other embodiments, the user  may be connected to a reservation concierge over the telephone .","Still in act , where it is determined that no error has occurred and a reservation is associated with the telephone , the server  sends a second message to the telephone . The second message may contain information about the user associated with the reservation, such as that user's name, user ID, default telephone number, or other information associated with the user.","In act , the telephone  confirms the user's identity. This may be accomplished by causing the information about the user associated with the reservation to be displayed to the user  through the interface  to confirm that the user  is the user associated with the reservation. This confirmation may be done by directing the telephone  to enter a confirmation state by displaying a confirmation screen containing some or all of this data and providing the user with the option to confirm or deny that this information identifies the user .","The appearance of the interface  in the confirmation state in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention can be seen in . In this example, the interface  of telephone  displays the name of the user associated with the reservation in display region , and asks the user  to confirm or deny that they are the identified user by interacting with the interface at the interactive region . The interactive region  may provide a set of interactive keys, for example, a confirmation soft key and a cancel soft key. If the name displayed is not the name of user , then it may be the case that a user other than user  currently has a reservation for the telephone  in workspace . The user  may then press a soft key to cancel the check-in attempt, in which case the telephone  may return to the ready state depicted in .","Still in act , in the event that the name displayed is the name of the user , the user  may confirm her identity by sending a third message to the server , in this example by pressing the confirmation soft key in the interactive region  in . In certain embodiments, the third message contains data explicitly identifying the telephone , for example, a unique hardware address such as a MAC address. In other embodiments, the server  may be configured to otherwise identify the telephone . In one embodiment, no attempt is made to verify the identity of the user . In an alternative embodiment, the user  is required to enter a passcode, interact with a voice recognition system, or satisfy other security measures in order to confirm her identity. Upon receiving the third message from the telephone , the server  will have confirmed that the user  has a reservation for the workspace  containing telephone , and will have further confirmed that the user  is physically present at the workspace .","In act , the server  instructs the switching server  to direct calls for the user  to the telephone . In one embodiment, the server  or the switching server  may determine if calls for the user  are currently being directed to a telephone other than the telephone . For example, the reservation database  may be queried to determine if the user  is currently checked into a different workspace. In other embodiments, the switching server  may retain or have access to similar information. If it is determined that calls for the user  are currently being directed to a telephone other than the telephone , the switching server  may execute steps that cease to direct those calls to that telephone.","Still in act , the server  sends a fourth message directing the switching server  to begin directing all telephone calls for the user  to the telephone . The fourth message may be received at the switching server  by a process running as a service, for example, an ASP.NET or C# service. In some embodiments, the switching server  may begin providing outgoing telephone service through telephone  in accordance with information about the user , for example, her long-distance calling privileges. This information may be retrieved from the reservation database  or the profile database  and sent to the telephone  by the switching server .","In act , the server  retrieves the telephony profile  associated with the user  from the profile database , and sends the telephony profile  to the telephone . In other embodiments, the switching server , rather than the server , may retrieve the telephony profile  associated with the user  from the profile database , and send the telephony profile  to the telephone .","In act , the telephone  configures itself according to the preferences stored in the telephony profile . For example, if the telephony profile  reflects the wish of the user  that the first speed dial number of the telephone  should connect the user  to a remote voicemail system, the telephone  will be configured accordingly.","Upon being configured according to the telephony profile , the telephone  is placed in a checked-in state. The appearance of the interface  in the checked-in state in one embodiment can be seen in . The information region  of the interface  may display such information as the assigned telephone number currently associated with the user , the name of the user , the local date and time, and other general or user-specific information. The display region  may display a log of the recent call activity of the user , or may be combined with the interactive region  to provide soft key functionality for speed dialing, voicemail access, call forwarding, and other telephone functionality, such as a numeric or alphanumeric keypad or controls for ringer settings. The interface  may further include soft key functionality providing the user  with the option to check out of the reservation system .","In various embodiments, once the user  is checked into the reservation system  at the telephone , the server  examines the reservation database  to determine if the user  has any simultaneous reservations with the currently checked-in reservation. If so, in some embodiments the server  or reservation database  may immediately cancel the other of the simultaneous reservations. In other embodiments, the other reservation may only be canceled after its start time, or may not be canceled at all.","Process  ends at act . Thus, the user  is checked into the reservation system  on the telephone , with the telephone  configured according to her preferences, and with all calls for the user  being directed to the telephone .","Check-Out Process","In various embodiments, the user  may be checked out of the reservation system  at a certain time or in response to an event. As will be described in more detail below, the user  may manually check out of the reservation system  at any time, or the system may check the user  out of the reservation system  at some time on or after the end time of the reservation.","A check-out process in accordance with one embodiment can be seen at  in , beginning at act .","In act , the server  or the switching server  receives or retrieves from the telephone  information about the current configuration of the telephone . This information may include some or all of the type of information stored in the telephony profile , and may be transformed into a format similar to that of the telephony profile  for storage in the profile database . This allows the profile database  to reflect the current telephone preferences of the user  by incorporating any preference changes the user  may have made while checked into the reservation system . Act  can be optional, and may not be performed in all embodiments. For example, in some embodiments, act  may only be performed when the user  checks out of the reservation system  at a particular workspace, for example, her default workspace, whereas in other embodiments, act  is not performed at all (hence its depiction in dotted-line form).","In act , the switching server  ceases directing telephone calls for the user  to the telephone . The server  may instruct the switching server  to cease directing those calls to the telephone , and may further instruct the switching server  to take additional steps as appropriate. For example, in various embodiments, the switching server  may begin directing calls for the user  to a voicemail system configured to record and retain messages for the user . In other embodiments, the switching server  may begin directing all calls for the user  to a different telephone, for example, a telephone in the user's default workspace or the user's cell phone.","In act , the telephone  may return to a ready state as seen in , or, if the telephone  has no imminent reservation associated with it, the telephone  may enter a non-configured state. In some embodiments, additional check-out measures may be taken. For example, any data retained by the phone, such as recently dialed numbers, may be purged from the memory or storage of the telephone .","Process  ends at act .","In various embodiments, the user  may manually check out of the reservation system  at any time while in the checked-in state, for example, through use of a soft key provided on the interface .","In various embodiments, the user  may be checked out of the reservation system  automatically on or after the end time of the reservation. In a further embodiment, at the end time of the reservation the user  may be provided with the option of extending the reservation if there is not another user having an imminent reservation for the workspace . Business rules may be applied to charge the user  or her department for an extension of time.","In some embodiments, the user  may be checked out without warning at the end time of the reservation. In other embodiments, at some time prior to the end time of the reservation the user  may be displayed a warning on the interface  that the reservation will be automatically checked out at the end time of the reservation.","In various embodiments, network traffic and bandwidth concerns associated with the check-out process may make it more desirable to leave users checked in after the end time of the reservation. In these embodiments, a regularly-scheduled batch check-out process may examine the reservation database  to identify all currently checked-in reservations for workspaces at which the users associated with the currently checked-in reservation is a different user that the user associated with the next reservation. The batch check-out process then instructs the switching server  to check the users out of the reservation system  at those workspaces in the method described above and seen in .","The batch check out process may run at a time of day where low network traffic is typically experienced, for example, at midnight or 1:00 AM. However, it will be appreciated that the batch check-out process may run at any time of day.","Scheduled Processes","It will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that the systems described in these embodiments are described as operating on a daily or 24 hour cycle for exemplary purposes only. Longer or shorter cycles, such as those encompassing one or more hours or days, are also contemplated. For example, rather than validating advance reservations or running the batch check-out process once every day, these processes may be scheduled to occur more frequently.","Administrative Views","In various embodiments, an administrative interface for monitoring data associated with reservations, telephones, users, telephony profiles, and other data and events associated with the systems and methods described herein is provided. For example, a system administrator or reservation concierge may be provided with an administrative interface at the server , the reservation database , or the user terminal . The administrative interface may provide a \u201cdashboard\u201d or other overview of the system status, and may display alerts when problems or predefined events occur in the system.","In various embodiments, the system administrator or reservation concierge may be able to \u201cdrill down\u201d to see detailed information about components of the system. This detailed information may include, for example, the status of each telephone  associated with the system, such as whether it is in a ready state, whether a user is currently checked in to a reservation on the phone, the start time of the next reservation associated with the telephone, and any failed check-in attempts.","In further embodiments, the system administrator or reservation concierge may be provided functionality through the administrative interface to interact with system components through the interface. For example, in the event that a telephone is experiencing operation or network connectivity problems, an option may be provided to instruct the server  or the switching server  to reboot the telephone or take it offline.","In various embodiments, the system administrator or reservation concierge may be provided functionality to automatically summarize system performance or error data and generate reports or display other output.","Each of process  and  depicts one particular sequence of acts in a particular embodiment.
