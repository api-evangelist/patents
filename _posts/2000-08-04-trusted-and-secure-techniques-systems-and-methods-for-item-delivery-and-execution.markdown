title: Trusted and secure techniques, systems and methods for item delivery and execution
abstract: Documents and other items can be delivered electronically from sender to recipient with a level of trustedness approaching or exceeding that provided by a personal document courier. A trusted electronic go-between can validate, witness and/or archive transactions while, in some cases, actively participating in or directing the transaction. Printed or imaged documents can be marked using handwritten signature images, seal images, electronic fingerprinting, watermarking, and/or steganography. Electronic commercial transactions and transmissions take place in a reliable, “trusted” virtual distribution environment that provides significant efficiency and cost savings benefits to users in addition to providing an extremely high degree of confidence and trustedness. The systems and techniques have many uses including but not limited to secure document delivery, execution of legal documents, and electronic data interchange (EDI).

No. 6,185,683, which is a continuation of application Ser. No. 08\/699,711, filed Aug. 12, 1996, now abandoned, which is a continuation-in-part of application Serial No. 08\/388,107, filed Feb. 13, 1995, now abandoned.","This application is related to concurrently filed commonly assigned copending application Serial Number 08\/699,712 of Ginter et al. entitled \u201cTrusted Infrastructure Support Systems, Methods and Techniques for Secure Electronic Commerce, Electronic Transactions, Commerce Process Control and Automation, Distributed Computing, and Rights Management\u201d (hereafter referred to as \u201cShear et al\u201d to avoid confusion with the \u201cGinter et al\u201d referenced in the paragraph above). The entire disclosure (including the drawings) of this related Shear et al. patent application is incorporated by reference into this specification as if expressly set forth in this specification.","These inventions relate to secure and trusted delivery of digital information. More specifically, these inventions pertain to techniques, methods and systems for providing reliable, trusted, verifiable delivery, handling, creation and\/or execution of digital items such as documents, executable code (e.g., Java applets), and\/or any other information capable of being represented in digital form. The present invention also relates to commercial and other electronic activities involving a trusted third party electronic go-between (such as a computer controlled process) to audit, validate, and\/or direct electronic transactions, executions and\/or delivery and\/or to archive information representing and\/or at least in part comprising securely communicated digital information.","There is a great need for convenient, cost effective techniques to securely handle and deliver documents and other items. Existing methods such as express and personal couriers, registered mail, facsimile and electronic mail fulfill some of these needs but these techniques each have their problems and are deficient in important ways.","Perhaps the ultimate in secure document handling is the personal trusted courier. Many of us have seen spy films showing a trusted courier delivering documents containing state secrets. In such scenarios, the document sender places the document or other item into a lockable attach\u00e9 case. The sender seals and locks the case with a key or combination that only he and the recipient have. The courier handcuffs the case to his or her wrist, boards an airplane and flies to the required destination\u2014all the while carefully guarding the attach\u00e9 case and its contents. Upon arriving at the destination, the courier personally delivers the case to the intended recipient. The recipient unlocks the case and retrieves its contents, all the while having a high degree of assurance that the contents have been kept secret.","The confidentiality, security and reliability provided by a personal trusted document courier has never really been matched by any other form of document delivery. Even though we sometimes might want or need the services of a personal trusted document courier, it is likely that practical reasons (such as cost and availability) require us to use less trusted forms of delivery for even our most important and confidential documents or other items. Moreover, even the trusted courier technique does not provide a reliable means of later providing how and when the information was used by the recipient and\/or subsequently handled by others to whom the recipient may pass the information and what information was actually sent. This approach also cannot provide the degree of interactivity between the sender and the recipient possible in a world of near instantaneous communications, including seamlessly supporting processes related to rights management, and document creation and dissemination.","As discussed below, existing alternatives to the trusted courier are more practical and less expensive, and some offer advantages such as instantaneous communications and interactivity\u2014but all suffer from various disadvantages.","Federal Express and other express courier services provide rapid (for example, overnight) delivery services at a relatively high degree of trustedness.","In the typical case, the sender places the items to be delivered into a special, tear resistant sealed envelope, and fills out an \u201cair bill\u201d that lists the sender's name, address and telephone number, and the intended recipient's name, address and telephone number. The \u201cair bill\u201d also lists options such as, for example, the type of delivery service required (i.e., delivery next business morning, next business afternoon, or second business day), whether the sender requires Federal Express to obtain the recipient's signature, the payment method, and a unique \u201ctracking number\u201d used to uniquely identify the package.","Once the package is complete and ready to send, the sender may provide it to Federal Express through a number of different methods:\n\n","Federal Express maintains a fleet of aircraft that shuttle most packages to a central sorting and routing facility for subsequent dispatch to various destinations across the United States and the world. A fleet of delivery trucks deliver the packages from local airports to each recipient. At the sender's option, a delivery person may obtain a recipient's signature at the time she delivers the package\u2014providing documentation that may later be used to prove the package was in fact received by the intended recipient or someone at his or her home or office.","Federal Express uses automated computer tracking and package handling equipment to route individual packages to their destinations. Delivery information is put into the tracking computer to allow customers and service people to automatically retrieve information about when and to whom particular packages were actually delivered, or where the package happens to be at the moment.","Federal Express and other similar document delivery services have been highly successful because they cost-effectively ensure reliable delivery of original documents and other items. Nevertheless, they do have some significant disadvantages and limitations. For example:\n\n","These problems are exacerbated when several individuals and\/or organizations in different geographical locations are all parties to a transaction\u2014a complex, multiparty contract, for example\u2014and all must sign or otherwise process and\/or execute one or more related documents.","A relatively more secure delivery technique is registered mail. Registered mail correspondents can have a high degree of confidence that their packages will arrive at their required destinations\u2014but may not like the time delays and additional expense associated with this special form of mail handling.","To use registered mail, the sender places her document or other items into a sealed envelope or package and takes her package to the nearest Post Office. For security, the Post Office may prohibit the use of resealable tape and mailing labels, and instead require the package to be sealed with paper tape and the address to be written directly on the package. These safeguards help to ensure that any attempts to tamper with the package or its contents will be detected.","The Post Office securely transports the registered mail package to the recipient, requiring each postal employee who accepts custody of the package along its journey to sign and time stamp a custody record. The postal carrier at the recipient's end personally delivers the package to the recipient\u2014who also has to sign for it and may be asked to produce proof of identification. The custody record establishes a chain of custody, listing every person who has had custody of the package on its journey from sender to recipient.","As discussed above, registered mail is relatively secure and confidential but delivery takes a long time and is very labor and infrastructure intensive.","Facsimile is an electronic-based technology that provides virtually instantaneous document delivery. A facsimile machine typically includes a document scanner, a document printer, and electronic circuits that convert document images to and from a form in which they can be sent over a telephone line. Facsimile requires each of the sender and the intended recipient to have a facsimile machine. The sender typically places the document to be sent into a document feeder attached to a facsimile machine. The sender then typically keys in the telephone number of the intended recipient's facsimile machine and presses a \u201cstart\u201d button. The sender's facsimile machine automatically dials and establishes contact with the recipient's facsimile machine.","Once a good connection is established, the sender's facsimile machine begins to optically scan the document one page at a time and convert it into digital information bits. The sender's facsimile machine converts the digital bits into a form that can be transmitted over a telephone line, and sends the bits to the intended recipient's facsimile machine. The sender's facsimile machine may also send as part of the document, a \u201cheader\u201d on the top of each page stating the sender's identity, the page number of the transmission, and the transmission time. However, these headers can be changed at will by the sender and therefore cannot be trusted.","Since the recipient's facsimile machine receives the transmitted information at the same time the sender's facsimile machine is sending it, delivery is virtually instantaneous. However, sending a document to an unattended facsimile machine in an insecure location may result in the document falling into the wrong hands. Another common scenario is that the facsimile machine operator, through human error, dials the wrong telephone number and ends up delivering a confidential document to the wrong person (for example, the local grocery store down the street, or in some unfortunate cases, the opposing side of a negotiation, legal proceeding or other pitched battle). Thousands of faxes are lost every day in a \u201cblack hole\u201d\u2014never arriving at their desired destinations but possibly arriving at completely different destinations instead.\n\n","More and more, people are using electronic mail to send documents, messages, and\/or other digital items. The \u201cInternet explosion\u201d has connected millions of new users to the Internet. Whereas Internet electronic mail was previously restricted primarily to the academic world, most corporations and computer-savvy individuals can now correspond regularly over the Internet.","Currently, Internet electronic mail provides great advantages in terms of timeliness (nearly instantaneous delivery) and flexibility (any type of digital information can be sent), but suffers from an inherent lack of security and trustedness. Internet messages must typically pass through a number of different computers to get from sender to recipient, regardless of whether these computers are located within a single company on an \u201cIntranet\u201d for example, or on Internet attached computers belonging to a multitude of organizations. Unfortunately, any one of those computers can potentially intercept the message and\/or keep a copy of it. Moreover, even though some of these systems have limited \u201creturn receipt\u201d capabilities, the message carrying the receipt suffers from the same security and reliability problems as the original message.","Cryptography (a special mathematical-based technique for keeping messages secret and authenticating messages) is now beginning to be used to prevent eavesdroppers from reading intercepted messages, but the widespread use of such cryptography techniques alone will not solve electronic mail's inherent lack of trustedness. These electronic mail messages, documents and other items (e.g., executable computer programs or program fragments) that might have been sent with them as \u201cattachments,\u201d remain vulnerable to tampering and other unauthorized operations and uses once decrypted and while delivery may be reported, actual use can not be demonstrated. Some people have tried to develop \u201cprivacy enhanced\u201d electronic mail, but prior systems have only provided limited improvements in reliability, efficiency and\/or security.","As discussed above, a wide variety of techniques are currently being used to provide secure, trusted confidential delivery of documents and other items. Unfortunately, none of these previously existing mechanisms provide truly trusted, virtually instantaneous delivery on a cost-effective, convenient basis and none provide rights management and auditing through persistent, secure, digital information protection.","In contrast, the present inventions provide the trustedness, confidentiality and security of a personal trusted courier on a virtually instantaneous and highly cost-effective basis. They provide techniques, systems and methods that can bring to any form of electronic communications (including, but not limited to Internet and internal company electronic mail) an extremely high degree of trustedness, confidence and security approaching or exceeding that provided by a trusted personal courier. They also provide a wide variety of benefits that flow from rights management and secure chain of handling and control.","The present inventions preferred embodiment make use of a digital Virtual Distribution Environment (VDE) as a major portion of its operating foundation, providing unique, powerful capabilities instrumental to the development of secure, distributed transaction-based electronic commerce and digital content handling, distribution, processing, and usage management. This Virtual Distribution Environment technology can flexibly enable a wide variety of new business models and business practices while also supporting existing business models and practices.","The Virtual Distribution Environment provides comprehensive overall systems, and wide arrays of methods, techniques, structures and arrangements, that enable secure, efficient electronic commerce and rights management on the Internet and other information superhighways and on internal corporate networks such as \u201cIntranets\u201d. The present inventions use (and in some cases, build upon and enhances) this fundamental Virtual Distribution Environment technology to provide still additional flexibility, capabilities, features and advantages. The present invention, in its preferred embodiment, is intended to be used in combination a broad array of the features described in Ginter, et al, including any combination of the following:","A. VDE chain of handling and control,","B security trusted internodal communication,","C. secure database,","D. authentication,","E. cryptographic,","F. fingerprinting,","G. other VDE security and communication techniques,","H. rights operating system,","I. object design and secure container techniques,","J. container control structures,","K. ARPML rights and process control language,","L. electronic negotiation,","M. secure hardware, and","N. smart agent (smart object) techniques.","For example, parties using the Virtual Distribution Environment can participate in commerce and other transactions in accordance with a persistent set of rules they electronically define. Such techniques, systems and arrangements bring about an unparalleled degree of security, reliability, efficiency and flexibility to electronic commerce, electronic rights management and other important business models. The present inventions make use of these persistent electronic rules to provide secure, automated, cost-effective electronic control for electronic document and other digital item handling and\/or delivery, and for the electronic formation and negotiation of legal contracts and other documents.","By way of non-exhaustive summary, these present inventions provide a highly secure and trusted item delivery and agreement execution services providing the following features and functions:\n\n","System may operate on the Internet, on internal organization and\/or corporate networks (\u201cIntranets\u201d irrespective of whether they use or offer Internet services internally), private data networks, and\/or using any other form of electronic communications.","System may operate in non-networked and\/or intermittently networked environments.","Legal contract execution can be performed in real time, with or without face to face or ear-to-ear personal interactions (such as audiovisual teleconferencing, automated electronic negotiations, or any combination of such interactions) for any number of distributed individuals and\/or organizations using any mixture of interactions.","The items delivered and\/or processed may be any \u201cobject\u201d in digital format, including, but not limited to, objects containing or representing data types such as text, images, video, linear motion pictures in digital format, sound recordings and other audio information, computer software, smart agents, multimedia, and\/or objects any combination of two or more data types contained within or representing a single compound object.","Content (executables for example) delivered with proof of delivery and\/or execution or other use.\n\n","Trustedness provides non-repudiation for legal and other transactions.","Can handle and send any digital information (for example, analog or digital information representing text, graphics, movies, animation, images, video, digital linear motion pictures, sound and sound recordings, still images, software computer programs or program fragments, executables, data, and including multiple, independent pieces of text; sound clips, software for interpreting and presenting other elements of content, and anything else that is electronically representable).","Provides automatic electronic mechanisms that associate transactions automatically with other transactions.","System can automatically insert or embed a variety of visible or invisible \u201csignatures\u201d such as images of handwritten signatures, seals, and electronic \u201cfingerprints\u201d indicating who has \u201ctouched\u201d (used or other interacted with in any monitorable manner) the item.","System can affix visible seals on printed items such as documents for use both in encoding receipt and other receipt and\/or usage related information and for establishing a visible presence and impact regarding the authenticity, and ease of checking the authenticity, of the item.","Seals can indicate who originated, sent, received, previously received and redistributed, electronicallyview, and\/or printed and\/or otherwise used the item.","Seals can encode digital signatures and validation information providing time, location, sender and\/or other information and\/or providing means for item authentication and integrity check.","Scanning and decoding of item seals can provide authenticity\/integrity check of entire item(s) or part of an item (e.g., based on number of words, format, layout, image\u2014picture and\/or text\u2014composition, etc.).","Seals can be used to automatically associate electronic control sets for use in further item handling.","System can hide additional information within the item using \u201csteganography\u201d for later retrieval and analysis.","Steganography can be used to encode electronic fingerprints and\/or other information into an item to prevent deletion. Multiple steganographic storage of the same fingerprint information may be employed reflecting \u201cmore\u201d public and \u201cless\u201d public modes so that a less restricted steganographic mode (different encryption algorithm, keys, and\/or embedding techniques) can be used to assist easy recognition by an authorized party and a more private (confidential) mode may be readable by only a few parties (or only one party) and comprise of the less restricted mode may not affect the security of the more private mode.\n\n","The present inventions also provide for the use of a trusted third party electronic go-between or intermediary in various forms, including the \u201cvirtual presence\u201d of such go-between through the rules and controls it contributes for distributed governance of transactions described in the present invention, and further through the use of a distributed, go-between system operating in on-line and\/or off-line modes at various user and\/or go-between sites. Such a trusted third-party go-between can provide enhanced and automated functionality, features and other advantages such as, for example:\n\n","Trusted go-between can supervise execution of legal items such as documents\u2014ensuring that all required conditions are satisfied and that all parties agree before permitting a document to be executed and informing parties of any as-yet-unsatisfied requirements and allow parties to view completed documents on-screen and\/or in printed form with \u201cdraft, not enforceable\u201d or the like printed on the pages, before final agreement to commit. Actual execution (closing) occurs, for example, as the third party system verifies final, electronically asserted agreement and execution by all parties. Such \u201catomic\u201d transactions are especially useful in supporting \u201cclosings\u201d or the like.\n\n","Trusted go-between can act as a user rights authority clearinghouse for additional and\/or alternative rights which may, for example, be available to particular classes, specific users, at a certain cost, or as specified by the sender. Trusted go-between may also mediate between sender(s) and recipient(s) in response to recipient's request for new, different and\/or modified rights or sender's and\/or receiver's request for third party archived information (which may require the agreement by only one, expressly either one, or both sender(s) and recipient(s).","In addition to multiple individuals and\/or parties in several organizations, a trusted go-between may also provide services to parties within a single organization, thus enhancing the security, reliability, auditability, authentication, efficiency, and timeliness of secure document delivery and secure transaction facilitation within a given organization.","Trusted go-between may provide services both on public networks, such as the Internet, on internal corporate networks (\u201cIntranets\u201d\u2014irrespective of whether or not they use Internet type conventions), and on private networks connecting two or more individuals and\/or organizations exchanging documents and other content in digital format and\/or participating together in various transactions.","A third party go-between can provide a communications switching integration. For example, a communications service provider may automatically provide the go-between services for a connection. For example, certain telephone numbers might be offered that have these services built in to the switching network, or a special dialing sequence might be used to access a communications channel with these characteristics. This can provide data links for networks, or be integrated with traditional fax lines, or even voice lines. For example, a fax transmission might be archived, have a seal inserted during transmission, and\/or have a hash value stored for later reference. A voice transmission could be similarly managed. Both of these examples have the advantage of compatibility with the existing infrastructure (albeit at the cost of lacking persistent control after delivery). Using this infrastructure for data links has the added advantage of transparency.","A third party go-between can provide Transaction Authority services as described in the copending concurrently filed Ginter et al patent application","The entire disclosure of the above-referenced Ginter et al. patent specification is incorporated by reference in connection with .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0206","num":"0258"},"figref":"FIG. 88","b":["4050","4052","4054","4056","4058","4058","4060","4060","100"]},"Item  might be a document such as a handwritten or typed letter, or it could be a legal document such as a contract. It could have both text and pictures, just text or just pictures. It could be a sound recording, a multimedia presentation, or a visual work such as a film or television program. Item  could be any item or information capable of being represented in digital form. The item  can be initially presented to the appliance  in electronic form (for example, on a diskette), or the appliance can convert it from some other form into electronic form.","Electronic delivery person  receives item  in digital form and places it into a secure electronic container \u2014thus forming a digital \u201cobject\u201d . A digital object  may in this case be, for example, as shown in , and may include one or more containers  containing item .  illustrates secure electronic container  as an attach\u00e9 case handcuffed to the secure delivery person's wrist. Once again, container is shown as a physical thing for purposes of illustration only\u2014in the example it is preferably electronic rather than physical, and comprises digital information having a well-defined structure (see ). Special mathematical techniques known as \u201ccryptography\u201d can be used to make electronic container  secure so that only intended recipient  can open the container and access the electronic document (or other item)  it contains.","In this example, sender  sends item  by supplying the document to an electronic appliance A. In this example, electronic appliance A is an intelligent electronic walk-up kiosk that may be located in a public place or on private property, such as the offices or work areas of a firm. Appliance A in this example has a document slot  into which sender  can feed item . Electronic appliance A can automatically, optically scan the item  and convert it into digital information for sending over an electronic connection or network  (such as, for example, electronic highway  shown in ). The item  can be sent to one or many recipients specified by sender .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0210","num":"0262"},"figref":["FIG. 89","FIGS. 7 and 8"],"b":["600","600","600","93","93"]},"Referring to , the example kiosk appliance A can include a computer screen  for displaying informational messages, and user operable controls  such as push buttons for allowing sender  to select between delivery options. Appliance  in this example may also include a card reader  for reading a credit card or other kind of card provided by the sender . Additionally, if desired, electronic appliance A may include a telephone receiver  and telephone dialing keypad  (or other input devices) to allow sender  to get information and assistance or give additional instructions. Electronic appliance A may optionally include a keyboard for entering textual and other information (not shown).","Also as shown in , electronic appliance A may optionally include a video camera  and may display remote video in a \u201cwindow\u201d  on screen  (or on an optionally separate screen not shown). Camera  allows appliance  to take a photograph of sender  and\/or recipient . It may also allow sender  and recipient  to see each other in order to simultaneously authenticate each other's identity visually\u2014and to have a \u201cteleconference\u201d discussion about item  or other matters. The electronic appliance  may also have a microphone\/speaker  perhaps to coordinate details of the pending transaction. Appliance A might also include a media reader  to read from a floppy diskette, smart card or other digital storage device. The appliance  can include, in addition, a document shredder\/destroyer .","Also as shown in , appliance A in this example has a secure processing unit (SPU)  (see ).

Sender  may select different ways to identify recipient  based on the confidentiality of the document and the level of security the sender is willing to pay for. In one example, sender  might require the recipient's appliance B to require recipient  to prove that he is who he says he is. This secure \u201cauthentication\u201d function might be met by, for example, requiring recipient  to input a password, present digital proof of identity using, for example:","a digital document or \u201ccertificate\u201d issued by a trusted third party, and\/or","have appliance  measure a biometric characteristic of the recipient such as, for example, taking the recipient's photograph (and possibly automatically compare it with a known photograph of the recipient supplied by sender  or system ) or using any other biometric sensing technique.","Sender  may also specify the electronic address of recipient , or it might let system  automatically, securely and confidentially locate the recipient using a secure directory service as described in the copending Shear et al. application.","Once sender  has selected the service options she desires, appliance  may next display a message on computer screen  asking sender  to insert item  into document slot  for electronic scanning. When the sender  inserts the document  or other item (, block C), electronic appliance  may (if necessary) automatically, optically scan item  to create an electronic, digital form of the document (using conventional optical scanning and optical character recognition technology, for example). During this scanning process, appliance  might display a message on computer screen  such as \u201cI am scanning your document now . . . . \u201d Instead of feeding in a document, the sender might provide the document or other item in digital form by inserting a floppy diskette or smart card into reader , or by connecting a portable computer up to port  and having the portable computer \u201cupload\u201d the document into appliance .","The item  to be sent need not be a document, but could be any type of item capable of being transformed into digital form such as, for example:","pictures or other graphical information;","sound information such as voice, music or both;","executable computer program or other code;","video, film or other moving image sequences;","multimedia, video games and the like;","any combination or subcombination of the above.","After appliance  has scanned or otherwise received the entirety of document  or other item, appliance  may calculate and display a total price on computer screen  and ask sender  to pay for the service (, block D).

For example, a well made certificate is essentially unforgeable (which is to say, it would be easier to fabricate a electronic fingerprint carrying device, for example, than a well made certificate  barring unforeseen advances in mathematics), but the trouble with certificates is the weakness of correlation between physical access (e.g., holding the card, or sitting at the appliance) and permission to use. Passwords are a weak form of authentication\u2014that is, establishing this correlation. Biometric techniques, particularly iris and retinal scans, are stronger forms of authentication. It is possible for biometric information to be encoded in a field of a certificate , and for the software controlling the card to confirm that the biometric input is consistent with the field in the certificate prior to authorizing use of the certificate or the card in general. This authentication may be limited in time (e.g., using an inactivity time out, each time the card is inserted, etc.) In addition, a transaction might require this authentication to occur simultaneous with use (rather than for an entire session, even if the card only requires one authentication per session).","After payment has been arranged (, block C), electronic delivery person  will open secure container  and give recipient  a printed and\/or electronic copy of item  only once he is satisfied\u2014to the degree required by sender \u2014that the recipient  is the correct person.","Electronic delivery person  may also note various information about the delivery (illustrated here by having him write the information down on a clipboard , but implemented in practice by electronically storing an \u201caudit\u201d trail). System  may\u2014based on the particular receipt options sender  requested\u2014provide the sender with an electronic and\/or paper receipt of the type shown in , for example (, step D). Such an example receipt  might specify, for example:\n\n","The sender's electronic appliance A and the recipient's electronic appliance B can report their respective \u201caudit trails\u201d periodically or upon completion of delivery or some other event. They can report the audit information to a support facility such as information utility usage analyst C (see ).

For example, an option to destroy the original item at the send end and recreate it at the recipient's end (e.g., in the case of the stock certificate mentioned earlier) is both a send option and a receipt option. Similarly, options pertaining to procedures for electronic contract execution typically will require pre-agreement from both the sender and the recipient (i.e., from all parties to the contract). In these cases, there should be some menu options that are driven by the address of the proposed recipient\u2014and there may be an electronic (or humanly-driven) negotiation to resolve conflicts.","The PPE 's \u201cregister recipient\u201d processing may also require input or other interaction from the user.  show a relatively straightforward menu-based user interface that may be used to elicit information from sender . In a more advanced example, DTDs  (see  and following) associated with one or more load modules  may be used to control user interfaces (e.g., the \u201cpop up\u201d as shown in )). In this model, the user interface does not contain any specific visual elements (e.g., menus, buttons, data entry fields, etc.). Instead, the pop up contains application \u201cframework\u201d code. The framework code in this style of user interface uses a structured input stream (DTD ) from the PPE  to create the visual elements of the interface, and optionally the allowed values of certain fields. This structured data stream may (like other control structure DTDs ) be based on SGIL, for example.","This dynamic user interface approach allows control structures to be more \u201cself describing\u201d in the sense that application programs do not need to know ahead of time (i.e. when they are written) all of the fields, values, etc. for the structures. This gives structure designers more freedom in how their controls are designed. Given a rich enough grammar in the DTD , designers needn't concern themselves with whether application programs will have the ability to manage the interaction with a user regarding their structures.

If there is a problem with the controls (e.g., they are for some reason unacceptable to the sender, they are not valid, etc.), the sender's PPE  determines whether the problem is critical (, decision block J). If the problem is critical, PPE  aborts the whole process (\u201cY\u201d exit to  decision block J).","If the problem is not critical (\u201cN\u201d exit to  decision block J), PPE  performs an exception process (, decision block L) to handle the problem and then waits for the next event\u2014which in this particular example may be a \u201cgenerate secure object\u201d event (see , block ).  shows example steps the PPE  may perform in response to this \u201ccreate secure object\u201d event based on the control sets registered in accordance with step , for example.","Referring to , the PPE  may use the dynamic user interaction techniques described above to request sender  to select between send options and to otherwise specify the type and level of service he or she desires ( block A; see  block A). Generally, sender  may be required to select between various options; each option may carry with it a certain price. The following are example options the sender  may select from:","Document Options\n\n","Seal options\n\n","Delivery Options\n\n","Contract Execution Options\n\n","Teleconferencing Options\n\n","In the dynamic user interface model, for example, the user options associated with a contract offer (which are used to create electronic controls associated with the electronic transaction) might relate to a suggested addition, modification, deletion, etc. to an existing item . If the VDE-aware applications used by the participants included word processing capabilities (given that the negotiation has a text based portion), for example, the VDE protected content in the offer could be represented as a \u201credline\u201d or \u201crevision marking.\u201d The controls could further include aspects that manage modification of content in a controlled way (e.g., see , and ). A more complex example might include several of these modifications, insertions, deletions, etc. in a single offer to represent a \u201chorse trading\u201d offer indicating a willingness to make a series of changes at once, for example, a willingness to pay more money in exchange for removing a restrictive clause.","The options (and associated controls) associated with a contractual offer may also permit the offerer and\/or the recipient to add comments to the offer before it is sent and\/or accepted. These comments and\/or some or all of the negotiation history may be recorded and managed using the audit capabilities of VDE and\/or one or more repositories for VDE objects.","In this example, the PPE  checks the user input for validity (, decision block B) based on applicable controls, and may abort the process (or provide other suitable exception handling) if the input is not valid.","PPE  may next specify any audit and routing controls based on the user input it has received and\/or the recipient controls it has registered (, block C).

Step C typically also involve creating electronic controls specifying permissions and\/or restrictions relating to the use of item . In fact, the electronic control set(s)  created by block C may, for example, specify a variety of different document delivery or other characteristics such as, for example:\n\n","Control set  can be used to enforce a secure chain of handling and control on document container  and\/or its contents. This secure chain of handling and control may be used, for example, to specify delivery, routing, auditing or other parameters as discussed above.","In performing step , appliance  may also create routing slip  (see ) and a template for return receipt(s) .","In one example, items , , may be embodied within electronic control set  and expressed by the various elements within the electronic control set.  shows an example of a routing slip  data structure that may be maintained within secure electronic container  (e.g., as one or more DTDs  in connection with one or more load modules \u2014see ).

A receipt \u201ctemplate\u201d may be included in the container, may be referenced in an archive, or may be named out of a set of default templates stored in each appliance.","The routing slip  (see ) associated with the document(s) in the container may be integrated with control information  reflecting chain of handling and control relationships among recipients. For example, the control information  associated with the item(s)  may be correlated with fields of the routing slip . Successful completion of a receipt may qualify a specific user to become eligible to use a subset of the control information  that permits them to make changes in a portion of the item, and describe their own control information for the changes, so long as this control information does not provide further recipients with the right to modify the new material. The control information  may further specify that no changes may be made to an item  until one or more specified recipients has read the item, and (through use of reciprocal controls as show in \u2013for example) indicated their approval of further changes.","In another example, an entire class of users may be permitted to access the documents (through the presence of a certificate indicating their membership in a class, for example), and the routing slip  may be used to record who has handled a particular version of the document. Through use of chain of handling and control techniques, the presence of certain users on the routing slip may permit further control information to be specified by a user. For example, after an analyst's research report has been reviewed by three other analysts, a manager may be permitted to modify the control information associated with the report to permit transmission to \u201cpublic\u201d users.","Electronic controls  may also include one or more control methods specifying the type of audit information that is to be maintained in connection with the electronic transaction.

Such audit information may be maintained exclusively within the sender's appliance , it might be maintained exclusively within the recipient's appliance secure database, it might be maintained exclusively within the trusted go-between 's appliance  secure database, or it might be maintained in a combination of any or all of these. Additionally, the audit information may or may not be delivered with item  depending on the particular objectives. A usage clearinghouse as described above in connection with  and\/or as disclosed in the Shear et al. patent disclosure may be used to track the audit information based on event-driven or periodic reporting, for example.

Audit information  may also be treated as part of the signaling methodology described for reciprocal methods (see \u2013) to provide receipts. For example, copies of receipts may be delivered to the sender, as described above, as well as to the sender's manager in a corporate setting, or to the sender's legal counsel or other professional advisors (such as tax advisers, accountants, physicians, etc.) Some items  which are delivered to, or used by, recipients to gather information (such as tax forms, purchase orders, sales reports, and insurance claims) may require delivery of receipts to several parties other than the sender. Some transactions may require the delivery of such receipts before completion. For example, a sales report requesting delivery of products from a company's inventory may require that a receipt from the reading of a document delivered to the sales organization be received by the accounting department for audit purposes before permitting receipt of the document by the sales organization.","Referring once again to , electronic appliance  may next request authority from sender  to obtain payment for delivery of the item (, block ; , block D). Payment may be by any convenient mechanism, and may be made by the sender, the recipient and\/or by a third party. This payment processing in this example is handled by PPE  in accordance, for example, with one or more billing methods as shown in  for example.","The appliance  is then ready to accept item  (such as a document) to be sent if the item hasn't already been inputted (, block ;  block E). PPE  may (based on control sets specifying this) use the dynamic user interaction technique described above to interact with the sender  and obtain the requested item for transmission. As mentioned above, for physical documents, appliance  can optically scan the document into electronically readable form employing document reader\/scanner  using page reader technology and\/or optical character recognition, for example. For electronic documents or other items such as those created by a personal computer  (see ), this \u201cinputting\u201d step may be a matter of having sender  select or create the item using standard document or file creation applications, or physically picking such document using icons or other menu-driven techniques. In one particular example, sender  may \u201cselect\u201d a document or item to send by commanding a word processing or other application to \u201cprint\u201d or otherwise write the item to a particular virtual printer or other output device which is mapped into the overall secure electronic delivery process.","Appliance  may store the item in any of multiple representations. For example, it could store it in Adobe Acrobat (PDF) or other text based page description. Storing the document in CCIT Group III Facsimile format is an example of a \u201cuniversal\u201d image format for black and white images. Group V is an example of a color format. TIFF is another example that incorporates many image types, as well as different compression formats and descriptive metadata.","PPE  may perform various tests on the inputted item and\/or other results of the user interaction provided by block E in accordance with one or more user controls. For example, if the sender has specified that he is sending a 6 page letter but only inputs five pages, PPE  may notice this discrepancy and notify the sender (, decision block F). PPE  may abort the process or perform other suitable exception handling (\u201cN\u201d exit to decision block F) if the results of the test are not satisfactory.","PPE  may embed any seals , signatures  or hidden signatures  into the item if needed (, block ). This process may involve, for example, identifying signature insertion locations and embedding signatures upon directed or other controlled circumstances. \u201cIntelligent\u201d optical character recognition (OCR) may be used to identify signature locations. The display might also show an image of the page and allow the operator to identify the signature locations, for themselves, or more importantly, for other parties. The PDF (or other document description format) expressions could be extended to include a code that would allow indication of signature insertion points.","Depending upon the particular electronic controls being used, placement of the sender's signature or seal on the document may be based on the PPE 's authentication of the sender as shown in FIG. \u2014and may require an additional indication of assent from the sender\u2014for example, pressing a \u201cYes\u201d button, providing additional biometric or other identification information (e.g., \u201cplace your finger on the sensor if you want to sign this letter\u201d or \u201cProvide your mother's maiden name to sign this letter\u201d). Such authentication is important for non-repudiation and to prevent fraud. The sender might actually sign his signature on a pressure-sensitive or magnetic-sensing signature capture and\/or verification pad, provide a bit-map image of his signature by presenting a \u201csmart card\u201d storing it (plus using appropriate authentication techniques to assure that the bitmap image is being presented by the true signature owner), or provide enough information through user interaction as described above that the PPE  can access an electronic signature file containing the signature (e.g., stored locally within appliance  or accessible over network  from an archive).","In the multi-party execution example shown in , appliance  could simultaneously embed two or more signatures into the same document or other item \u2014but only upon securely receiving indications that all signatories assent to the document's terms.","Appliance  may next place the item and associated electronic controls into one or more secure containers  (, block H). Referring to  once again, step  normally involves placing the image I of item  (including any seats, signatures and other information) into the secure container . It may also involve placing a data (e.g., text) version of the item D into the same or different container , along with possibly adding tools  for using the item in either or both forms. The PPE  may then send the completed object  to an object switch  (see ) for transmission to the recipient.","Referring to , appliance  may then deliver the secure container(s)  to the intended recipient  and\/or to trusted electronic go-between  based upon the instructions of sender  as now reflected in the electronic controls  associated with the object  (, block ). Such delivery is preferably by way of electronic network  (), but may be performed by any convenient electronic means such as, for example, Internet, Electronic Mail or Electronic Mail Attachment, WEB Page Direct, Telephone, floppy disks, bar codes in a fax transmission, filled ovals on a form delivered through physical mail, or any other electronic means to provide contact with the intended recipient(s).","Appliance  may, through further interaction with PPE , immediately and\/or later provide a receipt such as shown in  (, block ). Appliance  can immediately issue a receipt indicating that the object  has been sent. If rapid electronic communications means are being used, appliance  may also receive audit trail information from the recipient's appliance  while the sender waits, and issue a receipt indicating some or all of the kind of recipient interaction information shown in the  example receipt. This receipt providing step may, for example, be based on PPE  receiving one or more administrative or other objects  containing audit information (see ).","For purposes of security and trustedness, PPE  may actually \u201cissue\u201d the receipt\u2014although it may use various other portions of appliance  (e.g., receipt printer A, display , card\/media reader , , etc.) to output the receipt to the sender . PPE  may also or alternatively maintain a copy of the receipt information (and\/or the audit information  on which it is based) within its secure database  (see ).

For example, appliance  may check one or more digital signatures  within container  to ensure that they are authentic, or perform other authentication tests as described in detail above. PPE  may perform critical and\/or non-critical exception processing (not shown) if the received object  and its contents are not autheritic.","PPE  may analyze any seal or other secure information that is part of the item . For example, although the item image may be captured and cropped by untrusted processes, the analysis of the image data is preferably done inside the PPE . Once the seal option of the image is identified, an analysis process will be run to recover the digital information stored in the seal (or steganographically encoded in the document). The next step is to determine what the expected values should be. To do this, the PPE  may make requests of an application program running locally to determine a user's expectations, may use a digital representation of a receipt or other audit data, and\/or may contact a trusted go-between or other trusted third party to obtain the appropriate expected values. To facilitate this process, there may be some unencrypted information in the seal that can be used to establish a correlation with other information (e.g., a receipt, a transaction number, etc.). If such information is not available, a local store or a trusted third party might compare the entirety of the recovered digital information with stored records to determine such a correlation. In other cases, the expected values may be determined from context (e.g. a default set of expected values; or by examining the seal information itself, in either encrypted or decrypted form, for \u201ctags\u201d or other schema or semantic information).","Once the expectation values of the information is determined, any encrypted portion must be decrypted using the public key corresponding to the private key used above to make the seal. This key can be obtained using the mechanisms discussed in Ginter et al. Once decrypted, the expected values may be compared with the actual values to determine correlation. Information about the correlation may be reported to a user and\/or a third party, as appropriate. In addition, some or all of the seal information may be included in such report.","Once PPE  is satisfied that the received item is authentic, it may embed receipt related information into the item if the electronic controls  associated with the item require it (, block D). In one example, the \u201celectronic fingerprinting\u201d techniques described above in connection with  may be used for encoding various types of information onto item \u2014for example, to show where the document has been. PPE  may embed seals  and\/or hidden information  onto the item image I at this time if desired. Electronic fingerprinting, sealing and embedding hidden information may also be performed by the PPE  at the sender's  site\u2014but, it may be advantageous to delay this process until the item arrives at the recipient's site because more things have happened to the item by then. For example, it may be desirable to encode, into seal , hidden information  and\/or hidden or unhidden electronic fingerprinting and\/or watermarking information, the time stamp of when the recipient actually opened the container . In some arrangements, one seal, hidden signature or hidden or unhidden electronic fingerprint could be added at the end of sender , and an additional seal, piece of hidden information and\/or hidden or visible electronic fingerprint could be added at the end of recipient . Any or all of these various techniques may be used depending upon business requirements, convenience, logistics and aesthetics.","PPE  may next perform any required payment and\/or other processing as needed (, block E). For example, PPE  may charge the recipient  for receiving the document (e.g., \u201ccollect on delivery\u201d) or it may perform other processing such as debiting, crediting, initiating a local audit, round robin pass along, or the like\u2014all as specified for example by electronic controls .","Referring again to , appliance  may next index or otherwise catalog item  for later access and reference (, block ), and may automatically identify document\/file format for storage or presentation to recipient  (, block ).

If the return is structured appropriately for automated processing, tax calculations and application of relevant tax rules can also be automated by the trusted go-between.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0463","num":"0731"},"figref":"FIG. 102","b":["700","700","600","1","600","3","600","5","600","2","600","7","600","10","600","12","600","1","600","3","600","5","4700","4700"],"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0078","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0078-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0079","list-style":"none"},"li":["send the memo (in secure containers) in \u201cround robin\u201d fashion to each of users (A)(), (A)() and (A)() for approval.","If any one of these users changes the memo, then trusted go-between (A) can circulate the revised memo to the other two for additional comments and revisions.","Once all three of users (A)(), (A)() and (A)() approve the memo, trusted go-between (A) may be empowered to place each of their digital and\/or handwritten signatures or initials on the memo, place it into one or more secure containers with a control set specifying it is read only and can only be read by users (A)()\u2013(A)(), (A)(), (A)()\u2013(A)() and (A)().","Trusted go-between (A) may then send a copy of the memo in a container to each of these users, or could require the same container to circulate from one to another.","The trusted go-between  may require the electronic controls to maintain a secure audit trail indicating where the container has been, who has opened it, who has accessed the memo it contains, and when. Trusted go-between (A) might thus increase personal accountability by evidencing whether a particular person had seen a particular document, when, and for how long."]}}}},"Organization A's Intranet  might also be used to exchange and\/or distribute highly confidential design specifications. System  can provide a highly secure audit trail indicating who has had access to a container containing the confidential design specifications; when the person(s) accessed it; and what they did with the specification (print a copy, view it on screen for so many minutes, make a copy of it, etc.) System  (with or without the assistance of a trusted go-between (A) can also maintain, in digital form, a detailed record of who has \u201csigned off\u201d on the design specifications\u2014thus ensuring personal accountability and providing a high degree of efficiency.","Private transaction authorities (A), (B) can also provide a \u201cfirewall\u201d function to protect confidential information from escaping to outside of the respective organizations A, B. Suppose for example that organization A is an integrated circuit design house and organization B is an integrated circuit foundry. Organization A designs and specifies the circuit layout of a chip, producing a \u201ctape out\u201d that it sends to organization B. Organization B manufactures an integrated circuit based on the \u201ctape out\u201d, and delivers chips to organization A.","System  can be used to facilitate the above business transaction while protecting confidentiality within each of organizations A and B. For example:\n\n","Organization B's trusted go-between (B) could manage the chip manufacturing process, ensuring that all steps and conditions required to manufacture chips in accordance with organization A's design specification are followed.","Telecommunications are becoming ubiquitous in post-industrial societies. As a convenience to customers, the trusted go-between could offer many of its services as part of, or in conjunction with providers of telecom services. In one non-limiting example shown in , a trusted go-between  is co-located and integrated with a telephone switch that connects to a telephone or other telecommunications network via wires (or other connections)  (in another example, the switch and trusted-go between  cooperate, but are not co-located). In one example, a person with a laptop  or other computer lacking a PPE  wishes nontheless to take advantage of a subset of secure item delivery services. The computer  is equipped with a fax modem and associated application software. The computer dials a special number which may be an \u201c800\u201d number and is connected to the trusted go-between  who authenticates the sender using a pre-established password and\/or stronger methods such as biometric measurements. The sender indicates the telephone number of fax machine to receive the document.","After selection of delivery options and trusted go-between services, and after making arrangements for payment, the sender's computer  faxes the document pages , , to the trusted go-between . In one example, the trusted go-between  applies seals  to each page , , of the faxed document and an additional seal for the overall document. The trusted go-between  then faxes the sealed document to the recipient fax machine . The trusted go-between  also archives and notarizes the sealed document in case the sender or other authorized party requires proof that the document was sent on a particular time and date to a device with a particular telephone number. In the event that the sender's and\/or recipient's appliance is VDE aware (e.g., fax machine equipped with a protected processing environment ), this service will be provided with additional levels of security and trustedness.","In another example, the sender may prefer to have the document delivered in a secure container over a network such as the Internet, in which case, the sender may indicate the recipient's network address. The sender may connect a personal computer  with a modem to another special number and send a digital item to the trusted go-between  using Internet protocols. In this one example, the sender may not have yet installed VDE, and so the trusted go-between takes the document or item and puts it in a secure container along with controls selected by the sender and delivers the secure container to the recipient, who in this example, does have VDE installed.","These examples illustrate the more general point that the trusted go-between  may provide a range of value-added services even to parties who do not yet have the VDE installed on their appliances, and can enhance the security and trustedness of item delivery nevertheless.","While the invention has been described in connection with what is presently considered to be the most practical and preferred embodiment, it is to be understood that the invention is not to be limited to the disclosed embodiment, but on the contrary, is intended to cover various modifications and equivalent arrangements included within the spirit and scope of the appended
