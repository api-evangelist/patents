{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["PRIORITY CLAIM AND REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND ART","DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION","BEST MODE OF CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61\/137,554, filed Jul. 31, 2008, under 35 U.S.C. Section 119, and also claims benefit as a National Stage Entry of PCT\/US2009\/52483, which has an international filing date of Jul. 31, 2009.","This application was made with Government assistance under Grant No. 2004-IJ-CX-K0555 issued by Department of Justice. The Government has certain rights in this invention.","A field of the invention is analyte collection. Embodiments of the invention may be useful, for example, in analyte detection and analysis systems and methods, as might be used for the collection, detection, and analysis of a wide range of vapors or gases, particulate, and\/or liquid bound analytes.","Analyte detection is becoming increasingly important as a security and safety measure. Transportation, commercial, government, educational, and other facilities have a need for the sensitive and rapid detection of analytes, such as (but not limited to) those that are indicative of explosives or other substances that pose a threat. In addition, in industrial, residential, and commercial settings analyte detection can provide warning of particles or vapors that pose a health or safety risk. Example analytes that can be detected include hazardous materials such as but not limited to explosive-related materials, toxic industrial chemicals (TICS), or chemical or biological agents.","Analysis instruments have been developed and are under development to meet the need for detection of analytes. A non-limiting example analysis instrument currently being used in both portable and larger forms is the Ion Mobility Spectrometer (IMS). More particular examples of an IMS include the GE Vapor Tracer models, though other types of IMS may be used. Speed and sensitivity are primary concerns, and thus researchers and manufacturers seek to improve the speed and sensitivity of such analysis instruments.","A typical IMS device has separate particle and vapor modes. In a particle mode, an assembly is affixed to the device to accept and desorb particles from a substrate such as a swab (though other substrates are possible). The swab, for example, may be inserted into the assembly and heated to vaporize any collected particulates. The vapor is directed via vacuum into the instrument for analysis. Another assembly can be affixed to the device for vapor mode, a mode in which the device collects vapors for analyte detection.","Preconcentrators offer the opportunity to enhance the performance of any type of analysis instrument by increasing the concentration of analyte in a volume of fluid sent for analysis. Generally, preconcentrators collect analyte over a period of time (during adsorption) and then provide a concentrated fluid stream to the analysis instrument (during desorption).","Rapid preconcentration requires rapid heating. Accordingly, successful microscale preconcentrators have advantages regarding cycling and desorption, as heating to accomplish desorption can be conducted quickly and with low power. Example microscale preconcentrators are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,257,835 to Manginell et al., entitled \u201cChemical Preconcentrator with Integral Thermal Flow Sensor\u201d, and in U.S. Pat. No. 6,171,378 to Manginell et al., entitled \u201cChemical Preconcentrator\u201d. For example, a chemical preconcentrator may be formed from a substrate having a suspended membrane, such as low-stress silicon nitride. This work incorporates a flow over design.","Multiple stage designs are often used for high volume concentration. Examples of multiple stage designs are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,854,431 to Linker et al., entitled \u201cTwo Stage Preconcentrator for Vapor\/Particle Detection\u201d, and U.S. Pat. No. 6,085,601 to Linker et al., entitled \u201cParticle Preconcentrator\u201d.","Example microscale preconcentrators with a flow through design are disclosed in U.S. Published Patent Application No. 20050095722 (incorporated by reference herein), published May 5, 2005, and entitled \u201cMicro scale Flow Through Sorbent Plate Collection Device\u201d, and in U.S. Published Patent Application No. 20050226778, published Oct. 13, 2005, and entitled \u201cMicro scale Flow Through Sorbent Plate Collection Device\u201d. The flow through design has a number of advantages, one of which is increasing contact between analyte fluid flow and a sorbent in a collection area compared to typical flow over designs that would require creating a turbulent flow to match the level of analyte fluid-sorbent contact.","However, while one or more of the preconcentrators described above are suitable for low volume collection, high volume collection for continuous testing presents special challenges. One reason is that preconcentrators and analysis instruments have generally been designed to conduct sampling over small time periods. Accordingly, the volume of sample flow that can be accommodated is generally small.","According to embodiments of the present invention, a large volume preconcentrator device for concentrating analytes is provided. An example device comprises a housing that accepts an analyte vapor flow, and a plurality of collection surfaces are disposed within the housing. A selectively actuatable heater is disposed on each of the collection surfaces.","At least one selectively actuatable damper is disposed within the housing for selectively restricting a collection flow.","Embodiments of the present invention provide, among other things, a preconcentrator suitable for collecting and desorbing a large volume of analyte. An example large volume preconcentrator is especially well-suited for vapor and particulate sampling within an HVAC system, though preconcentrators according to embodiments of the present invention may be used with other systems and\/or analysis instruments. Such large volume preconcentrators may be used in concert with other preconcentrators to provide a multiple stage preconcentrator.","Generally, a large volume preconcentrator according to example embodiments of the invention includes a housing that accepts an analyte vapor flow, and houses one or more collection surfaces. Preferably, the collection surfaces are provided by surfaces of angled supports, for example louvers, disposed within the housing. Heaters may be provided on, for example affixed to, the collection surfaces. In a preferred embodiment, the heaters are affixed to both opposing surfaces (faces); that is, the collection surface and an opposed surface of each louver. Preferably, the heaters are thin and thermally isolated from the supporting louvers. In an example large volume preconcentrator, the heaters are adhered to both sides of the louvers. Alternatively, the heaters may be suspended in air to provide thermal insulation. The heaters on the collection face (the surface of the louver facing the collection flow of the analyte) are preferably (but not necessarily) coated with a sorbent material that collects target analytes while at a predetermined temperature, for example (but not necessarily) room temperature or ambient temperature, and desorbs upon heating to elevated temperatures (e.g., temperatures above the temperature used for collection). By thermally isolating the heaters from the supporting louvers, the amount of material to heat can be minimized, thus ensuring rapid heating and a concentrated analyte pulse.","In example embodiments, the narrow louvers may be fixed with respect to the housing (or at least can be fixed during collection and desorption), and the collection faces generally form a collection plane for collecting analyte. Immediately upstream of the collection plane, one or more selectively movable dampers are provided within the housing to selectively block fluid flow further upstream. In an example embodiment, adjustable louvers disposed within the housing are used alone or in combination as a valve to stop collection during desorption of the collected analyte. Once the heaters on the collection surfaces are heated, the pressure drop over the louver valve can then be used to drive analyte from the large volume preconcentrator to an outside system or device. Nonlimiting examples of outside systems or devices include a detector, an HVAC system, or an additional (e.g., second) preconcentator stage.","Preferred embodiments will now be discussed with respect to the drawings. The drawings include schematic figures that are not to scale, which will be fully understood by skilled artisans with reference to the accompanying description. Features may be exaggerated for purposes of illustration. From the preferred embodiments, artisans will recognize additional features and broader aspects of the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIGS. 1A-1B","FIGS. 1A-1B"],"b":["10","10","12","12","14","12","12","16","18","12","12","12","12"]},"To collect and desorb analyte, at least one and preferably a plurality of collection surfaces  are provided within the housing . In the example preconcentrator  shown in , the collection surfaces  are provided by respective surfaces of a plurality of supports, for example louvers , that are disposed within the housing . Preferably, these supports, e.g., louvers , are thin and narrow. By thin, it is contemplated that the thickness (depth) of the louvers  be sufficiently small to reduce blocking of fluid flow during collection. If the louvers  are too thick, they may cause a pressure drop and take more power to heat up (both slower to heat as well as more power necessary to heat them). Optimal thickness (thinness) can vary depending on factors such as the velocity of the air. Nonlimiting example louvers have a thickness on the order of millimeters, though other thicknesses are contemplated. Narrowness of the louvers  refers to how wide the louvers are with respect to the airflow and the complete width of the housing . For example, a small number (as a nonlimiting example, two) of the louvers  may be provided that are wider, or alternatively there may be many narrow louvers (or numbers or louvers or widths in between), though each particular configuration may provide a (desired) larger surface area or meet other criteria (as a nonlimiting example, mechanical considerations as needed or desired).","The louvers  may be supported within the housing  in any suitable manner, and may be supported either independently or as one or more combined surfaces (e.g., in a frame). As shown in , the louvers  may be aligned, such as in a vertical arrangement, but this is not necessary in all embodiments. For example, one or more of the collection surfaces  (e.g., surface of the louvers ) may instead be offset from other collection surfaces so that they do not interfere with one another during a desorption phase.","The louvers  are preferably (but not necessarily) fixed in position with respect to the housing  (and thus are referred to as fixed louvers in some example embodiments), and may be angled so that the collection surfaces  face toward the collection flow  to collect the analyte, as shown in . Accordingly, the collection surfaces  are also referred to as collection faces herein. It is preferred that the angle of attack and the velocity of the incoming fluid (e.g., air) maximize capture of vapor and particles, but this is not necessary in all embodiments. Preferably, the louvers  are also angled so that the collection surfaces  face away from the desorption flow  so that the desorption flow leads away from the collection surfaces. In other words, in a particular example embodiment, the louvers  may be angled such that a direction normal to the collection surfaces  is at least partly toward the collection flow  and at least partly in the direction of the desorption flow . A nonlimiting example for the angle of the louvers  is 45\u00b0. Surfaces of the louvers  provide both the collection surface  and an opposing surface .","For desorbing the analyte, as best shown in , a heater  (preconcentrator element) is disposed over the collection surfaces , and preferably also over the opposing surfaces . An example heater  is a metal film heater. The heater  is preferably thin in comparison to the thickness of the louvers . Generally, the heater  is adequately thin so that the elements have a fast thermal time constant, for example less than a second. The heater  is preferably thermally isolated from the collection surfaces  and the opposing surfaces  via a thermal insulating layer . Alternatively, the heater  may be suspended in air to provide thermal insulation (the surface of the heater  provides the collection surface). It is also contemplated in other particular embodiments for the heaters  to be free-standing or suspended, in which case a surface of the heater would provide the collection surface. In this latter case, the supports can be reduced or eliminated.","In the example embodiment shown in , the thermal insulating layer  is a polyimide film, and more particularly a 100 \u03bcm Kapton film. By thermally isolating the heater  from the collection surface  (and preferably also from the opposing surface ) the amount of material to heat is minimized, providing more rapid heating as well as a concentrated analyte pulse.","For collecting analyte, the collection surfaces  preferably include a layer  of a sorbent material, as best shown in . The layer of sorbent material can vary according to the analyte to be collected, as will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art. A nonlimiting example sorbent material is a sorbent polymer.","A significant design consideration for vapor or particle preconcentrators based on thermal desorption is the rate at which the collection surface  can be heated. Preferred embodiment devices are designed to provide a thermal power density sufficient to heat only the top surfaces of the heater up to 230\u00b0 C. or some appropriate thermal desorption temperature. A preferred embodiment strip heater  is shown in . Using flex circuit fabrication techniques, example heater traces  are sandwiched between a thermal distribution layer (high thermal conductivity)  and a thermal isolation layer (low thermal conductivity), such as layer . In the example heater  shown in , the thermal distribution layer  is silicon nitride, the heater traces  are copper or gold, and the thermal isolation layer  is polyimide (e.g., Kapton). In a nonlimiting example, the strip heater  is 6-12\u2033 in length and 1-2 cm in width, though these can of course vary.","Not shown in  (but shown in ) is the layer of sorbent material . A nonlimiting example sorbent material is the Naval Research Laboratory's HC polymer that selectively absorbs target analytes at room temperature and releases them at elevated temperatures approaching 200\u00b0 C. This polymer layer may be deposited from its solvated form onto the thermal distribution layer  by inkjet printing, dip coating, or spray coating. Other sorbent materials may be used in the alternative. Thus, an example heater  may generally be composed of a stack comprising (from bottom to top); the thermal insulation layer  such as a polyimide, the heater trace , a thin dielectric layer (in some example embodiments) (not shown), which may be a relatively poor thermal conductor, the metallic thermal distribution layer , and the sorbent layer  (shown in ).","The individual heater strips  may be linked together in parallel over relatively large areas in order to simplify electrical connections and control electronics, or connected separately should they need, for example, to be individually addressed to allow for programmed sequential desorption. Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate electrical connections and control electronics that may be used. In the nonlimiting example heater  shown in , bond pads  may be provided for electrically coupling a suitable electrical control system, such as control electronics (not shown), to the traces  for selectively actuating the heater. Further, the strip heaters  may be perforated with holes ranging from 10-1000 \u03bcm used to reduce pressure drop and improve collection efficiency for particles. In particular example embodiments, heater traces  may have their widths adjusted (and therefore thermal power density) as a function of position along the strip  in order to compensate for the temperature variations naturally accruing in a Joule heated bar. In other example embodiments, the heater trace  may take the form of a bar (as opposed to traces) with small perforations whose density or size varies along the bar length in order to compensate for the temperature variations naturally occurring in a Joule heated bar. The Joule heated conductor may have high thermal conductivity fingers used to carry thermal energy to the edges of the collector.","Referring again to , to stop collection during desorption and to control desorption flow, at least one, and preferably a plurality of, selectively movable dampers are provided within the housing  downstream of the collection plane (that is, downstream of where the collection flow  reaches the collection surfaces ). In an example embodiment, the dampers are provided by a plurality of adjustable louvers  disposed immediately downstream (or disposed closely downstream). The example adjustable louvers  are positioned within the housing  and configured so that they can selectively rotate about a center  between at least a first position, shown in , to provide respective gaps therebetween and thus allow fluid flow, and a second position, shown in , to overlap one another, providing a barrier to fluid flow or otherwise restricting fluid flow. In this way, the example louvers  can be used as a valve to selectively allow collection during a collection mode () or selectively stop collection during a desorption mode (). For selectively rotating the adjustable louvers , each of the adjustable louvers may be disposed about and supported by the center , which may be selectively pivotable. Alternatively or additionally, the louvers  themselves may be selectively movable to rotate the louvers about the center . Suitable devices or mechanisms for selectively rotating the louvers  will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art.","Thus, in an example operation, during collection mode as shown in , the heater  is either off or is sufficiently in a reduced state to allow collection for the collection surfaces . The collection surfaces  are positioned to face the direction of collection flow , and the louvers  are selectively positioned to allow fluid flow through the housing  for collection, so that analyte is collected on the sorbent layer  on the collection surfaces. Any suitable device for inducing flow may be used if desired to aid fluid flow through the housing .","After a suitable time period for collection (which can vary, as will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art), the preconcentrator  then enters desorption mode (). The heater  is activated on one or more of the collection surfaces  (and preferably on the opposed surfaces  as well) to desorb the analyte. As described above, the collection surfaces  are preferably positioned to face along the direction of desorption flow . The adjustable louvers  are rotated to substantially close fluid flow along the direction of the collection flow . During desorption flow , which may if desired be also induced by any suitable device, the desorbed analyte flows from the housing  to an outside device for collection.","As a nonlimiting example of an outside device, the preconcentrator  in  is shown leading into a second stage preconcentator . This second stage preconcentrator  may be, for example, a flow-through preconcentrator such as that disclosed in U.S. Published Patent Application 20050095722 (incorporated by reference herein), published May 5, 2005, and entitled \u201cMicro scale Flow Through Sorbent Plate Collection Device\u201d, and in U.S. Published Patent Application 20050226778, published Oct. 13, 2005, and entitled \u201cMicro scale Flow Through Sorbent Plate Collection Device\u201d.","In an example embodiment, a selectively operable valve  may be provided in an outside device or between the housing  and the outside device to control fluid flow. For example, during collection mode (), the valve  may be closed to prevent fluid flow to the outside device. During desorption mode (), the valve  may be opened as shown to allow fluid (and analyte) flow to the outside device.","Large volume preconcentrators according to embodiments of the present invention, such as the preconcentrator , provide various features and advantages. For example, the example heater  and variations thereof offer more flexibility in terms of controlling the temperature profile over the collection surfaces in comparison to those based on metal or carbon meshes. Also, by utilizing dampers such as the louvers  as valves, the device  is more easily extended to arbitrarily large cross sectional areas as opposed to other macro-scale preconcentrators that utilize expensive (and large) iris or gate valves. If the collection surfaces , and the heaters , are quite thin, the pressure drop will be lower than in designs that use metal or carbon mesh. The preferred embodiment housing  and variations thereof can be easily retrofitted over any of various outside devices. A nonlimiting example is a return air duct inlet.","It will be appreciated that the preconcentrator  shown in  and the heater  shown in  are merely examples, and that variations are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. For example, dampers, such as but not limited to louver valves, may be placed both upstream and downstream of the collection surfaces  in order to more carefully control desorption flow. The preconcentrator heaters  may be placed on adjustable (e.g., actuatable and\/or pivotable) louvers for better control of the desorption flow profile. As another example, two independent louver valves and preconcentrators may be used side by side so that, while one half of the device is desorbing, the other half may continue to collect analyte. This configuration also minimizes disruption to the flow balance of an outside system, such as an HVAC system. The preconcentator heaters , preferably composed of thin micromachined polymer strips, may be suspended on a frame instead of supported by a set of louvers. In addition to the heaters , active coolers (e.g., Peltier coolers) may be added to one or more of the collection surfaces  to aid in the collection mode.","In another example embodiment, the louvers  or other supports may include one or more narrow slots running therethrough, defining generally rectangular spaces between the narrow slots. These narrow slots can allow tuning of the size of the particles that are captured on the collection surface based on the linear velocity, while allowing fibers and other contaminants to pass through.","Among many other possible variations, the preconcentrator  may be used in conjunction with an ionic or ozone based particle precipitation technology to enhance particle collection efficiency and\/or analyte desorption from the source. The preconcentrator  may alternatively or additionally be used in conjunction with a laser desorption technique for release of analyte from targets.","While various embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, it should be understood that other modifications, substitutions, and alternatives are apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art. Such modifications, substitutions, and alternatives can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, which should be determined from the appended claims.","Various features of the invention are set forth in the appended claims."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 1B","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
