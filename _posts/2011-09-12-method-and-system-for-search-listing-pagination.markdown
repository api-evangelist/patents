title: Method and system for search listing pagination
abstract: A system and method for search list pagination include sorting a set of records in an order based on a dynamic element of each of the records, and displaying the set of records in two or more pages on an interface. If the dynamic elements of any of the records changes between the display of the first page of records and the receipt of a request to display a second page of records on the interface, the method updates the ordering of the records to account for the change in the dynamic element of each of the records, and displays the second page sorted in the order. In such a manner, a user of the system or method may view each of the records sorted in the order, based on the instantaneous contents of the records.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Frequently, when a user requests to view large numbers of records displayed in a user interface, such as in response to a search request, the records are sorted in an order based on one or more sorting criteria and displayed in pages. Each of the pages displayed on a user interface may typically contain up to a predetermined maximum number of records, and the user may navigate between pages by selecting or activating links, buttons or other means that may be known to those of skill in the art. The maximum number of records that may be displayed on each page, and the sorting criteria, may be automatically set by the interface, or optionally set by the user.","When all of the data stored in each of the records to be displayed is static, paginating records is a simple and straightforward task. Records containing immutable data may be sorted according to one or more sorting criteria, divided into pages, and displayed page-by-page to the user. For example, where a user requests to view a set containing 157 records sorted by at least one sorting criteria, and a user interface may display a maximum of 50 records, a user may view three respective pages displaying records 1-50, 51-100 and 101-150, and a fourth page displaying records 151-157. To navigate from page to page, a user may select buttons or links reading \u201cnext 50,\u201d or \u201cprevious 50,\u201d to view and review each of the records contained in the set.","However, when at least some of the data stored in each of the records is dynamic, and subject to change, list pagination presents a challenging problem in that one or more records may escape review as a user advances from page to page, depending on the sort criteria chosen by the user. For example, where a set containing 38 records is sorted based on the time and date on which each record was last updated in an original list, and where records 1-10 of that set are displayed at time t, a request to display records 11-20 of that set made at time twould skip a record if one of records 1-10 (e.g., record no. 7 of the original list) was updated between time tand time t. Once record no. 7 of the original list is updated, and the request to display records 11-20 is received, the list of records would be reordered such that record no. 7 of the original list would immediately fall to the end of the sorted list and replace record no. 38 as the final record in the new list, while records 8-38 of the original list would advance forward to replace records 7-37 in the new list. Therefore, when the user requests to view records 11-20, the records displayed would correspond to the twelfth through twenty-first (12-21) records of the original list, and record no. 11 of the original list, which advanced forward to become record no. 10 of the new list, would not be displayed to the user.","The present invention is intended to overcome the aforementioned disadvantages of the prior art by providing an effective alternative to existing systems and methods for pagination, including search listing pagination of dynamic records.","As is set forth in greater detail below, the present invention includes improved systems and methods for displaying paginated records in a sorted list. More particularly, the present invention is directed to systems and methods for search list pagination, and for displaying search results in paginated lists and ensuring that each of the results is displayed to a user.","According to one embodiment of the present invention, a record system provides a user interface that may display up to 25 records pertaining to a series of banking transactions in a paginated list. The records include the name of the payor or payee, the amount of the transaction and a memorandum line or other summary of the transaction. A user requests to view records pertaining to a set consisting of hundreds of transactions, sorted based on the date and time on which the records were most recently updated, with the record that was updated earliest listed first, and the later-updated records listed after sequentially after the earliest-updated record. Ten seconds after the user requests to view the records in the paginated list, one of the first 25 records that had been displayed to the user is updated. When the user then requests to review the next 25 records of the set, the system marks the last of the previously displayed records that has not been updated with a token, re-sorts the records, and displays the next 25 records in the set that were updated after the record that was marked with a token. In such a manner, the system ensures that the user is able to view all of the records in the set, instantaneously sorted based on the date and time on which the records were most recently updated.","According to another embodiment of the present invention, an auction web site permits customers to place bids on a variety of items posted at the site. The items may be viewed in an order based on any number of variables (e.g., cost, time remaining until each item's respective auction closes, or individual features of the respective items) which may be subject to change based on the addition or subtraction of items from the auction web site (e.g., when new items are made available, when old items are sold, or when an item's auction on the site expires). When a user visits the web site and enters a search request for the keywords \u201ccomputer printer,\u201d the web site displays the first 50 individual computer printers that are available for bidding in a first area of the computer display, sorted by the highest bid price received to date, and the 50th printer in the list has a highest bid price of $199. Shortly after the user entered the keywords \u201ccomputer printer,\u201d and viewed the first set of 50 printers, two of the printers listed in the first set were sold, and thus removed from the list. Additionally, the bid prices of three printers that were below $199 when the first set was displayed had since received bids that exceeded $199, and two additional printers having bid prices greater than $199 were newly made available at the web site after the first set was displayed. When the user requests to view the next 50 individual computer printers, sorted by highest bid price, the web site displays the 50 individual computer printers having highest bid prices of less than $199 in the first area of the computer display. The web site also displays the three printers which had bid prices below $199 when the first set was displayed, and the two additional printers which were added to the site and had bid prices greater than $199 after the user first made his request, in a second area of the computer display. Therefore, the systems and methods ensure that all of the computer printers available at the auction at the time the user requests to view the next 50 individual computer printers are ultimately displayed to the user in a paginated format, regardless of when the printers were added to the auction site, and regardless of any changes to the set of items corresponding to the keywords \u201ccomputer printer,\u201d based on the addition of items to the web site, or the removal of items from the web site.","Accordingly, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, a system may display a set containing a relatively large number of records listed in multiple pages on a user interface. The records may include one or more elements of dynamic data that are subject to change, and the records may be sorted based on at least one of these elements and displayed in multiple pages. Where one or more of the elements of dynamic data changes in such a manner that would require a reordering of the sorted records, the systems and methods of the present invention ensure that none of the records is overlooked or omitted as the user advances from page to page, in order to display additional records, and that each of the records is ultimately displayed to the user. For example, the systems and methods of the present invention may mark or tag the last displayed record on a page that has not changed, and display the records that follow the marked record sequentially in order beginning on the next page. The systems and methods of the present invention may also determine whether any additional records have been added to the system since the search was performed, and display any new records in such a manner that ensures that a user is always able to view an entire set of records in a sorted, paginated list format, and that no record is ever overlooked or omitted in a display to the user.","The systems, computers, servers, and the like described herein have the necessary electronics, software, memory, storage, data sources, firmware, logic\/state machines, microprocessors, communication links, displays or other visual or audio user interfaces, printing devices, and any other input\/output interfaces to perform the functions described herein and\/or achieve the results described herein.","In accordance with the systems and methods of the present invention, searches may be performed by any means known to those of skill in the art, such as the entry of one or more keywords or relevant numerical indicia into a text box or other interactive platform. The systems and methods described herein may be used to display records stored in one or more databases or like storage devices, and may include information presented in the form of tables, spreadsheets or other multidimensional formats. Furthermore, the systems and methods described herein may be used to present information in any form of interface, such as a user interface that enables the display of information to a user, or in an application programming interface that may enable one system or program to communicate with another system or program. As used herein, the term \u201cdynamic record\u201d refers to any item of information containing at least one element or aspect that may be subject to change, such as dates, times, prices or any other variable.","Users of the systems and methods of the present invention may operate any web-enabled or Internet applications, such as web browsers, interfaces or any other client-server applications or features including electronic mail or other messaging techniques to communicate with (or connect to) one or more system elements through the network. In addition, the computers and servers utilized in accordance with the present invention may include any of a number of computing devices that are capable of communicating over the network, including but not limited to set-top boxes, personal digital assistants, mobile phones including \u201csmart\u201d phones, digital media players, web pads, tablets, laptop computers, desktop computers, electronic book readers, and the like. The protocols and components for providing communication between such computers and servers are well known to those skilled in the art of computer communications and thus, need not be described in more detail herein.","The data and\/or computer executable instructions, programs, firmware, software and the like (also referred to herein as \u201ccomputer executable components\u201d) described herein may be stored on a computer-readable medium that is within or accessible by one or more computers or servers having sequences of instructions which, when executed by a processor (such as a central processing unit, or CPU), cause the processor to perform all or a portion of the functions and\/or methods described herein. Such computer executable instructions, programs, software and the like may be loaded into the memory of computers and servers using drive mechanisms associated with the computer readable medium, such as a floppy drive, CD-ROM drive, DVD-ROM drive, network interface, or the like, or via external connections.","Referring to , a flow chart  of a process for search list pagination performed by a system according to one embodiment of the present invention is shown. The process represented by flow chart  begins at step , where a user performs a search for all records in a database that have been updated within a predetermined period of time, i.e., within the last hour. At step , the list of records returned in the search may be sorted based on the time that each record was most recently updated, with the record having the oldest update time listed first, and the records having the next-oldest update times listed sequentially thereafter.","At step , it is determined whether the number of records that have yet to be displayed is greater than the maximum number of records N that may be displayed on the page. If the number of records remaining to be displayed is less than or equal to N, all of the records not previously displayed will be displayed on the page at step . If, however, the number of records remaining to be displayed is greater than N, the system will display the N records that have the earliest update times and have not yet been displayed since their last update at step .","At step , the system receives a request from the user to display additional records that have not previously been displayed since their last update. At step , the system determines whether any of the records that have been previously displayed have been updated. If none of the previously displayed records has been updated, the process returns to step . If any of the previously displayed records has been updated, then the updated records are returned to the list of remaining records at step . At step , the last displayed record that has not been updated is marked with a token, and the records that have not yet been displayed and have been updated after the record marked with a token are re-sorted according to their last update time at step . The process shown in flow chart  continues until all of the records have been displayed as sorted by the time at which each record was updated last.","For purposes of illustration, many of the systems and methods described herein are referenced primarily in the context of a system for displaying records containing dynamic data that are sorted based on the time at which each record was most recently updated. As will be recognized by those of skill in the art, however, the systems and methods disclosed herein may also be used in numerous other environments. Moreover, the searches or requests to display sets of data may be received or performed on a single piece of hardware, i.e., a computer containing at least one processor and at least one database, and displayed on that single piece of hardware, and need not be transmitted over a network or between multiple individual pieces of hardware or users.","As is set forth above, one embodiment of the systems and methods of the present invention, such as the process shown in flow chart  of , may be used to display records containing dynamic data to a user in a specific order such that each of the records are displayed to the user and none of the records is either missed, skipped or overlooked, even if the order is based on a particular dynamic variable or element of data, and the value of that variable or element changes with respect to one or more records. Referring to , a table  containing records  is shown. The records  in table  may be displayed, for example, in accordance with one embodiment of a method of the present invention, such as steps - of the process shown in flow chart  of .","The data stored in each of the records  is listed in columns containing the record number , the record name  and the time  at which the record was last updated. The records  are to be displayed on pages that may include a maximum of ten records at one time. As is shown in , a request  to display the first page  of records  was made at 7:15 a.m.","As is shown in , the records  are shown as sorted based on the time , beginning with the oldest updated record (no. 1, Augusta), which was last updated at 6:26 a.m. Because the table  contains more than ten records, the first ten records are displayed in a first page . Five minutes after the first request to display records is received, or at time 7:20 a.m., a request  to display a second page  of records is received, and it is determined that two of the records (no. 8, Los Angeles, and no. 5, Hartford) have been updated since the first page of records was displayed. These records are returned to the list, and the last record that was not updated (no. 10, Norfolk) is marked with a token . The remaining records that have not been displayed since their last update are then sorted based on the last time  that each record was updated.","As is shown in , the remaining six records that have not been displayed and have update times that are later than the update time of the record marked with a token  (no. 10, Norfolk) are shown on a second page . The records shown on the second page  are sorted by the time of their most recent update, and the two records (no. 8, Los Angeles, and no. 5, Hartford) that had been updated after the initial request to display records, and before the request to display additional records, are shown at the bottom of the page .","By marking the last displayed record with a token, and displaying the next set of records immediately after that token, one embodiment of the systems and methods of the present invention may ensure that each of the records is displayed to the user despite the dynamic nature of the variable by which the records are sorted (e.g., the time at which the records are last updated).","Some advantages of the systems and methods of the present invention are shown in , which include various displays of a set  containing thirty records in pages of not more than twenty-five records.  shows the set  displayed sorted in order. Upon a request by a user, the first twenty-five records (e.g., records 1-25) of the set  may be displayed in a first page . Where the records contain merely static data, or where the records contain one or more elements of dynamic data that have not changed, a request to display the next set of records (e.g., records 26-30) results in the display shown in , in which a second page  that begins with records ,  which follow the last record  shown in the first page  is shown.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 3C","FIG. 3D","FIG. 3C","FIG. 3D"],"b":["300","310","320","322","314","320","322","326","328","314","326","328"]},"One or more embodiments of the systems and methods of the present invention may address disadvantages of the prior art, as is shown in . According to the systems and methods of the present invention, when a user views the first page  of records shown in , and requests to view additional records in the set, the systems and methods of the present invention may mark the last displayed record that has not been updated, i.e., record , with a token, and then re-sort the records that have either been updated or not yet displayed, and display a next subset  of records beginning immediately after the record  marked with a token, i.e., beginning with records , . In such a manner, records ,  are displayed in their updated form, and records ,  are presented in sorted order as the first records of the second page  following the record  marked with a token, and are not overlooked.","The tokens of the present invention may be used to designate a certain record shown in a list as a baseline for the display of subsequent records in another list, and may be a unique identifier formed from one or more aspects of the data stored in a record that is used to establish a sequential ordering of multiple records. Referring to , a flow chart  of a process according to another embodiment of the present invention is shown. The process begins at step , where a request to display dynamic records according to a sort criteria is received by the system from a user. A \u201csort criteria\u201d may be any basis for sorting records containing data, such as alphabetically, logically, or ascending or descending values of one or more particular elements of data.","At step , a unique identifier is created for each dynamic record based on the sort criteria at time t. The unique identifier may be randomly selected, or may be formed from one element of data stored in the record, or by combining or concatenating two or more elements of the data. At step , it is determined whether the number of records that have yet to be displayed and have not yet been updated is greater than N, the maximum number of records that may be displayed on a page of an interface. If the number of records to be displayed is less than or equal to N, then the remaining dynamic records are displayed in a single page at step , sorted based on the unique identifiers in accordance with the sort criteria, and the process ends.","If the number of records remaining to be displayed is greater than N, then, at step , the next N dynamic records that have not yet been displayed since their last update are displayed, sorted by their respective unique identifiers. At step , the system receives another request from a user to display additional dynamic records according to the sort criteria. Therefore, at step , the system creates unique identifiers for each of the records based on the sort criteria at time t. At step , the system sets the unique identifier of the last dynamic that has been displayed as a token and, at step , determines the number of remaining dynamic records having unique identifiers that rank sequentially after the token before returning to step . The process shown in flow chart  continues until all of the records have been displayed as sorted based on the unique identifiers in accordance with the sort criteria.","The unique identifiers of the present invention may be formed from one variable, or from one or more variables combined or concatenated together. In such a manner, the unique identifiers may be a universal variable applied to each of the records and used to sort each of the records in a set. Referring to , a table  of records containing dynamic data is shown. The table  includes a plurality of orders for materials to be installed on a construction project. The orders in the table  are listed in columns, including the order number , the order description  (e.g., type of materials), the quantity , the order price , the date  and time  that the orders were entered or revised, and the unique identifier  for each order.","The unique identifiers  shown in  are formed by concatenating the date  when the order was entered or revised, the time  when the order was entered or revised, and the order number . As is shown in , the unique identifiers  have the format YYYYMMDDHHMMXXX, where YYYYMMDD is the date  of the order (i.e., the four digits of the year, the two digits of the month and the two digits of the day when the order was entered or revised), HHMM is the time  of the order (i.e., the hour and minute when the order was entered or revised) and XXX is the order number . Therefore, each of the orders listed in table  has a distinct unique identifier , even if the orders were entered at the exact same time. For example, order no. 004 (Treated Lumber) and order no. 009 (Curtain Wall) were entered at 2:15 p.m. on Mar. 7, 2011. Therefore, the order for treated lumber has a unique identifier of 201103071415004 and the order for a curtain wall has a unique identifier of 201103071415009.","In such a manner, the records shown in table  may be sorted based on the unique identifiers  in the format YYYYMMDDHHMMXXX, because each of the records has a distinct unique identifier. By forming a unique identifier based on the time when the record was last updated and the record number, the records shown in table  may be sorted based on both the time of the last update and the order number.","The records shown in the table  of  may be displayed in accordance with one embodiment of a method of the present invention, such as the process represented by the flow chart  shown in . If a first page containing the first thirteen records shown in  is displayed as sorted by the unique identifiers  at time t, and a request to display additional records is received at time t, then the unique identifiers will be calculated again, and the unique identifier  corresponding to order no. 034 (Linoleum Flooring), the thirteenth record shown in , will be marked with a token. Next, if record nos. 012 (Telecommunications Cables), 032 (HVAC Unit) and 042 (Railing, Indoor Stairs) shown in  were updated between time tand time t, then the unique identifiers , ,  of those records will be updated.","Referring to , the records in the table  are sorted according to the updated unique identifiers . In particular, because record nos. 012, 032 and 042 were updated, the respective unique identifiers , ,  have been updated accordingly. A second page of additional records may be shown beginning with unique identifiers that are later than the unique identifier  of the first page that was marked with a token, as is shown in , and the record nos. 012, 032, 042 that have been updated most recently are the last three records shown in the second page.","In addition to the displays of records shown in , A-E, A and B, which demonstrate displaying updated records that are sorted based on the ascending values of a variable, e.g., the time at which a record was last updated or a unique identifier of the record, the systems and methods of the present invention may be used to display records sorted based on non-ascending (or descending) values of variables, or records appear or are updated in such a manner that they would have appeared on a previous page. For example, where a series of records are displayed in a sorted order in a first portion of a screen, new or updated records that would have been listed higher in the sorted order could be displayed in a second portion of the screen, such that a user viewing records in the sorted order may be made aware of updated records that would be displayed in accordance with the sort criteria, and also of new and updated records that would have been displayed on pages that were previously viewed by the user.","Referring to , a flow chart  of a process according to another embodiment of the present invention is shown. The process begins at step , where a request to display dynamic records and variables according to sort criteria is received by the system from a user. At step , it is determined whether the number of records that have yet to be displayed and have not yet been updated is greater than N, the maximum number of records that may be displayed on a page of an interface. If the number of records to be displayed is less than or equal to N, then the remaining dynamic records and variables are displayed in a single page at step , in accordance with the sort criteria, and the process ends.","If the number of records remaining to be displayed is greater than N, then, at step , the next N dynamic records and variables that have not yet been displayed are displayed in a first portion of a screen, sorted in accordance with the sort criteria. At step , a request to display additional dynamic records and variables that have not yet been displayed is received from a user. At step , the last displayed record is marked with a token. At step , it is determined whether any dynamic records have been added to the set, and at step , it is determined if any dynamic records have not yet been displayed. If all of the dynamic records have been displayed, then the process ends.","If there are any dynamic records that have not yet been displayed, then at step , the process displays dynamic records having variables greater than the variable of the dynamic record marked with a token, and returns to step . The process shown in flow chart  continues until all of the records have been displayed as sorted by the time at which each record was updated last.","Accordingly, an embodiment of a method of the present invention, such as the process shown in flow chart  of , may be used to not only re-order and display updated records in accordance with a sort criteria but also display new or updated records even if such records would not have ordinarily been displayed in accordance with the sort criteria.","Referring to , a table  of records and a display  of items in a first portion of a screen corresponding to the records is shown. The table  contains twelve records pertaining to used sport\/utility vehicles (SUVs) for sale, and the first five records - in the table , represented in page , correspond to the items - shown in the display . The table  includes columns according to the make, model, year, miles, price and entry time and date of each of the SUVs, and both the records in the table  and the items in the display  are sorted in a descending order, based on the prices of the SUVs.","Between the time when a user requests the display of the records - in the table , and the time when a user requests the display of items corresponding to the next five records in the table , a new record corresponding to another used SUV is added to the table. Referring to , the table  of records and the display  of items in the first portion of the screen corresponding to the records is shown. The table  contains thirteen records pertaining to used SUVs, including the twelve records shown in  and an additional record , which was newly added to the table . The records - shown in page  of table  of  also correspond to the items - shown in the display , upon the request of a user. Record , which would have been shown in the display  shown in  based on its price had it been entered into the table  at the time of the user's request, is shown in the display  of items in a second portion of the screen as item .","Therefore, the user who requested to view the records shown in , sorted by price, is not only able to view the remaining records in the table  in descending order but also able to view any additional records which were added to the table  after the initial request to view records was received. Accordingly, the systems and methods of the present invention provide a more versatile and complete account of the records contained in table  to a user, sorted according to his or her preferences, and makes the user aware of changes to the records that would not have been otherwise displayed to the user.","Although the foregoing examples are described in the context of sorting records in an ascending order, and by modifying the listing of records sorted in an ascending order by placing updated records at the end of the descending order, the systems and methods of the present invention may be modified to provide for the display of records ordered on any basis, i.e., ascending order, descending order, alphabetical order, logical order, or any other order. Moreover, although many of the foregoing examples are described in the context of sorting records based on a time at which each record was updated, the present invention is not so limited. Rather, the systems and methods of the present invention may be used to sort and display records based on any other variable, including times, dates, dimensions, prices or any other value that may be ordered.","Furthermore, although the disclosure has been described herein using exemplary techniques, algorithms, and\/or processes, it should be understood by those skilled in the art that other techniques, algorithms and processes, or other combinations and sequences of the techniques, algorithms and processes described herein, may be used or performed in order to achieve the same function(s) and\/or result(s) described herein, and are included within the scope of the present disclosure.","Any process descriptions, steps, or blocks in flow diagrams should be understood as potentially representing modules, segments, or portions of code which include one or more executable instructions for implementing specific logical functions or steps in a process, and alternate implementations are included within the scope of the preferred embodiments of the systems and methods for paginating records, such as search lists, may be deleted or executed out of order from that shown or discussed, including substantially concurrently or in reverse order, depending on the functionality involved, as would be understood by those reasonably skilled in the art.","It should be understood that, unless otherwise explicitly or implicitly indicated herein, any of the features, characteristics, alternatives or modifications described regarding a particular embodiment herein may also be applied, used, or incorporated with any other embodiment described herein.
