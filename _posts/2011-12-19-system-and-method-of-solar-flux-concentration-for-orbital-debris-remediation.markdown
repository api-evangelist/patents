title: System and method of solar flux concentration for orbital debris remediation
abstract: A system for concentrating solar radiation onto a space debris object to vaporize includes a focusing system, an object tracking system and a positioning system. The focusing system has a total focal length f, and includes a first focusing device and a second focusing device. The first focusing devices change from a compact state to a deployed state, and the compact surface area is less than the deployed surface area. The object tracking system determines the location of the object. The positioning system orients the focusing system such that solar radiation focuses on the space debris object.

The government has certain rights in the invention.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to solar technologies, and more particularly to solar concentrators.","2. Description of the Related Art","Space debris includes man-made non-functional objects that are either in Earth orbit or re-entering the atmosphere. Some examples of space debris include non-functional satellites and fragments from space vehicle explosions or collisions. Space debris is a hazard to future space vehicles because of the risk of collision.","Space debris can be separated into three categories by size: Category 1 (<1 cm); Category 2 (1-10 cm); Category 3 (>10 cm). In particular, there are about 100,000 to 10,000,000 pieces of Category 2 space debris within 1600 km of the Earth's surface. Thus, it is important to remediate the large population of Category 2 space debris to reduce the chance of collision.","High power lasers that either deployed on the ground or from space have been proposed as solutions to remediate Category 2 space debris objects. Earth-based lasers suffer huge propagation losses from atmospheric attenuation and turbulence, cloud obscuration, and pointing errors over the longer distances required to intercept debris. To compensate for the huge propagation losses, prohibitively high transmitter flux is required, making power requirements for ground lasers excessive and costly. The relatively low wall-plug efficiency of current laser technology makes space deployment very costly and virtually impractical relative to the launch costs, which place a severe limit on the size, weight and power (SWaP) of effective laser platforms.","Solar flux concentration has been proposed as a way to remediate Category 2 space debris. Solar flux concentration utilizes focused solar radiation to vaporize the space debris. In order to use solar flux concentration, a large area focusing system for concentrating sufficient solar radiation must be carried into space. Ordinarily, a typical focusing system has a lot of large and heavy optical components needed to enable high quality imaging, but solar flux concentration has less demanding requirements on surface curvature, especially using different technology (such as diffractive membrane optics), and the mass and bulk of conventional optical components make it impractical for spacecraft deployment of such large apertures.","What is needed for effective space debris remediation is a solar flux concentration system that that has a compact volume for easy transportation to space, yet provides a large surface area after deployment that is easily managed and directed.","The present invention provides an effective system implementation that has a compact volume for easy transportation to space, yet provides a large surface area after deployment, and requires a less demanding pointing and control system than its equivalent on the ground.","A system is provided for concentrating solar radiation onto an object at an arbitrary orbital location. The said system includes a focusing system, a target debris object tracking system, and a beam pointing and lens positioning system. The focusing system has a total focal length f, and includes two focusing elements, each of which can change from a pre-deployed (stowed) compact state, within a very small volume, to a deployed state of very large area in the same manner for each. The first focusing element has a positive focal length, fwhen fully deployed and the second focusing element has a negative focal length, f(equal but opposite in polarity to f) when fully deployed. Both elements share a common principal optical axis when deployed. Conventional Fresnel (amplitude or phase) elements are separated by a distance d when fully deployed where d is adjusted by linear actuators by the positioning system to vary the focal distance. This effective focal distance is:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mi":"f","mo":"=","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"msub":[{"mi":"f","mn":"1"},{"mi":"f","mn":"2"}],"mo":"\u2062"},{"msub":[{"mi":"f","mn":"1"},{"mi":"f","mn":"2"}],"mo":["+","-"],"mi":"d"}]}}}},"br":{},"sub":["1","2"],"sup":["3 ","3 ","3 ","4 ","3 "]},"The object tracking system can determine the location of the object using conventional imagers for angular position tracking and laser (or microwave) radar for range tracking. The positioning system is adjusted based-on inputs from the tracking system and sun sensors. The targeted debris object must be monitored to derive focal spot size, brightness and temperature to optimize the transfer of solar energy to the debris object and monitor the disintegration process.","Additional advantages and novel features of the invention are set forth in part in the description which follows, and in part will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon examination of the following or may be learned by practice of the invention. The advantages of the invention may be realized and attained by means of the instrumentalities and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims.","In accordance with one or more embodiments of the present invention, a system is provided for concentrating solar radiation onto an object at a location. For example, a space debris object is detected by the system. The system then acquires and tracks the targeted debris object and transmits concentrated solar radiation onto the space debris object to vaporize the space debris object.","The system includes a deployment mechanism, a focusing system, an object tracking system, a beam pointing, and a lens positioning control system. For example, the focusing system may be any deployable system that can focus solar radiation. Non-limiting examples of focusing systems include deployable Fresnel membrane lenses, deployable binary diffraction membrane gratings, deployable membrane pinhole arrays, and deployable membrane photon sieves.","The object tracking system may be any tracking system that can detect and track an object of interest. Non-limiting examples of object tracking systems include laser imaging tracking systems, optical tracking systems, and radar tracking systems. One example of an object tracking system consists of three subsystems: 1. An inertial reference assembly, which measures platform inertial attitude updated with periodic star tracker reference inputs, 2. A sun sensor that determines the direction of the sun with respect to the platform, and 3. An imaging tracker that can determine either the debris object location based on solar illumination or the same object given reflected laser illumination from a laser radar on-board the platform. Together these feed absolute angle location of the debris object to the platform attitude control system so that attitude control actuators (e.g., momentum wheels, cold gas thrusters, etc.) can slew the lens assembly platform with the object as it moves by the platform in a lower orbit. The other essential system required to successfully engage the target debris object is the focus control system which takes input from three subsystems: 1. A laser radar (or equivalent microwave radar) that measures the range to the debris object to establish the required focal distance, 2. An in situ wavefront sampler that measures the tip, tilt, curvature and relative alignment between the two lens elements comprising the solar flux focusing control system, and 3. In situ temperature sensors that determine the degree of solar loading on the lens membranes and structural elements to compensate for any asymmetric loading that could shift or defocus the focal spot at the debris object. The laser radar can also assist the platform\/lens attitude control system by providing an alternate angle measurement of the debris object if the solar flux is too dim or bright to easily track in the panchromatic visible band. Finally, a remote temperature sensing capability is provided as an input to the target debris object monitoring system to help determine the effect on the object of the solar flux. Thus, images from the imaging tracker and remote temperature estimates of the focused spot help determine the spot size, intensity and temperature to determine the state of the debris object and any disintegration processes that it may be undergoing. It can also help determine the required adjustments to maintain the concentrated solar flux spot on the target debris object with sufficient duration to entirely disintegrate it.","The positioning system may be any positioning system that can controllably move a focusing system. Non-limiting examples of positioning systems include momentum wheels, cold gas jets, magnetic torquers, and electrodynamic positioning systems.","The focusing system has a total focal length f, and includes a first focusing device and a second focusing device. The first focusing device and second focusing device each may be any focusing devices that transmit concentrated solar radiation onto a location, but in combination are adjustable to focus the solar flux adaptively as range changes between the system and the target debris object. Non-limiting examples of focusing devices include Fresnel lenses, pinhole arrays, and photon sieves. Alternative means of adapting the focus is to adjust the distance between the positive and negative Fresnel (amplitude or phase patterned) lenses, or to adjust relative orientations of two phase-only Fresnel lenses with the appropriate phase pattern.","Both focusing elements can change from a compact state to a deployed state. Prior to deployment they have a very compact volume, and a first surface area, wherein the compact volume sufficient to be stowed within conventionally-sized launch vehicle volumes and have a very large deployed surface area when in deployed to maximize the captured solar flux. The compact surface area is less than the deployed surface area.","The first focusing element has a focal length fin the deployed state. The second focusing element has a focal length fin the deployed state. For effective total focal point (f) control only two types of elements are required: one with a positive and one with a negative focal length of equal and opposite value, in either order with respect to the source or target object.","When deployed, the focusing elements share an optical axis. The first focusing element is separated from the second focusing element by a distance d. The object tracking system can determine the location of the object and via the platform attitude control system orient the system to point at the target debris object and maximize the solar flux delivered to the debris object. The lens element positioning system adjusts the spacing of the elements to focus the solar flux at the correct debris object range.","Example embodiments in accordance with aspects of the present invention will now be described with reference to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIGS. 1A-1C","b":"100","sub":["0","1 ","2"]},"As shown in , solar flux concentration system  includes an object tracking system , a lens positioning system to focus the solar flux  and a focusing system .

Non-limiting examples of communication links include radio frequency links, optical links, wired links and wired links.","Focusing system  transmits focused solar radiation onto a targeted space debris object at focal point  for vaporization. Focusing system  should vaporize a targeted space debris object within a limited exposure time.","As solar radiation has a large range of wavelengths, a general focal length desired to be focused depends on the design spectrum chosen.","As illustrated in , focusing system  is shown to be focusing solar radiation at focal point . As one skilled in the art can appreciate, there are many possible focal points associated with the different wavelengths of solar radiation. Thus, depending on the design parameter of solar flux concentration system , one skilled in the art will be able to recognize\/calculate the focal point for a predetermined wavelength of light. Clearly, any material may be used depending on the design parameter chosen.","Also illustrated in , a single focal point, focal point , is shown for purpose of brevity.

For example, focusing system  may have an optical structure that is at least 100 meters in diameter.","For such a large aperture diameter, conventional focusing systems would have been impractical to deploy. Glass lenses have an areal density of over 100 kg\/m, making the payload extremely heavy. Furthermore, conventional focusing systems would have difficulty fitting into any known spacecraft and would risk damage from shocks during launching.","Unlike conventional focusing systems, focusing system  utilizes collapsible membrane optics so that it has a compact payload size when not deployed and be light-weight.

Focus control portion  receives measurements of range from laser radar portion , which permits commands to be executed to change the relative spacing of the two lens elements to maintain a minimal focal spot on the debris object via lens assembly linear and angular actuators portion  (either linear, angular or both, depending on the type of membrane lens amplitude and phase modulation profile).","To refine the focus of the system, additional measurements are made and input into focus control portion . These include a sampling of both lens membranes as several strategic points using Shack-Hartmann type wavefront samplers in wavefront sampler  embedded in each membrane and illuminated with either surface emitting light emitting diodes (LEDs) or laser diodes as well as monitoring such reflected beams from specific points on each membrane and measuring the degree of deflection using in situ CMOS sensors. In addition, local in situ temperatures are monitored via in situ temperature sensor portion  on the membrane and structural elements (along radial longeron spars and around peripheral boundaries) to determine the degree of solar loading and how asymmetric it is in order to compensate via guy-wire bias on the longeron radial spars for each octal segment of a given lens element. Finally, sensing of the debris object's temperature via remote temperature sensing portion , can be accomplished by either infrared imaging or remote pyrometery. Thus, attitude and focus commands as well as estimated debris temperatures are input into a final state estimate of the location, spot size, and duration of the solar flux at the debris object in order to assist compensation and determine the limit for maintaining track and the disintegration process. The extent of the disintegration process is also monitored by imagery from the imaging tracker.","Additional controls enable measurement and actuation of the lens elements in terms of their relative spacing (d), and relative rotation angle ( ) about their shared optical axis. Bidirectional linear actuators comprised of flexible high-tensile strength wires can be used to control large changes in relative separation. Rotary actuators at the base of each central spar control their relative rotation angle. This latter function is useful for large angular shifts for modulating the focal distance when the lens elements look like those shown in the figure, which are phase-only elements. Small angular shifts are useful when using two Fresnel lens elements (amplitude or phase-only) comprised of arrays to enable very small angular deviations for beam control. A small amount of curvature control can be accomplished by applying an electrostatic field between each octal segment of each corresponding lens element using transparent conductive coatings on each of their segments, for instance indium tin oxide (ITO). This permits another degree of freedom in fine tuning the spot location and size.","In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, membrane surfaces intended as light collectors or focusing elements may be replicated into an array of sub-elements. Such sub-elements may perform similar to a much larger the large Fresnel zone provided they maintain alignment, channelize, and focus light as the distance is varied between two such arrays. Flexible membranes can also support thin film electronics such as optical tracking circuits, solar cell arrays, and focal planes. Accordingly, flexible membranes may be embedded into the appropriate surfaces to support these functions. Further, the relative surface distortions of each membrane may be monitored to support their compensation using so-called Shack-Hartmann devices.","Solar flux concentration system  ensures that focusing system  is lightweight and has a small payload size prior to deployment by virtue of collapsible membrane optics. The integrated solar cells on the membrane optics or inflatable structures provides practically unlimited power for Solar flux concentration system , thus eliminating the need to carry additional power source to further reduce payload mass.
