The disclosures of all six of the aforementioned applications are hereby incorporated herein by reference.","The present invention relates to systems and methods for structured generation and distribution of news releases, including over networks and particularly the Internet.","The prior art is familiar with applications available over the World Wide Web for providing an individual with news stories that have been automatically selected according to pre-specified criteria. On the other hand, the preparation of news stories and, more particularly, of news releases, is generally an operation that involves human effort of a kind that has not significantly changed in decades. While there are aids, such as word processing programs, that can be invoked to speed the motion of words selected by the writer onto a text-storing medium such as paper, the actual selection of the words in a news release usually involves the same exercise of creative effort and editorial judgment that has been required since the format of a news release was first developed. Indeed, part of the difficulty in writing a news release involves developing a suitable approach to whatever happens to be the subject of the release. In this sense, a typical prior art news release is friendly neither to the creator, owing to the work involved in creating the news release, nor to the reader, owing to the effort involved in gleaning information from it.","It is not surprising, therefore, that the writing of news releases is usually left to specialists in marketing and public relations departments of businesses or to independent public relations consultants.","In a first embodiment of the present invention, a method of providing a news release to a user comprises:\n\n","In further related embodiments, a method further comprises permitting selection and retrieval of the data provided to the user, according to user-specified search criteria, so that the user may select among a plurality of news release experiences. The news release experiences may include exposure to promotional information. Providing the experience of a news release may include providing content that has been selected, for at least one of the plurality of sections of the news release, from among a plurality of different possible choices of content for the at least one section of the news release, the selection based upon characteristics of a target audience of the news release. The news release experience may include exposure to an advertisement relating to an information category identified based upon the user's previous response, over the network, to at least one other advertisement.","In another embodiment according to the invention there is provided a method of facilitating a transaction conducted, at least in part, electronically over a network, wherein the transaction takes place in a plurality of stages among a plurality of parties, at least one of the parties being a user. The method includes: providing to at least one party, in at least one stage of the transaction, an experience of a news release in accordance with the method of the first embodiment above, the news release selected based upon the subject matter of the transaction. At least one of the parties may be a merchant.","In a further embodiment according to the invention, a method of providing promotional information to a user over a network comprises:","providing to the user over the network an experience of a news release in accordance with the method of the first embodiment described above,","the news release experience including exposure to promotional information and provided to the user only upon a determination that a selected marketing tier for the promotional information is of equal or higher hierarchical marketing tier level than a predetermined level,","the marketing tier for the promotional information selected from among a plurality of marketing tiers each characterized by a different hierarchical level of customization to user preferences. The promotional information may include a promotional e-mail.","In another embodiment according to the invention, a method of conducting market research comprises forming a profile of a user's product or service preferences based upon the user's choices of products from among a plurality of product or service options provided to the user as news release experiences in accordance with the method of the first embodiment described above.","Further related embodiments include systems for implementing the above-described methods.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 1A","FIG. 27"],"b":["11","12","13"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 1B","b":["14","15"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 2A","FIG. 3A","FIG. 1"],"b":["31","32","34","34","33","32","34","31","21","11","31","32","34","22","34","33","23"]},"In a further embodiment, there may be included further activities associated with distribution of the news release. In particular, in box , there are automatically identified classes of recipients of the news release based on content of at least one of the sections in the news release. In one embodiment, information in the section KEY WORDS\/TOPICS is used to identify the classes. Alternatively, for example, it is known in the art of intelligent content management to identify key words in text and to use these key words to characterize the content of the text. See for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,799,304 (Miller, \u201cInformation evaluation\u201d); U.S. Pat. No. 5,649,186 (Ferguson, \u201cSystem and method for a computer-based dynamic information clipping service\u201d); U.S. Pat. No. 5,537,586 (Amram et al., \u201cEnhanced apparatus and methods for retrieving and selecting profiled textural information records form a database of defined category structures\u201d); U.S. Pat. No. 5,418,951 (Damashek, \u201cMethod of retrieving documents that concern the same topic\u201d); and U.S. Pat. No. 5,384,703 (Withgott et al., \u201cMethod and apparatus for summarizing documents according to theme\u201d), which are hereby incorporated herein by reference. Such a characterization may be used to determine classes of recipients of the news release. In particular, it is within the scope of the present invention to utilize a list of recipients, wherein each recipient is placed in one or more classes according to the interests or other characteristics of the recipient. One major group of recipients in many applications for embodiments described herein is reporters. Reporters may be placed in classes according to the types of topics they cover, for example fashion, new technology, business leaders, and so forth. However, other groups are also possible recipients and may also be placed in classes according to interests or other characteristics. For example, business managers may be targeted for news releases depending on the nature of the businesses they manage. Consumers, too, may be interested in receiving information concerning specific kinds of new products. All of these groups may be treated as recipients and placed into appropriate classes. Accordingly, in step , there are automatically identified classes of recipients of the news release based on content of at least one of the sections of the news release. Thereafter, in box , there occurs the activity of distributing the news release to recipients of each identified class. In further embodiments, distribution of the news release is performed automatically and includes sending the news release as e-mail over the Internet. The e-mail may optionally include an attachment supplying additional information. Further information concerning the Internet and E-Mail is provided in the above referenced patents and, for example, in Gralla, (Ziff-Davis Press, 1996), which is hereby incorporated herein by reference; see especially pages 44-49.","In a further embodiment, feedback provided by a recipient of the news release is provided to the news release's promoter as shown in box  of . The feedback may include a variety of recipient responses to the news release; for example, questions, comments, reviews, or return opinions about the news release or collateral matters; or about the underlying products or services discussed in the news release; or about information contained in sources cited in the news release, including that contained in websites accessible by cited hyperlinks; or about samples of the underlying products or services. In one preferred embodiment, the feedback includes information as to which news release it responds to (since it may be only one of many news releases distributed), or includes information as to which promoter it responds to (since it may be one of many promoters on whose behalf news releases are distributed). It may also include information enabling further communication with the recipient who is the source of the feedback.","In a particular embodiment, server  of  receives the feedback as email transmitted over network  from a recipient's remote computer . The server then provides the feedback as e-mail to the promoter's remote computer , over network . In an alternative embodiment, a recipient provides feedback directly to a promoter, for example as e-mail from computer  to computer . In an additional alternative embodiment, feedback is not provided directly to a promoter, but instead is provided to an intermediary agent of the promoter\u2014for example, an advertising agency.","In another embodiment, summarized in the block diagram of , identification of recipients of the news release is facilitated through the use of preference analysis techniques, such as collaborative filtering. In this embodiment, the initial steps of the embodiment of  are followed (steps -). As in step  of , classes of recipients (or individual recipients) are initially identified based on the content of the news release, for example by key word techniques (step  of ). Next, however, in step  of the embodiment of , a ratings questionnaire or other preference questionnaire is distributed to each recipient, preferably accompanying the news release. The preference questionnaire elicits the recipient's degree of preference for the news release; for example, it may seek a recipient's rating of the news release on a numerical scale of 1 to 10. Each recipient's response to the preference questionnaire is then received along with other feedback on the news release, in step . The preference questionnaire may be implemented, in one embodiment, as an e-mail message, e-mail attachment, and\/or HTML link that accompanies an e-mail news release. In this embodiment, the preference feedback can then be received by a computer, such as server  of , as an emailed (or otherwise digitally transmitted) reply to the preference questionnaire.","Once the preference feedback has been received, the embodiment of  next (in step ) comprises the step of analyzing the recipients' preference feedback using preference analysis techniques, such as collaborative filtering. Collaborative filtering techniques are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,064,980 of Jacobi et al, and U.S. Pat. No. 6,041,311 of Chislenko et al., the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference. In one embodiment, a preference vector is maintained for each news release recipient, containing as elements the recipient's numerical rating of each news release. For each given news release recipient who has already rated news releases, a host system, such as server  of , identifies groups of recipients who have the highest correlation of preference vectors with that of the given recipient, and who thus have similar tastes in news releases. This may be performed, for example, by evaluating the dot product of preference vectors of recipients and selecting a group of recipients having the highest results. Then, for each news release that the given recipient has not yet received, the system determines how highly it was rated by the selected group of recipients. Those releases that received high ratings by the selected group (for example, releases that received above a specified average numerical rating, or that received ratings which are relatively high when compared with those of other news releases that the given recipient has not yet received) are then distributed to the given recipient (step ). Thus news releases may also be distributed to recipients in a way that accords with the preferences of other recipients having similar tastes. In this way, the likelihood that recipients enjoy the distributed news releases is increased. (It should be noted that embodiments of the invention are not limited to performing collaborative filtering in the particular fashion just described, but may also perform other methods of collaborative filtering, or other forms of preference analysis.)","Finally, in the embodiment of , further preference feedback may be gained on distributed news releases, as shown by arrow  (back to step ). Steps - are thus repeated, refining data on recipients' preferences for news releases, and thereby refining news release targeting.","In further embodiments according to the invention, news releases generated in a manner similar to those described herein may be distributed by a wide variety of distribution mechanisms. Referring to , such embodiments according to the invention begin in step  with the structured generation of a news release in a fashion similar to those described in, for example, , A, B, or A-C. Once the content for the news release is specified, stored, and retrieved into a desired format, the next step of the embodiment of  is to distribute the news release to recipients by one or more of a variety of distribution mechanisms (step ).","For instance, the news release may be distributed in video form  or audio form . In these cases, the method of news release generation may itself involve the capture of video or audio data for one or more of the sections of the news release, in which case the video or audio data is then distributed as part of the assembled news release. Alternatively, data in video or audio form may be automatically generated based on a user's news release content, at the user's option, and subsequently distributed. In one embodiment, a user specifying news release content over the Internet may provide an instruction via a web page selection to convert the user's specified news release text to an audio voice signal, for subsequent distribution. Whether generated from text or audio\/video input, the news release (or one or more sections thereof) may then be delivered to recipients in audio and\/or video form. The news release may be delivered by e-mail, in a form that is readable by an audio or video player on a personal computer; but the delivery may also be to a variety of receiving devices. For example, the message may be delivered in audio or video format to a personal computer, Internet appliance, or wireless device.","News releases, whether distributed in text, audio, or video form, may also be distributed to or from wireless devices  in accordance with embodiments of the invention. Thus, for example, news release content, whether received from a wireless device or by other electronic means, may be retrieved into a desired format and distributed to wireless receiving devices.","News releases may also be distributed by virtual delivery mechanisms  in accordance with the embodiment of . Thus, data corresponding to a news release (whether in text, audio, video, or other format) may be embedded in, or attached to, a virtual delivery mechanism for distribution to recipients. Such a mechanism is \u201cvirtual\u201d in that it is created in, and accessible by, software; but it effectively functions like a delivery mechanism. As a particular example, a news release may be embedded in a virtual envelope (or \u201csmart envelope\u201d) for distribution to recipients. These envelopes may then be easily forwarded by users, potentially leading to the development of virtual networks based on users' affinities and shared tastes. At the time of filing, such \u201csmart envelopes\u201d are marketed as Gizmoz\u2122 on the World Wide Web at http:\/\/www.gimoz.com. Gizmoz\u2122 function like a mobile envelope that adjusts to any platform, and allow widespread replication to users in a (non-harmful) \u201cviral\u201d fashion. Embodiments according to the invention are not limited to this distribution mechanism, however, and may also be used with other virtual distribution mechanisms.","In accordance with the embodiment of , news releases may also be transmitted by other media , which may be any one of a wide variety of electronic media. Additionally, the attachments to news releases may contain content from a variety of media, including, for example, audio media, video media, virtual delivery mechanisms (such as Gizmoz\u2122 \u201csmart envelopes\u201d), or Java applets, in a fashion similar to those described above for the news releases themselves. The news releases may also be equipped with features that facilitate forwarding to other recipients. For example, a news release may contain a software \u201cbutton\u201d enabling a recipient to select the message for forwarding to another recipient by e-mail or by message delivery to a wireless device.","News releases may also be distributed, in accordance with the embodiment of , at a higher level of aggregation than that of the individual news release. Thus, a user may receive a \u201cmeta-news release\u201d that gives only the headlines (or other simple identifier), and possibly the \u201cIn Brief\u201d sections, from each of a collection of different individual news releases. These releases are preferably organized by subject matter. For example, a user may receive a meta-news release on \u201cThis Week in Neurobiology,\u201d containing a collection of news release headlines related to neurobiology. Such headlines in a meta-news release preferably enable the reader of the meta-news release to access the corresponding individual releases. For example, each headline may have an HTML link to its associated individual news release.","It should also be noted that, while several references have been made herein to use of the HTML language to implement specific features of embodiments of the invention, embodiments according to the invention are not limited to using HTML, but may instead use any language providing the desired functionality, as will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art in conjunction with the specification herein.","In accordance with a further embodiment of the invention, a user is provided with an electronic advertisement, in the format of a news release generated in a manner similar to those described herein. Such an electronic advertisement may be provided over a network, for example as an HTML page over the Internet, or in any other suitable language or network.","In one such embodiment, an electronic advertisement, formatted as a news release in accordance with embodiments described herein, is provided to a user upon a determination that the user is interested in purchasing a given category of products or services. For example, in one embodiment, a user indicates an intention of purchasing a product or service from a given category, by communicating over an electronic network. The embodiment detects the user's intention, identifies the category of the product or service, and provides the user, over the network, with a news release formatted in accordance with an embodiment of the invention, relating to the same category of products or services. A user's intention to purchase a product or service may be identified, for example, using an Expression of Purchase Intent (EPI) engine, such as one used, at the time of filing, at http:\/\/www.gator.com, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.","In another, similar embodiment according to the invention, a user's interest in a given category of products or services is determined based upon the subject matter of an electronic search that the user conducts. Once the category of the user's search is identified, a news release in accordance with an embodiment of the invention, relating to the identified category, is provided to the user electronically over the network. An example of a website that identifes a user's interest based on a search category is found, at the time of filing, at http:\/\/www.go.com, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.","In another embodiment according to the invention, an electronic advertisement in the format of a news release generated in a manner similar to those described herein is provided as a follow-up advertisement to a \u201cteaser\u201d electronic advertisement. For example, such a follow-up advertisement may be provided to a user after the user clicks on a banner advertisement on the Internet.","In a further related embodiment, such a follow-up advertisement may be provided to a user after the user accesses a customized advertisement. The follow-up advertisement may, for example, be provided after the user accesses a customized advertisement delivered over a network, such as the Internet or a wireless network; or after the user accesses a customized advertisement delivered over a broadcast system, such as a Digital Video Recorder (DVR) system, Interactive Television (ITV) system, or a Video-on-Demand system. At the time of filing, several companies provide such broadcast systems, which provide interactivity, preference engines, and interactive commercials; example systems include TiVo, Replay TV (of SONICblue, Inc.), Ultimate (of Microsoft Corp.), and Wink Interactive Television. The customized advertisement, which triggers the provision of a follow-up advertisement in the format of an embodiment of the present invention, may have been targeted or customized to the system's user by various known techniques for determining consumer preferences, including techniques of preference analysis.","In a further related embodiment, such a follow-up advertisement may be provided as part of a \u201cdigital insert\u201d or \u201cdigital package insert,\u201d for example as part of an online billing statement, or a click-on addition to an online confirmation of an order. For example, a reader may be presented with a headline, and then click through to obtain such a follow-up advertisement for a related item.","In another embodiment according to the invention, a news release formatted in accordance with an embodiment described herein is provided as a targeted advertisement or e-mail (for example, an electronic promotion) that goes only to certain recipients based upon a targeting algorithm. For example, such a news release may be used with, or as part of, any software or technique used to target advertisements or other e-marketing materials. For example, Predictive Networks tracks and analyzes online behavior, and uses this data to customize advertisements to individual users; see http:\/\/www.predictivenetworks.com, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. Similar techniques may be used based on patterns of keyboard and mouse usage, or based on remote control usage with an interactive television. Resulting data patterns (\u201cprofiles,\u201d \u201csilhouettes,\u201d and \u201cbiometric user silhouettes\u201d) may be used to target advertisements.","In another embodiment according to an invention, a news release or advertisement formatted in accordance with an embodiment described herein is used with, or as part of, a recommendation engine, which targets the news release or advertisement based on the preferences of a target audience. Recommendation engine techniques may use collaborative filtering; however, other recommendation engine techniques may be used in accordance with embodiments of the invention.","In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, a news release formatted in accordance with an embodiment described herein is provided as a marketing-related e-mail with delivery tiers or profiled delivery. For example, such a method may provide promotional information to a user over a network, by providing the user with an experience of a news release in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. The news release is provided to the user only upon a determination that a selected marketing tier for the promotional information is of equal or higher hierarchical marketing tier level than a predetermined level. The marketing tier for the promotional information is selected from amongst a plurality of marketing tiers, each characterized by a different hierarchical level of customization to user preferences.","In a further embodiment according to the invention, a news release or advertisement formatted in accordance with an embodiment described herein is used in conjunction with a zero latency engine (ZLE) or other system or method that provides an almost instantaneous response to other transactions. In another embodiment, such a news release or advertisement is used with, or as part of, systems like and including DoubleClick's DART (Dynamic Advertising Reporting Targeting), an advertisement placement technology that DoubleClick is now also using to manage marketing e-mails. See U.S. Pat. No. 5,948,061 and http:\/\/www.doubleclick.com\/us, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference. In addition, such a news release or advertisement may be archived, and used in response to search inquiries. Also, such a news release or advertisement may be provided in response to other information collected online. For example, vendor X could look at complaints on PlanetFeedback about vendor Y, and respond to the complainer with an e-mail in the format of a news release in accordance with an embodiment of the invention, advertising vendor X's products. See http:\/\/www.planetfeedback.com, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.","In another embodiment according to the invention, a news release formatted in accordance with an embodiment described herein is provided as an electronic advertisement or e-mail that is not only targeted, but also customized. For example, the content may be auto-customized, with specific points in the format automatically customized based on other information (including from ZLE's or from any other database). Such an embodiment may be used in conjunction with personalization software or personalization platforms for marketers, and may be used to dynamically personalize an advertising message, or as part of optimized interactive marketing.","In another embodiment according to the invention, a news release formatted in accordance with an embodiment described herein is provided as an electronic advertisement or e-mail that is provided as part of a sampling\/promotions service or another similar incentive program, such as those provided at FreeSamples.com, mypoints.com, and GetRelevant.com, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference; or as part of Customer Loyalty programs or systems; or with surveys or gift certificates.","In a further embodiment according to the invention, a news release or electronic advertisement formatted in accordance with an embodiment described herein is linked to a system (such as a website) with which a recipient registers as a member, or registers to purchase a product, or registers to take up a marketer's offer.","In another embodiment, such a news release or electronic advertisement is delivered in a Zaplet format, or any similar format in which an e-mail shell has an embedded link to a Web-like application, which is shared by recipients of an e-mail message. See http:\/\/www.zaplet.coin, the dislcosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. The embedded links may, for example, come through the \u201cTake Action\u201d or \u201cFeedback Now\u201d portions of the format of a news release.","Such a news release or electronic advertisement may also be delivered as part of a \u201cviral\u201d marketing campaign, which may be fostered by a virtual delivery device such as Gizmoz\u2122 (described above).","News releases or electronic advertisements in accordance with an embodiment of the invention may also be used to communicate key information online about incipient problems or product updates. For example, a user may be provided with pre-emptive support service for a product, or be informed about updates, new releases, and enhancements to the product, as part of technical support or customer service.","In a further embodiment according to the invention, a news release or electronic advertisement formatted in accordance with an embodiment described herein is used as part of a transaction conducted partially or totally by e-mail. Microsoft's Passport and Ilium Software's eWallet are two examples of systems that provide the ability to conduct \u201ctransactive e-mail.\u201d See http:\/\/www.passport.com and http:\/\/www.iliumsoft.com\/wallet.htm, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference. Formats described herein may be used with similar systems in order to encourage parties to jump to the next step of a transaction, by giving a party just the information that he or she needs in order to proceed to the next step. In this regard, the \u201cTake Action\u201d and \u201cFeedback Now\u201d sections of a news release format described herein are particularly useful.","In another embodiment, a news release or electronic advertisement formatted in accordance with an embodiment described herein is used as part of an online shopping agent system, such as a website that tracks a retailer's inventory and then performs customized actions, such as offering hour-delivery for local merchants.","In accordance with further embodiments according to the invention, a news release or electronic advertisement formatted in accordance with an embodiment described herein is used with any of a variety of media or methods of access and delivery. For example, such a news release may be used with a \u201cpush to talk\u201d connection with an audio\/telephonic link; or be delivered on PDA's, Palms, smart phones, or smart appliances; with a company's sponsorship of a website; in audio form, for example as customized advertisements on Internet-based radio; aggregated into an e-mail newsletter, or as part of an electronic newsletter; as part of a wireless e-mail, or otherwise electronically delivered through a wireless device (such as a PDA or phone); as part of the X-Internet or expanded Internet, which extends Internet connectivity to other interactive devices such as cell phones and television; with targeted audio advertisements on a voice mail system, which may be a system in which users listen to targeted audio advertisements in exchange for free voice mail, and may press a button on a telephone handset to request an e-mail with more information; or with variable data printing (VDP), which takes information and web-pages that are customized based on information collected online, and puts them into paper form.","In another embodiment according to the invention, a news release or electronic advertisement formatted in accordance with an embodiment described herein is used with, or as part of, a rich media or mixed media electronic message. For example, such a message may involve streaming media instead of executable files and downloads. As another example, such a message may involve rich media such as that used by T-Mail, developed by the Townsend Agency, which uses a TCard, a rich-medial web page that can carry personalized content that includes animation, audio, video, HTML, or plain text. See http:\/\/www.etownsend.com\/capabilities\/inter_tmail.htm, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. A news release or electronic advertisement may also be used as a component of rich media e-mail campaigns, or other rich media electronic marketing or advertising campaigns.","In a further embodiment according to the invention, a news release or electronic advertisement formatted in accordance with an embodiment described herein is delivered via an application service provider's format, for example as part of a suite of applications related to electronic marketing and customer relationship management.","In another embodiment according to the invention, such a news release or advertisement is used as part of a \u201cpermission marketing\u201d program, similar to that found at YesMail.com, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.","The structure of another embodiment of the invention is next described by reference to . In this embodiment, a news release aggregator operates a host computer that distributes news releases. In box , a news release recipient \u201copts in\u201d to receiving news releases that target his or her special interests, by filling out a special-interest form and communicating it to the aggregator. The special-interest form includes the subjects that the recipient is interested in, and the recipient's email address. The special-interest form optionally may be communicated via an HTML page on a website, as a message to or from a wireless device, or as e-mail over the Internet.","In box , the aggregator classifies news release recipients according to their special interests, thereby enabling automatic filtering and dissemination of the news releases.","Next, in box , a news release promoter causes a news release format (such as the format illustrated below in connection with ) to be filled out, submits it to the aggregator, and pays the aggregator. The promoter need not fill out and submit the form itself, but may alternatively use the services of an intermediary agency, such as an advertising agency.","The aggregator edits the promoter's submission, and returns it to the promoter (or its intermediary agent) for final approval (box ). Once the promoter approves the news release, the aggregator retrieves the stored news release sections into a format for distribution, and distributes it to recipients who have \u201copted-in\u201d to receiving news releases of that type (box ). When the aggregator distributes the news release, the news release may also be archived by subject or other index (box ), and the archive may be made available to recipients (for example via HTML pages on a website).","When a recipient receives a news release, he or she may be interested in obtaining further information about the release. Using information provided by the promoter in the release, the recipient may research the release further\u2014for example, by activating a link to the promoter's website. Also, the recipient may research the news release by activating links to the aggregator's archive of news releases (box ).","Optionally, the recipient may provide feedback on the news release (box ). As discussed above in connection with , the feedback may include a variety of recipient responses to the news release; for example, questions, comments, reviews, or return opinions about the news release or collateral matters; or about the underlying products or services discussed in the news release; or about information contained in sources cited in the news release, including that contained in websites accessible by cited hyperlinks; or about samples of the underlying products or services. Preferably, the feedback indicates the news release and\/or promoter to which it responds. It may include information enabling further communication with the recipient who is the source of the feedback. In alternative preferred embodiments, the feedback is communicated to the aggregator via HTML pages on a website of the aggregator, or by activating an information link provided with the news release, or via e-mail over the internet.","Upon receiving recipients' feedback messages, the aggregator sorts them (preferably using computer sorting techniques) and provides each feedback message to the promoter for whom it was intended (boxes  and ) or to the promoter's intermediary agent. Feedback is preferably provided to the promoter (or its agent) as E-mail over a network, such as the Internet.","Additionally, the aggregator may provide summary feedback to each promoter (or its agent), along with individual recipients' feedback. Generally, the summary feedback gives useful summary information to each promoter (or promoter's agent) about recipients' behavior, based on information about the recipients that is known to the aggregator. It could include, for example, the percentage of all news release recipients who provided feedback to the promoter; a profile of the special interests of recipients who provided feedback to the promoter; the number of recipients who used the \u201cTake Action\u201d link, or other links; the number of feedback requests to a given promoter that are requests for products; or the percentages of favorable or unfavorable feedback.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0076","num":"0081"},"figref":["FIG. 27","FIG. 27"]},"The \u201cQUOTABLES\u201d section may be implemented, in one example, as an HTML link to a web page containing the quotations.

The article may be particularly useful for journalists who wish to base their own articles on the news release. By providing access to the article in the \u201cTAKE ACTION\u201d section, the automated news release thus captures a feature of traditional press releases. Alternatively, the full or partial article may be useful to consumers in obtaining further information about a product described in the news release.","In addition there is a section on contact information that includes subsections providing links to relevant websites, information concerning the availability of a full press release, other available materials, and persons who may be contacted (identified as \u201cCONTACT(S)\u201d).","For the contact information, the weblinks may be provided as simply a list of site addresses, or as hyperlinks.
