title: Multiple display monitor
abstract: A monitor having multiple displays within the same housing. The displays may be, for example, separate LCD panels that are placed in close proximity to one another so as to give the appearance of a single, large display. At least two of the displays may be treated by a computer connected to the monitor as a single display. A display controller divides a single frame of information that is provided by a display adapter of the computer into display information for multiple displays. By using the multiple display controller, the multiple display monitor may have more displays or panels than the number of cables linking the monitor to a computer. The special display controller also does not require a graphics card for each display. A three panel or display monitor is provided in which a central, centered work area display is framed by two side panels or displays.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present invention is generally directed to computers, and more specifically directed to the use of multiple displays with a single computer.","The use of multiple displays by computer enthusiasts continues to grow. Using more than one display allows a user to stretch his or her desktop to show more programs than if a single display is used. In addition, a single program may be stretched over multiple displays so that more of a document, such as a spreadsheet, may be seen without scrolling. A presentation may also have several pages open, with the pages spread across several different displays.","Because of the cost of producing large displays, purchasing two displays may provide the same amount of desktop space for less price than a large, single monitor. In addition to the cost of the monitor itself, however, conventional multiple monitor systems require an additional cable and display adapter, usually in the form of a video card, for each monitor. Alternatively, a special video card, often called a \u201cdualhead\u201d or multi-display card, must be purchased for the computer. Adding or changing the video cards requires opening the computer box and some knowledge of the internal structure of the computer. Moreover, the cables and video cards must be configured correctly by a user to create a single virtual display surface.","A drawback to the use of multiple monitors is that visually scanning from one monitor to another may be difficult. The wide frame that extends around the display for most monitors interrupts the eye when a user scans from one monitor to another, even when the monitors are placed as closely together as possible. In addition, the use of multiple monitors may cause discomfort for a user when viewing from one display to another.","The present invention provides a monitor having multiple displays within the same housing. The displays may be, for example, separate LCD panels that are placed in close proximity to one another so as to give the appearance of a single, large display.","In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, at least two of the displays are treated by a computer connected to the monitor as a single display. To this end, the monitor includes a display controller that divides a single frame of information that is provided by a display adapter of the computer into display information for multiple displays. By using the special multiple display controller, the multiple display monitor may have more displays or panels than the number of cables linking the monitor to a computer. The special display controller also does not require a graphics card for each display.","In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, a three panel or display monitor is provided in which a central, centered work area display is framed by two side panels or displays. The two side panels or displays together may be roughly the size of the central work area display.","There are a number of advantages provided by the monitor of the present invention. First, the side panels or displays may be located immediately adjacent to the central work area display. This arrangement prevents neck strain, because a user does not have to turn his or her head that much to view the side monitors or displays. In addition, the field of view between the adjacent panels is not interrupted such as in the case where two separate monitors are used. Moreover, because the two side panels are smaller than a single display of the same size, the production cost of producing a multiple display monitor is less.","Narrow seams between the side panels and the central work area display provide a smooth transition between the displays. In addition, the three part visual screen provides a natural division into a larger central work area (i.e., the central work area display) and peripheral areas (i.e., the side displays) that may be used for notifications, tree views, tool bars, and other items.","Other advantages will become apparent from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the drawings, in which:","Exemplary Operating Environment",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["110","110","110","110"]},"The invention is operational with numerous other general purpose or special purpose computing system environments or configurations.

Components of the computer  may include, but are not limited to, a processing unit , a system memory , and a system bus  that couples various system components including the system memory to the processing unit . The system bus  may be any of several types of bus structures including a memory bus or memory controller, a peripheral bus, and a local bus using any of a variety of bus architectures. By way of example, and not limitation, such architectures include Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) bus, Micro Channel Architecture (MCA) bus, Enhanced ISA (EISA) bus, Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) local bus, and Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) bus also known as Mezzanine bus.","Computer  typically includes a variety of computer-readable media. Computer-readable media can be any available media that can be accessed by the computer  and includes both volatile and nonvolatile media, and removable and non-removable media. By way of example, and not limitation, computer-readable media may comprise computer storage media and communication media. Computer storage media includes both volatile and nonvolatile, removable and non-removable media implemented in any method or technology for storage of information such as computer-readable instructions, data structures, program modules, or other data. Computer storage media includes, but is not limited to, RAM, ROM, EEPROM, flash memory or other memory technology, CD-ROM,CD-RW, digital versatile disks (DVD) or other optical disk storage, magnetic cassettes, magnetic tape, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium which can be used to store the desired information and which can accessed by the computer . Communication media typically embodies computer-readable instructions, data structures, program modules, or other data in a modulated data signal such as a carrier wave or other transport mechanism and includes any information delivery media. The term \u201cmodulated data signal\u201d means a signal that has one or more of its characteristics set or changed in such a manner as to encode information in the signal. By way of example, and not limitation, communication media includes wired media such as a wired network or direct-wired connection, and wireless media such as acoustic, RF, infrared and other wireless media. Combinations of the any of the above should also be included within the scope of computer-readable media.","The system memory  includes computer storage media in the form of volatile and\/or nonvolatile memory such as read only memory (ROM)  and random access memory (RAM) . A basic input\/output system  (BIOS), containing the basic routines that help to transfer information between elements within computer , such as during start-up, is typically stored in ROM . RAM  typically contains data and\/or program modules that are immediately accessible to and\/or presently being operated on by processing unit . By way of example, and not limitation,  illustrates operating system , application programs , other program modules , and program data .","The computer  may also include other removable\/non-removable, volatile\/nonvolatile computer storage media. By way of example only,  illustrates a hard disk drive  that reads from or writes to non-removable, nonvolatile magnetic media, a magnetic disk drive  that reads from or writes to a removable, nonvolatile magnetic disk , and an optical disk drive  that reads from or writes to a removable, nonvolatile optical disk  such as a CD ROM or other optical media, or writeable\/re-writeable optical media. Other removable\/non-removable, volatile\/nonvolatile computer storage media that can be used in the exemplary operating environment include, but are not limited to, magnetic tape cassettes, flash memory cards, digital versatile disks, digital video tape, solid state RAM, solid state ROM, and the like. The hard disk drive  is typically connected to the system bus  through a non-removable memory interface such as interface , and magnetic disk drive  and optical disk drive  are typically connected to the system bus  by a removable memory interface, such as interface .","The drives and their associated computer storage media, discussed above and illustrated in , provide storage of computer-readable instructions, data structures, program modules, and other data for the computer . In , for example, hard disk drive  is illustrated as storing operating system , application programs , other program modules , and program data . Note that these components can either be the same as or different from operating system , application programs , other program modules , and program data . Operating system , application programs , other program modules , and program data  are given different numbers herein to illustrate that, at a minimum, they are different copies. A user may enter commands and information into the computer  through input devices such as a keyboard  and pointing device , commonly referred to as a mouse, trackball, or touch pad. Other input devices (not shown) may include a microphone, joystick, game pad, satellite dish, scanner, a touch-sensitive screen of a handheld PC or other writing tablet, or the like. These and other input devices are often connected to the processing unit  through a user input interface  that is coupled to the system bus, but may be connected by other interface and bus structures, such as a parallel port, game port or a universal serial bus (USB). A monitor  or other type of display device is also connected to the system bus  via an interface, such as a display adapter interface . In addition to the monitor, computers may also include other peripheral output devices such as speakers  and printer , which may be connected through an output peripheral interface .","The computer  may operate in a networked environment using logical connections to one or more remote computers, such as a remote computer . The remote computer  may be a personal computer, a server, a router, a network PC, a peer device or other common network node, and typically includes many or all of the elements described above relative to the computer , although only a memory storage device  has been illustrated in . The logical connections depicted in  include a local area network (LAN)  and a wide area network (WAN) (not shown), but may also include other networks. Such networking environments are commonplace in offices, enterprise-wide computer networks, intranets and the Internet.","When used in a LAN networking environment, the computer  is connected to the LAN  through a network interface or adapter . In a networked environment, program modules depicted relative to the computer , or portions thereof, may be stored in the remote memory storage device. By way of example, and not limitation,  illustrates remote application programs  as residing on memory device . It will be appreciated that the network connections shown are exemplary and other means of establishing a communications link between the computers may be used.","Multiple Display Monitor",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","110","202","202","202","203","202","204","204","204","204","204","206","204","207"],"sub":["1","2 ","N ","1","2 ","N","1","2 ","N "]},"The display controller  divides a single image frame provided by the computer  into multiple images for the multiple displays . Such a display controller  for operating multiple displays is described in detail in copending and commonly owned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/284,045, filed Oct. 29, 2002 (the \u201c045 application\u201d), and incorporated herein by reference. As used herein, a display controller capable of operating multiple displays is referred to as a \u201cmultiple display controller.\u201d A conventional display controller  configured to function with one display, such as the display controller , are referred to herein as \u201csingle display controllers.\u201d","Although the '045 application may be read to understand the operation and configuration of a multiple display controller, a brief description is provided herein for the benefit of the reader. In general, a multiple display controller splits a single, large image frame provided by a computer into targeted display information for one or more displays. For example, a left half of the image data may be sent to a left display. In addition, the multiple display controller may provide information to the computer so that the computer may know how to target a particle display. For example, the computer may build its large image frame knowing that the left half will eventually be directed to a left display.","Thus, when connected to a computer, a multiple display controller may provide information about the displays to which it is connected. The information provided to the computer may include information about a single virtual display surface defined by all displays, such as the size, resolution, and refresh rate for the combined virtual display surface. In addition, the EDID information may include information about each of the individual monitors or displays, including the location of the individual displays in the single virtual display, and available resolutions and refresh rates for each of the monitors.","The information used by the computer depends upon whether the computer is capable of taking advantage of the locations and features of the multiple displays. If not, then the information about the single virtual display may be utilized by a computer. The computer treats the multiple monitors like a single monitor having the characteristics of the single display surface. Applications or window panes displayed by the computer may overlap two or more displays, and thus does not take advantage of the layout of the multiple displays.","If a computer is capable of recognizing the locations and features of the multiple displays, then the operating system of the computer and\/or applications running on the computer may target particular display information to a particular display or displays. To this end, the computer may optimize display quality and presentation for a user. An application programming interface (API) may be provided that exposes itself to applications so that the applications may be aware of the multiple displays and alter their images so that one or more particular panes are shown on a particular display or advantageously spread across multiple displays.","Although the computer recognizes that there are multiple displays, because of cable, display adapter, or other limitations, it still is limited to sending a single frame of data to the multiple display controller. Thus, information for the multiple displays must be properly mapped within the single frame of data. A display component, such as a video driver, may be used by the computer to expose virtual display surfaces for each of the displays that represent the corresponding portion of the single frame. The applications or the operating system may then target image information to the virtual display surfaces.","The virtual display surfaces are combined to form the single frame in a frame buffer (e.g., the frame buffer ) in the computer. The frame is forwarded to the multiple display controller , which divides the image, for example using line or frame buffers, and then provides appropriate display information to each of the separate displays. For some implementations of the invention, the image data for a particular display may be rotated so that it matches the scanning direction of the target display.","In any event, one or more multiple display controllers  may be used with one or more single display controllers  to provide appropriate image data to the displays . Also, In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, as is further described below, the present invention may be implemented with only a single multiple display controller . In such an embodiment, the single multiple display controller  is configured to provide image data to all of the displays  in the monitor . Alternatively, the invention may utilize a multiple display controller, such as the multiple display controller , to control one or more panels or displays  in the monitor , and also implement one or more single display controllers (e.g., the single display controller ) to control one or more displays , with one single display controller  being used for each display . Other combinations may be used in accordance with the spirit of the present invention.","Although shown as separate components in , the display controller  (or the display controller ) and its associated panel controller or controllers  may be combined in a single circuit board, or their functions may be distributed over a number of different components, or two or more of the controllers may be combined to form a single component, or the functions of two or more of the components may be spread over multiple elements on the same circuit board, multiple circuit boards, or may otherwise be provided. Similarly, unless otherwise stated herein, the components and elements used to describe the present invention are described as separate components for ease of description, and the functions of the components may be provided by several different devices or modules, and\/or one or more of the components may be combined with another to form a single device or module.","In any event, a monitor signal interface , is attached to the display controller , and a separate monitor signal interface is connected to the display controller . The monitor signal interfaces  may each be, for example, a scan converter or a digital receiver (e.g., configured to receive TMDS or LVDS).","A cable  extends between each of the monitor signal interfaces  and a respective host signal interface or connected to or otherwise associated with a respective display adapter or located in the computer . The host signal interfaces  may each be, for example, a digital-to-analog converter (DAC), or a digital transmitter sending a digital signal, such as TMDS (DVI) or LVDS. The display adapter  may be a video graphics card, may be an integrated adapter, or may be another suitable component that enables a computer to provide display information to the displays . The display adapter  is connected to the operating system  () for the computer  and may be utilized with one or more applications  (also ).","As can be understood, each display controller  or  requires its own monitor signal interface , cable , host signal interface , and display adapter . As such, there are advantages to use of the multiple display controller , in that a multiple display controller  may control multiple panels with a single monitor signal interface , a single host signal interface , a single cable , and a single display adapter . Set-up and equipment costs may thus be saved by utilizing the multiple display controller .","The displays  are preferably liquid crystal display panels (LCD), but alternatively may be plasma, cathode ray tubes (CRT), or another devices that are capable of displaying graphics and\/or text. In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, the displays  are provided as separate panels that are aligned adjacent to one another within the monitor  so as to provide a single, contiguous display surface. An example of such a monitor  is shown in . The monitor  includes three panels , ,  that together provide a single, large display surface within a single monitor housing . In such an embodiment, each display , as used herein, would be one of the physical panels , , . This implementation of a multiple panel monitor is significantly less expensive than providing a single panel monitor of the same size, especially if the panels are of the LCD variety. The reason the multiple panel monitor is less expensive to manufacture is that multiple smaller LCD panels may be produced with far less rejects than a single large panel LCD. The better production yields far offset the assembly costs of the multiple small monitors.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 3","FIG. 10"],"b":["1000","300","1000","1002","1004","1000","1006","1002","1004","1006","1002","1004"]},"The embodiment shown in  provides many benefits over the embodiment shown in . For example, the bent side panels ,  are more clearly seen by the peripheral vision of a user than if the entire monitor was flat. In addition, if other features or components are provided on the monitor , such as speakers , these components may be more appropriately aligned for the vision and\/or hearing of the user. Moreover, and importantly, the tilted side panels ,  as configured in  reduce the number of head turns necessary when reading or scanning the monitor  from left to right. As such, the configuration of the monitor  significant increases productivity, because large displays can cause as many as  head turns going from left to right, and beyond  head turns there is a decrease in productivity and increase in neck strain due to the head turns. By tilting the side panels , , they are more readily viewed without head tilt, thus minimizing head turns, which increases productivity and reduces neck strain.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":["FIGS. 11-13","FIGS. 11-13"],"b":["1100","1102","1104","1102","1100"]},"The monitor assembly  includes a novel, three-panel display having two side panels ,  hinged to a central panel .

The two side panels ,  of the monitor may then be folded out relative to the central panel  ().","The folding out of the side panels ,  provides increased viewing surface for a user. These side panels ,  may be provided at an angle relative to the central panel , such as is shown in . As such, the side panels ,  and the central panel  offer many of the benefits of the arrangement of the monitor  shown in . In addition, because the side panels ,  are hinged to the central panel , the side panels ,  may be conveniently stored between the central panel  and the base . Alternatively, if desired, the side panels ,  could be folded outward to extend along the back side of the central panel .

Typically, for a display that scans horizontally, linear data begins at a top of the panel, extends horizontally to the panel edge, and then starts on the next line, much in the same order as reading a page of text. The implementation in  requires that the image data for the left and right LCD panels , be stored so that a segment of data is sent to the left LCD panel, followed by a segment to the right LCD panel, followed by a segment to the left LCD panel, and so forth. This implementation thus requires that the data signal \u201cjump\u201d from the left panel to the right panel . However, as long as the line or other buffers are properly defined for the image data, targeting the proper data to the appropriate display is not a problem.","With appropriate information sent to each of the panels , , and , the computer may target particular image data to one or more of the panels . In this manner, the display location and properties of each of the displays  may be used to the best advantage of the computer . As an example, the computer (e.g., the operating system  or an application ) may target the central LCD panel as a work area, and may target the left LCD panel for a tree control for an application. The right LCD panel may, in turn, be targeted for a tool bar. To this end, the wider-than-tall aspect ratio of the central LCD panel is more natural for a main working area, and the taller-than-wide aspect ratio for the left and right LCD panels , is more natural for status, tool bar, and tree areas.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["202","202","202","202"],"sub":["1","2 ","1","2 "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":["FIGS. 6 and 7","FIG. 6) and 702","FIG. 7","FIGS. 6 and 7"],"b":["602","206","202","212","206","214","200","203","200","203"]},"The embodiment in  includes two side panels , that scan vertically, and the embodiment in  includes two side panels , that scan horizontally.

In this embodiment, the frame buffer  is aligned vertically so that the image information for the left LCD panel is arranged at a top portion, the central LCD panel is located centrally, and the image data for the right LCD panel is located at a bottom portion of the image data.","In this embodiment, each display includes its own multiple display controller , , or . The same image data signal is sent, via a host signal interface bus , to each one of the display controllers.
