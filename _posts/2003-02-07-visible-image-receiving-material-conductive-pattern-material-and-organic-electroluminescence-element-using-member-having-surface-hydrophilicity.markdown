Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a visible image receiving material, a conductive pattern material and an organic electroluminescence element, which use a member having surface hydrophilicity. More particularly, the present invention relates to a visible image receiving material that is suitable for printing using an aqueous ink and excellent in coloring properties with respect to a colorant, a conductive pattern material that can conveniently form a conductive pattern and is useful for forming a circuit board, and an organic electroluminescence element that is excellent in sharpness of pixels and durability and can be conveniently subjected to uniform and local patterning.","2. Description of the Related Art","Various kinds of image receiving materials have been conventionally used in a printing apparatus using a general aqueous ink, and the image receiving materials are required to have such characteristics that an image thus formed has high chroma saturation, a colorant can be firmly fixed on the image receiving material, and the image receiving material is quick drying and does not cause ink blurring. In order to deal with such demands, the conventional image receiving materials for ink-jet recording use a polymer mordant in an image receiving layer. In this case, however, although an image thus formed has high chroma saturation and excellent transparency. there are problems such as in that absorptivity and drying speed of an ink are deteriorated, and an ink is liable to blur. Inorganic ultra-fine particles have also been used in image receiving layers, and in this case, while absorptivity and drying speed are excellent for avoiding ink blurring, there are problems such as in that an image thus formed has insufficient chroma saturation for brilliant color reproduction, and blurring occurs in the image upon storage thereof over a long period of time or under high humidity conditions.","As an example of the image receiving layer, which is excellent in physical characteristics, a colorant receiving layer having a three-dimensional network structure with a large porosity is disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid Open (JP-A) No. 7-276789. In this case, however, absorptivity of an ink and coloring properties in respect to a colorant are insufficient, and thus a visible image receiving material that is excellent in these characteristics is demanded.","Furthermore, various kinds of conductive pattern materials have been conventionally used for forming a circuit board. Representative examples thereof include those produced by forming a thin film of a conductive material on an insulating material by a known method, such as vacuum deposition, subjecting the thin film is subjected to a resist treatment, removing a part of the resist thus formed by pattern exposure, and then carrying out an etching treatment to form a desired pattern. Such a process requires at least four process steps, and a treating step for a waste liquid is also required in the case where a wet etching treatment is carried out. Complicated process steps are thus required.","As an example using another method for forming a pattern for a conductive pattern, a material for forming a conductive pattern by using a photoresist is known. In this method, a substrate having a photoresist polymer coated thereon or having a photoresist provided on a dry film attached thereto is exposed with UV light through an arbitrary photomask to form a pattern, such as a lattice shape, and the method is useful for forming an electromagnetic wave shield requiring high conductivity.","In recent years, a method for forming a pattern directly from digital data without use of a photomask is receiving attention as a conductive pattern material, and various kinds of proposals have been made.","It is expected that an arbitrary pattern can be conveniently formed by utilizing such digitalized pattern forming. Examples of the method include a method utilizing a self-assembling monomolecular film. This method utilizes a molecular aggregate that is spontaneously formed upon immersing a substrate in an organic solvent containing a surface active molecule, and examples thereof include a combination of an organic silane compound with an SiOsubstrate or an AlOsubstrate, and a combination of an alcohol or an amine with a platinum substrate, which can be patterned, for example, by a photolithography process. Although the monomolecular film enables formation of a fine pattern, it is necessary to use the restricted combinations of substrates and materials, and thus the method is difficult to apply in practical use. Therefore, presently, that such a technique for forming a conductive pattern, such as wiring, that can be practically applied has not yet been established.","Furthermore, research and development relating to various kinds of display elements are being actively carried out, and among them, an organic electroluminescence element (hereinafter, also referred to as an \u201corganic EL element\u201d) is receiving attention owing to light emission of high luminance with a low voltage. In particular, the element is expected to realizing a full color display element having a large area.","To realize a full color organic EL element, it is presently necessary to arrange organic light emitting layers emitting light of three primary colors, red, green and blue, for the respective pixels, and as a production process of such a full color organic EL element, such methods as a patterning method of an EL element by a lithography process, a patterning method by vapor deposition, and a patterning method by a conventional printing method, such as screen printing, with a printing ink containing an EL material, have been employed.","However, the technique of patterning the organic light emitting layer has significant problems with regard to accuracy. The reasons therefor are as follows. The metal surface of the reflective electrode material is unstable, and thus patterning by vapor deposition fails to achieve sufficient accuracy. The polymer and the precursor for forming a positive hole injection layer and an organic light emitting layer cannot withstand patterning processes, such as photolithography.","In order to solve the aforementioned problems, JP-A No. 10-153967 discloses an EL display device capable of exerting full color display in which a resin black resist is formed between transparent pixel electrodes by a photoresist process, and light emitting materials corresponding to the respective light emitting pixels are contained in ink liquids by using the resin black resist as a partition, and which is applied by the ink-jet method, as well as a production process of the EL display device.","However, because a blue light emitting material assuring durability and reliability cannot be prepared as a conventional PPV series aqueous solution precursor, organic light emitting layers of red and green colors are patterned for respective pixels by the ink-jet method, and a charge transporting organic light emitting layer of blue color is formed as an adjacent layer by a vacuum deposition method.","Furthermore, JP-A No. 10-12377 as an example of a process using no partition between pixels upon patterning the organic light emitting layers of three colors for the respective pixels by the inkjet method, discloses the following process. A positive hole injection layer is formed as an upper layer of a transparent pixel electrode formed on a glass substrate having thin film transistors formed thereon, and the organic light emitting layers corresponding to the respective pixels are formed as an upper layer of the positive hole injection layer by the ink-jet method.","However, there is a problem in accuracy of spotting ink droplets at positions of the pixels corresponding to the respective colors, and there is also a problem in that the liquid droplets are expanded and contracted during drying, whereby proper performance of the EL display cannot be exerted due to overlap of and gaps between the respective light emitting layers.","Furthermore, in the foregoing techniques, there is no particular consideration of adhesion between the organic compound layer, on which the pixels are formed, and a lower layer (such as a substrate), and therefore, there is a defect in that the organic compound layer is liable to be peeled off.","Under the circumstances described in the foregoing, it is difficult uniformly attain both sharpness and durability of the pixels and local patterning for the respective colors, in the organic EL element.","A first object of the invention is to provide a visible image receiving material that is high in absorptivity and fixing property of an ink, and is excellent in coloring property of a colorant.","A second object of the invention is to provide a conductive pattern material excellent in conductivity and durability capable of being used in a broader range of application that can provide a pattern with high resolution without complicated process steps and expensive machines even in the case where it is applied to the formation of wiring using plural different materials, and can directly form a pattern on a substrate based on digital data.","A third object of the invention is to provide an organic EL element that is excellent in sharpness and durability (adhesion strength) of pixels and can be conveniently conduct uniform and local patterning.","As a result of earnest investigations in view of the foregoing problems by the inventors, they recognize the strong hydrophilicity of a hydrophilic graft chain, and the objects of the invention can be accomplished by applying a member having the graft chain on a surface thereof (i.e., a member having surface hydrophilicity) in the visible image receiving material, the conductive pattern material and the organic EL element as a member corresponding to the characteristics thereof, whereby the invention has been completed.","Accordingly, as a result of investigations in application of the member to the visible image receiving material in view of the strong hydrophilicity of the hydrophilic graft chain, it has been found that the first object of the invention can be attained by providing an image receiving layer having the hydrophilic graft chain on a support, and thus the visible image receiving material of the invention has been completed.","In order to attain the first object of the invention, the following aspects are provided.","The invention relates to a visible image receiving material containing a support having on at least one printing surface thereof an image receiving layer having a hydrophilic graft chain.","It is preferred in the visible image receiving material of the invention that the image receiving layer comprises the hydrophilic graft chain bonded to a surface of the support or a surface of an intermediate layer provided on the support.","It is preferred in the visible image receiving material of the invention that the hydrophilic graft chain is bonded to a surface of the support or a surface of an intermediate layer provided on the support at an end of the graft chain, and a graft portion exhibiting hydrophilicity is substantially not crosslinked.","It is preferred in the visible image receiving material of the invention that the intermediate layer comprises a layer containing a compound exerting a polymerization initiating function.","It is preferred in the visible image receiving material of the invention that the image receiving layer comprises a layer that receives an aqueous ink.","It is considered that because the visible image receiving material of the invention has a hydrophilic graft chain having high mobility in the image receiving layer, it has a considerably high absorption rate of an ink, is excellent in drying speed, and shows less broadening of dots (blur), in comparison to the conventional image receiving material. Furthermore, it is considered that because the material also has such characteristics that the amount of an ink absorbed per unit area is large, it shows a high dot concentration to sharpen the colors.","In the image receiving layer having a hydrophilic graft chain in the visible image receiving material of the invention, the hydrophilic graft chain is directly bonded to the support. Therefore, upon attaching an ink to the surface thereof, the ink is ionically adsorbed to a hydrophilic group of the hydrophilic graft chain immediately and is firmly fixed thereon, to form a uniform image having a high density. As a result, even thought the image receiving layer itself is a thin layer, an image excellent in sharpness and color tone can be formed.","Accordingly, the visible image receiving material of the invention can be used as an image receiving material for various kinds of printing method using an ordinary aqueous ink. Among these, it is particularly preferably used in an apparatus using an aqueous ink having a low viscosity, such as an ink-jet recording apparatus.","As a result of earnest investigation made by the inventors paying attention on the strong ionic adsorptivity of the hydrophilic graft chain, the second object of the invention can be attained in such a manner that a member having surface hydrophilicity containing the hydrophilic graft polymer chain is used, and a conductive material is locally applied and adsorbed to the member having surface hydrophilicity, whereby the conductive pattern material of the invention has been completed.","In order to attain the second object of the invention, the following aspects are provided.","The invention relates to a conductive pattern material comprising a member having surface hydrophilicity comprising a support having at an entirety of at least one surface thereof a hydrophilic graft chain, and a conductive material layer formed thereon comprising a conductive material locally applied and adsorbed thereto.","It is preferred in the conductive pattern material of the invention that the member having surface hydrophilicity comprises the hydrophilic graft chain bonded to a surface of the support or a surface of an intermediate layer provided on the support.","It is preferred in the conductive pattern material of the invention that the hydrophilic graft chain is bonded to a surface of the support or a surface of an intermediate layer provided on the support at an end of the graft chain, and a graft portion exhibiting hydrophilicity is substantially not crosslinked.","It is preferred in the conductive pattern material of the invention that the conductive material is conductive fine particles.","It is preferred in the conductive pattern material of the invention that the conductive material layer is formed by discharging the conductive material in a fluid form from an ink-jet recording head in a pattern using an ink-jet recording apparatus, to locally apply the conductive material to the member having surface hydrophilicity.","As an embodiment of locally applying the conductive material to the member having hydrophilicity, in addition to the foregoing embodiment of discharging the conductive material in a fluid form to a pattern form by using an ink-jet recording apparatus, such embodiments are preferred in the invention, as an embodiment of forming to a film having a pattern form by using a mask pattern by the known film forming method, such as a gas phase accumulating method (gas phase method), an embodiment using the known pattern printing method, such as screen printing, and an embodiment of printing a sheet having a conductive thermal transfer layer coated thereon to a pattern form by using a heat-sensitive image forming element.","While the function of the conductive pattern material of the invention is considered as follows while it is not completely clear. The conductive pattern material of the invention uses the member having surface hydrophilicity having a hydrophilic graft polymer chain directly and chemically bonded to the support. Upon attaching a conductive material for forming wiring on the surface thereof, the conductive material is ionically adsorbed to the hydrophilic graft polymer chain through polarity mutual action based on the hydrophilic group present in the hydrophilic graft polymer chain, and the molecules adsorbed are firmly fixed in the form of a substantially monomolecular film to form a uniform layer having a high density. As a result, the layer exhibits high strength and high wear resistance even with a thin film, and thus a wiring pattern without disconnection can be formed.","Because the hydrophilic graft polymer chain in the conductive pattern material of the invention has high mobility, it has such characteristics that in comparison to the case where conductive fine particles are adsorbed on an ordinary crosslinked polymer film, the adsorption rate is significantly large, and the amount of conductive fine particles that can be adsorbed per unit area is large. Therefore, it is considered that even in the case where conductive fine particles are used as the conductive material, conductivity is not disturbed by gaps present among the fine particles to realize excellent conductivity.","Furthermore, in the case where an apparatus for locally supplying the conductive material (such as an ink-jet apparatus) is used to apply and adsorb the conductive material to the member having surface hydrophilicity, the object can be conveniently attained only with a small amount of the conductive material in comparison to the conventional method, such as a dipping method. Moreover, in the case where plural different conductive materials are to be adsorbed, the respective conductive patterns are independently formed owing to the local supply of the conductive material, and thus the patterns do not physically and chemically influence each other. Therefore, the conductive pattern material of the invention can be suitably used for sequentially forming different conductive patterns.","The inventors have also found that the third object of the invention can be attained by forming a hydrophilic surface having a hydrophilic graft chain on a substrate having an electrode previously formed thereon, and locally forming an organic light emitting layer or forming plural organic compound layers including an organic light emitting layer, on the hydrophilic surface, whereby the organic EL element of the invention has been completed.","Furthermore, the inventors have also found that the third object of the invention can be attained by forming a hydrophilic\/hydrophilic region by application of energy on a substrate having an electrode previously formed thereon, and forming at least one organic compound layer including an organic light emitting layer on the surface, whereby the organic EL element of the invention has been completed.","In order to attain the third object of the invention, the following aspects are provided.","The invention relates to an organic EL element of a first embodiment comprising in the following order\n\n","It is preferred in the first embodiment of the organic EL element of the invention that the hydrophilic surface contains the hydrophilic graft chain bonded to a surface of the first electrode or a surface of an intermediate layer provided on the first electrode.","It is preferred in the first embodiment of the organic EL element of the invention that the hydrophilic graft chain is bonded to a surface of the first electrode or a surface of an intermediate layer provided on the first electrode at an end of the graft chain, and a graft portion exhibiting hydrophilicity is substantially not crosslinked.","It is preferred in the first embodiment of the organic EL element of the invention that the organic compound layer is formed by discharging a composition in a fluid form for forming the organic compound layer from an ink-jet recording head in a pattern using an ink-jet recording apparatus, to locally apply the composition to the hydrophilic surface.","In the first embodiment of the organic EL element of the invention, the substrate having a surface containing a hydrophilic graft chain formed thereon are sometimes totally referred to as a \u201csubstrate material\u201d. The substrate necessarily has the first electrode, and it also may further have other elements, such as an insulating layer for distinguishing light emitting regions, a circuit.","While the function of the first embodiment of the organic EL element of the invention is considered as follows while it is not completely clear.","In the first embodiment of the organic EL element of the invention, the surface having hydrophilic graft chain directly and chemically bonded to the substrate material is provided. Based on the function of the hydrophilic group present in the hydrophilic graft chain, the organic compound layer to be formed as an upper layer thereof is ionically adsorbed to the hydrophilic graft chain through polarity mutual action and is firmly fixed to form a uniform layer having a high density. As a result, it is considered that pixels in the organic EL element of the invention show both high hydrophilicity and high durability.","Because the hydrophilic graft chain in the invention has high mobility, it has such characteristics that in comparison to the case where the composition for forming the organic compound layer is applied to the known ordinary crosslinked polymer film, the adsorption rate is significantly large, and the amount of the composition that can be adsorbed per unit area is large. Furthermore, because the vertical permeability is also excellent, the composition for forming the organic compound layer is not diffused to the periphery but is quickly and locally permeated to the layer having the hydrophilic surface having the hydrophilic graft chain (hereinafter, which is sometimes referred to as a \u201chydrophilic graft layer\u201d in the first to fourth embodiments of the organic EL element of the invention) in the vertical direction to reach the surface of the substrate material. Therefore, the organic compound layer thus formed is locally formed only on the light emitting region and can be firmly adhered to the substrate material. Accordingly, in the organic EL element of the invention, it is considered that excellent sharpness and durability are exerted by the high adhesion strength of the pixels thus realized.","In the first embodiment of the organic EL element of the invention, the following embodiment of a process for producing an organic EL element is preferred.","The preferred embodiment of a process for producing an organic EL element comprises the steps of:\n\n","A second embodiment of the organic EL element of the invention comprises in the following order\n\n","A third embodiment of an organic EL element of the invention is an organic EL element of the second embodiment, in which the hydrophilic region is formed by application of heat, supply of an acid, or irradiation of a radiation ray locally on a surface having a polymer compound including a functional group whose hydrophilicity\/hydrophobicity is changed by heat, an acid, or a radiation ray.","It is preferred in the organic EL element of the third embodiment of the invention that the functional group whose hydrophilicity\/hydrophobicity is changed is at least one selected from the group consisting of a secondary alkylsulfonate ester group, a tertiary carboxylate ester group and an alkoxyalkyl ester group.","As the polymer compound including a functional group whose hydrophilicity\/hydrophobicity is changed by heat, an acid, or a radiation ray (hereinafter, also referred to as a \u201cpolarity conversion group\u201d), a linear polymer compound bonded to the surface provided on the substrate having the first electrode or a linear polymer compound bonded at an end of the polymer chain to the surface of the substrate by a chemical bond through a stem polymer compound is preferred.","A fourth embodiment of an organic EL element of the invention is an organic EL element of the second embodiment, in which the hydrophilic region is formed by local irradiation of a radiation ray on a surface having been in contact with a hydrophilic compound having a polymerizable group.","It is preferred in the organic EL element of the fourth embodiment that the hydrophilic region is formed on a layer containing a compound exerting a polymerization initiating function which layer is provided on the first electrode.","It is preferred in the organic EL element of the second embodiment that the organic compound layer is formed by discharging a composition in a fluid form for forming the organic compound layer from an ink-jet recording head in a pattern using an ink-jet recording apparatus, to locally apply the composition to the hydrophilic region.","In the second embodiment of the organic EL element of the invention, the substrate having the surface capable of forming a hydrophilic\/hydrophobic region by application of energy is sometimes referred to as a \u201csubstrate material\u201d. The substrate necessarily has the first electrode, and it also may further have other elements, such as an insulating layer for distinguishing light emitting regions and a circuit.","In the organic EL element of the third embodiment of the invention, a hydrophilic region, a hydrophobic region and a mixed region thereof can be formed in a region having been irradiated with a radiation ray (including exposure) and a region having been heated on the substrate material corresponding to the polarity of the surface having the polymer compound having the polarity conversion group, and therefore, the organic compound layer can be selectively and locally formed only on the hydrophilic region.","The hydrophobic region can function as a partition among the pixels to improve accuracy (uniformity) upon forming the pixels. Furthermore, a partition can be formed only on the hydrophobic region.","The polymer compound having a polarity conversion group is bonded, for example, at an end thereof to the substrate material directly or through the stem polymer compound. The hydrophilic compound used in the fourth embodiment is also bonded to the substrate material by exposure. The hydrophilic region thus formed maintains high hydrophilicity and exhibits excellent durability.","The polymer compound having a polarity conversion group in the organic EL element of the third embodiment of the invention and the hydrophilic compound in the fourth embodiment has a graft chain structure having high mobility, whereby the hydrophilic region has a significantly large adsorption rate, a large water amount to be retained per unit area, and excellent vertical permeability, in comparison to the affinity of the known ordinary crosslinked polymer film with water molecules.","Therefore, upon forming the hydrophilic organic compound layer as an upper layer of the hydrophilic region, a composition for forming the organic compound layer is quickly penetrated into the layer having the polymer compound forming the hydrophilic region (hydrophilic graft polymer layer), and the organic compound layer after formation is firmly adhered to the substrate material. Accordingly, the organic EL element of the invention realizes high adhesion strength of the pixels to exert excellent durability.","Preferred examples of a process for producing the organic EL element of the invention include the following production processes () and ().","The process for producing an organic EL element () comprises the steps of:\n\n","The process for producing an organic EL element () comprises the steps of:\n\n","It is preferred in the organic EL element of the invention that the organic light emitting layer or the plural organic compound layers including an organic light emitting layer is formed by an ink-jet method or a pattern printing method.

Visible Image Receiving Material","The visible image receiving material of the invention comprises a support having on at least one printing surface thereof an image receiving layer having a hydrophilic graft chain. The image receiving layer will be described.","1-1. Image Receiving Layer having Hydrophilic Graft Chain","The image receiving layer having a hydrophilic graft chain in the visible image receiving material of the invention may be formed by bonding the hydrophilic graft chain directly to the surface of the support, or may be formed by forming an intermediate layer, which is liable to be bonded to the hydrophilic graft chain, on the surface of the support, and then grafting a hydrophilic compound to the intermediate layer. Furthermore, the image receiving layer in the visible image receiving material of the invention includes those produced in such a manner that a polymer having a hydrophilic graft chain bonded to a stem polymer compound or a polymer having a hydrophilic graft chain bonded to a stem polymer compound and having a crosslinkable functional group introduced thereto is coated or coated and crosslinked to arrange the layer on the surface of the support, and those produced in such a manner that a composition containing a hydrophilic graft chain having a crosslinking group at an end thereof and a crosslinking agent is coated or coated and crosslinked to arrange the layer on the surface of the support.","The characteristic features of the hydrophilic compound in the visible image receiving material of the invention include those features that an end or a side chain of the hydrophilic graft chain is directly and chemically bonded to the surface of the support or the surface layer of the support, but the graft portion exhibiting hydrophilicity is substantially not crosslinked. According to the structure, the mobility of the graft portion exhibiting hydrophilicity is not restricted, and the graft portion is not hidden in the firm crosslinked structure, so as to maintain high mobility. It is considered therefore that excellent hydrophilicity is exhibited in comparison to an ordinary hydrophilic polymer having a crosslinked structure.","The hydrophilic graft chain generally has a weight average molecular weight Mw of from 500 to 5,000,000, preferably from 1,000 to 1,000,000, and more preferably from 2,000 to 500,000.","In the visible image receiving material of the invention, (a) an embodiment where the hydrophilic graft chain is bonded directly to the surface of the support or to an intermediate layer provided on the surface of the support is referred to as \u201csurface graft\u201d, and (b) an embodiment where the hydrophilic graft chain is introduced into the polymer crosslinked structure is referred to as a \u201chydrophilic graft chain-containing crosslinked hydrophilic layer\u201d. In the invention, the support and an assembly containing the support having the intermediate layer provided thereon are referred to as a \u201csubstrate material\u201d.","1-1-1. (a) Production Method of Surface Graft","A method for producing the surface having a hydrophilic group contained in the graft chain on the substrate material includes two methods, i.e., a method of attaching the graft chain to the substrate material by a chemical bond, and a method of polymerizing a compound having a polymerizable double bond with the substrate material as the starting point to form the graft chain.","The method of attaching the graft chain to the substrate material by a chemical bond will be described.","In this method, a compound having a functional group capable of reacting with the substrate material at an end or a side chain of the graft chain is used, the functional group and a functional group on the surface of the substrate material are subjected to chemical reaction to conduct grafting. The functional group capable of reacting with the substrate material is not particularly limited as far as it can be reacted with the functional group on the surface of the substrate material, and examples thereof include a silane coupling group, such as alkoxysilane, an isocyanate group, an amino group, a hydroxyl group, a carboxyl group, a sulfonic acid group, a phosphoric acid group, an epoxy group, an allyl group, a methacryloyl group and an acryloyl group.

Furthermore, a polymer of a hydrophilic monomer used in the surface graft polymerization described later and a copolymer containing a hydrophilic monomer are usefully employed.","The method of polymerizing a compound having a polymerizable double bond with the substrate material as the starting point to form the graft chain is generally referred to as surface graft polymerization. In the surface graft polymerization method, an active species is formed on the surface of the substrate material by such a manner as irradiation of a plasma, irradiation of light and heating, and a compound having a polymerizable double bond arranged to be in contact with the substrate material is polymerized to be bonded to the substrate material.","As the surface graft polymerization method for carrying out the invention, any known method described in the literatures may be used.

An irradiation graft polymerization method using a radiation ray, such as a \u03b3 ray and an electron beam, is described in Kyuchaku Gijutu Binran (Manual for Adsorption Technique), published by NTS Co., Ltd., supervised by Takeuchi, on February of 1999, p. 203 and 695. As a specific procedure of the photo-graft polymerization method, those methods disclosed in JP-A Nos. 63-92658, 10-296895 and 11-119413 can be employed. In the plasma irradiation graft polymerization method and the radiation ray irradiation graft polymerization method, those methods disclosed in the foregoing literatures and Y. Ikeda, et al., vol. 19, p. 1804 (1986) can be applied.","More specifically, a surface of a polymer, such as PET, is treated with a plasma or an electron beam to generate a radical on the surface thereof, and a monomer having a hydrophilic functional group is then reacted with the active surface to obtain a graft surface layer, i.e., a surface layer having a hydrophilic group.","The photo-graft polymerization can be carried out in such a manner, in addition to those described in the foregoing literatures, that a photo-polymerizable composition is coated on a surface of a film substrate material, and the surface is then in contact with an aqueous radical polymerizable compound, followed by irradiation with light, as described in JP-A Nos. 53-17407 (Kansai Paint Co., Ltd.) and 2000-212313 (Dainippon Ink And Chemicals, Inc.).","The compound useful for forming the hydrophilic graft surface layer has a polymerizable double bond and also necessarily has a nature of hydrophilicity. As the compound, any compound including a hydrophilic polymer, a hydrophilic oligomer and a hydrophilic monomer may be used as far as the compound has a double bond in the molecule thereof. A particularly useful compound is a hydrophilic monomer.","Examples of the hydrophilic monomer useful in the visible image receiving material of the invention include a monomer having a positive charge, such as ammonium and phosphonium, and a monomer having a negative charge or a monomer capable of being dissociated to a negative charge, such as a sulfonic acid group, a carboxyl group, a phosphoric acid group and a phosphonic acid group, and in addition thereto, a hydrophilic monomer having a nonionic group, such as a hydroxyl group, an amide group, a sulfonamide group, an alkoxy group and a cyano group, may also be used.","In the visible image receiving material of the invention, specific examples of the useful hydrophilic monomer include (meth)acrylic acid and an alkali metal salt or an amine salt thereof, itaconic acid and an alkali metal salt or an amine salt thereof, allylamine and a hydrogen halide acid salt thereof, 3-vinylpropionic acid and an alkali metal salt or an amine salt thereof, vinylsulfonic acid and an alkali metal salt or an amine salt thereof, styrenesulfonic acid and an alkali metal salt or an amine salt thereof, 2-sulfoethylene (meth)acrylate, 3-sulfopropylene (meth)acrylate and an alkali metal salt or an amine salt thereof, 2-acrylamide-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid and an alkali metal salt or an amine salt thereof, acid phosphoxypolyoxyethylene glycol mono(meth)acrylate and a salt thereof, 2-dimethylaminoethyl (meth)acrylate and a hydrogen halide acid salt thereof, 3-trimethylammoniumpropyl (meth)acrylate, 3-trimethylammoniumpropyl (meth)acrylamide and N,N,N-trimethyl-N-(2-hydroxy-3-methacryloyloxypropyl)ammonium chloride.

As the polymerization initiator used herein, for example, thermal polymerization initiators and photopolymerization initiators, which have been known in the art, capable of exhibiting a polymerization initiating function upon irradiation of activation light, heating or irradiation of an electron beam can be used after appropriate selection. Among these, photopolymerization, which shows a larger reaction rate (polymerization rate) than thermal polymerization, is preferred from the standpoint of production suitability, and thus a photopolymerization initiator is preferably used.","The photopolymerization initiator used in the surface graft polymerization method by application of energy is not particularly limited as far as it is active to irradiated activation light, and can polymerize the polymerizable compound contained in the intermediate layer and the hydrophilic compound having a polymerizable group at an end or a side chain contained in the upper layer, and examples thereof include a radical polymerization initiator, an anionic polymerization initiator and a cationic polymerization initiator.","Specific examples of the photopolymerization initiators include acetophenones, such as p-tert-butyltrichloroacetophenone, 2,2\u2032-diethoxyacetophenone and 2-hydroxy-2-methyl-1-phenylpropan-1-one; ketones, such as benzophenone, 4,4\u2032-bisdimethylaminobenzophenone, 2-chlorothioxanthone, 2-methylthioxanthone, 2-ethylthioxanthone and 2-isopropylthioxanthone; a benzoin ethers, such as benzoin, benzoin methyl ether, benzoin isopropyl ether and benzoin isobutyl ether; and benzylketals, such as benzyldimethylketal and hydroxycyclohexylphenyl ketone.","The amount of the polymerization initiator in the intermediate layer is preferably in a range of from 0.01 to 20% by mass, and more preferably in a range of from 0.1 to 10% by mass, in terms of solid content.","A solvent used upon coating the polymerizable compound and the polymerization initiator is not particularly limited as far as it can dissolve these components. Solvents having a not too high boiling point are preferred from the standpoint of easiness of drying and workability, and those having a boiling point of about from 40 to 150\u00b0 C. can be selected.","Specific examples thereof include acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, cyclohexane, ethyl acetate, tetrahydrofuran, toluene, ethylene glycol monomethyl ether, ethylene glycol monoethyl ether, ethylene glycol dimethyl ether, propylene glycol monomethyl ether, propylene glycol monoethyl ether, acetylacetone, cyclohexanone, methanol, ethanol, 1-methoxy-2-propanol, 3-methoxypropanol, diethylene glycol monomethyl ether, diethylene glycol monoethyl ether, diethylene glycol dimethyl ether, diethylene glycol diethyl ether, propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate, propylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate and 3-methoxypropyl acetate.","These solvents may be used solely or after mixing. The concentration of the solid contents in the coating composition is suitably from 2 to 50% by mass.","The coating amount for forming the intermediate layer on the support is preferably from 0.001 to 20 g\/m, and more preferably from 0.1 to 10 g\/m, in terms of the mass after drying. When the coating amount is less than 0.001 g\/m, the sufficient polymerization initiating function cannot be exhibited to cause insufficient grafting of the hydrophilic compound, and thus there is a possibility to fail to obtain the desired hydrophilicity. When the coating amount exceeds 20 g\/m, there is a tendency of deteriorating the film property to cause film peeling. Thus, both the cases are not preferred.","As described in the foregoing, the intermediate layer is formed in such a manner that the composition for forming the intermediate layer is arranged on the surface of the support, for example, by coating, and then the solvent is removed to form a film. At this time, the film is preferably hardened by heating and\/or irradiating light. In particular, when the film is dried by heat and then preliminarily hardened by irradiation of light, it is preferred since the hardening of the polymerizable compound is previously carried out to a certain extent, whereby such a phenomenon can be effectively prevented that the intermediate layer itself is peeled off after attaining graft of the hydrophilic compound. The reason why irradiation of light is used for the preliminary hardening is the same as having been described for the photopolymerization initiator.","The conditions of the heating temperature and the heating time can be selected in such a manner that the coating solvent is sufficiently dried. It is preferred from the standpoint of production suitability that the drying temperature is 100\u00b0 C. or less, and the drying time is 30 minutes or less, and it is more preferred that the drying temperature is from 40 to 80\u00b0 C., and the drying time is 10 minutes or less.","Upon irradiation of light to be carried out after the heat drying, a light source used for forming the image receiving layer described later can be used. It is preferred that the irradiation of light is carried out to such an extent that the polymerizable compound present in the intermediate layer is partly radically polymerized but is not completely polymerized, from the standpoint of the formation of the image receiving layer and prevention of inhibition of the formation of the bond between the active point of the intermediate layer and the graft chain formed by application of energy. The time of the irradiation of light is preferably 30 minutes or less while it varies depending on the intensity of the light source. As a target of the preliminary hardening, for example, the film remaining ratio after solvent washing is 10% or more, and the initiator remaining ratio after the preliminary hardening is 1% or more.","(Application of Energy)","The method for applying energy upon bonding the surface graft to the intermediate layer or the support is not particularly limited as far as the method can form an active point on the surface of the substrate material, and can apply energy capable of forming a bond to the hydrophilic compound having a polymerizable group, and a method of irradiating activation light is preferred from the standpoint of simplicity of the apparatus.","Examples of the method for applying energy used for forming the hydrophilic surface in the invention include a method of heating the whole surface and a method using irradiation of a radiation ray, such as whole surface irradiation. Preferred exposure and heating conditions for applying energy to the whole surface can be appropriately selected by taking such a target into consideration that the polymerization function of the compound exhibiting the polymerization function contained in the intermediate layer is exhibited to activate the initiator.","Specific examples of the exposure and heating measure include irradiation of light, such as those using an infrared laser, an ultraviolet ray lamp and visible light, irradiation of an electron beam, such as \u03b3 ray, and application of heat energy, such as utilization of a thermal head, a heat roll and a heating zone using a non-contact heater or hot air. Examples of the light source therefor include a mercury lamp, a metal halide lamp, a xenon lamp, a chemical lamp and a carbon arc lamp. Examples of the radiation ray include, an electron beam, X ray, an ion beam and a far infrared ray. Furthermore, a g-line, an i-line, deep UV light and a high density energy beam (laser beam) may also be used.","Examples of the laser used for laser exposure include a gas laser, such as a carbon dioxide laser, a nitrogen laser, an Ar laser, a He\/Ne laser, a He\/Cd laser and a Kr laser, a liquid (dye) laser, a sold laser, such as a ruby laser and a Nd\/YAG laser, a semiconductor laser, such as a GaAs\/GaAlAs laser and an InGaAs laser, and an excimer laser, such as a KrF laser, a XeCl laser, a XeF laser and an Arlaser. Among these, a semiconductor laser and a solid high output infrared laser, such as a YAG laser, emitting an infrared ray having a wavelength of from 700 to 1,200 nm are preferably used.","Preferred examples of specific embodiments generally employed include direct or indirect heating on the whole surface with a heating apparatus, scanning exposure with an infrared laser, and exposure on the whole surface with a high illuminance flash exposure, such as a xenon discharge lamp, and exposure with an infrared lamp.","In the case where the exposure is carried out with activation light, an ultraviolet ray and visible light are preferred, and exposure with an ultraviolet ray is particularly preferred from the standpoint that it is excellent in polymerization rate. The principal wavelength of the activation light is preferably from 250 to 800 nm.","Examples of the light source used for irradiation of an ultraviolet ray include a low pressure mercury lamp, a high pressure mercury lamp, a fluorescent lamp, a xenon lamp, a carbon arc lamp, a tungsten incandescent lamp and sunlight.","The necessary period of time for irradiation of light is generally from several seconds to 24 hours while it varies depending on the objective degree of hydrophilicity and the light source used.","According to the foregoing manner, the active point generated on the surface of the substrate material by application of energy on the whole surface of the substrate is polymerized with the hydrophilic compound having a polymerizable group to obtain a visible image receiving material having an image receiving layer containing a hydrophilic graft chain having high mobility. In a preferred embodiment, a hydrophilic compound having a polymerizable group on a side chain thereof is added, whereby the hydrophilic graft chain is bonded to the polymerizable group on the side chain of the graft chain bonded to the surface of the substrate material to form a graft chain having a branched structure. Thus, the hydrophilic graft having high mobility is exponentially improved in formation density and mobility, and therefore, higher hydrophilicity is exhibited.","1-1-2. (b) Production Process of Hydrophilic Graft Chain-containing Crosslinked Hydrophilic Layer","The hydrophilic graft chain-containing crosslinked hydrophilic layer used in the visible image receiving material of the invention can be produced in such a manner that a graft chain is produced by using a method that is generally known as a synthesis method for a graft polymer, and the graft chain is crosslinked. Specific examples of the method are disclosed in \u201cGraft Jugo to sono Oyo\u201d (Graft Polymerization and Its Applications\u201d, by Fumio Ide, published by Kobunshi Kankokai Co., Ltd. (1977) and \u201cShin Kobunshi Jikken-gaku\u201d (New Polymer Experimentation) 2, Synthesis and Reaction of Polymers, edited by Society of Polymer Science, Japan, published by Kyoritsu Shuppan Co., Ltd. (1995).","The synthesis of the graft polymer is basically classified into the following three methods, i.e., (1) a branch monomer is polymerized from a stem polymer, (2) a branch polymer is bonded to a stem polymer, and (3) a branch polymer is copolymerized with a stem polymer (macromer method). The hydrophilic surface (image receiving layer) in the invention can be produced by any of the three methods, and among these, the macromer method (3) is particularly useful from the standpoint of production suitability and control of the film structure. The synthesis of the graft chain by using a macromer is disclosed in \u201cShin Kobunshi Jikken-gaku\u201d (New Polymer Experimentation) 2, Synthesis and Reaction of Polymers, edited by Society of Polymer Science, Japan, published by Kyoritsu Shuppan Co., Ltd. (1995) and also disclosed in detail in \u201cMacromonomer no Kagaku to Kogyo\u201d (Chemistry and Industry of Macromonomers), by Yuya Yamashita, published by IPC, Ltd. (1989).","Specifically, the hydrophilic macromer can be synthesized by using the hydrophilic monomer described for the organic crosslinked hydrophilic layer, such as acrylic acid, acrylamide, 2-acrylamide-2-methylpropane sulfonate and N-vinylacetamide, according to the method disclosed in the literatures.","Particularly useful examples of the hydrophilic macromer used in the visible image receiving material of the invention include macromer derived from a monomer containing a carboxyl group, such as acrylic acid and methacrylic acid; a sulfonate-based macromer derived from a monomer, such as 2-acrylamide-2-methylpropane sulfonate and styrenesulfonic acid and salts thereof; an amide-based macromer derived from a monomer, such as acrylamide, and methacryl amide; an amide-based macromer derived from a N-vinyl carboxylic acid amide monomer, such as N-vinylacetamide and N-vinylformamide; a macromer derived from a monomer containing a hydroxyl group, such as hydroxyethyl methacrylate, hydroxyethyl acrylate and glycerol monomethacrylate; and a macromer derived from a monomer containing an alkoxy group or an ethylene oxide group, such as methoxyethyl acrylate, methoxypolyethylene glycol acrylate and polyethylene glycol acrylate. A monomer having a polyethylene glycol chain or a polypropylene glycol chain can also be usefully used as the macromer of the invention.","The useful molecular weight of the macromer is generally in a range of from 400 to 100,000, preferably in a range of from 1,000 to 50,000, and particularly preferably from 1,500 to 20,000. A molecular weight of less than 400 cannot exhibit the effect, and a molecular weight exceeding 100,000 deteriorates the polymerization property to the copolymerization monomer constituting the stem chain.","After synthesizing the hydrophilic macromer, the hydrophilic graft chain-containing crosslinked hydrophilic layer is produced, for example, by the following method. The hydrophilic macromer is copolymerized with another monomer having a reactive functional group to synthesize a graft copolymer, and then the graft copolymer thus synthesized and a crosslinking agent capable of reacting with the reactive functional group of the copolymer are coated on the support, followed by crosslinking them through reaction with heat. In another example of the method, a graft polymer having a photocrosslinkable group or a polymerizable group is synthesized, and the hydrophilic macromer and the graft polymer are coated on the support, followed by crosslinking them through reaction with irradiation with light.","Consequently, the image receiving layer having the hydrophilic graft chain can be provided on the substrate material. The thickness of the image receiving layer can be appropriately selected depending on the purposes, and in general, it is preferably in a range of from 0.001 to 10 \u03bcm, more preferably in a range of from 0.01 to 5 \u03bcm, and particularly preferably in a range of from 0.1 to 2 \u03bcm. Preferred ink receiving property and preferred ink fixing property can be obtained in the foregoing thickness range.","In the case where the hydrophilicity of the surface of the substrate material is high, it is not necessary that the whole surface of the substrate material is completely covered with the graft chain. In the case where the graft chain is introduced to the surface of the known hydrophilic substrate material, the effective hydrophilicity and ink receiving property can be exhibited by introducing the graft chain to only 0.1% or more of per the total surface area. The graft chain is more preferably introduced to 1% or more, and particularly preferably 10% or more, per the total surface area.","In another embodiment of the production of the hydrophilic surface (image receiving layer) in the visible image receiving material of the invention, the hydrophilic surface (image receiving layer) that can be applied to the visible image receiving material of the invention can be obtained in the following manner. A polymer compound including a functional group that changes the hydrophobic nature thereof to hydrophilicity by application of energy, such as heat and irradiation of a radiation ray, is provided on the support by the surface graft method described in the foregoing, and the whole surface of the support is then subjected to application of energy. This hydrophilic member can be applied to the image receiving layer of the invention and is disclosed in detail in Japanese Patent Application No. 2001-355074, which is made by the inventors and incorporated herein by reference.","1-2. Support","The support used in the visible image receiving material of the invention is a support having such a surface that the end or the side chain of the hydrophilic compound having the polymerizable group can be chemically bonded thereto directly or through the stem polymer compound. The support itself may have such characteristics, or in alternative, the intermediate layer having such characteristics may be provided on the support (substrate).","1-2-1. Support Substrate","The support substrate used in the visible image receiving material of the invention is not particularly limited and can be appropriately selected from the known materials depending on purposes.

In the invention, the supports disclosed in JP-A No. 62-253159, pages (29) to (31) can also be used in addition to the foregoing supports. The thickness of the support is not particularly limited and can be appropriately selected depending on purposes, and it is generally about from 50 to 300 \u03bcm, and preferably from 100 to 200 \u03bcm.","In the case where a metallic sheet is used as the support, the metallic sheet (such as an aluminum plate) may be subjected to the known surface treatment, such as a surface roughening treatment and an anodic oxidation treatment, depending on necessity.","In the case where a plastic film, such as a polyester film, is used, it is preferred to use those having been subjected to a surface roughening treatment from the standpoint of formability and adhesion property of the image receiving layer.","In the case where a support having a roughened surface is used, the surface property thereof preferably satisfies the following conditions.","As preferred conditions of the support having a roughened surface, in the parameters of tow-dimensional roughness, the center line average roughness (Ra) is from 0.1 to 1 \u03bcm, the maximum height (Ry) is from 1 to 10 \u03bcm, the ten-point average roughness (Rz) is from 1 to 10 \u03bcm, the average interval of irregularity (Sm) is from 5 to 80 \u03bcm, the average interval of local peaks (S) is from 5 to 80 \u03bcm, the maximum height (Rt) is from 1 to 10 \u03bcm, the center line peak height (Rp) is from 1 to 10 \u03bcm, and the center line groove depth (Rv) is from 1 to 10 \u03bcm.

Member Having Surface Hydrophilicity","The member having hydrophilicity in the conductive pattern material of the invention is a member containing a support having at an entirety of at least one surface thereof a hydrophilic graft chain. That is, in the invention, the hydrophilic graft chain is present on the whole surface of the support on the side where hydrophilicity is demanded, and thus the surface exhibits uniform hydrophilicity. In the case where the requirement is satisfied, the hydrophilic graft chain may be directly bonded to the surface of the support, or in alternative, an intermediate layer, to which the graft chain can be easily bonded, is provided on the surface of the support, and then a hydrophilic compound is grafted on the intermediate layer.","Further examples of the member having surface hydrophilicity include a member obtained in such a manner that a polymer formed by bonding the hydrophilic graft chain to a stem polymer compound or a polymer obtained by bonding the hydrophilic graft chain to a stem polymer and introducing a crosslinkable functional group thereto is arranged on the surface of the support by coating or by coating and crosslinking, and a member obtained in such a manner that a composition containing the hydrophilic graft chain having a crosslinking group at an end thereof and a crosslinking agent is arranged on the surface of the support by coating or by coating and crosslinking.","In the following description of the conductive pattern material, the surface having the hydrophilic graft chain is sometimes referred to as a \u201chydrophilic surface\u201d.","The characteristic feature of the hydrophilic graft chain in the invention is such a structure that the end of the graft chain is bonded to the surface of the support or to the surface layer of the support, and the graft portion exhibiting hydrophilicity is substantially not crosslinked. Owing to the structure, the graft portion exhibiting hydrophilicity is not restricted in mobility and is not hidden in the firm crosslinked structure, so as to maintain high mobility. It is considered therefore that excellent hydrophilicity is exhibited in comparison to an ordinary hydrophilic polymer having a crosslinked structure.","The hydrophilic graft chain generally has a weight average molecular weight Mw of from 500 to 5,000,000, preferably from 1,000 to 1,000,000, and more preferably from 2,000 to 500,000.","In the conductive pattern material of the invention, (a) an embodiment where the hydrophilic graft polymer chain is bonded directly to the surface of the support or to an intermediate layer provided on the surface of the support is referred to as \u201csurface graft\u201d, and (b) an embodiment where the hydrophilic graft polymer chain is introduced into the polymer crosslinked structure is referred to as a \u201chydrophilic graft chain-containing crosslinked hydrophilic layer\u201d.

The fluid referred herein is not particularly limited as far as it has such fluidity that it can be discharged from an ink discharging nozzle of the ink-jet apparatus described later at an ordinary temperature (25\u00b0 C.). The fluid may be oily or aqueous, or in addition to being a solution, it can be a solid material such as fine particles, or a dispersion such as latex.","For example, in the case where electrodes are to be formed as in a TFT, such fluids can be used that is produced in such a manner that the known conductive polymer, such as polyethylene dioxythiophene (PEDOT), is dissolved in a solvent to form a fluid, conductive fine particles described later are uniformly dispersed in a suitable dispersing medium, a binder is also dissolved simultaneously with the conductive fine particles, or latex is further mixed thereto.","\u2014Conductive Fine Particles\u2014","The conductive fine particles used in the invention are not particularly limited as far as they have conductivity and can be arbitrarily selected from fine particles of the known conductive materials. Examples thereof include metallic fine particles, such as Au, Ag, Pt, Cu, Rh, Pd, Al and Cr, oxide semiconductor fine particles, such as InO, SnO, ZnO, CdO, TiO, CdInO, CdSnO, ZnSnOand InO\u2014ZnO, fine particles of these material doped with an impurity that is suitable to these materials, spinel compound fine particles, such as MgInO and CaGaO, conductive nitride fine particles, such as TiN, ZrH and HfN, conductive boride fine particles, such as LaB, and conductive polymer fine particles as an organic material.","\u2014Relationship between Polarity of Hydrophilic Surface and Conductive Fine Particles\u2014","In the case where the hydrophilic surface obtained in the invention has an anionic group, such as a carboxyl group, a sulfone group or a phosphone group, the surface has a negative charge, on which conductive fine particles having a positive charge (i.e., cationic nature) are adsorbed to form a conductive region (wiring).","Examples of the conductive fine particles having a cationic nature include metallic (oxide) fine particles having a positive charge. Fine particles having a positive charge on the surface in a high density can be produced, for example, by the method disclosed in T. Yonezawa, 1999, p. 1061, T. Yonezawa, 2000, vol. 16, p. 5218, and T. Yonezawa, , Japan, vol. 49, p. 2911 (2000).

When the particle diameter is less than 0.1 nm, there is such a tendency that conductivity given by continuous contact of the surfaces of the fine particles is lowered. When it exceeds 1,000 nm, the adhesion strength between the hydrophilic surface and the particles is lowered, and there is such a tendency that the strength of the conductive region is deteriorated.","The conductive fine particles are preferably adsorbed in the maximum adsorption amount capable of being adsorbed on the hydrophilic group of the hydrophilic surface. The dispersion concentration in the dispersion containing the conductive fine particles is preferably about from 0.001 to 20% by mass from the standpoint of securement of conductivity.","The conductive fine particles may be used in combination of two or more kinds thereof in addition to the sole use. Furthermore, in order to obtain the prescribed conductivity, plural materials can be previously mixed and then used.","The using amount of the conductive fine particles can be appropriately selected. Because they are introduced in the substantially monomolecular form to the hydrophilic surface through ionic adsorption, they can exhibit sufficient conductivity only with a small amount in comparison to the using amount of a conductive material used in the ordinary conductive pattern material. Furthermore, such a conductive region having high sharpness can be formed that can be applied to a minute circuit.","\u2014Ink-jet Recording Apparatus\u2014","An ink-jet recording apparatus that is preferably used for forming the conductive material layer in the invention will be described.","In the ink-jet recording apparatus, pattern information of an image to be formed on a substrate is supplied to the ink-jet recording apparatus from an information supplying source, such as a computer, through a transmission means, such as a bus.","As the ink-jet recording apparatus, those having an ink-jet recording head capable of discharging droplets of the fluid and a control system capable of driving the recording head according to an arbitrary pattern can be used. By using the apparatus, droplets of the fluid are discharged to a prescribed position on the member having surface hydrophilicity from a nozzle hole (spout) of the ink-jet recording head driven according the pattern information, and thus the fluid is attached according to the pattern information.","The ink-jet recording head equipped in the ink-jet recording apparatus has a cavity constituted as being capable of containing the fluid charged therein, and a voltage according to an arbitrary pattern is applied to a piezoelectric element, which can induce volume change in the cavity, to change the volume of the cavity, whereby the fluid charged therein is discharged from the spout in a minute droplet form, and thus is locally supplied and absorbed to the image receiving layer, followed by removing a solvent and a dispersing agent from the fluid, so as to form a conductive pattern.","<(2) Embodiment of Forming Conductive Material to Film by Known Film Forming Method using Mask Pattern>","The embodiment (2) that is preferably used for forming the conductive material layer in the invention will be described.","In the case where the embodiment (2) is used as the forming method of the conductive material layer in the invention, the known methods that have been used for forming a film of a conductive material can be used as the method for forming the conductive material layer.

At this time, in the case where the region, to which heat, an acid, or irradiation of a radiation ray is applied, exhibits hydrophilicity, the hydrophobic layer maintains the original surface condition and remains as a hydrophobic region in the region, to which heat, an acid, or irradiation of a radiation ray is not applied. In the case where the region, to which heat, an acid, or irradiation of a radiation ray is applied, becomes a hydrophobic region, the hydrophilic layer maintains the original surface condition and remains as a hydrophilic region in the region, to which heat, an acid, or irradiation of a radiation ray is not applied.","The local formation of a hydrophilic\/hydrophobic region is carried out by irradiation of a radiation ray, such as light, or by heating. In the case of an embodiment using the light-to-heat converting substance is used in combination as one embodiment of light irradiation, a hydrophilic\/hydrophobic region can be formed by heating by scanning exposure with laser light in the infrared region.","Examples of the method for forming a hydrophilic\/hydrophobic region include a method of writing with heating or irradiation of a radiation ray, such as exposure. For example, light irradiation with an infrared laser, an ultraviolet ray lamp or visible light, electron beam irradiation, such as \u03b3-ray, and thermal recordation with a thermal head can be carried out. Examples of the light source therefor include a mercury lamp, a metallic halide lamp, a xenon lamp, a chemical lamp and a carbon arc lamp. Examples of the radiation ray include an electron beam, X-ray, an ion beam and a far infrared ray. A high energy beam (laser beam) is also used.","Preferred examples of a specific embodiment that is generally employed include direct local recordation with a thermal recording head, scanning exposure with an infrared laser, high illuminance flash exposure, for example, with a xenon discharge lamp, and exposure with an infrared ray lamp.","In order to carry out direct pattern formation with digital data from a computer, a method of carrying out polarity conversion with laser exposure is preferred.

Among these, the method of reacting a functional group of the hydrophilic compound with a monomer having an ethylenic addition-polymerizable unsaturated group is particularly preferred from the standpoint of synthesis suitability.","Examples of the hydrophilic monomer used for synthesizing the hydrophilic compound having a radically polymerizable group at an end of the main chain and\/or a side chain include a monomer having a hydrophilic group, e.g., a carboxyl group, a sulfone group, a phosphoric acid group, an amino group, a salt of them, a hydroxyl group, an amide group and an ether group, such as (meth)acrylic acid and an alkali metal salt or an amine salt thereof, itaconic acid and an alkali metal salt or an amine salt thereof, 2-hydroxyethyl (meth)acrylate, (meth)acrylamide, N-monomethylol (meth)acrylamide, N-dimethylol (meth)acrylamide, acrylic amine and a hydrogen halide salt thereof, 3-vinylpropionic acid and an alkali metal salt or an amine salt thereof, vinylsulfonic acid and an alkali metal salt or an amine salt thereof, 2-sulfoethyl (meth)acrylate, polyoxyethylene glycol (meth)acrylate, 2-acrylamide-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid and acid phosphoxypolyoxyethylene glycol mono(meth)acrylate.","Examples of the allyl group-containing monomer to be copolymerized with the hydrophilic monomer include ally (meth)acrylate and 2-allyloxyethyl methacrylate.","Examples of the monomer having a double bond precursor include 2-(3-chloro-1-oxopropoxy)ethyl methacrylate.","Examples of the monomer having a addition-polymerizable unsaturated group used for introducing an unsaturated group by utilizing reaction with the functional group, such as a carboxyl group, an amino group, a salt thereof, a hydroxyl group and an epoxy group, in the hydrophilic monomer include (meth)acrylic acid, glycidyl (meth)acrylate, allyl glycidyl ether and 2-isocyanatoethyl (meth)acrylate.","Preferred examples of the hydrophilic compound having a polymerizable group at an end and\/or a side chain include a hydrophilic macromonomer.

The polymerization ratio can be increased by adding a hydrophilic monomer.","The addition amount of the hydrophilic monomer is preferably from 0 to 60% by mass in terms of solid content based on the total hydrophilic compound having a polymerizable group. When the amount exceeds 60% by weigh, it is not suitable because the coating property is deteriorated to fail to carry out uniform coating.","Examples of the hydrophilic monomer that is useful for using in combination with the hydrophilic compound having a polymerizable group at an end and\/or a side chain thereof include a monomer having a positive charge, such as ammonium and phosphonium, and a monomer having a negative charge or an acidic group capable of being dissociated to a negative charge, such as a sulfonic acid group, a carboxylic acid group, a phosphoric acid group and a phosphonic acid group. Among these, a hydrophilic monomer having a nonionic group, such as a hydroxyl group, an amide group, a sulfonamide group, an alkoxy group and a cyano group, may also be used.","Specific examples of the hydrophilic monomer that is particularly useful for using in combination with the hydrophilic macromonomer in the embodiment include the following monomers.","Examples of the hydrophilic monomer include (meth)acrylic acid and an alkali metal salt or an amine salt thereof, itaconic acid and an alkali metal salt or an amine salt thereof, allylamine and a hydrogen halide acid salt thereof, 3-vinylpropionic acid and an alkali metal salt or an amine salt thereof, vinylsulfonic acid and an alkali metal salt or an amine salt thereof, styrenesulfonic acid and an alkali metal salt or an amine salt thereof, 2-sulfoethylene (meth)acrylate, 3-sulfopropylene (meth)acrylate and an alkali metal salt or an amine salt thereof, 2-acrylamide-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid and an alkali metal salt or an amine salt thereof, acid phosphoxypolyoxyethylene glycol mono(meth)acrylate and a salt thereof, 2-dimethylaminoethyl (meth)acrylate and a hydrogen halide acid salt thereof, 3-trimethylammoniumpropyl (meth)acrylate, 3-trimethylammoniumpropyl (meth)acrylamide and N,N,N-trimethyl-N-(2-hydroxy-3-methacryloyloxypropyl)ammonium chloride.","Furthermore, 2-hydroxyethyl (meth)acrylate, (meth)acrylamide, N-monomethylol (meth)acrylamide, N-dimethylol (meth)acrylamide, N-vinylpyrrolidone, N-vinylacetamide, polyoxyethylene glycol mono(meth)acrylate, a monomer having an amino acid skeleton in the molecule, such as N-methacryloyloxyethylcarbamic acid aspartic acid, and a monomer having a sugar skeleton in the molecule, such as glycoxyethyl methacrylate are also useful.","A solvent used in a composition containing the hydrophilic compound is not particularly limited as far as the hydrophilic macromonomer and the hydrophilic monomer as the main components can be dissolved therein, and an aqueous solvent, such as water and a water soluble solvent, is preferably used.

In the case where the coating amount is less than 0.1 g\/m, there are some cases where sufficient hydrophilicity cannot be obtained, whereas when it exceeds 10 g\/m, a uniform coating film is difficult to be obtained, and thus both the cases are not preferred.","3D-1-2. Formation of Hydrophilic\/Hydrophobic Region","In the embodiment, the surface having been in contact with the hydrophilic compound having a polymerizable group can be locally irradiated with a radiation ray to form a hydrophilic\/hydrophobic region. In other words, a hydrophilic region can be formed on the first electrode.","In the embodiment, the method for applying energy for forming a hydrophilic region is not particularly limited as far as the method can form an active point on the substrate material, and can apply energy capable of forming a bond between the active point and the hydrophilic compound having a polymerizable group, and a method of irradiating activation light is preferred from the standpoint of simplicity of the cost and the apparatus.","In the case where irradiation with activation light is applied to the local exposure, both scanning exposure based on digital data and pattern exposure using a lith film can be used.","As the method used for the pattern formation, the writing methods exemplified for the third embodiment can be preferably applied to this embodiment.","As a result of the application of energy, the active point generated on the substrate material is polymerized with the hydrophilic compound having a polymerizable group to form a surface having a hydrophilic graft chain having high mobility. In a preferred embodiment, a hydrophilic compound having a polymerizable group at an end and a side chain thereof is added, whereby the hydrophilic graft chain is bonded to the polymerizable group on the side chain of the graft chain bonded to the surface of the substrate material to form a graft chain having a branched structure. Thus, the hydrophilic graft having high mobility is exponentially improved in formation density and mobility, and therefore, higher hydrophilicity is exhibited.","3D-2. Substrate and Electrode","The substrate and the first and second electrodes in the embodiment are appropriately selected from the constitution of the organic EL element. Specifically, the same materials as in the substrate and the first and the second electrode exemplified in \u201c3A-2. Substrate and Electrode\u201d can be exemplified.","The surface of the substrate material (i.e., the substrate having at least the first electrode provided thereon) in the embodiment is not limited as far as it has such characteristics that are suitable for providing the surface graft through graft synthesis. In the embodiment, in view of effective generation of the active point and improvement in the sensitivity of the hydrophilic region formation, it is particularly preferred to form a layer having a polymerizable compound and a polymerization initiator added thereto as a compound exhibiting a polymerization initiating function through application of energy to the surface of the substrate material, i.e., to form a layer exhibiting a polymerization initiating function.","3D-2-1. Layer Exhibiting Polymerization Initiating Function","The layer exhibiting a polymerization initiating function (hereinafter, also referred to as a \u201cpolymerizable layer\u201d) can be formed in such a manner that the necessary components are dissolved in a solvent capable of dissolving the components and provided on the surface of the substrate material by coating, and the coated film is then hardened by heating or irradiation of light.","Details of the polymerizable compound and the polymerization initiator contained in the polymerizable layer, and the solvent used upon coating may be the same as those described in \u201c1-1-1. (a) Production Method of Surface Graft\u201d.","The coating amount in the case where the polymerizable layer is formed on the substrate material is preferably from 0.1 to 20 g\/m, and more preferably from 1 to 15 g\/m, in terms of weight after drying. When the coating amount is less than 0.1 g\/m, the sufficient polymerization initiating function cannot be exhibited to make grafting of the hydrophilic compound insufficient, and thus there is a possibility that the desired hydrophilicity cannot be obtained. When the coating amount exceeds 20 g\/m, there is such a tendency that the film property is deteriorated, and the film is liable to be peeled off. Therefore, both the cases are not preferred.","In the embodiment, the composition for forming the polymerizable layer is arranged on the surface of the substrate material, for example, by coating, and the solvent is removed to effect film formation, whereby the polymerizable layer is formed. At this time, it is preferred that the film is hardened by carrying out heating and\/or irradiation of light. In particular, when the film is dried by heat and then preliminarily hardened by irradiation of light, it is preferred since the hardening of the polymerizable compound is previously carried out to a certain extent, whereby such a phenomenon can be effectively prevented that the polymerizable layer itself is peeled off after attaining graft of the hydrophilic compound. The reason why irradiation of light is used for the preliminary hardening is the same as having been described for the photopolymerization initiator.","The conditions of the heating temperature and the heating time can be selected in such a manner that the coating solvent is sufficiently dried. It is preferred from the standpoint of production suitability that the drying temperature is 100\u00b0 C. or less, and the drying time is 30 minutes or less, and it is more preferred that the drying temperature is from 40 to 80\u00b0 C., and the drying time is 10 minutes or less.","Upon irradiation of light to be carried out after the heat drying, a light source used for forming a hydrophilic\/hydrophobic region can be used. It is preferred that the irradiation of light is carried out to such an extent that the polymerizable compound present in the polymerizable layer is partly radically polymerized but is not completely polymerized, from the standpoint of the formation of the hydrophilic layer and prevention of inhibition of the formation of the bond between the active point of the polymerizable layer and the graft chain formed by application of energy. The time of the irradiation of light is preferably 30 minutes or less while it varies depending on the intensity of the light source. As a target of the preliminary hardening, for example, the film remaining ratio after solvent washing is 10% or more, and the initiator remaining ratio after the preliminary hardening is 1% or more.","3D-3.
