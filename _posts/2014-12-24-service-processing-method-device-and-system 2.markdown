Currently, expansion of all those capabilities is concentrated on the BRAS or the BNG; however, because there will be more types of value-added services in the future, when each service is expanded, software upgrade and even hardware upgrade need to be performed on the BRAS or the BNG. Regardless of the software upgrade or the hardware upgrade, an operator needs to power off a BRAS or BNG device, and original services of users on the BRAS or the BNG are interrupted. Currently, the number of users that the BRAS or the BNG can support is very large, and if device power-off is performed, an influence range is very large, which greatly affects user experience.","Embodiments of the present invention provide a service processing method, device, and system, where service expansion can be performed without changing an original device of an operator.","To achieve the foregoing objective, the embodiments of the present invention use the following technical solutions:","A service processing method, including acquiring business service information corresponding to a to-be-processed service flow.

If a service atom processing capability notified by a new service processing device is received, a new entry is added into an existing distributed service routing table according to the service atom processing capability corresponding to the new service processing device and address information of the new service processing device. If a new service atom processing capability notified by an adjacent service router, a corresponding entry, in the distributed service routing table, of the adjacent service processing device is updated according to the new service atom processing capability. Optionally, if no service atom processing capability notified by the adjacent service processing device is received in a time, an entry that is corresponding to the adjacent service router and in the distributed service routing table may be deleted.","It should be noted that, for generating the distributed service routing table according to the locally configured service atom processing capability of the adjacent node, it is unnecessary for the service processing device to acquire a service atom processing capability of another service processing device by itself; instead, the distributed service routing table is generated according to a service atom processing capability, locally pre-configured in the service processing device, of an adjacent service processing device. The pre-configured service atom processing capability of the adjacent service processing device, for example, may be configured by network maintenance personnel or other personnel.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0144","num":"0143"},"b":["702","1","10"]},"The predetermined service route selection policy includes a longest prefix matching policy and an optimal service feature matching policy.","For example, the longest prefix matching policy may be understood as follows: If a service atom cluster corresponding to the to-be-processed service flow is ABCD, according to the distributed service routing table of Table 3, a service processing device corresponding to an output port 4 should be selected, because the service processing device corresponding to the output port 4 may process a service atom A; when a service atom cluster corresponding to the service flow is BCAD, according to content displayed in the distributed service routing table of Table 3, a service processing device corresponding to an output port 3 should be selected, because the service processing device corresponding to the output port 3 may process a service atom combination BC. Compared with a service processing device corresponding to an output port 2, a service atom C can further be consecutively processed.","For example, the optimal service feature matching policy may be understood as selecting a route with a lowest routing cost. For example, when the service atom cluster corresponding to the service flow is BCAD, according to the content displayed in the distributed service routing table of Table 3, a route whose output port is 3 should be selected; however, if a routing cost of the service processing device corresponding to the output port 3 is higher, for example, a transmission delay is larger, and in this case, a route that is corresponding to the output port 2 and whose routing cost is lower may be selected.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0148","num":"0147"},"b":["703","1"],"figref":"FIG. 10"},"Further, the first service processing device may further receive a second service flow sent by the adjacent service processing device, acquires a service label in the second service flow and decodes the service label into a corresponding service atom or service atom cluster, and processes the second service flow according to the corresponding service atom or service atom cluster.","Optionally, the second service processing device receives a service flow packet sent by the first service processing device, and the service flow packet carries a service label corresponding to the service flow; the second service processing device processes the service flow packet according to a registered service atom processing capability; and the second service processing device deletes a processed service atom from a service atom cluster corresponding to the service label, and then determines whether there is a remaining service atom in the service atom cluster. If it is determined that there is a remaining service atom, the service label in the service flow packet is replaced with a new service label from which the service atom is deleted, and an output port and a corresponding next-hop address are searched for in the distributed service routing table according to the new service label and optionally according to the predetermined service route selection policy; the second service processing device sends, by using the found output port, a service flow packet carrying the new service label to a third service processing device (such as the service processing device ) corresponding to the next-hop address, so that the third service processing device processes the service flow according to a service atom processing capability of the third service processing device. The deleting the processed service atom from the service atom cluster corresponding to the service label is, for example, when a service label of the service flow is ABCD, and the service processing device  processes a service atom A, deleting the service atom A in the service label ABCD, and generating a new service label BCD.","If it is determined that there is no remaining service atom, the second service processing device forwards the service flow packet out of the service routing network.","Two data processing manners provided in this embodiment may be applied in different network scenarios, which increases a usage scope of this embodiment of the present invention, and improves expansibility of a service.","According to the service processing method provided by this embodiment of the present invention, a service processing sequence is identified by using a service atom or a service atom cluster, and business service information corresponding to the service atom or the service atom cluster is generated, so that a service router and a service server adjacent to the service router process a to-be-processed service flow according to the business service information. In a service processing manner provided by this embodiment, development of a new service changes into recombination of existing service atoms or adding of a new service atom, so that an operator may proceed to process a service by still using an existing device, and therefore service expansion can be performed without changing an original device of the operator.","This embodiment of the present invention provides a service processing device , and the service processing device , for example, may be the controller in Embodiment 1.
