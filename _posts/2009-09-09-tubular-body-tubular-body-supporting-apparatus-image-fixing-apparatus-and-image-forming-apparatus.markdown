Technical Field","The present invention relates to a tubular body, a tubular body supporting apparatus, an image fixing apparatus, and an image forming apparatus.","2. Related Art","In an image forming apparatus such as a copy machine or a printer that uses an electrophotographic method, a photoreceptor (photoreceptor drum) formed into, for example, a drum is charged, and the photoreceptor drum is exposed to light controlled based on image information to form an electrostatic latent image on the photoreceptor drum. Then, the electrostatic latent image is converted into a visual image (toner image) with a toner, the toner image is transferred onto a recording paper via, for example, an intermediate transfer medium, and the transferred toner image is fixed by use of a fixing unit to form an image.","According to an aspect of the invention, there is provided a tubular body including:","a substrate including concave portions on a surface thereof;","a surface layer formed on the surface of the concave portion-including side of the substrate; and","a particle positioned at an interface between the substrate and the surface layer in each of the concave portions.","In what follows, an exemplary embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to the drawings. A member having same operation or function is represented by same reference mark through all drawings and a duplicated explanation will be omitted.","[Tubular Body]","(Endless Belt)","As one example of a tubular body according to the exemplary embodiment, an endless belt will be described.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 3","FIG. 4"]},"An endless belt  of the exemplary embodiment shown in  is, as shown in , an endless belt that has a substrate  having concave portions  on a surface, a surface layer  formed on the surface of the substrate  on the side thereof having the concave portions , and particles  positioned at an interface between the substrate  and the surface layer  in the concave portions .","In the endless belt , as shown in , plural concave portions  are formed on a surface (surface in contact with the surface layer ) of the substrate  and, on an inside surface of each of the concave portions , plural particles  are present in a state of being embedded. The surface layer  formed on a surface of the substrate  is formed, as shown in , so as to cover a surface of the substrate  and the particles  and fill the inside of each of the concave portions . Accordingly, the particles  are present inside of each of the concave portions  of the substrate  and in a state in contact with both of the substrate  and the surface layer  (that is, positioned at an interface between the substrate  and the surface layer ).","In the endless belt  of the exemplary embodiment, the concave portions  are present on a surface of the substrate , and the particles  are positioned at an interface between the substrate  and the surface layer  in each of the concave portions  on a surface of the substrate . Accordingly, owing to presence of the concave portions , an area of an interface between the substrate  and the surface layer  increases to be able to obtain an anchoring effect, and, owing to presence of the particles  on the inside surface of each of the concave portions , a surface area of the substrate  and the surface layer  further increases to enable to obtain a higher anchoring effect. As the result, adhesiveness between the substrate  and the surface layer  is improved to result in difficulty in peeling the surface layer  of the endless belt .","An average diameter of the concave portions  on a surface of the substrate  may be from 0.01 \u03bcm to 1,000 \u03bcm (or about 0.01 \u03bcm to about 1,000 \u03bcm), from 0.05 \u03bcm to 100 \u03bcm, or from 0.1 \u03bcm to 50 \u03bcm, from the viewpoint of improving adhesiveness between the substrate  and the surface layer . An average depth of the concave portions  may be from 0.01 \u03bcm to 500 \u03bcm, from 0.05 \u03bcm to 250 \u03bcm, or from 0.1 \u03bcm to 100 \u03bcm.","An average diameter and an average depth of the concave portions  are measured as shown below. Specifically, a cross section of the endless belt is cut out with a microtome, followed by observing the cross section with an electron microscope. Plural positions are observed and evaluated and thereby an average diameter and an average depth of the concave portions  are calculated.","Examples of a shape of the concave portion  include, for example, a hemisphere, a cylinder and an ellipse without particular restriction. However, a hemisphere or a cylinder may be selected from the viewpoint of developing an anchoring effect.","A number of the concave portions  present on a surface of the substrate  may be, per 1 mmof an area of the surface of the substrate , from 1 to 1,000 (or from about 1 to about 1,000), from 5 to 500, or from 10 to 100.","Surface roughness Ra of a surface of the substrate  that has plural concave portions  may be from 0.01 \u03bcm to 20 \u03bcm, from 0.05 \u03bcm to 10 \u03bcm, or from 0.1 \u03bcm to 5 \u03bcm.","The surface roughness of the substrate  is obtained by measuring a surface of the substrate , using a measurement sample obtained by sticking a sample piece of the substrate  to a flat glass substrate, by use of a surface roughness meter SURFCOM 570A (trade name, manufactured by Tosei Engineering Corp.). Examples of measurement condition include, for example, shape of stylus tip: \u03b8=90\u00b0 conical stylus, diameter of stylus tip: tip r (tip)=2 \u03bcm, and a scanning length: 10.0 mm.","When a surface of the substrate  in the endless belt  is observed and measured, an exposed surface of the substrate  obtained by removing a surface layer  from the endless belt  as shown below is observed and measured. Specifically, a belt end is gently scraped with a plastic chip to remove a surface layer to expose a surface of the substrate .","A volume average particle diameter of the particles  may be from 0.01 \u03bcm to 15 \u03bcm (or from about 0.01 \u03bcm to about 15 \u03bcm), from 0.05 \u03bcm to 10 \u03bcm, or from 0.1 \u03bcm to 8 \u03bcm, from the viewpoint of improving adhesiveness between the substrate  and the surface layer .","A volume average particle diameter of the particles  is measured and defined as shown below. That is, MULTISIZER II (trade name, manufactured by Beckmann-Coulter Inc., aperture diameter: 50 \u03bcm) is used for measurement, a particle size distribution of measured particles is drawn as a cumulative distribution of a volume of the respective particles with respect to divided particle size ranges (channels) from a smaller particle size side, and a particle size where the cumulation becomes 50% is defined as a volume average particle diameter.","When a volume average particle diameter of the particles  is 15 \u03bcm or less, flatness of a surface of the endless belt  (that is, a surface of the surface layer  that is not in contact with the substrate ) is inhibited from deteriorating owing to the particles . Furthermore, when a process of producing an endless belt  includes a step of spraying water in which the particles  are dispersed, since the volume average particle diameter of the particles  is 15 \u03bcm or less, the particles  are difficult to sediment in water; accordingly, a spray nozzle is difficult to being clogged during spraying. Furthermore, when the volume average particle diameter of the particles  is 0.01 \u03bcm or more, the particles  are inhibited from forming aggregated particles in water owing to too large surface area of the particles .","An average diameter of the concave portions  may be from 1 to 10,000 times (or from about 1 to about 10,000 times), from 2 to 1,000 times, or from 5 to 500 times the volume average particle diameter of the particles .","Examples of shape of the particles  include, for example, a sphere, an infinite form, a flake, a whisker, and a porous shape, without particularly restricting. Among these, when a shape of the particles  is a flake, a whisker or a porous shape, an increase in a surface area of the particles  causes an increase in a contact area with the substrate  or the surface layer , or charges tend to stay at apexes of the particles  to increase an electrostatic bonding action.","A number of particles  present at an inner surface of each of the concave portions  may be from 1 to 10,000 (or from about 1 to about 10,000), from 2 to 1,000, or from 5 to 500.","When the particles  are present at an inner surface of the concave portion , the particles  may be present at a position other than the concave portion  on a surface of the substrate .","A material of the particles  may be an inorganic compound or an organic compound without particularly restricting.","Examples of the inorganic compound include, for example, barium sulfate, zeolite, silicon oxide, tin oxide, copper oxide, iron oxide, zirconium oxide, titanium oxide, aluminum oxide, zinc oxide, nickel oxide, tin-doped indium oxide, silicon nitride, boron nitride, titanium nitride and silicon carbide.","As the organic compound, for example, a fluororesin is exemplified. Examples of the fluororesin include, for example, a tetrafluoroethylene polymer (hereinafter, referred to as PTFE), a tetrafluoroethylene\/perfluoroalkyl vinyl ether copolymer (hereinafter, referred to as PFA), a tetrafluoroethylene\/hexafluoropropylene copolymer (hereinafter, referred to as FEP), a tetrafluoroethylene\/ethylene copolymer (hereinafter, referred to as ETFE), polyvinylidene fluoride (hereinafter, referred to as PVDF), polychlorotrifluoroethylene (hereinafter, referred to as PCTFE) and mixtures thereof. More specific examples of the fluororesin include PTFE, PFA, FEP and mixtures thereof from the viewpoint of more excellent heat resistance.","A material of the particles  may be a material high in affinity with a material of the surface layer  from the viewpoint of an improvement in adhesiveness between the substrate  and the surface layer . For example, when a fluororesin is used as a material of the surface layer , a material of the particles  may also be a fluororesin.","In the endless belt  of the exemplary embodiment, the particles  are in a state of being embedded in the inner surface of the concave portion . However, without restricting thereto, the particles  may be in a state of being in contact with an inner surface of the concave portion .","Furthermore, the endless belt  of the exemplary embodiment has plural particles  in each of the concave portions . However, without restricting thereto, like an endless belt  shown in , one particle  may be in each of the concave portions . However, an endless belt  may have plural particles  in each of concave portions  because a surface area in which a surface layer  is in contact with a substrate  and particles  is larger to result in larger adhesiveness between the substrate  and the surface layer  and to prevent the surface layer  from being peeled.","In what follows, the respective members constituting an endless belt  will be described.","<Substrate >","When an endless belt  is used as a fixing belt of an image fixing apparatus, as a material used for the substrate , a heat resistant material may be used and, specifically, selected and used from known various plastic and metal materials.","Among the plastic materials, plastic materials generally called an engineering plastic may be used. Examples thereof include, for example, a fluororesin, polyimide (PI), polyamideimide (PAI), polybenzimidazole (PBI), polyether ether ketone (PEEK), polysulfone (PSU), polyether sulfone (PES), polyphenylene sulfide (PPS), polyetherimide (PEI), and wholly aromatic polyesters (liquid crystal polymers). Among these, thermosetting polyimide, thermoplastic polyimide, polyamideimide, polyetherimide and a fluororesin may be used from the viewpoint of excellent mechanical strength, heat resistance, wear resistance and chemical resistance.","A metallic material is not particularly restricted. Various metals and alloys may be used. Specific examples thereof include, for example, SUS, nickel, copper, aluminum and iron. Furthermore, the heat resistant resin or the metallic material may be plurally layered.","When an endless belt  is used as a fixing belt of an image fixing apparatus, a thickness of a substrate  is, for example, in the range of from 50 \u03bcm to 150 \u03bcm.","Meanwhile, when an endless belt  is used as an intermediate transfer belt or a recording medium conveying belt of an image forming apparatus, examples of material used in the substrate  include, for example, a polyimide resin, a polyamideimide resin, a polyester resin, a polyamide resin and a fluororesin, among these a polyimide resin or a polyamideimide resin may be used. The substrate  may be formed into a seamless form or a form with seam as long as it is formed into a ring (endless) form. A thickness of the substrate  may be in a range of, for example, from 20 \u03bcm to 200 \u03bcm.","<Surface Layer >","As a material used in the surface layer , for example, a fluororesin is exemplified. A fluororesin material has flame resistance; accordingly, it may be used as a material of the surface layer .","Specific examples of the fluororesin material include, for example, a powder paint or resin tube of a fluororesin, a fluorine-modified urethane and silicone resin, a copolymerized fluororubber, fluororesin-copolymerized vinyl ether, PFA (tetrafluoroethylene perfluoroalkoxy resin) or FEP (tetrafluoroethylene\/hexafluoropropylene copolymer paint), PTFE (tetrafluoroethylene) paint, PTFE-dispersed urethane paint, ETFE (polytetrafluoroethylene) tube, PVdF (polyvinylidene fluoride), and a PHV (polytetrafluoro vinylidene) resin material.","Furthermore, in the case where the endless belt  is used as an intermediate transfer belt, when a fluororesin material having volume resistivity larger than 10\u03a9\u00b7cm is used as a material of a surface layer , the surface layer  works as a surface insulating layer; accordingly, there is no need of separately disposing a surface insulating layer or a back conductive layer.","The surface layer  may have a heat resistant property. Specifically, a glass transition temperature of the surface layer  may be from 100\u00b0 C. to 200\u00b0 C. When the glass transition temperature of the surface layer  is set in the above range, for example, like the case where the endless belt  is used as a fixing belt, even when a step of heating the endless belt  is included, the endless belt  may be inhibited from deforming or being contaminated.","The glass transition temperature of the surface layer  is measured with a differential scanning calorimeter (trade name: DSC-50, manufactured by Shimadzu Corporation) based on JIS 7121-1987. When a temperature of a detector of the unit is calibrated, a melting temperature of a mixture of indium and Zn is used and an amount of heat is calibrated with heat of fusion of indium. A sample is put in an aluminum pan, the aluminum pan which a sample is put in and a vacant aluminum pan for reference are set, and a measurement is conducted at a temperature rising rate of 10\u00b0 C.\/min. A temperature at a point of an intersection of extrapolated lines of a base line in an endothermic portion and a rising line of a DSC curve obtained by the measurement is referred to as a glass transition temperature.","A thickness of the surface layer  is, for example, from 5 \u03bcm to 400 \u03bcm.","<Characteristics of Endless Belt >","When an endless belt  is used as an intermediate transfer belt or a recording medium conveying belt, surface resistivity may be controlled in the range of from 1\u00d710\u03a9\/\u25a1 to 1\u00d710\u03a9\/\u25a1 and volume resistivity may be controlled in the range of from 1\u00d710\u03a9cm to 1\u00d710\u03a9cm. In this connection, as required, to the substrate  or the surface layer , as a conductive agent, carbon black such as Ketjen black or acetylene black, graphite, metal or alloy such as aluminum, nickel or a copper alloy, metal oxide such as tin oxide, zinc oxide, potassium titanate, tin oxide-indium oxide or tin oxide-antimony oxide composite oxide, or a conductive polymer such as polyaniline, polypyrrole, polysulfone or polyacetylene may be added (herein, \u201cconductive\u201d in the polymer means that volume resistivity is less than 10\u03a9\u00b7cm). The conductive agents may be added singularly or in a combination of at least two thereof. Furthermore, in order to control the surface resistivity or volume resistivity, the conductive agent may be added to the particles  or particles of the conductive agent themselves may be used as the particles .","Herein, the surface resistivity and volume resistivity are measured by use of HIRESTA UPMCP-450 model UR Probe (trade name, manufactured by Dia Instrument Co., Ltd.) under an environment of 22\u00b0 C. and 55% RH, in compliance with JIS-K 6911.","<Method for Producing Endless Belt >","In what follows, as an example of a method for producing an endless belt , a method for producing an endless belt  that uses a polyimide resin as a material of the substrate  will be described. However, as mentioned above, a material of the substrate  of the endless belt  is not restricted to a polyimide resin.","\u2014Step of Preparing Polyamide Acid Solution\u2014","A polyimide resin used as a material of the substrate  is produced by heating a solution of polyamide acid (that is, polyimide precursor) to imidize. In this connection, in a production of an endless belt  that uses a polyimide resin as a material of the substrate , in the beginning, a polyamide acid solution is prepared (step of preparing polyamide acid solution).","Polyamide acid is synthesized in a solvent with a diamine compound and tetracarboxylic dianhydride.","As tetracarboxylic dianhydride, aromatic compounds and aliphatic compounds are exemplified. However, without particular restriction, any one thereof may be used.","Examples of the aromatic tetracarboxylic dianhydride include, for example, pyromellitic dianhydride, 3,3\u2032,4,4\u2032-benzophenonetetracarboxylic dianhydride, 3,3\u2032,4,4\u2032-biphenylsulfonetetracarboxylic dianhydride, 1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride, 2,3,6,7-naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride, 3,3\u2032,4,4\u2032-biphenylethertetracarboxylic dianhydride, 3,3\u2032,4,4\u2032-dimethyldiphenylsilanetetracarboxylic dianhydride, 3,3\u2032,4,4\u2032-tetraphenylsilanetetracarboxylic dianhydride, 1,2,3,4-furantetracarboxylic dianhydride, 4,4\u2032-bis(3,4-dicarboxyphenoxy)diphenylsulfide dianhydride, 4,4\u2032-bis(3,4-dicarboxyphenoxy)diphenylsulfone dianhydride, 4,4\u2032-bis(3,4-dicarboxyphenoxy)diphenylpropane dianhydride, 3,3\u20324,4\u2032-perfluoroisopropylidenediphthalic dianhydride, 3,3\u2032,4,4\u2032-biphenyl tetracarboxylic dianhydride, bis(phthalic acid)phenylphosphineoxide dianhydride, p-phenylene-bis(triphenylphthalic acid) dianhydride, m-phenylene-bis(triphenylphthalic acid) dianhydride, bis(triphenylphthalic acid)-4,4\u2032-diphenylether dianhydride, and bis(triphenylphthalic acid)-4,4\u2032-diphenylmethane dianhydride.","Examples of the aliphatic tetracarboxylic dianhydride include, for example, aliphatic or alicyclic tetracarboxylic dianhydride such as butanetetracarboxylic dianhydride, 1,2,3,4-cyclobutanetetracarboxylic dianhydride, 1,3-dimethyl-1,2,3,4-cyclobutanetetracarboxylic acid, 1,2,3,4-cyclopentanetetracarboxylic dianhydride, 2,3,5-tricarboxycyciopentylacetic dianhydride, 3,5,6-tricarboxynorbornane-2-acetic dianhydride, 2,3,4,5-tetrahydrofurantetracarboxylic dianhydride, 5-(2,5-dioxotetrahydrofuranyl)-3-methyl-3-cyclohexene-1,2-dicarboxylic dianhydride, or bicyclo[2,2,2]-oct-7-ene-2,3,5,6-tetracarboxylic dianhydride; and aromatic ring-containing aliphatic tetracarboxylic dianhydride such as 1,3,3a,4,5,9b-hexahydro-2,5-dioxo-3-furanyl)-naphtho[1,2-c]furan-1,3-dione, 1,3,3a,4,5,9b-hexahydro-5-methyl-5-(tetrahydro-2,5-dioxo-3-furanyl)-naphtho[1,2-c]furan-1,3-dione, or 1,3,3a,4,5,9b-hexahydro-8-methyl-5-(tetrahydro-2,5-dioxo-3-furanyl)-naphtho[1,2-c]furan-1,3-dione.","The tetracarboxylic dianhydride may be, among the compounds, an aromatic tetracarboxylic dianhydride, and specifically pyromellitic dianhydride, 3,3\u2032,4,4\u2032-benzophenonetetracarboxylic dianhydride or 3,3\u2032,4,4\u2032-biphenylsulfonetetracarboxylic dianhydride. The tetracarboxylic dianhydrides may be used singularly or in a combination of at least two thereof.","The diamine compound is not particularly restricted as long as it is a diamine compound having two amino groups in its molecular structure.

These diamine compounds may be used singularly or in a combination of at least two thereof.","Polyamide acid may be polyamide acid synthesized by use of aromatic tetracarboxylic dianhydride and aromatic diamine from the viewpoint of the mechanical strength of a compact (polyimide resin substrate).","As a solvent used for synthesizing polyamide acid, for example, an organic polar solvent may be used. Examples of organic polar solvent include, for example, a sulfoxide solvent such as dimethylsulfoxide or diethylsulfoxide, a formamide solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide or N,N-diethylformamide, an acetamide solvent such as N, N-dimethylacetamide or N,N-diethylacetamide, a pyrrolidone solvent such as N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone or N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone, a phenol solvent such as phenol, o-, m-, or p-cresol, xylenol, halogenated phenol or catechol, an ether solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane or dioxolane, an alcohol solvent such as methanol, ethanol or butanol, a cellosolve solvent such as butyl cellosolve, hexamethylphosphoramide, and \u03b3-butylolactone. These may be used singularly or in a combination thereof.","As a solvent used for synthesizing polyamide acid, other than the organic polar solvents, an aromatic hydrocarbon such as xylene or toluene may be used.","A solvent used for synthesizing polyamide acid may be capable of dissolving synthesized polyamide acid and partially imidized polyamide acid.","A polyamide acid solution may contain a solvent so that a solid content therein may be from 5% by weight to 30% by weight.","\u2014First Coating Liquid Film Forming Step\u2014","In a first coating liquid film forming step, a polyamide acid solution prepared in the step of preparing a polyamide acid solution is coated on an outer peripheral surface of a cylindrical core body to form a first coating liquid film (that is, a coating liquid film of a polyamide acid solution).","A method for coating a polyamide acid solution on an outer peripheral surface of a cylindrical core body is selected depending on a situation without restricting to particular one. Examples of specific coating method include, for example, a method where the cylindrical core body is dipped in a polyamide acid solution and pulled up to coat on an outer peripheral surface of the cylindrical core body and a method where a solution is ejected onto a surface of the cylindrical core body with the cylindrical core body rotating in a horizontal direction with respect to a center axis thereof to spirally coat, followed by smoothing a coating liquid film of polyamide acid solution with a blade.","As a material of the cylindrical core body, a metal such as aluminum, nickel, or stainless steel may be used. Among these, aluminum may be used from the viewpoint of large thermal expansion coefficient.","A surface of the cylindrical core body may be plated with chromium or nickel or may be coated with a fluororesin or a silicone resin.","A surface of the cylindrical core body may be roughened to have a surface roughness Ra of from 0.2 \u03bcm to 2 \u03bcm. Examples of a method for roughening a surface specifically include, for example, a blasting method, a grinding method and a sand paper treatment. As a method for roughening a surface, among the foregoing methods, a method where a blasting treatment is applied on a surface of a cylindrical core body with spherical particles may be used from the viewpoint of putting an inner surface of a polyimide resin endless belt into a state of a spherical surface having high slidability and a state where a projected fine unevenness is formed.","\u2014Drying Step\u2014","In a drying step, a coating liquid film of a polyamide acid solution formed on an outer peripheral surface of a cylindrical core body in the first coating liquid film forming step is dried to form a coating film. Specifically, a coating liquid film of a polyamide acid solution is dried at a temperature in the range of from 40\u00b0 C. to 130\u00b0 C. At this time, a coating liquid film of a polyamide acid solution tends to cause sagging owing to gravity. In this connection, in order to inhibit a polyamide acid solution from sagging, a cylindrical core body on which a coating liquid film of a polyamide acid solution is coated may be kept horizontal in an axial direction while being rotated at a speed in the range of from 10 rpm to 60 rpm to dry. Also in the first coating liquid film forming step, a polyamide acid solution may be coated while rotating, followed by, while continuing rotating, conducting the step of drying.","\u2014Step of Applying Liquid Droplets\u2014","In a step of applying liquid droplets, liquid droplets containing an aqueous solvent are applied to a coating liquid film of a polyamide acid solution formed in the first coating liquid film forming step or to a coating film formed by drying a coating liquid film of a polyamide acid solution in the step of drying. That is, a step of applying liquid droplets is conducted after the first coating liquid film forming step but before the drying step, or after the drying step.","When the liquid droplet applying step is conducted, concave portions  are formed on a surface of the substrate . Specifically, when a liquid droplets come into contact with a first coating liquid film or a coating film, at a contact portion, a mixing reaction or a substitution reaction between a solvent contained in the first coating liquid film or coating film (an organic polar solvent, in particular) and an aqueous solvent contained in the liquid droplets is caused to generate a mixed solution. That is, at the contact portion, a solvent in the first coating liquid film or coating film moves into liquid droplets, thereby an amount of a solvent contained in the first coating liquid film or coating film is reduced and the liquid droplets become a mixed solution of the aqueous solvent and the solvent. On the other hand, polyamide acid is dissolved with difficulty in the mixed solution; accordingly, in the first coating liquid film or coating film, which contains polyamide acid, a concentration of a solid content increases and a volume decreases. As the result, concave portions are formed in the first coating liquid film or coating film in the contact portion to roughen the first coating liquid film or coating film.","In the liquid droplet applying step, when liquid droplets heated at from 40\u00b0 C. to 100\u00b0 C. are applied to the first coating liquid film or coating film, solubility of the solvent to an aqueous solvent increases; accordingly, the mixing reaction and the substitution reaction are forwarded. As the result, an amount of volume reduction of the first coating liquid film or the coating film at a contact portion of the liquid droplet becomes larger to intensify a surface roughening effect.","The liquid droplet applying step, as mentioned above, may be applied either before the drying step or after the drying step. However, the liquid droplet applying step is necessarily applied in a state where the solvent is contained in at least the first coating liquid film or the coating film.","When the liquid droplet applying step is conducted, an amount of the solvent contained in the first coating liquid film or the coating film (a remaining amount of the solvent) is in the range of, for example, from 20% to 90%. The remaining amount of the solvent is measured as shown below. Specifically, a weight of the coating liquid film is measured from an increment of total weights before and after coating, a weight of the belt after baking of the coating liquid film is measured, and a ratio of a weight of a baked belt to a weight of the coating liquid film is calculated.","After the liquid droplet applying step, depending on circumstances, a drying step may be further applied. The liquid droplet applying step may be carried out both of before and after the drying step from the viewpoint of obtaining higher surface roughening effect.","A method for applying liquid droplets is not particularly restricted. Specifically, it is possible to use a sprayer that sprays a liquid in particle such as a nebulizer or a sprayer to spray liquid droplets onto the first coating liquid film or the coating film. Furthermore, as a liquid droplet applying method other than the spraying, for example, a method where inkjet is used to apply liquid droplets is exemplified.","The liquid droplets contain at least an aqueous solvent and, as required, may contain other components. Examples of the aqueous solvent include, for example, water such as distilled water or ion exchanged water, and alcohols, among these, water may be used. These may be used singularly or in a combination of at least two thereof. As another component, for example, a surfactant is exemplified.","The liquid droplets may contain the particles . When liquid droplets containing an aqueous solvent and the particles  are applied to the first coating liquid film or the coating film in the liquid droplet applying step, adhesiveness between the substrate  and the surface layer  is made more excellent.","Specifically, when, for example, a particle dispersion liquid obtained by mixing the particles  in water is sprayed to the first coating liquid film or the coating film, the particle dispersion liquid comes into contact with the first coating liquid film or the coating film. At this time, in the contact portion, water attached to a surface of the particles  causes a mixing reaction or substitution reaction with a solvent contained in the first coating liquid film or the coating film. Accordingly, the particles  move toward an inner surface of a concave portion generated at the contact portion. Furthermore, owing to a thixotropic property of a polyamide acid solution in the first coating liquid film or the coating film, a part of the particles  intrude into the first coating liquid film or the coating film.","Then, for example, when, in this state, a coating step described below is conducted, followed by a heating step described below, the particles  are positioned at an interface between the substrate  and the surface layer  and strongly bond with both the substrate  and the surface layer . That is, in the heating step, when polyamide acid is imidized to generate a polyimide resin and a surface layer forming material is baked to form a surface layer, an effect that the polyimide resin of the substrate  and the surface layer  are contracted by heating to strongly clip the particles  is obtained. Furthermore, since the particles  are positioned at an interface between the substrate  and the surface layer , a contact area of the substrate , the surface layer  and the particles  becomes larger to result in an effect that a chemical bonding effect such as an electrostatic bonding action is generated more strongly.","On the other hand, in the case where liquid droplets that do not contain the particles  are used, as a method for producing an endless belt  having the particles  in the concave portion  of the substrate , a method where the particles  are applied to a surface of the first coating liquid film or the coating film after the liquid droplet applying step or a method where after the liquid droplet applying step, a heating step is conducted to produce the substrate  having the concave portions , followed by applying the particles  to the concave portions  of the substrate  is exemplified.","A droplet diameter of a liquid droplet may be from 0.01 \u03bcm to 1,000 \u03bcm, from 0.05 \u03bcm to 500 \u03bcm, or from 0.1 \u03bcm to 100 \u03bcm.","A droplet diameter of a liquid droplet is measured as shown below. Specifically, liquid droplets are applied on a surface of a coating liquid film, diameters of attached liquid droplets are observed with a microscope, and an image thereof is processed to measure an average value of liquid droplet diameters.","When a droplet diameter of a liquid droplet is 0.01 \u03bcm or more, in the case where a liquid droplet applying step is conducted with liquid droplets containing the particles , the particles  intrude inside of the first coating liquid film or the coating film, and the particles  intervene between the substrate  and the surface layer  to generate a bonding effect. On the other hand, when a diameter of a concave portion  is too large, an anchoring effect may decrease in some cases. However, when a droplet diameter of a liquid droplet is 1,000 \u03bcm or less, a diameter of the concave portion  is not excessively large; accordingly, because of the anchoring effect, adhesive strength between the substrate  and the surface layer  is increased.","\u2014Heating Step (First Heating Step)\u2014","In a heating step (first heating step), a first coating liquid film or a coating film to which liquid droplets are applied in the liquid droplet applying step is heated at a temperature from 200\u00b0 C. to 450\u00b0 C. to forward an imidization reaction of polyamide acid to obtain a polyimide resin. The heating step is conducted with the first coating liquid film or the coating film formed on a surface of a cylindrical core body. An imidization temperature (heating temperature) is different respectively depending on species of tetracarboxylic dianhydride and diamine, which are starting materials of a polyamic acid. However, it may be set at a temperature where the imidization reaction comes to completion.","\u2014Second Coating Liquid Film Forming Step\u2014","In a second coating liquid film forming step, on a surface of a first coating liquid film or a coating film on which liquid droplets are applied in the liquid droplet applying step or a polyimide resin obtained in the first heating step, a coating liquid containing a material for forming a surface layer  is coated to form a second coating liquid film. That is, the second coating liquid film forming step is applied after the liquid droplet applying step and may be conducted either before the first heating step or after the first heating step.","As a coating liquid used in the second coating liquid film forming step, for example, a dispersion liquid where a material that forms a surface layer  is dispersed in a solvent is exemplified. Specifically, for example, when a fluororesin is used as a material of the surface layer , as a coating liquid being used, for example, a solution where a fluororesin is dispersed in a solvent is exemplified.","As a solvent, for example, water is exemplified. Alcohol such as ethanol or butanol, glycol such as ethylene glycol, or esters thereof may be used together.","In the coating liquid, as required, a surfactant or a viscosity adjusting agent may be added. Furthermore, when a material such as carbon powder, titanium oxide or barium sulfate other than a fluororesin is contained in a surface layer , the material may be mixed and dispersed in the coating liquid.","As a method for coating a coating liquid (a method for forming a second coating liquid film), for example, a dipping method, a spray coating method and a ring coating method are exemplified.","As mentioned above, a second coating liquid film forming step may be conducted either before the first heating step or after the first heating step. However, a second coating liquid film forming step may be carried out before the first heating step from the viewpoint of improving adhesiveness between a substrate  and a surface layer . That is, a method for producing an endless belt  may include a step where the coating liquid is applied on a surface of a first coating liquid film or a coating film on which liquid droplets are applied in a liquid droplet applying step to form a second coating liquid film, and a step where the first coating liquid film or the coating film on which a second coating liquid film is formed and the second coating liquid film are heated.","When a second coating liquid film forming step is conducted before a first heating step where a first coating liquid film or a coating film is imidized, in a heating step after a second coating liquid film is formed, polyamide acid in a first coating liquid film or a coating film causes an imidization reaction and a resin contained in a second coating liquid film coated on a surface of a first coating liquid film or a coating film is baked. Since a first coating liquid film or a coating film and a second coating liquid film are contracted by heating, particles  are strongly gripped by a substrate  and a surface layer . Accordingly, compared with a case where a second coating liquid film forming step is conducted after a first heating step where a first coating liquid film or a coating film is imidized, when a second coating liquid film forming step is conducted before the first heating step, an endless belt  excellent in adhesiveness between a substrate  and a surface layer  is obtained. When a second coating liquid film forming step is conducted before the first heating step, a heating temperature in a heating step after a second coating liquid film forming step may be set at a temperature equal to or higher than a melting temperature of a material constituting a surface layer .","On the other hand, when a second coating liquid film forming step is conducted after the first heating step, a second heating step where a second coating liquid film is heated to form a surface layer  is necessary. In this case, a heating temperature in a second heating step, similarly to the first heating step, may also be from 200\u00b0 C. to 450\u00b0 C. and equal to or more than a melting temperature of a material constituting a surface layer .","When a second coating liquid film forming step is followed by a heating step and further followed by cooling to normal temperature (25\u00b0 C.), a cylindrical core body on which a fluororesin and a polyimide resin are layered is obtained. When a cylindrical core body is removed therefrom, an endless belt  is produced. An endless belt  is, as required, cut to trim lengths of ends or ground to adjust surface roughness.","In what is mentioned above, a method for producing an endless belt , that is, a method for producing an endless belt  where particles  are positioned at an interface between a substrate  and a surface layer  in concave portions  of a substrate  is described. The foregoing method is effective as well in the case where an endless belt that does not contain a particle  is produced.","That is, also in the case where an endless belt that contains a substrate that has concave portions on a surface thereof and a surface layer formed on a surface of the substrate and does not contain a particle is produced, a method for producing, which contains the first coating liquid film forming step, a drying step, a liquid droplet applying step, a second coating liquid film forming step and a heating step, may be used. Specifically, in the liquid droplet applying step, when liquid droplets that contain an aqueous solvent and do not contain a particle is applied on a surface of a first coating liquid film or a coating film, concave portions are readily formed on a surface of a substrate. In particular, in the liquid droplet applying step, when the sprayer is used to spray, concave portions on a surface of a substrate are more readily formed.","(Other Form)","In what is mentioned above, as an example of a tubular body according to the present exemplary embodiment, an endless belt is described. However, a tubular body of the present exemplary embodiment may have another form without restricting to an endless belt. Specific examples of other form include, for example, a roll used as a charging roll, a transfer roll, a pressure roll, or a heating roil is exemplified.","Specifically, for example, a roll that includes a core having concave portions on a surface thereof, a peeling layer formed on a surface of the core and particles positioned at an interface between the core and the peeling layer in the concave portions is exemplified.","A material of a core is not particularly restricted and may be a material excellent in mechanical strength and excellent in heat conductivity. Specific examples of core material include, for example, metal such as aluminum, SUS, iron or copper, an alloy, ceramics and FRM (fiber-reinforced metal).","As a material of a peeling layer, for example, a fluororesin such as PFA may be used. In order to improve endurance and wear resistance, plural fluororesins may be contained.","A thickness of a peeling layer may be from 10 \u03bcm to 100 \u03bcm, or from 20 \u03bcm to 30 \u03bcm.","[Image Fixing Apparatus, Image Forming Apparatus, Tubular Body Supporting Apparatus]","In the next place, an image forming apparatus of a first exemplary embodiment that uses a tubular body of the exemplary embodiment will be described.  is a schematic diagram for explaining as main portion of a tandem image forming apparatus that includes an endless belt that is a tubular body according to the exemplary embodiment as a pressure belt of a fixing unit.","Specifically, an image forming apparatus  includes a photoreceptor  (electrostatic latent image holding member), a charging roll  for charging a surface of a photoreceptor , a laser generator  (electrostatic latent image forming unit) that exposes a surface of a photoreceptor  to form an electrostatic latent image, a developing unit  (developing unit) that develops a latent image formed on a surface of a photoreceptor  with a developer to form a toner image, an intermediate transfer belt  (intermediate transfer medium) to which a toner image formed by a developing unit  is transferred from a photoreceptor , a first transfer roll  (first transfer unit) that transfers a toner image to an intermediate transfer belt , a photoreceptor cleaning member  for removing a toner or dust attached to a photoreceptor , a second transfer roll  (second transfer unit) for transferring a toner image on an intermediate transfer belt  to a recording medium, and a fixing unit  (fixing unit) for fixing a toner image on a recording medium. A first transfer roll  may be disposed immediately above a photoreceptor  as shown in  or may be disposed at a position slightly displaced from immediate above a photoreceptor .","Furthermore, a configuration of an image forming apparatus  shown in  will be detailed.","In an image forming apparatus , a charging roll , a developing unit , a first transfer roll  disposed via an intermediate transfer belt , and a photoreceptor cleaning member  are disposed counterclockwise around a photoreceptor , and one set of the members forms a developing unit corresponding to one color. For every developing unit, a toner cartridge  that replenishes a developer to a developing unit  is disposed, and, for a photoreceptor  of each of the developing units, a laser generator  that illuminates laser light in accordance with image information on a surface of a photoreceptor  on a downstream side of a charging roll  (in a rotating direction of a photoreceptor ) and on an upstream side of a developing unit  is disposed.","Four developing units corresponding to four colors (for example, cyan, magenta, yellow, and black) are disposed in series in a horizontal direction in an image forming apparatus , and an intermediate transfer belt  is disposed so as to go through transfer regions of photoreceptors  and first transfer rolls  of four developing units. An intermediate transfer belt  is bridged with a tension applied by a support roll , a support roll , and a drive roll , which are disposed on an inner surface side of the intermediate transfer belt  counterclockwise in an above-mentioned order, and forms a belt supporting unit . Four first transfer rolls are located on a downstream side of a support roll  (in a direction of rotation of an intermediate transfer belt ) and on an upstream side of a support roll . Furthermore, on an opposite side of a driving roll  via an intermediate transfer belt , a transfer cleaning member  for cleaning an outer peripheral surface of an intermediate transfer belt  is disposed so as to come into contact with a driving roll  under pressure.","On an opposite side of a support roll  via an intermediate transfer belt , a second transfer roll  for transferring a toner image formed on an outer peripheral surface of an intermediate transfer belt  to a surface of a recording paper sheet transported from a paper feed portion  via a paper sheet path  is disposed so as to come into contact with a support roll .","At a bottom of an image forming apparatus , a paper sheet feed portion  for housing a recording medium is disposed, and a recording medium is fed so as to go through a contact portion of a support roll  and a second transfer roll , which form a second transfer portion, from a paper sheet feed portion  via a paper sheet path . A recording medium which have gone through the contact portion is further transported by a not shown conveying unit so as to go through a contact portion of a fixing unit  and finally ejected outside of an image forming apparatus .","In the next place, an image forming method that uses an image forming apparatus  shown in  will be described. A toner image is formed for every developing unit. After a surface of a photoreceptor  that rotates counterclockwise is charged by a charging roll , a latent image (electrostatic latent image) is formed on a surface of the charged photoreceptor  by a laser generator  (exposure unit), then, the latent image is developed with a developer fed from a developing unit  to form a toner image, and a toner image transported to a contact portion of a first transfer roll  and a photoreceptor  is transferred to an outer peripheral surface of an intermediate transfer belt  that rotates in a direction of an arrow mark C. A photoreceptor  from which a toner image is transferred is cleansed by a photoreceptor cleaning member  to remove a toner and dust attached on a surface thereof to prepare for forming a next toner image.","A toner image developed by every developing unit of each of colors, which is in a state of being sequentially superposed on an outer peripheral surface of an intermediate transfer belt  so as to correspond to image information, is transported to a second transfer portion, and transferred by a second transfer roll  to a surface of a recording paper sheet transported from a paper sheet feed portion  through a paper sheet path .
