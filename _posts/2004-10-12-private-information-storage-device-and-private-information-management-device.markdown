{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","This invention relates to a private information storage device and a private information management device in which the information pertinent to the event experienced by a user and the information privately required by the user are stored in a correlated fashion.","This application claims priority of Japanese Patent Application No. 2003-352896, filed on Oct. 10, 2003, the entirety of which is incorporated by reference herein.","2. Description of Related Art","Recently, with the progress in the network structure, such as the so-called Internet, and with the widespread use of a large-capacity recording medium, an environment is being created for providing or acquiring the voluminous information. In keeping up therewith, a large variety of information providing services have been proposed and, in these information providing services, attempts are being made for handling a large quantity of the information efficiently and efficaciously.","As an example, the information providing party extracts the taste of each user as an information accepting party to feature each individual to supply the information or services best fitted to each such individual (personalization of the information provided). This technique is used in online services allowing for purchase of articles of commerce from a site on the Internet. By introducing the information personalization, the services which allow for purchase of books on the Internet have realized the function of presenting recommended books to a user who purchased a book, from a list of works of the author of the book purchased by the user, the function of presenting other books purchased by other users who purchased the same book as that purchased by the user, the function of the apprising other users of the information the user feels useful for these other users.","The party accepting the information (the party browsing the information) is able to change the operating conditions or setting according to the taste of the user (customization). For example, the responsive properties of a mouse, the window coloring or the fonts can be changed.","Such as system which, by the above information personalization or customization, enables the efficient and efficacious use of the information, has already been known. As a developing phase of the personalization, such techniques as real-time profiling of the user's behavior on the network, learning the user's operating habit to provide the user with the GUI suited to the user's taste, or monitoring the user's reaction to observe the taste or the reaction of the user to the contents recommended by an agent.","As described above, the so-called push-type information furnishing, in which the information supplied by the provider is tailored to the individual user to provide a party desiring the information or services with the optimum information, becomes possible, while the party accepting the information may acquire the desired information extremely readily.","However, for tailoring the information provided to each individual (personalization), the information provider has to collect the individual-level information, by enquetes, through paper medium or Internet sites, or to collect the behavior hysteresis (purchase hysteresis of books in the above example) of the individual users. Among the information providing services, employing the Internet, there is such a service consisting in collecting the fee information pertinent to a marriage ceremony, a reception hall, an English school or a variety of culture schools, or the information pertinent to the atmosphere or service contents, from those who utilized these in the past, such as by enquetes, fitting the collected results to the rules already determined, and by displaying together the matched information, that is, the information pertinent to establishments or the experience information from the user, on a display image surface, to provide a latent user with the information in determining the establishments or the service providers.","If, in these information providing services, the information is to be made available among plural users, the retrieving step in retrieving the desired information from a large quantity of the text information is simplified by having the user intending to lay open his\/her experience data furnish the information, depending on the experience level, and by visualizing the collected experience data of the users in order for the user retrieving the information to acquire the information of high fidelity (information close to the desired information), as disclosed for example in Patent Publication 1.","In the technique described in this Patent Publication 1, the majority of the information, collected from those who already exploited the ceremony halls and reception halls, is the text information, and hence it is difficult to recognize readily whether or not the information contents on which the user places emphasis are contained in the text information furnished. Thus, with the conventional system, a large quantity of the text information, which inherently is not needed, has to be read, such that it is frequently difficult to find the information needed by the user.","The majority of the techniques for tailoring the furnished information to the individual (personalization) consist in the information provider using intricate artifices to extract a user taste model. These conventional techniques are used for information management for such cases where services desired by the individual users are provided, or where the information is co-owned by plural users. However, these techniques do not reflect variegated tastes of the individual users in need of the information.","[Patent Publication 1] Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication 2003-16202","It is an object of the present invention to provide a private information storage device and a private information management device in which the information pertinent to the event experienced by the user is stored and managed so as to be read out, whereby the information may be taken out with higher responsiveness than with the technique of keyword retrieval over the network, while the selected information may be taken out from the extracted information more efficaciously, and the information taken out is highly useful for the user.","In one aspect, the present invention provides a private information storage device including information acquisition means for acquiring experience information pertinent to an event experienced by a user; private information adding means for adding private information, privately needed by the user, to the acquired experience information; information inferring means for generating predictive information inferable from the experience information and the private information; and storage means for putting the experience information, the private information and the predictive information into order for enabling the retrieval and for storing the three information thus put into order therein.","In another aspect, the present invention provides a method for storing the private information including acquiring experience information pertinent to an event experienced by a user; adding private information privately needed by the user to the experience information acquired; generating predictive information inferable from the experience information and the private information; and putting the experience information, the private information and the predictive information into order for permitting retrieval to store the three information thus put into order therein.","In a further aspect, the present invention provides a private information management device including information acquisition means for acquiring experience information pertinent to an event experienced by a user; private information adding means for adding private information, privately needed by a user, to the experience information acquired; information inferring means for generating predictive information inferable from the experience information and the private information; storage means for putting the experience information, the private information and the predictive information into order for enabling retrieval to store the three information thus pit into order therein; retrieval inputting means for inputting a retrieval condition by the user; information presenting means for presenting information to the user; and information retrieval presentation controlling means for retrieving the fitting information from the experience information, the private information and the predictive information stored in storage means, based on the retrieval condition entered by the retrieval inputting means, to present the retrieved information to the information presenting means.","In yet another aspect, the present invention provides a private information management method including acquiring experience information pertinent to an event experienced by a user; adding private information, privately needed by the user, to the experience information acquired; generating predictive information inferable from the experience information and the private information; putting the experience information, the private information and the predictive information for enabling retrieval to store the three information thus put into order therein; and retrieving the fitting information from the empirical information, the private information and the predictive information thus stored, based on a retrieving condition input by the user, to present the information retrieved.","With the private information storage device, according to the present information, it is possible to store the private information as well as the information pertinent to an event experienced by the user, in such a manner as to remind the user of the experience of the event.","Moreover, with the private information storage device, according to the present invention, the user may be reminded of the event, he\/she experienced in the past, while the information pertinent to an unexperienced event may be predicted from the experienced event and presented to the user. Thus, the retrieval may be made with higher responsiveness than is possible with keyword retrieval on the network. The processing of selecting the desired information from the extracted information is efficacious and highly useful for individuals.","The present invention proposes a scheme of storing the information pertinent to the event experienced by the user and the information needed by the user for utilization later on. In a concrete example of the present invention, the information needed by the user is termed the private information. The user's private information is a mark applied for comprehensibly indicating the information acquired and desired to be used again, or an evaluation value pertinent to the acquired information, and is entered in association with the information pertinent to the event experienced by the user.","According to the present invention, the date and time of a user's experience, as well as the image and the speech then recorded, are stored as the information pertinent to the event experienced by the user. The additional information as entered by the user in connection with the experienced event is handled as the private information. For example, if a user has purchased a certain commodity, the information on the date\/time of purchase or the position of the store where the commodity was purchased, represents the information on the experienced event, whilst the user's impression or the lesson, obtained form the experience, such as the evaluation on the site of the store, on the services rendered or on the purchased commodity, or the grounds for such evaluation, and which is entered as \u2018memoranda\u2019, represents the user's private information.","According to the present invention, even if an event has not been experienced by a user, the information pertinent to such event may be generated and stored. For example, the present invention is featured by the fact that, if the weather was bad when the user visited a certain place, such that the comprehensive evaluation was bad, it is inferred that, if the weather was \u201cgood\u201d, such comprehensive evaluation will have been higher, so that such data as weather \u201cgood\u201d and \u201ccomprehensive evaluation\u201d are generated and rendered available. Thus, according to the present invention, the experience information, the private information, the predictive information generated from the two information, the user's impression on the experience, cases of success and failure, or the information tantamount to the lesson, are stored, along with the experience information, as the marks or evaluation values are annexed for use later.","For exploiting the stored information, it is sufficient that the user inputs the retrieving conditions. By so doing, the information on past analogous experiences, if any, and\/or the information analogous to the predicted information, if any, may be taken out. For example, if the user visited the same place in the past, the private information, such as the data and time of the visit, the information on e.g. the commodities then purchased and the evaluation then given, are presented. Moreover, the information that, although the evaluation then given was not bad, the evaluation will be better if the condition is changed, if there is any such information, is presented.","According to the present invention, the information pertinent to the event experienced by the user and the information inferred from the experienced event are stored. Since it is sufficient that the information is presented from storage means which may be retrieved later by a keyword, the device of the present invention may be such a one in which the storage means is provided on the network. Although the information derived from the experiences of the individual users may be designed to be used solely by the user in person, the information derived from the experiences of the individual users may also be co-owned by other users.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["1","1","10","30"]},"The private information management device  includes, as the information registration unit , an information acquisition unit  for acquiring the information pertinent to an experienced event, a private information adding unit  for adding the private information, a data recognition processing unit  for recognizing the acquired information, a data definition processing unit  for classifying the recognized data in accordance with the predetermined definition, and a data storage unit  for storage of the data classified according to the definition.","The information acquisition unit  is a means for acquiring the information around the user, and includes a means capable of acquiring the image information, speech information, position information and time\/date, such as a camera, microphone or GPS. The data recognition processing unit  performs the processing of extracting the specified information from e.g. the image information, speech information, position information or time\/date, as acquired by a camera, microphone or GPS. The data recognition processing unit  includes an image recognition unit , a text processing unit  and a speech processing unit . The image and the text of the image data acquired from the camera is subjected to image recognition processing and text recognition processing, by the image recognition unit  and the text processing unit , to extract specified image and text data. The speech data acquired from the microphone is processed by a speech recognition unit  to recognize the speech. The speech information is converted into text data by a language processing unit , and key data is extracted from the converted text data by a keyword extraction unit .","The data extracted by the data recognition processing unit  is classified in the data definition processing unit  in accordance with predetermined definitions. Examples of the definitions include an image of a person, the identification information pertinent to the image of the person, such as family, brothers\/sisters, spouse, place of work, friends, age groups, place of residence or nationality, the degree of density as verified from image data (low or high), sort of the building, as verified from image data (sort of the service works, as may be surmised from placards), name of the buildings (letter\/character strings), time\/date, weather (fine, rainy or cloudy), atmospheric temperature (high or low), humidity (high or low), wind (strong or weak), position information (latitude, longitude or altitude), closest station, common name that may be understood only by the user, evaluation value and items of evaluation (conditions of site, evaluation of the salespeople, evaluation of goods, atmosphere of store, pricing, time of supplying cooking and other conditions). The acquired data are classified based on these definitions. The data storage unit  holds the data classified based on the above definitions.","A data processing unit  generates the experience information not actually experienced by the user but which is pertinent to the experienced event, and the predictive information, which may be inferred from the private information as input by the user, puts the experience information, private information and the predictive information into order such as to enable the retrieval, and causes the three information sorts in storage means. As an example, the private information is the \u2018value\u2019 imparted to the experience information pertinent to the event experienced by the user. The data processing unit  generates predicted values for the evaluated values, imparted from the user, on the occasion of the condition changes, as the predictive information.","The case of exploiting the private information of the user, registered in the information registration unit , is hereinafter explained.","The private information management device  includes, as the information exploitation unit , an information acquisition unit , for acquiring the current state, a retrieval inputting unit , supplied with the retrieving conditions, a data recognition processing unit  for recognizing the acquired information, a retrieving unit  for extracting the information conforming to the retrieving conditions or the analogous information from the data storage unit , and an information presenting unit  for presenting the extracted information to the user.","The information acquisition unit  and the data recognition processing unit  acquire and recognize the position information of the current site, and the other information, by a method similar to that of the information registration phase. The retrieval inputting unit  is supplied with the retrieving conditions by the user. The inputting methods include the speech input, text input or the image input. In case the speech is input to the retrieval inputting unit , the data recognition processing unit  extracts the keyword pertinent to the time, site and the person from the text. In case the text data is input to the retrieval inputting unit , the data recognition processing unit  extracts the keyword from the text and, in case the image data is input to the retrieval inputting unit , the data recognition processing unit  extracts the keyword from the image. The data recorded in schedule management software may also be used.","The retrieving unit  includes a presentation data inferring unit , for extracting the information, analogous to the retrieving conditions, from the data storage unit , and a presentation data retrieving unit , for extracting the information matched to the retrieving condition, from the data storage unit . In retrieving the information from the data storage unit , the database management system, used in the information registration unit , is used for retrieval. The information extracted by the retrieving unit is presented to the user by the information presenting unit  by the text data, audio guide, or the image display, taken alone or in combination.","In connection with an event experienced by the user, the present private information management device  is able to store the information pertinent to the experience, and the private information, such as to remind the user of the experience. Moreover, the private information management device  is able to predict the information on an unexperienced event, from the event directly experienced by the user, and hence is able to store the information which is in excess of the information corresponding to the actual experience of the user. Additionally, since the information being retrieved is the information collected on the basis of the user's experience, the information of higher utility for a user may be taken out with responsiveness and efficiency higher than with a technique of keyword retrieval over a network, while the desired information may be efficaciously selected from the extracted information, thus allowing taking out the information of high utility and efficiency.","The present invention is also featured by the fact that the registrant in person exploits the information managed by the private information management device . For this reason, the information obtained from the experience of the user, or the private information, such as impression, evaluation or lesson for the experienced event, does not have to be generalized, but may be recorded in a form that may be understood solely by the user. It is preferable that the information pertinent to the experienced event is automatically acquired by the camera, microphone or the GPS, as far as is possible, as in the example described above. The private information management device  according to the present invention is desirable under the circumstances that, in actuality, the user feels it difficult to leave a \u2018memorandum\u2019 consciously in connection with an event experienced by the user, and is liable to lose the chance of recording the crucial information, such that, if similar chance presents itself again, it is not possible to take advantage of the previous experience.","Referring to , the private information management device , as a concrete example of the present invention, is explained in detail.  separately shows the information registration phase and the information exploitation phase, both of which are carried out using the private information management device .  shows a specified example of the private information management device . In the present concrete example, the case of a user having a meal in a restaurant (store) is explained. Consequently, the information registration phase is the phase of registering the information of the surrounding in the user having a meal in a restaurant, and the private information at this time, while the information exploitation phase is a phase of taking out the past information pertinent to the restaurant at the next chance.","Since it is crucial for a user experiencing an event to be carrying the private information management device , the private information management device  in the present concrete example is of the mobile type. Even though the private information management device is of the mobile type, it may be connectable to a device corresponding to e.g. a stationary PC  or a server device for household use so that the information acquired may be stored therein. In this case, it is sufficient that the data storage unit  of the private information management device  is provided independently on the side of the stationary PC  or of the server device so that the information will be transmitted\/received wirelessly or over a wired communication interface between data storage unit and the main body unit of the private information management device .","Referring to , the private information management device  includes a GPS  for acquiring the position information, a CCD (charge coupled device)  for acquiring the information around the user, and a microphone . These components serve as the information acquisition unit  for the information registration phase and as the information acquisition unit  for the information exploitation phase, shown in . In this private information management device , image data and voice data are automatically acquired, without operations by the user. The CCD  and the microphone  transfer to a mode of generating and storing storage form data, based on a data model, at a preset time interval, or with changes in the environment around the user, for storing the data. For example, detection of a large sudden sound, or detection of a keyword specified by a keyword extraction unit , is used as a trigger for information acquisition. In the explanation of the present concrete example, the information around the user, acquired by the information acquisition unit , is termed the experience information, as necessary.","The private information management device  also includes an evaluation inputting key , as a private information addition unit  for the user to add the private information, and an operating input unit  for a retrieval input in the information exploitation phase or for an operating input for this device. The evaluation inputting key  may be a simple pushbutton for inputting points corresponding to the number of times of pressing operations, or an operating input key, such as a ten-key, capable of directly inputting the evaluation values. In the present concrete example, the evaluation of \u2018best\u2019, \u2018acceptable\u2019, \u2018good\u2019, \u2018bad\u2019 and \u2018worst\u2019 is given, depending on the number of times of the pressing operations. The evaluation input from the evaluation inputting key  does not necessarily have to be entered simultaneously with the experience of the user. That is, the evaluation input may be made, in connection with the experienced event, at a time later than the time of the information acquisition.","The private information management device  may be provided with a structure for acquiring the weather information, such as atmospheric temperature, humidity or weather, as a structure corresponding to the information acquisition unit , in addition to the above-described structure. The technique for acquiring the position information or the weather information may be exemplified by having the position information or the weather information periodically distributed in addition to receiving the base station information periodically transmitted from the base station, as is already realized in the field of a mobile phone. The private information management device  may also be provided with a simple temperature or humidity sensor.","The private information management device  includes an image recognition unit , a sentence recognition unit  and a speech recognition unit  for recognizing the image data, sentence data and speech data acquired, respectively. The image recognition unit  executes image recognition processing on the image data acquired from the CCD . For example, it executes the processing of recognizing and extracting a face portion of a person. The sentence recognition unit  executes text recognition processing on image data acquired from the CCD . For example, it executes the processing of recognizing letter\/character strings or symbols in the image, such as letters\/characters in a placard, to extract the name of the building or the sign as text data. The speech recognition unit  includes a speech recognition processing unit , a language processing unit , and a keyword extraction unit . The speech recognition processing unit  recognizes and processes speech data acquired from the microphone  as speech. The language processing unit  converts the speech data into text data, and the keyword extraction unit  extracts the key word from the as-converted text data.","The private information management device  also includes a data definition processing unit  for giving definitions to the data extracted by the image recognition unit , sentence recognition unit  and the speech recognition unit . The data definition processing unit  is equivalent to the data definition processing unit  for the information registration phase and to the retrieving unit  for the information exploitation phase, and classifies the extracted data in accordance with the predetermined definitions or retrieves the information from a database  in accordance with the retrieving conditions.","In the database  of the private information management device , there are registered, for example, image data and text data stating the information pertinent to the image data. For example, for image data of a face of a person, there are stored names, addresses, sites of contact or ages of friends in associated manner. There is also stored the information of families, brothers\/sisters, spouse, people in the place of work, friends, and so forth, if any, that are pertinent to this person. The persons, sorts or names of the buildings (letter\/character strings), as determined from image data, text data and speech data, extracted by the image recognition unit , sentence recognition unit  and the speech recognition unit , are compared to data stored in the database , so as to be classified and stored as new data. Among the definitions, there are, for example, the position information (latitude, longitude or altitude), time\/date data, weather information (fine, rainy or cloudy), atmospheric temperature (high or low), humidity (high or low), wind (strong or weak), closest station, common names that may be understood only by the user, evaluation values and items of evaluation (conditions of site, evaluation of the salespeople, evaluation of goods, atmosphere of store, pricing, time of supplying cooking and other conditions). The acquired data are classified based on these definitions.","The private information management device  also includes a data processing unit  corresponding to the data processing unit  shown in . The data processing unit  generates the predictive information inferable from the private information and the experience information extracted by the above components and which have been defined by the data definition processing unit . Specifically, the data processing unit  is provided with predicted evaluation values corresponding to the evaluated values which were afforded by the user on the subjects of evaluation exemplified by the conditions of site, salespeople, commodities, atmosphere of the store, price setting, cooking presenting time and so forth, and which will prevail in case the conditions have changed. That is, if the evaluation values are set in five stages and the value of \u201c1\u201d is afforded as the private information, it is set to \u201c5\u201d, as an example, whereas, if \u201c\u22123\u201d is afforded for the setting of \u201c\u22125 to +5\u201d, it is set to \u201c3\u201d, and the new evaluation value obtained here is used as the predictive information.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 6"],"b":"59"},"The predictive information may be automatically generated by the data processing unit . The user may be prompted to make input as the guide as to what will be the atmosphere under certain and certain conditions is presented to the user by e.g. the software processing.","The data acquired and defined are model-converted, in accordance with a data model, and stored in the database , using a database management system (DBMS). Examples of the techniques for model conversion include the technique consisting in defining the data in a tabulated form and managing the tabulated data in accordance with the DBMS with use of a relational database (RDB), and a technique of classifying the data using the RDFs-OWL and managing the so classified data in accordance with the DBMS with use of RDFDB or XMLDB. The information pertinent to the event experienced by the user, or the private information, stored in the database , may be edited later, if so desired by the user.","The private information management device  also includes, as a structure for presenting the information to the user, an LCD , as display, a display device , a loudspeaker  and a speech outputting device .","The above-described structures are comprehensively controlled by a CPU, a ROM having stored therein e.g. processing programs, and a controller , provided with a RAM, as a work area for the CPU.","Referring to ,  and , the case of registering the information pertinent to the experienced event (experience information) and the private information, by a user, with the aid of the aforementioned private information management device , is hereinafter explained.  illustrate the information registration processing for a case where a user has a meal in a restaurant (store) and the information exploitation processing of subsequent exploitation of the registered information, respectively.","First, the case where the user acquires the experience information in a restaurant  and the private information, is explained. When the user, carrying the aforementioned private information management device , takes a meal in the restaurant  (arrow A in ), the information pertinent to the experienced event is acquired by the private information management device  (arrow B in ). The information acquired here is classified into the experience information and the private information. The experience information is mainly acquired automatically by the private information management device . The private information is entered by the user (arrow C in ). It is noted that the private information may or may not be entered simultaneously with the acquisition of the information pertinent to the experienced event.","As for the timing of the acquisition of the experience information, it is sufficient if the user sets the mode of automatically acquiring the information at a preset interval before walking into the restaurant . However, in a usual case, the user cannot consciously execute this mode setting operation. According to the present invention, the information pertinent to the experienced event is desirably acquired without the user becoming conscious about it, and hence the experience information is to be acquired automatically, with changes in the surrounding states as a trigger, as far as is possible. For example, if a sentence \u201cMay I help you?\u201d is defined at the outset, as a keyword for trigger, the data formulating mode is entered when the user steps into the restaurant  and the private information management device  has detected the sentence \u201cMay I help you?\u201d operating as a trigger (steps S and S of ).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0068"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0069"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},"The timing for the user to enter the private information (arrow C in ) may be arbitrary, as described above. The private information may be added later to the acquired information. In the present concrete example, the user may be prompted to input the private information by generating the sound or by vibrations when the user has finished the experience in the restaurant , that is, when the user has moved from this restaurant to another place. There may, of course, be provided a mode which allows for acquisition of the experience information or for inputting of the private information on the part of the user.","If, when the private information management device  has booted the CCD or the GPS in a step S, and is in a standby state, a trigger is detected, the private information management device  in a step S moves to a data formulating mode, and acquires the experience information. The experience information, acquired in a step S, is recognized and processed as from a step S. If the experience information acquired is image data, the image recognition processing is carried out on image data acquired from the CCD  in a step S. If the experience information acquired is the image data, and the letter\/character information is contained in the image, the sentence recognition unit  in a step S executes text recognition processing on image data acquired from the CCD , and recognizes the letter\/character string, in the image, such as the letters\/characters of e.g. a placard, and extracts the name of the building or the sign as text data. If the experience information acquired is the speech data, the speech recognition processing unit  in a step S performs speech recognition processing on the acquired speech data. Then, in a step S, the language processing unit  converts the speech information into text data and, in a step S, the keyword extraction unit  extracts the keyword from the text data. The GPS data, acquired by the GPS , such as the position data or the date\/time data, and the text data, entered by the information presenting unit , may directly be used, and hence the private information management device  proceeds to the next step.","In a step S, the private information management device  accepts the inputting of the private information from the user. At this time, the information that could not be acquired as the experience information, such as the store name or store site, is entered simultaneously by the user. However, the private information does not have to be entered at this stage. The mode for the user to input only the private information is also provided. The data obtained from the acquired information are classified in a step S in accordance with the definitions.","The private information management device  in a step S generates the predictive information inferable from the private information and the experience information acquired. Data as the predictive information is also classified based on the definitions. Data obtained from the information acquired and data as the predictive information are ultimately stored in a step S in the database .","By the above processing, the experience information and the private information of the user are put into order and stored in the database  in such a manner as to permit facilitated retrieval. Thus, the above information, obtained through actual experience by the user, may be stored.","The case of exploiting the user's private information, registered in the information registration unit , is now explained with reference to . Here, the case of the user retrieving the information pertinent to restaurants is explained.","The private information management device  is supplied with information retrieval conditions (arrow D in ). The retrieval conditions supplied may be automatically selected, with the keyword, contained in the information, derived from the user's current state, as acquired by the private information management device per se, as a retrieving key. In addition, the conditions directly entered by the user may be used. Among the techniques for a user to input the retrieving conditions, there are such techniques by manual inputting, from item to item, based on the GUI for inputting the retrieving conditions, by speech input in keeping with the guidance, and by simple utterance of the keyword. In the following, the case in which the retrieving condition is input from the user by speech is explained.","In a step S, the private information management device  acquires the position information of the current site, and the other information, by a method similar to that for the information registration phase. In the next step S, it is verified whether or not the retrieval condition has been entered. If the retrieval condition has been entered by the user, the keyword is extracted, depending on the inputting method. In case the user has entered the retrieval condition by speech, for example, in case the user has uttered \u201crestaurant with amicable atmosphere\u201d to the private information management device , the speech recognition unit  executes the speech recognition processing, and extracts the keywords \u201catmosphere\u201d, \u201camicable\u201d and \u201crestaurant\u201d.","The position information of the current site, acquired at this time, and the other information, are referred to below as the current information.  show the current information acquired in the step S and the retrieval condition acquired in the step S, respectively. In association with the numbers of the acquired information, the time information for Aug. 31, 2003, 12:10 is represented as \u201c200308311210\u201d, while the position information 58\u00b059\u203220\u2033 latitude, 135\u00b042\u203240\u2033 longitude and 520 m altitude is represented as \u201c585920, 1354240, 520\u201d. In addition, the information pertinent to the attendant circumstances, such as the weather information, transmitted from the base station, for example, is acquired. The retrieval conditions, acquired by the private information management device , are \u201cgood\u201d atmosphere and name of the place being the \u201crestaurant\u201d, as shown in . Thus, these data are added to data used as the retrieval condition, such that the set of data shown in , including these data, becomes a keyword for the retrieval conditions.","The experience information, acquired in the step S, is recognized and processed in the processing of a step S and in the following steps. If the information is the experience data, the image recognition processing is carried out on image data acquired from the CCD  in the step S. If the information is the image data and the letter\/character information is contained in the image, the sentence recognition unit  in a step S executes the text recognition processing on the image data acquired from the CCD . For example, the sentence recognition unit  executes the text recognition processing on image data acquired from the CCD , and recognizes the letter\/character string or the symbol in the image, such as letters\/characters in a placard, to extract the name of the building or the sign as text data. If the information is speech data, the speech recognition processing unit  in a step S performs speech recognition processing on the acquired speech data. In the next step S, the language processing unit  converts the speech information into text data and, in the next step S, the keyword extraction unit  extracts the keyword from the text data. If the information is text data or GPS data, processing transfers directly to the next step . If no retrieval condition has been entered in the step S from the user, processing similarly transfers directly to the next step .","In the step S, the information including the retrieval conditions and the information analogous with the retrieval conditions are extracted from the database , based on the current information extracted in the steps S to S and the retrieving condition entered by the user. For extracting the information retrieved from the database by the user, the database management system used in the information registration unit  is used. For example, memory base reasoning (MBR) and the distance between two points (Euclid distance) is used. As for the retrieving method, if such a case is found in which all items of the information stored in the database are available, the evaluation values for the experience entered by the user are prioritized, whereas, if the totality of the items are not available, priority is placed on the items with a higher degree of matching. The information of other experiences, having evaluation values as specified by the retrieving conditions, input by the user, may also be retrieved.","The information extracted by the data definition processing unit  as the retrieving unit is presented in a step S to the user by text data, voice guide, image display, or combination thereof (arrow E in ).","If the retrieving condition has been input by the user in the step S, retrieval is carried out based on the keyword of the retrieving condition. If the retrieving condition has not been input, retrieval is carried out under a condition analogous to the current information. For example, if the current place is the restaurant, and the user visited this restaurant in the past, the result of evaluation at such past time is presented. If the user did not visit this restaurant in the past, the information on a near by restaurant the user visited in the past is presented. If no retrieving condition has been entered, but the current time is the meal time, the information on the restaurant near the user's current site is presented.","A data example, displayed as being the result of retrieval, is shown in . Retrieved results , , ,  and  are displayed against the input current information and retrieving conditions. Of these result data, the results  to  are the information obtained by experiences by the user. The result  is the data shown in . If the time is the evening later than 18.00, both the atmosphere and the evaluation are the \u201cbest\u201d.","As for the display order, the contents of the retrieving conditions by the user are prioritized. For example, if the \u201ccloseness\u201d is input by the user, the information of restaurants which are close to the current site is prioritized over the information of restaurants having a high evaluation.","With the present technique, data recorded in the schedule management software may be used. For example, if the user is scheduled to visit a certain place at a certain time on a certain date, and this schedule is registered in the schedule management software, it is possible to extract the optimum route from the database  and the start target time, from the database , for presentation to the user in advance.","Thus, the present private information management device , as described above, is able to store the information, experienced by the user, along with the information reminiscent of the experience. Since the information obtained on retrieving the data storage unit of the present device is the information once experienced by the user, the information obtained on retrieving the data storage unit by the present device is efficacious and of high utility as compared to the information obtained by the technique of keyword retrieval on the network, such as the Internet. Moreover, the information reminds the user of the event he\/she experienced in the past, and hence is more realistic than the generalized information obtained on retrieval on the network."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 14"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
