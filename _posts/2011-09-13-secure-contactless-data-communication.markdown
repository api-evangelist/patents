{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Contactless data communication has been employed in multiple industries, including the automotive industry. There, contactless data communication is used to gain access to a vehicle. A key or key fob is held by a person and is operable to communicate with a vehicle when the key fob is within range of wireless communication with the vehicle. The person may press a button on the vehicle or lift the handle of a door of the vehicle to initiate communication between the vehicle and the key or key fob. Once communication is initiated, the vehicle and the key or key fob may exchange messages to allow the person access to the vehicle. For example, the key or key fob may transmit one or more authentication messages that the vehicle validates.","One problem that has arisen with contactless data communication is that it is susceptible to a relay attack. In the context of access to vehicles, this attack includes a person initiating the communication with the vehicle by pushing a button on the vehicle or lifting a handle on the vehicle's door. The vehicle then transmits a signal which is captured by the person and relayed to a remote device using a transceiver. The remote device may be located away from the vehicle but in proximity to the key or key fob. For example, the vehicle may be in a parking lot of a restaurant and the owner of the vehicle may be in the restaurant. The remote device may be located inside the restaurant and may relay the signal transmitted by the vehicle in the restaurant. The key fob, while in the possession of the owner, may receive the signal transmitted by the vehicle as a result of the remote device and may respond with authentication signals. The remote device may capture the authentication signals and transmit them to the person in proximity with the vehicle who initiated the communication. The transceiver held by the person may transmit the authentication signals to the vehicle and the vehicle may validate the authentication signals. This may allow an unauthorized person access to the vehicle.","In one embodiment, a method includes receiving, at a first device, a first signal transmitted from a first antenna and receiving a second signal after receiving the first signal. The second signal is transmitted from a second antenna after the first signal was transmitted from the first antenna. The method includes determining expected characteristics of an expected signal based on combining the first signal and the second signal. The method includes receiving, at the first device, a third signal comprising signals transmitted from the first antenna and the second antenna substantially simultaneously. The method includes determining whether the third signal comprises at least one characteristic that matches the expected characteristics. In response to determining that the third signal matches the expected signal, the method includes engaging, by the first device, in a communication session with a second device, the second device comprising the first antenna and the second antenna.","In some embodiments, the expected characteristics may comprise one or more of: an expected amplitude, an expected frequency, an expected phase, and an expected angle. The first signal may be different than the second signal. The second device may be a vehicle.","In one embodiment, a system includes at least one antenna configured to receive a first signal transmitted from a first antenna. The at least one antenna is also configured to receive a second signal after receiving the first signal. The second signal is transmitted from a second antenna after the first signal was transmitted from the first antenna. The at least one antenna is also configured to receive a third signal. The third signal comprises signals transmitted from the first antenna and the second antenna substantially simultaneously. The system also includes at least one processor configured to determine expected characteristics of an expected signal based on combining the first signal and the second signal and determine whether the third signal comprises at least one characteristic that matches the expected characteristics. In response to determining that the third signal matches the expected signal, the at least one processor is configured to engage in a communication session with a first device, the first device comprising the first antenna and the second antenna.","Depending on the specific features implemented, particular embodiments may exhibit some, none, or all of the following technical advantages. The presence of a relay attack in a contactless data communication session may be detected. Communicating with the ability to detect a relay attack may be performed without need for a high amount of data storage or computing power. Other technical advantages will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art from the following figures, description and claims.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","1","2","3","1","2","3","3","1","2","3","1","2","3"]},"In some embodiments, data transmissions are to be carried out between base station BS and Passive Entry\/Go module PEG. For example, a transmission from base station BS to Passive Entry\/Go module PEG may be in the low frequency (LF) band at, e.g., 125 kHz by inductive coupling in the electromagnetic near field. In some embodiments, the low frequency (LF) band may be between 30 kHz to 300 kHz. As another example, a transmission from Passive Entry\/Go module PEG to base station BS may take place at frequencies in the megahertz range (e.g., 315 MHz). The data transmissions may be used to carry out an authentication and data communication process. Base station BS radiates or transmits the electromagnetic field sequentially in succession from two or more of antennas AN, AN and AN. Antennas EN, EN and EN of Passive Entry\/Go module PEG may be located in the near field of antennas AN, AN and AN.","In Passive Entry\/Go module PEG, using antennas EN, EN and EN, the orthogonal components of the field strength vectors associated with antennas AN, AN, and AN are determined. Passive Entry\/Go module PEG may determine an expected signal using the received field strength vectors. For example, if Passive Entry\/Go module PEG received a first signal transmitted from antenna AN and then, after receiving the first signal, a second signal transmitted from antenna AN, Passive Entry\/Go module PEG may determine the expected signal by summing the field strength vectors associated with the signals transmitted from antennas AN and AN. The determined expected signal represents a signal expected to be received by Passive Entry\/Go module PEG when antenna AN transmits the first signal and antenna AN transmits the second signal at the same time.","In some embodiments, the components of the magnetic field strength vectors associated with signals transmitted by antennas AN, AN, and AN are transmitted back from Passive Entry\/Go module PEG to base station BS. Transmission of the values of the individual components back to the base station BS from the Passive Entry\/Go module PEG may be performed by modulating the values at frequencies in the megahertz range (e.g., 315 MHz) onto a reply or response signal as digital data in an encoded form. Base station BS may determine an expected signal using the received components of the field strength vectors instead of Passive Entry\/Go module PEG. For example, Passive Entry\/Go module PEG may have received a first signal transmitted from antenna AN and then, after receiving the first signal, Passive Entry\/Go module PEG may have received a second signal transmitted from antenna AN. The components of the magnetic field strength vectors associated with the first and second signals may be transmitted from Passive Entry\/Go module PEG to base station BS. Base station BS may determine the expected signal by summing the field strength vectors associated with the signals transmitted from antennas AN and AN. The determined expected signal represents a signal expected to be received by Passive Entry\/Go module PEG when antenna AN transmits the first signal and antenna AN transmits the second signal at the same time.","In some embodiments, it may be advantageous to determine the expected signal at the base station BS because it may reduce the complexity of an integrated circuit of the Passive Entry\/Go module PEG as well as the power consumption of the Passive Entry\/Go module PEG, which is beneficial when the Passive Entry\/Go module PEG is to be embodied in a key KE that may be small or the like.","Signals may be transmitted from two or more of antennas AN, AN, and AN simultaneously after two or more of antennas AN, AN, and AN have transmitted the sequential signals discussed above used to determine the expected signal. The signal received by Passive Entry\/Go module PEG corresponding to the signals transmitted from two or more of antennas AN, AN, and AN simultaneously may be compared to the expected signal determined above. If the signals transmitted simultaneously are validated (e.g., a match is determined between one or more characteristics of the signals transmitted simultaneously and characteristics of the signals transmitted sequentially), then key KE may continue communication with car CA. For example, key KE may transmit signals that include authentication information which car CA may validate. If car CA validates the authentication information, access may be granted to car CA, such as unlocking doors of car CA or starting car CA. In some embodiments, this may provide an advantage in that a relay attack may be detected.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","200","100","200","1","2","1","2","1","1","2","1","1","2","2"]},"In some embodiments, transceiver SE comprises three antennas EA, EA and EA that are oriented orthogonally relative to each other. Receiving antennas EA, EA and EA are connected to signal amplifiers V, V and V, respectively. Signal amplifiers V, V and V are coupled to inputs EAD, EAD and EAD of an A\/D converter AD, respectively. Furthermore, each input EAD, EAD and EAD of the A\/D converter AD is connected with input ED, ED and ED of a demodulator DEM, respectively. In this manner, the signal received by each one of the receiving antennas EA, EA and EA can be individually demodulated to obtain and evaluate the data being carried by the modulated signal as received by each of the receiving antennas. The A\/D converter AD and the demodulator DEM are also each respectively connected with a signal processor SP, which in turn is further connected with a memory unit MEM. In some embodiments, elements similar to A\/D converter AD, demodulator DEM, signal processor SP, and memory unit MEM may be included in transceiver SE.","In some embodiments, signal processor SP includes hardware for executing instructions, such as those making up a computer program.

As an example and not by way of limitation, signal processor SP may load instructions from memory unit MEM to an internal register or internal cache. To execute the instructions, signal processor SP may retrieve the instructions from the internal register or internal cache and decode them. During or after execution of the instructions, signal processor SP may write one or more results (which may be intermediate or final results) to the internal register or internal cache. Signal processor SP may then write one or more of those results to memory unit MEM. In particular embodiments, signal processor SP executes only instructions in one or more internal registers or internal caches or in memory unit MEM and operates only on data in one or more internal registers or internal caches or in memory unit MEM. One or more memory buses (which may each include an address bus and a data bus) may couple signal processor SP to memory unit MEM. In particular embodiments, one or more memory management units (MMUs) may reside between signal processor SP and memory unit MEM and facilitate accesses to memory unit MEM requested by signal processor SP.

Where appropriate, this ROM may be mask-programmed ROM, programmable ROM (PROM), erasable PROM (EPROM), electrically erasable PROM (EEPROM), electrically alterable ROM (EAROM), or flash memory or a combination of two or more of these. This disclosure contemplates memory units MEM taking any suitable physical form. Memory units MEM may include one or more storage control units facilitating communication between signal processor SP and memory units MEM, where appropriate.","Herein, reference to a computer-readable storage medium encompasses one or more non-transitory, tangible computer-readable storage media possessing structure. As an example and not by way of limitation, a computer-readable storage medium may include a semiconductor-based or other integrated circuit (IC) (such, as for example, a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) or an application-specific IC (ASIC)), a hard disk, an HDD, a hybrid hard drive (HHD), an optical disc, an optical disc drive (ODD), a magneto-optical disc, a magneto-optical drive, a floppy disk, a floppy disk drive (FDD), magnetic tape, a holographic storage medium, a solid-state drive (SSD), a RAM-drive, a SECURE DIGITAL card, a SECURE DIGITAL drive, or another suitable computer-readable storage medium or a combination of two or more of these, where appropriate.

The amplitude of the electromagnetic field E transmitted via the first transmitting antenna SA may be the same or similar to the amplitude of the electromagnetic field E transmitted via the second transmitting antenna SA.","Using the three receiving antennas EA, EA and EA of transceiver SE, the respective three orthogonal components of the field strength of the field E received from the first transmitting antenna SA are determined. The three components of the field strength vector E are individually converted into digital signals in the A\/D converter AD and the corresponding digital signals are provided to the signal processor SP. In a similar manner, the three components of the field strength vector E as received by the three receiving antennas EA, EA and EA are digitized through the A\/D converter AD and provided to and processed in the signal processor SP. In some embodiments, signal processor SP may use the digitized information regarding field strength vectors E and E to determine information such as angles A, A, and A. Signal processor SP may also determine resultant vector R by summing field strength vectors E and E. Such information may be stored in memory MEM.","In some embodiments, the operations discussed above with respect to  may be performed using some or all of the components of . For example, base station BS and antennas AN, AN, and AN may be implemented using transceiver SE. As another example, key KE, antennas EN, EN, and EN, and Passive Entry\/Go module PEG may be implemented using transceiver SE.","In some embodiments, an advantage realized through system  may be that unauthorized extending of the communication path or link via a relay transceiver or the like can be detected in a reliable manner by transmitting multiple signals in a sequence followed by transmitting the same signals simultaneously. The calculated value(s) from the received signals from the signals transmitted in succession may be compared to the received signal(s) from the signals transmitted simultaneously to determine whether there is a match.","In some embodiments, the security against a redirection or relaying attack can be further increased by multiple iterations of the techniques discussed above. For example, the security can be increased by using more than two antennas in the techniques discussed above.","Another example advantage that may be present in some embodiments is that detecting a relay attack may be performed without using a high amount of storage or processing power. For example, in some embodiments, U.S. Pat. No. 6,970,679 discloses a manner of detecting a relay attack that uses more storage and\/or processing power than the present disclosure.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIGS. 1-2"]},"At step , in some embodiments, a communication session may be activated. For example, a communication session between car CA and key KE of  may be activated at this step. This may occur, in some embodiments, due to the proximity of the key KE to the car CA, or due to actions performed on car CA (such as pressing a button on car CA or lifting a handle of a door on car CA). Activating the session at this step may initiate a contactless data communication session. For example, it may cause car CA to begin an authentication communication session to determine whether or not to grant access to car CA or to feature(s) provided by car CA. In some embodiments, the communication session activated at this step may be for the purpose of performing functions such as turning on car CA, starting the engine, turning on or off lights, determining diagnostic information, accessing the trunk or other compartments of car CA, or other suitable functions.","At step , in some embodiments, successive signals may be transmitted. For example, after the activation in step , car CA may transmit a first signal from antenna AN and then subsequently a second signal from antenna AN of . As another example, more than two signals may be transmitted successively, such as sending a first signal from AN a second signal from AN and a third signal from antenna AN. The multiple signals sent from multiple antennas at this step may be the same, substantially the same, or different. For example, the multiple signals sent at this step may differ in amplitude, phase, or frequency.","At step , in some embodiments, the successive signals transmitted at step  may be received. For example, if at step  antennas AN and AN each transmitted a signal, then at step  key KE may receive the signals. Antennas EN, EN, and EN of key KE may be used in receiving the signals transmitted at step .","At step , in some embodiments, signals received at step  may be analyzed. For example, the orthogonal components corresponding to the X, Y, and Z axes may be determined at step . As another example, angles between the signals transmitted at step  and received at step  may be determined. For example, if signals E and E of  were transmitted at step , angles A, A, and A, may be determined at step . An expected signal may be determined at this step. For example, the expected signal may be the sum of the signals received at step . In some embodiments, signals E and E of  may be summed at this step to determine signal R of . At this step, properties of the signals transmitted at step  may be determined such as the amplitude, phase, and frequency of the transmitted signals. The analysis performed at this step may be performed by components illustrated in . For example, antennas EA, EA, and EA may be used to determine the orthogonal components of signals transmitted at step . Signal processor SP and memory unit MEM of  may be used to determine information regarding signals transmitted at step  such as angles A, A, A of  and characteristics of signals transmitted at step  such as amplitude, phase, and frequency. In various embodiments the analysis described at this step may be performed at key KE or at car CA of . For example, the signals received at step  may be received by key KE and analyzed by key KE. As another example, the signals transmitted at step  may be received by key KE and then copies of the received signals may be sent to car CA to perform the analysis described above. In some embodiments, information determined at step  may be stored (e.g., in memory unit MEM).","At step , in some embodiments, multiple antennas may transmit signals at the same time. The signals transmitted at step  may be retransmitted from the antennas all at the same time. For example, if antennas AN and AN transmitted successive signals at step  those same signals may be transmitted by antennas AN and AN at the same time instead of being transmitted successively as discussed in step . The signals transmitted at this step may have different amplitudes, phases, and\/or frequencies from each other.","At step , in some embodiments, the signals transmitted at step  may be received. For example, the signals transmitted simultaneously at step  may have been transmitted by antennas AN, AN, and\/or AN of  and may be received by key KE. As received, there may only be one signal as opposed to three separate signals since the signals were submitted simultaneously at step . For example, the signals may be combined over the air and received as one signal at step . The signals may be received by components such as antennas EN, EN, and EN of .","At step , in some embodiments, it may be determined whether the signal received at step  is validated. At this step, as an example, it may be determined whether the signals transmitted simultaneously correspond to the signals transmitted successively at step . Characteristics of the signal received at step  may be analyzed at this step including characteristics such as phase, frequency, and amplitude of the signal as well as its orthogonal components in the X, Y, and Z axes. For example, it may be determined whether the received signal is equal to the sum of the received successive signals at step  within a given tolerance specified by a technician or automatically specified. One or more of the following may be used to determine whether the signals are validated:","1. The length of the vector that represents the signal received at step  may be compared to the length of the vector representing the sum of the signals received at step . If the comparison shows that the lengths of these vectors are equal within a certain tolerance level (e.g., 5-10%) then the signals may be validated.","2. An angle between vectors that correspond to the signals transmitted successively at  (which may be considered an expected angle) may be compared to an angle calculated by comparing the signal received at step  to the signals received at step . For example, angle A of  may be determined through calculation based on the measurements of signal E and signal E and may be considered an expected angle. The expected angle A may be compared to a corresponding angle calculated from the signal received at step  (e.g., by comparing the signal received at step  to the signals received at step ). If the angle calculated based on the signal received at step  is equal to the expected angle within a given tolerance (e.g., 5-10%) the signal received at step  may be validated.","3. Calculated angles between a vector representing one of the signals received at step  and the vector representing the sum of the signals received at step  may be compared to a corresponding angle calculated based on the signal received at step . For example, angles A and\/or A of  may be determined based on signals E and E that may have been received at step . Angles A and A may be compared to corresponding angles calculated by comparing the signal received at step  with E and E. If these angles are equivalent to each other within a given tolerance level (e.g., 5-10%) then the signal received at step  may be validated.","If it is determined that the signals received at  is validated, then step  may be performed; if it is determined that the signal received at step  is not validated, then step  may be performed.","At step , in some embodiments, the communication session may end. This may occur because the signal received at  may not have been validated. Determining that the signal is not validated at step  may indicate a suspicion that a relay attack has occurred (e.g., that signals are being relayed such that devices that are remote to one another may communicate as if they were in proximity of another). The communication session may be ended so that access may not be granted. For example, car CA may determine not to further communicate because it has determined that the signal received at step  was not validated. As another example, key KE may determine that the signal received at step  was not validated and end the communication session.","At step , in some embodiments, the communication session activated at step  may continue. For example, key KE may continue communication with car CA once it has been determined at step  that the signal received at step  was validated. This may indicate that a relay attack is not occurring. In some embodiments key KE may transmit one or more messages that includes authentication information to car CA in order to gain access or activate one or more features of car CA. The communication session may continue on a different frequency band than used in the preceding steps. For example, the signals transmitted in steps  and  may be transmitted in the kilohertz range while one or more subsequent transmissions that occur at step  may occur in the megahertz range. In some embodiments, key KE may send signals that cause car CA to unlock one or more doors to allow entry into car CA at this step.","In some embodiments, the steps discussed above may be performed iteratively or multiple times with different type of signals. For example, the signals transmitted at step  and step  may vary in multiple iterations such as varying the amplitude phase and\/or frequency of the signals. In some embodiments, when performing validation at step , the results of previous iterations may be taken into account. For example, in order to perform the validation in step  it may be required that three iterations of validation occur with varying types of signals transmitted at step  and . This may provide for stronger protection from attacks such as relay attacks.","In some embodiments, additional steps may be performed. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,970,679 describes techniques to detect a relay attack that may be performed with the steps discussed above. One or more of the techniques discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,970,679 and may be evaluated at step . If those techniques indicate that a relay attack is occurring, then step  may be performed, otherwise step  may be performed as long as the signal received a step  has been validated. Other suitable additional steps may be performed.","Although several embodiments have been illustrated and described in detail, it will be recognized that modifications and substitutions are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the appended claims. For example, while the embodiments discussed above are with regard to a communication session between a vehicle and a key (such as car CA and key KE of ), the components and techniques discussed above with respect to  may be used within other suitable contexts. As examples, the disclosure above may be applied in a communication session: between a computing device (such as a computer, smartphone, or tablet) and a peripheral; between a terminal used for financial transactions and an identification element (such as an ATM card or credit card); to unlock a door in a building; and to gain access to a locker."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Reference is now made to the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numbers represent like parts and which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 3"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
