title: Virtual drive mapping
abstract: The automatic mapping of a set of physical drives to virtual drives is disclosed. Given a maximum set of n physical servers, S-S, and a maximum set of m physical drives, D-D, a mapping of a set of virtual drives, V-V, to the physical drives D-D, is created, assuming n and m are fixed and known, and one virtual drive is created per server. Physical drives of size Dsize are organized into a maximum of p “Stripe Sets” SS-SS, each Stripe Set containing an equal number of physical drives. Each virtual drive will have a size, Vsize=(m*Dsize)/n (rounded down to the nearest integer). Virtual drives are mapped sequentially to Stripe Sets, starting with Vmapped to SS. Successive virtual drives are mapped to Stripe Sets until all virtual drives have been mapped to a Stripe Set.

No. 11\/636,108, filed Dec. 8, 2006, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","This invention relates to the mapping of virtual drives to servers, and more particularly, to the automated mapping of virtual drives to servers in a system that allows for additional servers and physical drives to be subsequently added to the system in a manner that does not require any change to the original mapping.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0004","num":"0003"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","106","104","106","104","102","104","106","102","104"]},"Conventional blade servers  may be connected to redundant external switch fabrics  through an \u201cA\u201d side Input\/Output (I\/O) switch  and a \u201cB\u201d side I\/O switch , which plug into the midplane  from the back of the chassis . Typically, the redundancy enables one switch to take over if the other fails. In addition, the blade server midplane is typically plumbed to allow for multiple independent redundant fabrics or I\/O protocols, such as Fibre Channel (FC), Serial Attached SCSI (SAS), SATA, Ethernet or InfiniBand. In the case of a FC configuration, each embedded switch  and  may be a FC Arbitrated Loop (FC_AL) switch or a full fabric switch, with a separate port to receive a FC link  from each of the multiple server blades , and output ports for connecting to each of the external switched fabrics .","To enable the server blades  to communicate with the switch fabric, typically a mezzanine I\/O card  that performs a Host Bus Adapter (HBA) (a.k.a. I\/O Controller (IOC)) function is required in each server blade . These mezzanine I\/O cards  are typically mounted to the server blades  as daughter cards. Note that this may also be accomplished by embedding an IOC directly on the server blade. However, this increases complexity for the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), who must now make a different server blade for each type of I\/O that will be supported. For purposes of this specification, mezzanine I\/O cards , referred to herein, include both daughter cards and IOCs mounted directly onto the server blade. The output of a mezzanine I\/O card  is two I\/O links  routed to each of the two embedded switches  and . The mezzanine I\/O cards  follow the standard device driver model, so that when a server blade  with a mezzanine I\/O card  is plugged into the midplane  and connected to an embedded switch  or , it appears to be a standalone server with a Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) card communicating with an external switch.","Each conventional server blade  has traditionally included two disk drives  for redundancy. However, the compact nature of blade servers  and the desired small size of the server blades  means that the two disk drives  normally contained in each server blade take up valuable space.","Modern disk drives contain more storage capacity that is typically needed by a server blade, and thus diskless server blades have been developed in which the physical disk drives are located either in another board within the blade server (an \u201cembedded\u201d implementation) or even in an enclosure outside the blade server (e.g. a storage array connected to the blade server). One company that makes diskless server blades for non-FC applications is Engenera.","Diskless server blades boot off of virtual drives, which are formed within the physical drives. The mapping of server blades and virtual drives has conventionally been a manual process involving adjusting Basic Input\/Output System (BIOS) settings and setting up the storage array with a World-Wide Port Name (WWPN) that maps to the server blades and the blade server.","Heretofore, in both blade server and non-blade server applications, there has been no way to automatically create virtual drives and map servers to the virtual drives. However, if the maximum number of allowable servers and drives is known, then a processor executing firmware either within one of the servers or external to the servers can automatically create virtual drives from existing physical drives, map them to existing servers, and allow for servers and drives to be subsequently added to the system (up to the maximum allowable numbers) without disrupting the mapping.","Therefore, there is a need to automatically create virtual drives from existing physical drives and map existing servers to the virtual drives when the maximum number of allowable servers and drives is known, and also to allow for additional servers and drives (up to the maximum allowable numbers) to be added and mapped without disrupting the original mapping.","Embodiments of the present invention are directed to automatically mapping a set of physical drives to a larger number of virtual drives for use by a set of computer servers. Users of this invention will save costs, space and power by using fewer physical drives than the number of physical servers.","Given a maximum set of n physical servers, denoted S-S, and a maximum set of m physical drives, denoted D-D, embodiments of the present invention define a set of algorithms implemented in firmware to automatically create and ma{acute over (p)} a set of virtual drives, denoted V-V, to the physical drives D-D, given the following assumptions: (1) the maximum number of supported servers, n, is fixed and known, (2) the maximum number of supported physical drives, m, is fixed and known, and (3) one virtual drive is created per server (i.e. n total virtual drives are presented).","In the virtual drive mapping algorithm, all virtual drives are the same size. Striping (also known as a Redundant Array of Independent Disks 0 (RAID 0)) is used to map, the virtual drives to the physical drives. Physical drives are organized into \u201cStripe Sets,\u201d with each Stripe Set containing an equal number of physical drives. There are a maximum of p Stripe Sets denoted SS-SS. Because each Stripe Set has an equal number of drives, the maximum number of physical drives m, must be divisible by the maximum number of Stripe Sets, p, with mlp physical drives per Stripe Set.","To automatically configure a maximum set of m physical drives into a maximum set of n virtual drives, the number of physical drives currently installed in the system, NUMdrives, and the size (capacity) in bytes of the installed physical drives is first discovered by querying each drive for its capacity. The smallest reported capacity of any of the physical drives, Dsize, is then assumed to be the capacity of all physical drives that are installed, or will be installed, in the system.","Because there are a maximum of n virtual drives supported by a maximum of in physical drives of size Dsize, and all virtual drives are the same size, each virtual drive will have a size, Vsize, equal to the maximum total size of all physical drives, m times Dsize, divided by the maximum number of virtual drives n, rounded down to the nearest integer. In other words, Vsize=(m*Dsize)\/n (rounded down to the nearest integer).","Next, the number of Stripe Sets must be selected. A default value for the number of Stripe Sets may be used to provide automatic configuration. The number of Stripe Sets, p, must be greater than or equal to 1, and less than or equal to the maximum number of physical drives m, with m being divisible by p. In other words, 1\u2266p\u2266m, where m is divisible by p.","By default, embodiments of the present invention may select the number of Stripe Sets, p, to yield the smallest number of physical drives per Stripe Set greater than 1. Each Stripe Set has a size, SSsize, equal to the size of a single physical drive Dsize multiplied by the number of physical drives in a stripe set, m\/p. In other words, SSsize=Dsize*m\/p (rounded down to the nearest integer).","Virtual drives are mapped sequentially to Stripe Sets, starting with Vmapped to SS. Successive virtual drives are mapped to the Stripe Sets, in order, until all virtual drives have been mapped to a Stripe Set.","Next, a validation step may be performed in which computations are made to determine if any of the configuration assumptions are being violated. To validate the configuration, the number of drives present, NUMdrives, determined above, must be checked to ensure that it maps into an integer number of Stripe Sets. In other words, the number of physical drives present, NUMdrives, must be a multiple of the number of drives in a Stripe Set, m\/p.","The actual number of servers present, NUMservers, must be discovered by querying the interconnect to the servers. Next, to ensure that the number of servers present, NUMservers, can be supported by the number of physical drives present, NUMdrives, the virtual drives are mapped to the physical drives as described above.","If the configuration is not valid for any of the above reasons, the user may be notified of the cause of the problem, and provided with instructions to create a valid configuration. Typically, a valid configuration can be reached by adding a number of physical drives until all requirements are satisfied.","In the following description of preferred embodiments, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and in which it is shown by way of illustration specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of the preferred embodiments of the present invention.","Although embodiments of the present invention are described herein in terms of blade servers and server blades, it should be understood that the present invention is not limited to blade servers and server blades, but is generally applicable to any multiple-server system employing virtual drives. In addition, the present invention is not limited to systems that support FC, but includes InfiniBand, Ethernet, Serial Attached Small Computer System Interconnect (SAS) signaling and the like. Implementation of these protocols requires that the midplane or other connectivity support the protocols.","Embodiments of the present invention are directed to automatically mapping a set of physical drives to a larger number of virtual drives for use by a set of computer servers.

The n and m values may be provided to the firmware of the present invention. These assumptions enable virtual drives to be created and mapped to servers using current quantities of servers and physical drives, and allows for adding servers and physical drives up to the maximum numbers n and m without having to perform any re-mappings of virtual drives to servers. In alternative embodiments, there may be more than one virtual drive per server. The actual number of virtual drives present at any time is of course limited by the actual number of servers installed in the system.","In the virtual drive mapping algorithm, all virtual drives are the same size. Alternative embodiments may support different size virtual drives. (Size means the capacity, in bytes, of a drive, virtual or physical). Any number of servers, from 1 to n, can be supported. In general, a user would start with a smaller number of servers and add servers over time. When adding servers, the size of existing virtual drives remains fixed. Virtual drive sizes are not reduced.","Striping (also known as a Redundant Array of Independent Disks 0 (RAID 0)) is used to map the virtual drives to the physical drives. Striping is a technique to distribute data from a single virtual drive to multiple physical drives. Physical drives are organized into \u201cStripe Sets,\u201d with each Stripe Set containing an equal number of physical drives. There are a maximum of p Stripe Sets denoted SS-SSin the example of . Because each Stripe Set has an equal number of drives, the maximum number of physical drives m, must be divisible by the maximum number of Stripe Sets, p, with m\/p physical drives per Stripe Set. Any actual number of Stripe Sets, from 1 to p, can be supported, provided that enough actual Stripe Sets are present to support the number of servers present. It should be noted that  shows two physical drives per Stripe Set as an example only; other numbers of physical drives per Stripe Set are possible.","To automatically configure a maximum set of m physical drives into a maximum set of n virtual drives, the number of physical drives currently installed in the system, NUMdrives, and the size (capacity) in bytes of the installed physical drives is first discovered by querying each drive for its capacity. Query methods depend on the specific protocol being used, and the invention does not depend on any specific query method. As an example, the \u201cRead Capacity\u201d command can be used in the SCSI protocol to determine the block size and total number of blocks on a drive. The smallest reported capacity of any of the physical drives, Dsize, is then assumed to be the capacity of all physical drives that are installed, or will be installed, in the system. Note that using the smallest size of a single drive as the capacity of all drives leaves unused capacity on drives larger than Dsize, but simplifies the mapping algorithm and allows for expansion of the number of installed servers and physical drives (up to the assumed maximums n and m) without requiring re-mapping. If less than m physical drives are present during the initial discovery, then any new drives added must have a size greater than or equal to Dsize. If the new chive has a size smaller than Dsize, it results in an unsupported configuration. In this case, the user may be notified of the error, and provided with instructions to replace the drive with a different drive of capacity greater than or equal to Dsize.","Because there are a maximum of n virtual drives supported by a maximum of in physical drives of size Dsize, and all virtual drives are the same size, each virtual drive will have a size, Vsize, equal to the maximum total size of all physical drives, m times Dsize, divided by the maximum number of virtual drives n, rounded down to the nearest integer. In other words, Vsize=(m*Dsize)\/n (rounded down to the nearest integer).","Next, the number of Stripe Sets must be selected. The use of Stripe Sets, while optional, allows the flexibility to upgrade the number of physical drives as long as entire Stripe Sets are added at a time. Because physical drives must be added in quantities equal to complete Stripe Sets, the number of drives in a Stripe Set represents a \u201ccost granularity\u201d to the user. However, having more drives in a Stripe Set improves performance because it is faster to access information from multiple physical drives at the same time, so there is a trade off between cost granularity and performance. A default value for the number of Stripe Sets will be used to provide automatic configuration, although in alternative embodiments users can specify a different value to optimize cost granularity vs. performance for a given application. The number of Stripe Sets, p, must be greater than or equal to 1, and less than or equal to the maximum number of physical drives m, with m being divisible by p. In other words, 1\u2266p\u2266m, where m is divisible by p.","By default, embodiments of the present invention may select the number of Stripe Sets, p, to yield the smallest number of physical drives per Stripe Set greater than 1. Thus, if there is only one physical drive, then there will be one Stripe Set with one physical drive per Stripe Set. Note that if the maximum number of physical drives, m, is prime, then by default there will be only one Stripe Set with m physical drives per Stripe Set, resulting in the highest cost granularity. In alternative embodiments, other methods may be used to select the default number of Stripe Sets.","Each Stripe Set has a size, SSsize, equal to the size of a single physical drive Dsize multiplied by the number of physical drives in a stripe set, m\/p. In other words, SSsize=Dsize*m\/p (rounded down to the nearest integer).","The next step is to map the virtual drives to the physical drives. Physical drives are added to the system a Stripe Set at a time. Each Stripe Set can support a number of physical servers determined by the number of virtual drives that fit within a Stripe Set. Virtual drives are mapped sequentially to Stripe Sets, starting with Vmapped to SS. Virtual drives continue to be mapped to SSuntil SSdoes not have enough capacity left to support another virtual drive. The number of whole virtual drives mapped to SSis equal to the size of a Stripe Set divided by the size of a virtual drive, rounded down to the nearest integer. In other words, the number of whole virtual drives mapped to SSis equal to SSsize\/Vsize=(Dsize*m\/p)\/((m*Dsize)\/n)=(m\/p)\/(m\/n)=n\/p, rounded down to the nearest integer.","Unused capacity in SSis combined with enough capacity from the second Stripe Set SSto support the next sequential virtual drive. Virtual drives continue to be mapped to SSuntil it no longer has enough capacity to support the next virtual drive. This iterative process continues under control of firmware until all virtual drives have been mapped. During this process, because the firmware knows the size of each virtual drive, Vsize, and the size of each Stripe Set, SSsize, it can track how much of each Stripe Set is \u201cconsumed\u201d as each successive virtual drive is mapped to it, and in this manner iteratively determine which successive whole and partial virtual drives are mapped to successive Stripe Sets using straightforward calculations easily implemented by those skilled in the art. One example of this process is as follows: (1) map first virtual drive to first Stripe Set; (2) compute remaining space in Stripe Set; (3) as long as remaining space in Stripe Set\u2267Vsize, map next virtual drive to Stripe Set, compute new remaining space in Stripe Set, and repeat step (3); (4) when remaining space in Stripe Set<Vsize, map portion of next virtual drive equal to remaining space in Stripe Set to the Stripe Set, and map the remaining space in next virtual drive to next Stripe Set; and (5) repeat steps (2) through (4) until last virtual drive has been mapped to last Stripe Set.","Users may need to know how many total servers can be supported by a given number of Stripe Sets. If the number of installed Stripe Sets is s, the number of supported servers equals the total capacity of all installed Stripe Sets divided by the size of a virtual drive, rounded down to the nearest integer. From the equation above, the number of supported servers=s*n\/p (rounded down to the nearest integer).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"sub":["1 ","2 ","1","3 ","1 ","1 ","3 ","2","4 ","2","5 ","2","2 ","5 ","3","6 ","7 ","3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"91pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"70pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Number of Physical Drives","Number of","Number of"]},{"entry":["Present","Virtual Drives","Servers Supported"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["1","Not Supported","Not Supported"]},{"entry":["2","2","1 or 2"]},{"entry":["3","Not Supported","Not Supported"]},{"entry":["4","4","1, 2, 3 or 4"]},{"entry":["5","Not Supported","Not Supported"]},{"entry":["6","7","1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"Next, a validation step is performed in which computations are made to determine if any of the configuration assumptions are being violated. For example, if only D was installed (one physical drive installed) in , this would be an invalid configuration (see Table 1) because each Stripe Set requires two physical drives.","To validate the configuration, the number of drives present, NUMdrives, determined above, must be checked to ensure that it maps into an integer number of Stripe Sets. The number of drives in each Stripe Set is equal to the maximum number of physical drives m, divided by the number of Stripe Sets p. The number of physical drives present, NUMdrives, must be a multiple of the number of drives in a Stripe Set, m\/p. The number of Stripe Sets, s, is equal to the number of drives present, NUMdrives, divided by the number of drives in a stripe set, m\/p. In other words, s=NUMdrives\/(m\/p).","The actual number of servers present, NUMservers, must be discovered by querying the interconnect to the servers. Specific query methods vary based on interconnect and protocol, and the invention is not dependent on the specific methods. As an example, in Fibre Channel a PLOGI command can be used to determine whether or not a server is present, and obtain the WWN of the server if present. Next, to ensure that the number of servers present, NUMservers, can be supported by the number of physical drives present, NUMdrives, the virtual drives are mapped to the physical drives as described above. Of course, the number of servers present, NUMservers, must be less than or equal to the number of supported servers, In other words, NUMservers<=s*n\/p (rounded down to the nearest integer).","If the configuration is not valid for any of the above reasons, the user may be notified of the cause of the problem, and provided with instructions to create a valid configuration. Typically, a valid configuration can be reached by adding a number of physical drives until all requirements are satisfied.","The configuration may be re-validated as described above when drives or servers are added or removed. In particular, when drives are added, embodiments of the present invention may first verify that the size of all new drives is greater than or equal to Dsize.","In alternative embodiments of the present invention illustrated symbolically in the example of , automated mapping of virtual drives to servers as described above may be used in a configuration that uses RAID 1 (mirroring) on each server to provide high availability. In the example of , two independent sets of physical drives D-Dand D-Dcan be mapped using this invention to create two independent sets of virtual drives V-Vand V-V. Each server is mapped to two virtual drives of equal size, that in turn map to separate physical drives. RAID 1 on each server mirrors all writes to both virtual drives. Since all data is mirrored (copied) to both drives, no single drive failure will cause the system to fail.","In a RAID  application, the redundant virtual drives seen by each server should be equal in size. To achieve equal size virtual drives, each instance of the virtual drive mapping algorithm independently discovers the size of the lowest capacity physical drive present, Dsize. Each instance then communicates the Dsize it discovered, then both instances use the smaller of the two as a common Dsize. Additionally, when validating the configuration, both instances must communicate to ensure that the configuration present is supported.","Embodiments of the present invention can support more than one virtual drive per server, given a known maximum number of virtual drives. Such a variation might be useful to have multiple operating system images per server. For example, each server could have one virtual drive loaded with a Windows system image, and another virtual drive loaded with a Linux system image. Users could choose which virtual drive to use at boot time.","In a blade server environment, each physical port on an embedded storage concentrator is connected to a specific physical server slot. During the discovery process, a unique name (example: WWNN in Fibre Channel) is identified for each active server in each physical slot. A table can be created that saves the mapping of server names to physical slots. Each time a server is removed or inserted the invention can update the mapping table. If a server is removed from a physical slot and a new server is added with a different name in the same slot, the invention can detect this situation by comparing the server name of the new server with server name saved in the mapping table for that physical slot. Several options are possible for this situation. A user may desire that the existing virtual drive image be mapped to the new physical server to enable rapid restoration of existing applications on a new server when an existing server fails. The invention can be configured to automatically map an existing virtual drive and all of its data to a new physical server replacing a failed server in a specific physical slot. Additionally, if an existing server is moved from one physical slot to another physical slot, the invention can detect this case by searching the mapping table to find the server name of the server that was just inserted into a different slot. Since that server name was previously recorded in the mapping table in a different slot, the invention can detect that the server has been moved from one physical slot to another physical slot. In this case, one option is to map the existing virtual drive and all of its data to the new physical slot.","Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications will become apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as being included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 6"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
