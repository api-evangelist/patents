{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO CO-PENDING APPLICATION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application is a continuation-in-part of co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/982,330 filed Oct. 18, 2001 which claims the benefit of provisional Application Ser. No. 60\/241,313, filed Oct. 18, 2000 in the name of Robert D. Burgess, both entitled \u201cVEHICLE AIRBAG ARRESTOR\u201d, the contents of both of which are incorporated herein in their entirety.","Today's vehicles are provided with passenger restraint devices, such as inflatable airbags, which are mounted in various locations within the vehicle, including within the steering wheel.","Sensors mounted at appropriate locations within the vehicle provide a signal to an inflation device when a predetermined amount of force contact is made with another object. The inflation device generates or supplies a quantity of gas to inflate the airbag and thereby cushion the forward movement of the driver of the vehicle and resulting from a front collision.","While airbags have proven to be effective in saving people's lives by minimizing injuries during a front vehicle collision, it has been found that in certain circumstances the airbag inflation device may be armed, but may not have gone off. This armed stated lasts for a predetermined period of time, such as two minutes, before the inflation device resets itself to an inactive state.","Frequently, in serious collisions, the driver  trapped within the surrounding vehicle body and literally, the vehicle body must be cut away from the driver in order to remove the driver from the vehicle. The so-called \u201cjaws of life\u201d are used in such a situation. A further complication in vehicle collisions is that an emergency person, such as a fireman, E.M.S., etc., may be required to attend to a driver trapped within a vehicle until the vehicle sheet metal is cut away or removed to enable the driver to be removed from the vehicle. Such emergency persons may be required to give resuscitation, C.P.R., or other medical assistance until the driver can be removed from the vehicle and attended to in a more adequate facility, such as a hospital, E.M.S. vehicle, etc.","In such a circumstance, the emergency person's head can be situated between the airbag in the vehicle steering wheel and the driver's head. This places the emergency person's head in a precarious position, particularly where the airbag inflation sensor may have been activated, but, for some reason, the inflation device has not yet activated to inflate the airbag.","In the event that the airbag inflates under its considerable force and speed when the emergency person's head is between the airbag and the driver's head, the emergency person's head will be forced into the driver's head, thereby creating the potential for serious injury to the emergency person as well as to the driver.","One attempt to address this problem is an emergency service device in the form of a circular steel plate with two large hooks protruding from an upper portion. The rear side of the steel plate is fitted with a series of triangle deflators which engage and rip open the airbag. The main body of the steel plate is slotted to accommodate the adjustable placement of a secondary inner body in the form of a rectangular steel plate with two hooks protruding from a lower portion. When assembled together, the upper and lower portions of the two steel plates can be adjusted to accommodate different steering wheel dimensions. A tensioning knob extends through the circular plate and allows adjustment of the lower hooks on the inner plate. Once the hooks are securely in place, the tensioning knob is tightened. A dust cover is fastened around the steering wheel and the plate\/hook assembly and tightened in place about the steering column by a strapping band. Ventilation openings are provided between the inner surface of the dust cover and the steering column when the dust cover strap is tightened.","However, this prior attempt at an airbag arrestor addresses the aforementioned problems with a complicated, multi-part device which requires several attachment steps and a tightening operation to secure the main device in place, and an additional installation step to add the dust cover. This takes time and can be a cumbersome task in the typically confined space existing in a crushed vehicle after a collision. At the same time, the dust cover in this device provides only a dust containment enclosure for the smoke and debris emitted by the airbag module during airbag inflation. The dust cover is not intended to suppress the entire airbag inflation as it is only provided as a dust and debris control enclosure.","Thus, it would be desirable to alleviate these potential problems. It would also be desirable to provide a device which contains the inflation of a vehicle airbag without significant expansion of the airbag. It would also be desirable to provide an airbag containment device which can be easily employed by an emergency person, preferably by one hand. It would also be desirable to provide an airbag containment device which can be repeatedly used in many emergency situations.","The present invention is an vehicle airbag arrestor which uniquely arrests and contains the inflation pressures in the vehicle airbag when the airbag arrestor is mounted about a vehicle steering wheel and steering column.","In one aspect, the airbag arrestor of the present invention includes a flexible, high strength enclosure having an open end. An attachment means is mountable about the enclosure to non-axially movably mount the enclosure about a vehicle steering column and a vehicle steering wheel containing an airbag module. The high strength, yet flexible nature of the material employed to form the airbag arrestor enclosure enables the enclosure to be easily mounted about a vehicle steering wheel and airbag module and a portion of the vehicle steering column and be securely fixed in place by the attachment means; while at the same time having sufficient strength to resist any substantial axial movement of the end of the enclosure with respect to the vehicle steering column and steering wheel so as to contain and redirect the explosive forces generated during airbag inflation.","The attachment means is, in one aspect, in the form of a strap or cord which is carried on the enclosure or is attachable to the enclosure. A connector can be mounted on the strap to enable a free end of the strap to be tightened about the enclosure to conform a sidewall of the enclosure adjacent to the open end tightly about the vehicle steering column while still allowing ventilation through the open end of the enclosure.","In another aspect, the connector includes at least one and possibly two biased latched members mounted in a body through which both ends of the strap or cord extend. Either free end of the cord can be drawn in one direction away from the body to tighten the cord about the enclosure. However, the latch members prevent reverse loosening movement of the strap thereby maintaining the strap in the tightened position until the associated latch member is moved to an unlatched position. In this position, one end of the strap or cord can be pulled through the latch thereby loosening the strap for removal of the enclosure from the steering column.","In another aspect of the invention, the airbag arrestor includes an enclosure having a closed end wall, an opposed open end and a sidewall. The enclosure defines an interior cavity between the end wall and the open end to be mountable over a vehicle steering wheel. An attachment member is mountable about the open end of the enclosure to substantially, non-axially, movably mount the enclosure over a vehicle steering wheel.","The airbag arrestor also includes at least one or more apertures formed in the sidewall of the enclosure.","In another aspect, the sidewall of the enclosure includes a plurality of flaps extending from the end wall to an opposed free end, each flap having opposed side edges. At least a portion of the side edges of two adjacent flaps are spaced apart to define the aperture therebetween.","In another aspect, the end wall of the enclosure includes shape support means, coupled to the end wall, for maintaining the shape of the end wall.","The support means includes a shape support member coupled to the end wall. The end wall further includes first and second spaced panels, the shape support means disposed between the spaced panels.","In another aspect, reinforcement means are coupled to the end wall for reinforcing the end wall.","The reinforcing means may include at least one strap coupled to the end wall. Alternately, the reinforcement means is a plurality of straps coupled to the end wall. At least two of the reinforcement straps may have overlapped portions.","In another aspect, the attachment member includes a strap disposed about the open end of the sidewall of the enclosure, and a connector, coupled to the strap for receiving a free end of the strap to releasible tighten the strap and the open end of the enclosure to a reduced diameter.","In another aspect, the strap is carried on the enclosure.","In another aspect, the sidewall includes a plurality of spaced straps extending from one end coupled to the end wall to opposed free end. Carrying means are formed on the free end of each flap for receiving the strap therethrough. The carrying means may be a pocket carried on the free end of each flap.","The airbag arrestor of the present invention overcomes certain deficiencies found in prior art airbag arrestors in that the present airbag arrestor may be easily and quickly installed and secured in a fixed, substantially non-axially movable position about a vehicle steering column and steering wheel without requiring an excessive number of mounting steps. The present airbag arrestor may be secured in place about the vehicle steering column by an essentially one hand operation which can be crucial in emergency conditions.","The present airbag arrestor uniquely confines and redirects the explosive gasses generated during airbag inflation away from the outer end of the airbag arrestor enclosure. This provides increased safety to emergency personnel which may have his or her head positioned between the airbag in the vehicle steering wheel and the driver while giving emergency care or attempting to remove the driver from the vehicle.","Referring now to the drawing, and to  in particular, there is depicted a first aspect of an airbag arrestor  according to the present invention. The airbag arrestor  is in the form of an enclosure  formed of a strong, but flexible material. The enclosure  has a generally cylindrical portion  extending from a first end  to an opposed second end . A generally flat end wall  is formed at the second end  of the sidewall . The enclosure  is preferably formed of a one-piece construction, although the sidewall  and the end wall  may be formed as separate panels or members which are securely joined together, such as by stitching, etc.","The first end  defines an interior opening end having a diameter sufficient to enable the first end  to be slid over a vehicle steering wheel  shown in phantom in .","Although the enclosure  preferably has the shape shown in , it will be understood that the enclosure  may take other shapes, such as a generally spherical shape extending from the first end .","In general, the enclosure  is formed with a steering wheel encompassing portion formed adjacent to the end wall  and a steering column attachment portion adjacent to the first end .","The enclosure  has a suitable length to facilitate easy mounting over a vehicle steering wheel  while enabling the first end  to be cinched down or tightened to a small diameter to hold the enclosure  securely and substantially non-movably on a vehicle steering column  to which the steering wheel  is mounted. The sidewall  may have a length sufficient to dispose the first end  over the steering column  axially over any elongated levers, such as a transmission shift lever, windshield wiper control lever, etc., which are typically mounted on vehicle steering columns to control various vehicle operating circuits and devices. Alternately, the sidewall  may have an elongated length sufficient to enable the first end  to be disposed entirely over all such levers and further along the length of the steering column  while enabling the first end  to be cinched down to a small diameter substantially in tight engagement with the outer diameter of the steering column .","The enclosure  is preferably formed of a lightweight, flexible, yet strong material. One preferred material is ballistic material used in soft body armor. KEVLAR is a typical aramide fiber employed in such soft body armor. While the use of ballistic material is preferred, it will be understood that the enclosure  may be formed of other strong, but flexible materials having sufficient strength to not expand to any significant degree despite the full force inflation of an airbag within the interior of the enclosure  as described hereafter.","Attachment means  are mounted on the enclosure , generally adjacent the first end  as shown in  and in greater detail in . The attachment means  functions to enable the first end  of the enclosure  to be expanded to its full open diameter; yet to be able to be cinched or tightly secured in a significantly smaller diameter in secure, substantially non-movable engagement about the vehicle steering column . Ideally, the attachment means  provide such tightening engagement of the first end  of the enclosure  about a vehicle steering column  through a one-handed operation as described hereafter.","One aspect of the attachment means  is shown in . The attachment means  include an elongated strap  preferably formed of a strong, lightweight, flexible material, such as ballistic material, i.e., ballistic grade polyamide, such as NYLON, etc. The strap  has a first end  and an opposed second end . Portions of the strap  are wound about shafts or legs  and , respectively, mounted in a connector .","As shown in , the second end  of the strap  is wound about the shaft  at one end of the connector  after the portion of the strap  adjacent to the second end  is passed underneath one end leg  of the connector , around the shaft  and then into engagement with an adjoining portion of the strap . Securement means, such as stitching , are employed to join the second end  of the strap  to an adjoining portion of the strap .","The upper portion  of the strap  extends from the point of attachment to the second and is slidably mounted about the first end  of the enclosure , such as by passing the strap  through loops or other securement means  formed on the enclosure . Thus, the portion  of the strap  extends completely around the periphery of the first end  of the enclosure  to a portion  shown in  which loops around the first shaft  in the connector , passes under an opposite end leg , and terminates in the first end .","In this arrangement, the first end  of the strap  is movable away from the connector  to tighten the strap  and the first end  of the enclosure  in a smaller diameter in tight engagement with the exterior of the vehicle steering column  as shown in . The end portion of the strap  extending from the first end  is held underneath the end leg  of the connector  to tightly retain the strap  in any tightened diameter. Upward movement on the leg  of the connector  will release the cinching force thereby enabling the strap  to be re-expanded to its normal, enlarged diameter.","Use of the airbag arrestor  will now be described in conjunction with . As shown in , an airbag  is mounted within the vehicle steering wheel  rotatably affixed to the vehicle steering column . Although not shown in , a conventional transmission shift lever, windshield wiper control lever, headlight control lever, etc., are normally mounted on the vehicle steering columns. However, an ignition key switch  is depicted by way of example only.","First, the first end  of the enclosure  will be expanded to its fullest diameter and the open first end  will be slid over the steering wheel . The enclosure  will be pulled over the steering wheel  until the end wall  is disposed in contact with or in close proximity to the steering wheel . The attachment means or strap  will then be grasped at one end, such as the free first end , and pulled to tightly compress the first end  of the enclosure  into secure engagement with the exterior surface of the vehicle steering column .","In this position, the airbag arrestor  of the present invention is securely mounted on the steering column  so as not to exhibit any substantial axial movement away from the steering wheel  in a direction toward the vehicle driver. However, due to the flexible nature of the side wall  and end wall  of the enclosure , some expansion in overall size may occur; but not to any significant amount. The enclosure  will contain any inflation of the airbag . The gases used to inflate the airbag  will escape through the first end  of the enclosure .","After the airbag arrestor  is no longer needed, the connector  is released and the strap  expanded to its full diameter enabling the enclosure  to be removed from the vehicle steering wheel .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["70","10","70","72","74","32","48","76","78","72","76","78","80","78","76"]},"The first end  of the latch member  is provided with a secure gripping surface , such as knurling, serrated teeth, etc., which dig into and engage the strap  looped around one end of the body .","A hand release surface  is provided at the opposite end of the latch member  for pivoting the latch member  in the direction to disengage the gripping surface  from the strap  thereby enabling the strap  to be retracted with respect to the body  so as to enable the first end  of the enclosure  to be expanded to its fullest diameter.","At the same time, the first end  and the strap  may be pulled under force through the latch member . The gripping surface  prevents reverse movement of the strap  unless the hand release surface  is engaged to pivot the gripping surface  away from the strap .","Another aspect of the latch or connector member according to the present invention is shown in . In this aspect, a strap  is in the form of a cord, formed of ballistic grade NYLON, for example, having first and second free ends  and , respectively. Both ends of the strap  extend through bores in a latch body . From the latch body , the two ends of the cord  extend through a folded-over portion on the first end  of the enclosure .","The latch body  carries two identical latch members  and , each of which is provided with a gripping surface  at one end. The gripping surfaces  are disposed in the bores in the latch body . Biasing springs  carried on the latch body  bias the latch members  and  into a position in which the gripping surfaces  fixedly engage the two portions of the cords  to prevent reverse movement of the two portions of the cords through the body . However, downward pivotal movement of one end of either latch member  and  will disengage the gripping surface  from the respective portion of the cord  thereby enabling the respective portion of the cord  to be pulled through the latch body  to enable the diameter of the first end  of the enclosure  to be expanded.","Reverse directional pulling of either end ,  of the cord  away from the latch body  reduces the length of the cord  within the first end  of the enclosure  thereby reducing the diameter of the first end  to enable the first end  to conform in snug engagement with the vehicle steering column.","Referring now to , there is depicted another aspect of an air bag arrestor  according to the present invention. In this aspect, the airbag arrestor  also includes an enclosure  formed of a lightweight, flexible, yet strong material. One preferred material is ballistic material used in soft body armor. KEVLAR is a typical aramide fiber employed in such armor. Other strong, but flexible materials having sufficient strength so as not to expand to any significant degree despite the full force inflation of an airbag within the interior of the enclosure  can also be used to form the enclosure .","The enclosure  includes an end wall , a sidewall, generally denoted by reference number , and an end  opposed from the end wall .","The end wall  generally is formed of at least one substantially circular shaped fabric panel and, possibly, two spaced panels joined at peripheral edges to define an interior cavity. For example, as shown in , the end wall  may be formed of a first end panel , and an opposed end panel , both joined together about their peripheral edges by stitching or integral formation. The spaced end panels  and  define an interior cavity in which a shape support means  is disposed. The shape support means  retains the rather flexible end panels  and  in the desired generally circular shape consistent with the circular shape of a steering wheel adjacent which the end wall  is disposed in a mounted position shown, for example, in . The shape support  may be formed of a semi-flexible, sponge rubber, cardboard, or other minimally flexible, semi-rigid materials.","As shown in , in one aspect of the invention, reinforcement means in the form of one or more reinforcing strips denoted by reference numbers A, B, C, D are mounted on the inner surface of the end wall , such as to the inner surface of the end panel . The reinforcement straps A\u2013D are formed of a suitable high strength material, such as 500 pound polypropylene dropline, for example.","Each reinforcement strap A\u2013D has at least one end which extends from one side of the enclosure  to an opposite end. The opposite of one or more of the reinforcement straps, A\u2013D can extend to an opposed edge or terminate within the periphery of the end panel  as for the strap A shown in .","Also, additional strength may be provided by overlapping a portion of two or more reinforcement straps A\u2013D as also shown in .","The reinforcement straps A\u2013D may be fixedly mounted to the end panel  by means of adhesive or by stitching each reinforcement strap A\u2013D to one surface of the end panel , such as the surface of the end panel  facing away from the shape support member .","The sidewall , in this aspect of the invention, includes at least one and potentially a plurality of apertures each denoted by reference number . Although the one or more apertures  may be formed as individual apertures having a completely closed periphery surrounded by portions of the sidewall , in one aspect of the invention, the apertures  in the sidewall  are formed by plurality of flaps, each denoted by reference number . Each flap  is joined at one end to the end wall  and extends continuously to an opposed, inner, free movable end . Each flap  also includes opposed side edges  and  which generally taper in a planar or acuate manner from a larger width spacing at the end wall  to a smaller width or spacing at the inner end . The apertures  are formed between opposed side edges  and  of two adjacent flaps  and extend to the inner ends  of two adjacent flaps .","As shown in , the airbag arrestor  also includes an attachment means  which is securable to the enclosure  and functions to tightly confine the inner ends  of the flaps  about a vehicle column , shown by example in , with the end wall  disposed adjacent to the vehicle steering wheel. The attachment means  securely holds the airbag arrestor  over the steering wheel and prevents substantial expansion or movement during an inadvertent or unexpected inflation of the vehicle airbag mounted within the steering wheel.","As in the first aspect of the invention described above and shown in , the attachment means  includes an elongated strap  formed of a strong, lightweight, flexible material, such as ballistic material, i.e., ballistic grade polyamide, such as NYLON, etc. The strap  may be formed of 3800 pound NYLON drop line.","The strap  may be mounted on or integrally carried as part of the airbag arrestor . As shown in , the inner end  of each flap  is folded over and stitched to itself along stitch line  to form a hollow pocket. The strap  extends through the circumferentially spaced pockets  in the flaps  with the opposed ends of the strap  releasibly secured together by means of a connector or cinch .","The cinch  may be the same as the connector  described above and shown in . Typically, one end of the strap  is wound around a pin at one end of the cinch  and secured to itself along a stitch line. The opposite end  of the strap  is inserted through a pivotal lock member which can be pivoted to a position opening a slot between one end of the pivot member and an adjacent pin  on the cinch  to allow the end  of the strap  to be pulled therethrough thereby reducing the diameter of the inner ends  of the flaps  to securely conform the inner ends  of the flaps  tightly about a steering column as shown in . Release of the lock member closes the slot thereby tightly holding the end of the strap  in the tightened position and preventing substantial loosening of the strap. However, a subsequent pivotal movement of the lock member to a slot opening position will allow movement of the end  of the strap  relative to the cinch  to enable the entire airbag arrestor  to be removed from a vehicle steering column .","Referring now to , there is depicted a use or mounted position of the airbag arrestor . Prior to mounting over the steering wheel and steering column, the diameter of the inner ends  of the flaps  is expanded by movement of the free end of the strap  relative to the cinch . This enables the ends  of the flaps  to be expanded sufficiently to allow mounting of the free ends  of the flaps  over the steering wheel.","With the enclosure  in a position in which the end wall  is disposed adjacent to the steering wheel, the free end  of the strap  is pulled through the cinch  thereby reducing the diameter of the end  of the flaps  to bring the ends  of the flaps  into tight, non-movable engagement with a portion of the steering column .","In this position, as shown in , the apertures  are formed between the adjacent side edges  and  of two adjacent flaps . The apertures  function as an escape passage for inflation gases generated during inflation of an airbag. These ready gas egress passages enable the inflation gases of an inflating airbag to be quickly dissipated thereby minimizing the amount of force exerted on the end wall  which would tend to cause longitudinal movement of end wall  relative to the steering wheel.","Thus, there has been disclosed an airbag arrestor which uniquely arrests and contains the inflation pressures in a vehicle airbag when the airbag arrestor is mounted about a vehicle steering wheel and steering column. The airbag arrestor includes a flexible enclosure which can be easily mounted in a substantially non-expandable manner about a vehicle steering wheel. Attachment means in the form of a strap or cord is carried at an open end of the enclosure and extends through a connector to enable the first end of the enclosure to be cinched into a tightened, small diameter shape in secure engagement about a vehicle steering column, typically by a one-handed operation, to prevent substantial axial movement of the airbag arrestor enclosure along the vehicle steering column under airbag inflation forces."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The various features, advantages and other uses of the present invention will become more apparent by referring to the following detailed description and drawing in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIGS. 1 and 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 6"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIGS. 6 and 7"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIGS. 6\u20138"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
