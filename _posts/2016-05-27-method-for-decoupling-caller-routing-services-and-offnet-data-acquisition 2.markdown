title: Method for decoupling caller routing services and off-net data acquisition
abstract: Call routing system and method for routing calls based upon an initiator's current location in a wireless communications network. The call routing system includes an interface to receive incoming communications directed to an identifier identifying different geographic locations of destination party. Interactive unit interacts with off-network providers. Call routing process is created to determine, based on the current location of the initiator, which geographic location to direct the communication and gateway mediation process is created to inquire from off-network service the current location of the initiator, to receive location data related to the initiator's current location, and to return the received location data to the call routing process. Interactive unit is configured to terminate communication to geographic location of the destination party based on the initiator's current location. Incoming communication and terminating communication are bridged at interactive unit.

No. 14\/317,509 filed Jun. 27, 2014, which claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119(e) of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/858,356 filed Jul. 25, 2013, the disclosures of which are expressly incorporated by reference in their entireties.","1. Field of the Invention","Embodiments of the present invention pertain to a system and method for properly routing telephone calls made by callers using the public telecommunications network. Specifically, embodiments relate to a method for incorporating a commercial location and data services that reside on remote computer networks and are available only via so-called web services, into an interactive voice response system to provide superior call routing and caller abandon rates.","2. Discussion of Background Information","The workhorse of the public telecommunications network, plain old telephone service (POTS) has historically been highly geographic in nature: every POTS number is essentially tied to a loop of copper from the local telephone company facility to its subscribers' homes or offices. The original design of the landline network, together with the rules used to assign telephone numbers to these facilities, resulted in a dependable and reasonably accurate correlation between a caller's telephone number and their physical, geographic location.","Many businesses still rely upon this correlation in order to properly handle inbound calls using special techniques to route callers to the office, store or service location that best pertains to some aspect of the caller's location, e.g., geographic coordinates, state, county, zip code, time zone, et al. In addition, some businesses require the caller's location in order to determine the appropriate interactive voice response (IVR) treatment, i.e., direct termination, call-prompt, county-routing, etc. The location of the caller is inferred by cross-referencing the area code and exchange of the caller's telephone number with telecommunications databases which give the geographic location of the local telephone company's facility that provides service to the caller.","Such databases are readily available from a number of sources, e.g. Telcordia Technology's \u201cLocal Exchange Routing Guide\u201d; these databases are normally uploaded to a data storage and retrieval facility which is housed close to the equipment used to route calls, and are accessible via an internal local area network; such databases are said to be \u201con-net\u201d. In general, on-net assets reside on high performance hardware and networks, with very low levels of latency and errors. Call routing services use on-net databases to determine the appropriate service location for a given inbound call.","Several factors have combined to significantly erode the correlation between caller's telephone numbers and their geographic location. Most notable is the proliferation of mobile telephones, which surpassed landline telephones in 2005; by 2013, more than one-third of Americans relied solely on their mobile phone, and a mobile phone was the primary telephone in more than half of US households. Although some of these devices are used within their original area codes' service areas, rarely are they used exclusively at the subscribers' homes, and frequently they're used outside their original area codes' service areas.","In addition, changes in the way blocks of new telephone numbers are assigned to telecommunications carriers, including wireless carriers, and especially those carriers whose networks are based on \u201cvoice over IP\u201d (VoIP) technology, and a de facto loosening of the rules used to assign numbers to underlying facilities, have also served to compromise the correlation between telephone number and inferred location.","All of these factors have combined to make it increasingly problematic to provide proper routing for inbound telephone calls.","Since the nature of wireless telecommunications requires that wireless carriers know the physical location of mobile devices, wireless carriers have designed and built the appropriate location technologies into their wireless communications networks and control systems. Wireless carriers have leveraged these capabilities to offer a variety of so-called \u201clocation-based services\u201d (LBS) directly to their own subscribers; they also offer access to their networks' location platforms to qualified aggregators. These aggregators function as a clearinghouse, providing a wide range of value-added services that seamlessly span a number of disparate wireless carriers. For example, Syniverse is a location-based service provider, offering access to the latitude and longitude of a number of wireless carriers' mobile subscribers, via real-time queries and common web-based application objects, over the public internet. Due to the fact that this information is derived from network telemetry in real-time, it can only be accessed remotely.","Access to other telecommunications databases is readily available; such databases contain a range of information about telephone numbers, including billing addresses. For example, AT&T's \u201cInformation Retrieval Service\u201d provides a wide variety of information about a given telephone number, and Neustar's \u201cPower Port Search\u201d provides access to a number of authoritative telecommunications databases\u2014again, via real-time queries and common web-based application objects, over the public internet. Due to the size, complexity, fluidity, and proprietary nature of these databases, it is not feasible that they would be downloaded to others' platforms\u2014they are only accessible remotely, via the technologies described above.","Such remotely accessible real-time information and databases are said to be \u201coff-net\u201d. In general, off-net assets tend to have a very different performance profile: retrieval times are often measured in seconds, as opposed to milliseconds; for example, the time required to derive the location of a mobile caller can vary from 4 to 16 seconds. Error rates can also be orders of magnitude higher; whereas an on-net database might have an error rate of 108, the figure for an off-net service could reasonably be 10.","The difference between on-net and off-net performance figures is all the more critical in light of the abandon rates for calls processed by IVRs, which tend to rise dramatically the longer a caller must wait for their call to be routed.","What is wanted, then, is a technique that allows the IVR to manage a caller's telephone experience independently of the off-net application gateways' performance characteristics\u2014a technique that affords call routing services the ability to interact with off-net providers to obtain critical routing data, while at the same time retaining the flexibility to manage that interaction using best practices for interactive voice response.","Note that although networks and systems based on E911 technologies are indeed capable of routing calls based on location, these algorithms are entirely unsuited for commercial use, due to the length of time required to route the call. Emergency callers have no alternative but to wait up to 30-45 seconds for the network to resolve their location; it is common experience that someone calling in response to a billboard, print or radio advertisement would abandon the call in a small fraction of this time.","For the purpose of this invention, an \u201cInteractive Voice Response unit\u201d (IVR) is a computer controlled system, which can be a collection of computer hardware and software, that accepts incoming telephone calls and routes said telephone calls.","For the further purpose of this invention, \u201crouting a telephone call\u201d refers to the execution of the appropriate voice prompts and computer algorithms in conjunction with database tables and application gateways of other, e.g., third party, service providers to determine the service location to which an incoming telephone call should be delivered.","For the further purpose of this invention, an \u201cinbound telephone call\u201d refers to the event of a telephone subscriber placing a call, and subsequent presentation of that call to the telecommunications carrier which has ultimate responsibility for delivering the call to the proper service location.","For the further purpose of this invention, \u201capplication gateway web services\u201d refers to commercial information services that are accessible over internet protocol-based networks via web application programming interfaces (APIs) built around Representational State Transfer (REST) protocols, which rely on Javascript Object Notation (JSON) for message format and the Hypertext Transmission Protocol (HTTP) for message negotiation and transmission.","For the further purpose of this invention, \u201crequest payload\u201d refers to the collection of information necessary to make a complete and well-formed query to an application gateway's web service; \u201cresponse payload\u201d refers to the collection of information returned from the gateway in response to such queries.","Since callers expect calls to be routed quickly, and since application gateways have distinct performance and latency profiles which are significantly less predictable than local data stores and can vary over time within and across gateways, it is a further aspect of this invention to provide a method to allow an IVR to avail itself of a separate software agent to mediate the interaction between the IVR program execution and the third parties' application gateways' web services, essentially decoupling the callers' telephone experience from the gateways' performance.","It is a further aspect of this invention to provide a technique whereby, if an inbound call cannot be successfully routed, the IVR will send the call to a call center to be routed manually, or will simply route the call on the basis of the location attributes of the caller's telephone number itself.","It is a further aspect of this invention to provide a method whereby, after having obtained a caller's location data, e.g., latitude and longitude coordinates, from an application gateway web service, the IVR can translate that data, e.g., coordinates, into other pertinent location attributes which may be required in order to properly route the call, e.g., telephone area code and exchange, zip code, county, and time zone.","Embodiments of the invention are directed to a call system for bridging a communication connection between an initiator and a destination party based upon a current location of the initiator within a wireless communications network. The calling system includes a communication interface configured to receive from the initiator an incoming communication directed to an identifier of the destination party, which identifies a number of different geographic locations in which the destination party is located; and an interactive unit configured to interact with off-network third party service providers via application gateways of the off-network third party service providers, the interactive unit comprising a communications control service operable to bridge at the communication interface the incoming communication of the initiator with one of the geographic locations of the destination party, based on the current location of the initiator. A call routing process is created by the communication control service to determine, based on a current location of the initiator, which of the geographic locations of the destination party the incoming communication should be directed; and a gateway mediation is process created by the call routing process to communicate with least one of the off-network third party service providers to inquire as to the current location of the initiator and to receive location data related to the initiator's current location, and to return the received location data to the call routing process. The call routing process is further configured to determine the initiator's current location from the received location data, to determine to which of the different geographic locations in which the destination party is located is the one of the geographic locations of the destination party to which the incoming communication should directed, and to return the one of the geographic locations of the destination party to the communications control service; and the communications control services is further configured establish a terminating communication to the one of the geographic locations of the destination party based on the initiator's current location via the communications network interface, whereby the incoming communication and the terminating communication are bridged at the communication interface. The incoming call does not originate over a land line device.","According to embodiments, the incoming communication can originate from one of a cell phone, voice over IP system, or the Internet.","In accordance with other embodiments, the call routing system may also include a database storing a plurality of sounds; and a processor configured to transmit at least some of the plurality of sounds to the initiator in a time period between the creation of the gateway mediation process and the response received from the off-network third party service providers.","In other embodiments, via peer creation, the gateway mediation process can be created by a gateway request from the call routing process that comprises a request identifier and a service request payload. The received location data returned to the call routing process from the gateway mediation process may include the request identifier and a response payload comprising the received location data. Further, a separate gateway mediation process may be created for each of the off-network third party location services. Also, new mediation processes can be created for each new incoming communication.","According to still other embodiments of the invention, after returning the received location data to the call routing process, the gateway mediation process can be terminated.","In other embodiments, after returning the one of the geographic locations of the destination party to the communications control service, the call routing process can be terminated.","In accordance with still other embodiments, the received location data may include at least a latitude and longitude for the initiator's current location.","In other embodiments, the call routing process may be configured to determine from the latitude and longitude of the initiator's current location to at least one of: an area code and exchange; a zip code; a county; and a time zone.","According to still other embodiments, the identifier of the destination party can be a toll free telephone number or an Internet website.","Embodiments of the invention are directed to a method for bridging a communication connection between an initiator and a destination party based upon a current location of the initiator within a wireless communications network. The method includes receiving from the initiator an incoming communication directed to an identifier of the destination party, which identifies a number of different geographic locations in which the destination party is located and interacting, via an interactive unit comprising a communications control service, with off-network third party service providers via application gateways of the off-network third party service providers by:\n\n","According to embodiments, the incoming communication can originate from one of a cell phone, voice over IP system or the Internet.","In accordance with other embodiments of the invention, the returned received location data can include data points in a coordinate system, and the method further comprises converting the data points to at least one of: an area code and exchange; a zip code; a county; and a time zone.","In other embodiments, the creating of the gateway mediation process may include peer creation of a gateway request from the call routing process that comprises a request identifier and a service request payload.","In still other embodiments, the received location data returned to the call routing process from the gateway mediation process can include the request identifier and a response payload comprising the received location data.","According to other embodiments, a separate gateway mediation process may be created for each of the off-network third party location services.","In other embodiments, new mediation processes can be created for each new incoming communication.","According to still other embodiments, after returning the received location data to the call routing process, the method further may include terminating the gateway mediation process.","In accordance with still yet other embodiments of the present invention, after returning the one of the geographic locations of the destination party to the communications control service, the method can further include terminating the call routing process.","Other exemplary embodiments and advantages of the present invention may be ascertained by reviewing the present disclosure and the accompanying drawing.","The particulars shown herein are by way of example and for purposes of illustrative discussion of the embodiments of the present invention only and are presented in the cause of providing what is believed to be the most useful and readily understood description of the principles and conceptual aspects of the present invention.
