The system includes a central controller and one or more power switch routers (PSR). The one or more PSRs are networkable and the controller and one or more PSRs communicate by a wireless connection. The central controller and the one or more PSRs may be coupled in a network, where the network may be either a star network or a mesh network, or a combination of a star and mesh network. The resulting network is a scalable AC power switch network that may be remotely or locally controlled with advanced metering telemetry. To reduce vampire power, the PSRs are able to accurately measure the power consumption, measuring the neutral power line, and communicate information to the central controller.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","DEFINITIONS"],"p":["The present application generally relates to apparatus and methods of monitoring, controlling and reducing power in electronic devices and systems, specifically the standby or vampire power.","Government agencies, utility agencies and customers are becoming aware of the real cost of producing electricity. These increasing costs of production, the effects on the environment, and the dependence on foreign resources has driven our economy to develop alternative \u201cgreen\u201d, more localized, energy production systems. One area that has not garnered as much attention is the waste of electricity and most importantly, the standby or \u201cvampire\u201d power consumption. This is the power consumed by electronic devices when they are switched off or in a stand-by mode. On average, household electronics may consume 40% of their electricity while the devices are in stand-by mode. An energy policy that identifies sources of waste (including stand-by power) and develops a methodology to mitigate and control them is now feasible due to the recent advances in technology.","Stand-by power has exponentially increased with the advances in new electronic appliances and devices. The devices now have remote controls, quick starts and stand-by modes that continue to use power while plugged in, regardless if the device is being used or not. Homes and offices, big and small, throughout the country have millions of electronic devices plugged to the AC power outlets (or outputs) continuously, with the vast majority in an idling\/standing-by mode the majority of the day. In this stand-by mode, power consumption is certainly not negligible. Typically, devices and appliances are utilized for short periods throughout the day, and they may be connected and drawing power 24\/7 & 365 days a year. Vampire appliances, such as computers, stereos and DVD players in \u201cstand by\u201d mode may increase a household's monthly bill by at least 10 percent. Therefore, it may be beneficial to develop systems and methods that are capable of monitoring, reducing and controlling vampire power.","The present specification is directed systems and methods that are capable of monitoring, controlling and reducing vampire power. The system may include a controller and one or more power switch routers (PSR). The one or more PSRs may be networkable and the controller and one or more PSRs may communicate by a wireless connection. Moreover, the controller and two or more PSRs may be joined in a network, where the network may be either a star network or a mesh network, or a combination of a star and mesh networks. A single PSR is not a network although functionally possible. A star PSR is a PSR configured for a star network and a mesh PSR is a PSR configured for a mesh network. The resulting network is a scalable AC power switch network that may be remotely or locally (i.e. manually) controlled, and monitored with advanced metering telemetry. To effectively reduce vampire power the PSR has to be capable of accurately measuring the power consumption and communicating information to the central controller for the software to act according to user inputs.","The PSR includes a monitoring device that further comprises a power metering device and a temperature sensor, a processor, an AC switch bank that supports 1 to N AC power outputs; and a wireless interface. The power metering device has a resolution of at least 1\/1000 of a watt and an accuracy of less than 1% at high and low power readings. The temperature sensor provides current temperature at the power switch router location. A accuracy of less that 1% means that the difference between the measurement and the actual value is less than 1%). The processor includes firmware that controls the interfaces of the controller, controls switches and lights, monitors status alarms, anomalies, and controls synchronization. Additionally, the firmware manages protocol stack and manages interfaces with application layer software.","As described in the Background, it may be beneficial to develop systems and methods that are capable of monitoring, controlling and reducing vampire power. Although unplugging or otherwise disconnecting electronic appliances and circuits may mitigate the consumption of stand-by power, manual techniques are neither practical nor useful to address the broad issues. The present specification describes circuits, networks and methods that provide efficient and cost effective solutions to monitor, control and reduce power, especially vampire power.","Vampire power\u2014The power consumption resulting\u2014from appliances and other electronic devices when the appliance or device is in a stand-by mode.","PSR\u2014A \u201cpower switch router\u201d is a networkable element that may assist in the monitoring, reduction and control of vampire power.","Software\u2014Upper (application) layer. Contains the GUI (graphical user interface) and the user functions, the web service function (to interface with Internet connected devices, smartphones, other heterogeneous networks), the NMS (network management system), and API function to communicate with the Firmware in the Network Controller to access PSRs in the network.","API\u2014An application program interface (API\u2014and sometimes spelled application programming interface) is the specific method prescribed by a computer operating system or by an application program by which a programmer writing an application program can make requests of the operating system or another application. An API may be contrasted with a graphical user interface or a command interface (both of which are direct user interfaces) as interfaces to an operating system or a program.","Firmware\u2014Firmware resides in the processor MPU-RISC  of the PSR or Network Coordinator. Firmware is used for low level hardware control, protocol stack, and interface to the upper layer software.","Network Coordinator (or Central Network Coordinator)\u2014An element of the \u201ccontroller\u201d that maintains the network integrity, performs automatic retries when a PSR node goes off line unexpectedly, and communicates with the Software through API commands. Optionally includes visible indicators of anomalies.","Power outlet or power output are synonymous terms in the present specification. Further the power outlet and power output may be a AC power outlet, as illustrated in , or they may have another type of interface. Power outlets and power outputs may be incorporated in a power strip or other type of chassis. Many installation embodiments are possible including embedding the chassis into a wall of a cubicle.","A system for monitoring, reducing and controlling vampire power may include a controller and one or more power switch routers (PSR). The one or more PSRs may be networkable and the controller and one or more PSRs may communicate by a wireless connection. Moreover, the controller and two or more PSRs may be joined in a network, where the network may be either a star network or a mesh network, or a combination of a star and mesh networks. A single PSR is not a network although functionally possible. A star PSR is a PSR configured for a star network and a mesh PSR is a PSR configured for a mesh network. The resulting network is a scalable AC power switch network that may be remotely or locally (i.e. manually) controlled, and monitored with advanced metering telemetry. To effectively reduce vampire power the PSR has to be capable of accurately measuring the power consumption and communicating information to the central controller for the software to act according to user inputs.","The requirements for the network may vary depending on the complexity of the environment. Generally, the requirements for a home environment may be less complex than for an office environment. For simpler environments, a star network, as illustrated in , may be sufficient to meet the requirements of the network. As shown in , embodiment  includes PSR , PSR , PSR , and PSR . These star PSRs are wirelessly coupled to controller . The functionality of the star PSRs in embodiment  may be the same. In operation, the star PSRs have different MAC addresses so they may be individually identified and accessed.","For more complex environments, a mesh network may be effective to provide connectivity to the appliances and electronic circuits.  illustrates a mesh network of distributed PSR nodes. As shown in , embodiment  comprises eleven mesh PSRs, including PSR  through PSR . The mesh network is controlled by controller . The functionality of each of the mesh PSRs in embodiment  may be the same. Additionally, the functionality of the star PSRs may be the same as the mesh PSRs. In operation, the mesh PSRs have different MAC addresses so they may be individually identified and the mesh PSRs have knowledge of the MAC address of the adjacent mesh PSRs.","In mesh networks, one or more mesh PSRs are wirelessly coupled to controller . For example, in embodiment , PSR  and PSR  are wirelessly coupled to controller . The remaining mesh PSRs communicate to controller  via the routing functionality of the other mesh PSRs. For example, packets from PSR  may be routed through PSR , then routed through PSR , then routed through PSR , then routed to controller . Controller  is configured to support the aforementioned routing functionality. A mesh network may incorporate a star network within the mesh network.","A technical solution proposed in the present specification is a system with hardware and software sub-systems to monitor, control and reduce stand-by power in homes and offices. The hardware and software sub-systems will now be discussed.","Hardware Sub-System.","The Hardware sub-system includes of a low power wireless router that may utilize the IEEE 802.15.4 standard as the basis for the physical layer interface. This router may be networked in a mesh fashion from 2 to \u201cN\u201d (where \u201cN\u201d is a finite number between 50 and 100), according to the requirements and necessities of the user. Use of a single router is possible, although may not be considered a network.","The routers in a given network may be bound to a controller, PC or gateway device which acts as a network coordinator using a USB dongle containing the IEEE 802.15.4 wireless interface, providing the controller does not have the interface already built in. A router, in the network, may connect to the controller either directly to or through other routers. The initial binding process, performed once, guarantees the security of the network since PSRs and Controllers are aware of themselves and no unbound PSR can become part of the network. The networks could be expanded beyond 100 routers by linking clusters of networks, performed in the upper Software, in similar fashion to current PC and computer networks. Power switch routers (PSR) may have a unique address that identifies it in the network it belongs. The controller keeps track of its routers and maintains the network. Every router may be bound and added to the network in order to be operational. The addressing scheme and number of bits in the address field varies depending on the selected protocol. The system may utilize the protocols stack of Zigbee or 6LoWPAN. The controller may include network software and graphical user interface that displays network and status information.","The router, or network node, or PSR, may control the stand-by power by disconnecting devices plugged in the AC power and effectively removing their stand-by power consumption. The ON\/OFF switching may be accomplished at the router while the command and control comes from the software sub-system through the PC controller or gateway device and the wireless network. Effectively, the power switch routers may reduce vampire power by disconnecting devices operating in stand-by mode based on local control or remote control. The router may have a targeted stand-by power of <400 mW.","The router may contain a precision power metering device and a temperature sensor for an information feedback that can be part of a closed loop control when configured to do so. The metering device is a single phase AC, 120 V, with a resolution of 1\/1000 of a Watt and an accuracy of less than 1% at high and low power readings. This device may exceed IEC62053\/ANSIC12.20 standards and may provide information for: Irms, Vrms, Power (W), Energy (Wh), VAR (W), VA (W), Power Factor, Line frequency, Phase Angle, per load. The temperature sensor may provide current temperature at the router location. In all, every router node provides a distributed sensing and metering telemetry at the load points. This level of resolution may be required to identify and accurately measure stand-by power.","Stand-by control programming and power metering, singularly or combined, distributed through a low power wireless mesh network of routers may provide the tools that assists users reduce energy consumption. It may be extended to Utilities' Smart Grid networks for a better energy efficiency policy by helping implement energy demand response and AC load control.","Demand Response is a component of smart energy demand, which also includes energy efficiency, home and building energy management.","Software Sub-System.","The software sub-system has two components: The firmware, used for low level hardware control, protocol stack, and interface to the upper layer software, and the upper (application) layer software which includes the network software (NMS: Network Management System), the GUI (Graphical User Interface), and a web service interface running on a computer, PC or server. Upper (application) layer software is referred to as \u201csoftware\u201d in the present specification.","The firmware may reside and run in the SoC inside the router where it may interface directly with the different modules of the circuit, control the switch bank, and lights, and monitor the SPST bank. The firmware may also monitor alarms, communicate with other's stand alone SOCs (System on Chip) components, and manage the protocol stack and the bidirectional interface with application layer software through API commands. Hence, the synchronization, data collection, alarm monitoring, switch control functions, protocol stack, routing and binding tables are implemented in the firmware.","The firmware AC power control function may include a switch bank of relay elements, Rell to Reln. The firmware controls the relay switch elements based on the information coming from the wireless network (e.g. locally from the Software GUI interface, or remotely from a web browser or a smartphone), from the SPST bank and from internal monitoring algorithms (e.g. a safety threshold exceeded). The firmware performs synchronization of the random input events and sets the switch bank and light indicators in the PSR and internal registers to designate which outlet is active in the PSR. This information is passed through the network to the Software GUI through the API where it is shown on the PC display or passed down to a remote display through the Software web service.","The firmware schedules data, status collection from the monitor I\/F SoC in a master\/slave configuration of two independent, stand alone, subsystems, and passes control information from the Software to the monitor I\/F.","The firmware in a mesh network performs a router function by which the PSR relays information to, and from other PSRs associated with it. This association of PSRs is established during the configuration of the network.","The upper layer software (software) may reside in a computer server, a PC containing the central controller that houses an IEEE 802.15.4, wireless interface for communicating with the PSRs in the network. The home and office systems may require different software sub-systems and configurations.","The software may include the NMS (network management system). The NMS keeps a topology of the network, manages the PSR network elements polling them periodically to update status including faults, configuration, alarms, performance, and security, and maintains a log of any events in the network.","The software may include the GUI (graphical user interface) running directly on the computer server or a PC that contains the central controller. The GUI provides direct interaction with the PSRs in the network and may use images instead of commands and text. The graphical control screen may allow the user to set up the switch banks in the PSRs in real time by point and click with immediate feedback, future scheduling with graphical calendars, display and set thresholds, display current and history information in charts or plots that could be superimposed to visualize events against time, including power (watts), current, volts, alarms, total cost, switch bank state, and other user configurable parameters.","The software may include automation of events based on user set timers, programmable preset buttons were non-critical equipment and appliances can be controlled ON or OFF real time or using schedulers and timers. The software automation may include monitoring of faults and conditions, internal to the network or external coming from Utility grid network regarding demand response, cost targets, and load control. The software automation may include PSR generated switch overrides that allow the user to extend a preprogrammed ON schedule. Software automatic messages to remote terminals, PCs and smartphones are capable of indicating event faults, report changes or user pre-assigned messages.","The software may include web services interface to allow remote access via the world wide web and smartphones through \u201capps\u201d (application created specifically to interface with the software web services). The web services interface may allow for a bidirectional communication of data, creation of complex automated messaging based on set up parameter thresholds, system alarms, event completions, NMS faults and network disruptions. The web services interface allows the user to access the network from anywhere in the world and be informed of user programmed event completions and fault conditions via software web services messages.","Local activation of the AC switches by the user may be communicated by the router to the central controller where the software captures the event and displays the new \u201cstate\u201d of the switches in the power switch router. For example, the product may be configured so that the routers in the network may have a selected number outlets connected to a non-critical equipment in the cubicles (pre-configured to be added to an ON\/OFF software timer by the IT employee) and may disconnect from the AC power at a specific time at night or weekend and may reconnect before employees resume their normal day's work. If an employee comes back to the office during the OFF cycle and enables the outlets locally the software sub-system would allow him\/her to work and will return to the \u201cOFF\u201d state automatically after some pre-determined duration of inactivity. Local activation by a user is communicated by the power switch router to the controller wherein software captures event and displays new \u201cstate\u201d of the switches in the power switch router. Local and remote activation are synchronized according to a pre-assigned priority.","System configurations for an AC output include an interruptible (ON\/OFF) AC output, and an always enabled AC output (non interruptible under software configuration), with LED \u201cON\u201d state indicators, where the interruptible (ON\/OFF) AC output is capable of being manually overridden for a pre-determined amount of time.","Through the Utility grid connectivity (via the Smart Meter or even through the WWW) the Upper Software (\u201csoftware\u201d) will collect utility messages, information about cost per KW\/h, demand response, total energy utilization. The system may facilitate this connectivity by having the capability to interface directly with IEEE 802.15.4 equipped smart meters.","Implementation",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","301","301","301","304","311"]},"SoC-Wireless I\/F  may also be coupled to a Monitor I\/F , Status Lights , N SPST Bank  and N Switch Bank-Relays . The N SPST Bank  and N Switch Bank-Relays  may have N elements (i.e. X N) in embodiment  of the power switch router. Accordingly, the N Switch Bank-Relays  may be coupled to AC Outlet - through AC Outlet N-.","Monitor I\/F  may be coupled to the current sensor  to monitor the N (neutral) power line.

Each router outlet may have an LED light  to indicate when it has AC power and a SPST switch  to override the \u201cstate\u201d of the outlet (or output) locally: An ON\/OFF function may be available so the AC output may be controlled locally avoiding having to control it through the central controller.","In summary, a power switch router may comprise a chassis with several individually controlled power outputs. AC output spacing may be selected to accommodate power cords and AD-DC adapters and avoiding blocking adjacent AC outputs where AC power outputs have an LED light to indicate when the AC power output has AC power and a manual control to override ON\/OFF state of the AC power output. Manual control may be facilitated by a switch or a push button or other control function that is recessed relative to case of the router to prevent accidental activation or deactivation of the switch.
