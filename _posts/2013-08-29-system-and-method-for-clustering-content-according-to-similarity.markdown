title: System and method for clustering content according to similarity
abstract: Systems and methods for clustering content according to similarity are provided that identify and group similar content using a set of tags associated with the content. A topic model of a group of content is built, producing a probability distribution of topic membership for the content. Individual items of content are then clustered using a clustering algorithm, and a distance matrix from the probability distribution is built. Based on the distance matrix, individual items of content are labeled as “must-link” or “cannot-link” pairs with the group of content. The topic model is then embedded into successively smaller dimensions using a kernel method, until the clustering is stable with respect to both the behavioral and content domains.

Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to content classification, and more particularly, a system and method for clustering content according to similarity.","2. Description of Related Art","Most content is now stored in digital form and accessible over networks. For example, Document Management Systems (DMS) provide repositories of documents that can be searched and accessed over a computer network. Most DMS implementations are within a domain, such as a company, and are used to store documents that can be categorized in a relatively narrow set of topics. For example, a law firm may have legal briefs and other legal documents stored in a DMS. Also, downloadable or streaming media content is available in various domains.","Of course, various repositories of documents and other content items can be accessed over the internet. The most common way of discovering content on the internet is through the use of search engines, which index the content and then provide links to the content in response to keyword or topical search queries. More recently, it has become popular to associate topical or other descriptive tags, from a set of tags, with content to facilitate content discovery and retrieval. The set of tags can be arranged in an ontology or other arrangement and applied to content in a manner which helps describe the content. Of course, the tags facilitate content discovery because indexing of the document is not required and the tags convey a sense of what the content is about in a semantic or topical sense. Ideally, the set of tags associated with a document represent a compressed or minimal description of the document, which serves to both associate the document with its most similar neighbors, and to discriminate it from others unlike it.","However, there are many limitations to developing a set of tags and associating tags with content. For example, different domains may use different sets of tags and tag arrangements. This may cause inconsistencies and even lack of interoperability between domains. Even within a domain with a predetermined tag arrangement, the sheer amount of content makes it difficult to apply tags in a meaningful manner. There are tools for automated tagging. However, such tools are limited and are not effective across broad spectrums of topics and content. Furthermore, tags alone may not accurately reflect the similarity of one item of content to one or more other items of content, when analyzing and forming groups of content.","There is a need for improved systems and methods for identifying and grouping similar content. The disclosed embodiments meet those needs and others by providing a system and method combining behavioral modeling with content clustering to group content according to similarity. By exploiting the pairwise constraints developed from a user behavioral model, embodiments of the system and method result in more robust, accurate and stable clustering performance.","A topic model of a group of content is built, producing a probability distribution of topic membership for each document within the group of content which can be treated as a vector. Each document represents a data point in a dataset to be clustered by a clustering algorithm. In addition to the topic distribution for each document, side information based on user behavior and in the form of constraints is utilized to boost clustering. The side information can take the form of \u201cmust-link\u201d and \u201ccannot-link\u201d data point pairs. \u201cMust-link\u201d pairs will reside in the same cluster; \u201ccannot-link\u201d pairs will reside in different clusters. Initially, the data is projected into a subspace where the must-link pairs are close together, and the cannot-link pairs are far apart. The data points in the subspace are then clustered, algorithm parameters are adjusted based on consistency of the clustering and the side information, and the data points are projected again in order to satisfy outstanding constraints. These steps can be repeated iteratively until the clustering is stable with respect to both the behavioral and content domains. For a general description of clustering, see, Y. Liu, R. Jin, and A. K. Jain, \u201cBoostCluster: Boosting Clustering by Pairwise Constraints\u201d; In ICDM '07, 2007.","In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the exemplary embodiments. It is apparent to one skilled in the art, however, that the present invention can be practiced without these specific details or with an equivalent arrangement. In some instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the preferred embodiment.","Referring now to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals designate identical or corresponding parts throughout the several views,  is a flowchart  illustrating an embodiment of a method for clustering content according to similarity. At processing block , a set of features for content items, such as a topic model for the content items, is built or received. The topic model can be built, for example, using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), or a similar generative model. LDA explains sets of observations regarding data similarity with unobserved groups. For example, an observation that words are collected into documents may result in an explanation that each of the documents is a mixture of a few topics, and that each word of each document corresponds to a topic within that document. Each document is viewed as a mixture of various topics, with words having no particular relevance, such as \u201cthe\u201d, \u201cand\u201d, \u201ca\u201d, etc., being unassociated with any topic or being relatively equally associated with many topics.","A topic model can thus be created by identifying the topic of each specific word. For example, a document may have the words \u201claptop\u201d, \u201ccell phone\u201d, \u201cDVR\u201d, \u201ccamera\u201d, and \u201cMP3 player\u201d. The word \u201claptop\u201d may be associated with multiple topics, such as brand names, laptop parts, \u201ccomputer\u201d, \u201celectronics\u201d, etc. \u201cCell phone\u201d, \u201cDVR\u201d, \u201ccamera\u201d, and \u201cMP3 player\u201d may have different or only slightly overlapping topics, but may all be associated with the topic \u201celectronics\u201d. Thus, the topic \u201celectronics\u201d can be added to the topic model, along with other topics identified in a similar fashion.","One or more topical tags associated with a content item can be identified using the topic model and clustered. Topical tags can be identified from, for example, an activity log of search queries (such as is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/792,029, filed Jun. 2, 2010, hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety), and\/or from markup language code (such as is described in U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/312,006, filed Mar. 9, 2010, hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). Alternatively, topical tags can be determined in any appropriate manner.","Topical tags can also be identified by a clustering algorithm, which performs what is commonly referred to as \u201ctext mining\u201d. Any suitable clustering algorithm can be used, including, but not limited to, hierarchical algorithms (including agglomerative algorithms, divisive algorithms, and BIRCH algorithms), partitional algorithms (including K-means clustering algorithms, fuzzy clustering algorithms, QT clustering algorithms, locality-sensitive hashing algorithms, graph-theoretic methods, and CLARANS algorithms), density-based clustering algorithms (including DBSCAN and OPTICS algorithms), subspace clustering algorithms (including correlation clustering algorithms and two-way clustering\/co-clustering\/bi-clustering algorithms), and spectral clustering algorithms (including Normalized Cuts algorithms and Meila-Shi algorithms). The topic model of processing block  can be pre-existing and can be received, i.e. made available to the method and apparatus discussed below.","At processing block , a probability distribution of topics for the plurality of content is created from the topic model. The probability distribution can be determined by analyzing the topic model to determine the probability that the topics within the model are indeed associated with the content. For example, the topic \u201celectronics\u201d may only be associated with 1% of the words within the content, while the topic \u201csoftware\u201d may be associated with 25% of the words within the content. Thus, the probability distribution may reflect that there is a high probability that the content is associated with the topic \u201csoftware\u201d, and a relatively low probability that that it is associated with the topic \u201celectronics\u201d. In one embodiment, the probability distribution can be represented by a vector.","At processing block , a distance matrix can be calculated for the plurality of content from the probability vectors. The distance matrix can be made using a variety of functions including, but not limited to, the Euclidean distance (also known as the 2-norm distance), the Manhattan distance (also known as the 1-norm distance), the maximum norm (also known as the infinity norm distance), the Mahalanobis distance, and the Hamming distance.","At processing block , the content item and the plurality of content items are labeled as a pairwise constraint, such as a must-link pair or cannot-link pair, based on the distance matrix. The content item and the plurality of content items are labeled according to \u201cboosted clustering\u201d, which improves clustering by the pairwise behavioral constraints: must-link pairs (where the content item and the plurality of content items should belong to the same cluster), and cannot-link pairs (where the content item and the plurality of content should belong to different clusters).","In order to identify whether the content item and the plurality of content are must-link pairs or cannot-link pairs, a subspace within the plurality of content items is first found that separates the must-link pairs within the content items from the cannot-link pairs. This subspace can be found, for example, by iteratively applying a kernel method until the pairs are separated and a convergence is reached, i.e. the movement of the data points becomes nominal. The kernel method applies a class of algorithms to perform pattern analysis on the data by mapping it into successively smaller dimensional spaces made up of the top eigenvectors of the must-link and cannot-link pairs. This mapping transforms the data into a set of points in a Euclidean space, which reveal relations in the data.","Once the subspace is established, data points relative to the content item are projected onto the subspace, where the appropriate pairwise constraint (i.e. must-link or cannot-link) is found and assigned, creating a boosted cluster at processing block . At processing block , the labeled content item and boosted cluster are stored in a tangible computer readable media, where it can be used, for example, to improve the accuracy of future clustering of content, to search and\/or locate content corresponding to specific topics, to catalog content, to aggregate content corresponding to specific topics, and\/or to label the content for any purpose.","The must-link\/cannot-link relationship is determined based on user behavior. For example, as users traverse a web site, or other content repository, the items of content viewed by the user is monitored and stored. For example, a simple table of user ID and item ID can be created based on the content viewed by the user. As an example, the table can be as follows",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"User 1","Content a"]},{"entry":[{},"User 1","Content c"]},{"entry":[{},"User 1","Content e"]},{"entry":[{},"User 2","Content c"]},{"entry":[{},"User 2","Content d"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"Statistical analysis can be applied to determine content that should and should not be paired. As examples, frequency of occurrence and co-occurrence and the like can be used. For example, if one considers the set A of site visitors who engaged with some item a, and the set of site visitors B who engaged with a potentially related item b, various metrics, such as probabilistic and entropy-based metrics can be applied.","Probability-based metrics look at the relationship between two items in terms of the overall likelihood a user would be interested in the items independently, together, and overall.
