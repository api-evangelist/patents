1 illustrates the primary features of the present invention:","At a PWM duty cycle of 77%, the output of the LED fixture is 900 fc, which saves 14.04% energy vs. running the LED fixture at a PWM duty cycle of 100%.","At a PWM duty cycle of 52%, the output of the LED fixture is 700 fc (or a non-linear dimmer matrix setting of 80%), which saves 40.11% energy vs. running the LED fixture at a PWM duty cycle of 100%.","At a PWM duty cycle of 46%, the output of the LED fixture is 640 fc (or a non-linear dimmer matrix setting of 70%), which saves 45.20% energy vs. running the LED fixture at a PWM duty cycle of 100%.","At a PWM duty cycle of 32%, the output of the LED fixture is 440 fc (or a non-linear dimmer matrix setting of 50%), which saves 54.80% energy vs. running the LED fixture at a PWM duty cycle of 100%.","Therefore as an example, using two stacked physical channels, both operating at a PWM duty cycle of 0.333, the present invention can make approximately 100% of the maximum light (900 fc) while saving approximately six (6) to eight (8) watts vs. running the same LED fixture at a PWM duty cycle of 100%, which is a primary benefit of the present invention.","As a result a non-linear dimmer matrix can be constructed to manage light output luminosity vs. power input so that each LED fixture, or daisy chained group of LED fixtures, is using the minimum amount of electricity to produce the required light at any dimmer setting.","A second benefit of operating using two stacked physical channels is a time division multiplexing scheme can be constructed that allows multiple LED fixtures, or multiple daisy chains of LED fixtures, to be powered by a single PoE port. As an example, using Chart 1 we can operate three (3) LED fixtures using a time division multiplexing scheme, in which each LED fixture is operating using two stacked physical channels, operating with a 33% duty cycle, and then staggering the start time of each LED fixture so that only one (1) LED fixture is drawing power at any point in time. In this example, three (3) LED fixtures, or daisy chains of LED fixtures, can operate on a single Power-over-Ethernet or Mid-Span port using a series of staggered start times, which greatly reduces Power-over-Ethernet Switch and\/or Mid-Span equipment costs.","The primary features of the present invention are: 1) stacking at least two physical channels to drive each LED fixture, or daisy chain of LED fixtures, 2) managing dimmer settings using linear luminosity requirements vs. uncorrelated linear power settings, and 3) managing the start time for each LED fixture, or daisy chain of LED fixtures, and the present invention also uses 4) sensors to detect ambient light conditions related to a particular LED fixture, or zone of LED fixtures, identified by room or space definitions that are cross-referenced to OSHA requirements, National and Local building code requirements, standards organizations, and\/or customer requirements to either minimum or desired ambient light conditions. As an example, the requirements for a building corridor are much different than for a hospital room, office space or lobby. The present invention's dimmer controls can be set to operate according to static dimmer settings in the lighting program that are adjusted according to signals received from at least one strategically place ambient light sensor, or by automatically adjusted dimmer settings according to signals received from at least one strategically placed ambient light sensor which are cross-referenced to tables for spaces and rooms defined in OSHA regulations, and\/or National and Local building codes, standards organizations, or proprietary requirements. The fifth (5th) primary feature of the present invention is intelligent lighting systems can be self-configuring using AutoID technologies, such as, but not limited to, RFID tags, barcoded tags, etc., to simplify the installation, commissioning, and warranty processes for simple, or very complicated, lighting environments.","These features of the present invention will be described in more detail in the detailed description of the various embodiments of the present invention.","The present invention relates to a system, method, and apparatus for powering intelligent lighting networks, and includes an integrated data collection and marketing system. Power for the intelligent lighting network is supplied by Power-over-Ethernet switches, which is conditioned to properly power LED fixtures.","In addition, the Power-over-Ethernet switch, associated router, and wireless access point, can be used to power a sensor network that collects data that is relevant to a client and their customers.","Furthermore, the data collected from the sensor network can be used to drive a marketing system that also is connected to the Power-over-Ethernet switch, associated router, and wireless access point.","Even furthermore, the present invention includes a power distribution unit, referred to throughout the description of the present invention as Power Station , which includes an integrated Lighting System Controller and optional integrated Industrial System Controller, a structured cabling network, sensors, wall switches, and LED fixtures.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["130","132","133","134","135","136"]},"Internet  is a global system of interconnected computer networks that use the Internet protocol suite (TCP\/IP) to link several billion devices worldwide.

Both of these products are further described in Hybrid Cloud .","Hybrid Cloud  is a composite cloud service that crosses the boundaries of private, public, and community clouds that extends the capacity and capability, via aggregation and integration, of the composite cloud service provided by the present invention. As an example, the present invention may store sensitive client data in house on a private cloud application and interconnect that application to a business intelligence application provided on a public cloud, as a software service. In the present invention, Hybrid Cloud  and Hybrid Cloud  communicate over Internet . The data is collected and stored as a result of using the present invention's sensors that are part of LaaS (Lighting as a Service) and MaaS (Marketing as a Service) systems. These sensors include WiFi and Bluetooth MAC addresses, temperature readings, camera gathered data, lighting system sensors that detect occupancy, vacancy, and ambient lighting conditions, etc. The hybrid cloud structure represented as Hybrid Cloud  and Hybrid Cloud  may use public cloud computing resources to meet temporary capacity needs that cannot be met by our private cloud. This capability enables the present invention's hybrid cloud to employ cloud bursting for scaling across at least one cloud, or a multiplicity of clouds. The primary application running in the Hybrid Cloud  is the present invention's Data as a Service (DaaS) engine, which includes data storage and data analytic services. Hybrid Cloud  also includes a Coupon Exchange for uniquely identified offers and discounts, and analytic engines, such as, but to limited to GAUSS, and GUIs for the MaaS system to request data to offer uniquely identified discounts, coupons, etc. to the MaaS system's customer's client's that have opted into the system. These uniquely identified discounts, coupons, etc. are offered to a MaaS client's customer's on-the-fly, based on analytics of past and present customer behaviors.","Hybrid Cloud  and Hybrid Cloud  may be constructed using Cisco's Intercloud product. In addition, Hybrid Cloud  and Hybrid Cloud  may be constructed using Cisco's Integration Platform, aka CIP. CIP is used to connect the present inventions diverse, on premise cloud, and DaaS applications across the business enterprise, and makes it easy to exchange data and services between them. This is done in an automated fashion, reusing application integrations and APIs to accelerate the delivery of new customer experiences, at a much lower cost.","The CIP solution brings together two powerful technologies:","1) Cisco Integration Bus, an open standards-based integration platform with over 120 prebuilt application connectors, graphical design tools, and mixed-model deployment tools, in order to integrate and deploy applications or services seamlessly and quickly.","2) API Management, a comprehensive suite of life-cycle management capabilities to design, build, and manage APIs for our systems and services.","The combination of these technologies provides the present invention a full set of enterprise-class tools and capabilities to create, deploy, manage, and capitalize on application integrations and APIs throughout our business. These include:\n\n","Router  is a networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks. Routers perform the \u201ctraffic directing\u201d functions on the Internet. A data packet is typically forwarded from one router to another through the networks that constitute the internet, until it reaches its destination node.","A router is connected to two or more data lines from different networks (as opposed to a network switch, which connects data lines from one single network). When a data packet comes in on one of the lines, the router reads the address information in the packet to determine its ultimate destination. Then, using information in its routing table or routing policy, it directs the packet to the next network on its journey. This creates an overlay inter-network. Router  is also a security appliance.","Network Connection S represents the connection from the premise where the LaaS network rack is located and Internet . This connection can include a variety of, but is not limited to, wired, and\/or wireless, and\/or fiber-optic connections, as well as an ISP modem, and head-end equipment, POTS networks, cable networks, satellite networks, microwave relays, LANS, WANS, cellular networks including a hot spot, etc.","PoE Switch  describes any of several standardized or ad-hoc systems which pass electrical power along with data on Ethernet cabling. This allows a single cable to provide both data connection and electrical power to devices such as wireless access points, IP cameras, and LED lights. Unlike standards such as Universal Serial Bus which also power devices over the data cables, PoE allows long cable lengths. Power may be carried on the same conductors as the data, or it may be carried on dedicated conductors in the same cable.","PoE Switch  also includes PoE Controller .","There are several common techniques for transmitting power over Ethernet cabling. Two of them have been standardized by IEEE 802.3. Since only two of the four pairs are needed for 10BASE-T or 100BASE-TX, power may be transmitted on the unused conductors of the cable. In the IEEE standards, this is referred to as Alternative B. Power may also be transmitted on the data conductors by applying a common-mode voltage to each pair. Because twisted-pair Ethernet uses differential signaling, this does not interfere with data transmission. The common mode voltage is easily extracted using the center tap of the standard Ethernet pulse transformer. This is similar to the phantom power technique commonly used for powering audio microphones. In the IEEE standards, this is referred to as Alternative A.","In addition to standardizing existing practice for spare-pair and common-mode data pair power transmission, the IEEE PoE standards provide for signaling between the power sourcing equipment (PSE) and powered device (PD). This signaling allows the presence of a conformant device to be detected by the power source, and allows the device and source to negotiate the amount of power required or available. Up to a theoretical 51 watts is available for a device, depending on the version of the standard in use and the vendor of the hardware.","A switch is a device in a computer network that electrically and logically connects together other devices. Multiple data cables are plugged into a switch to enable communication between different networked devices. Switches manage the flow of data across a network by transmitting a received message only to the one or more devices for which the message was intended. Each networked device connected to a switch can be identified using a MAC address, allowing the switch to regulate the flow of traffic. This maximizes security and efficiency of the network.","Due to these features, a switch may be seen as more \u201cintelligent\u201d than a network hub, which provides no security or identification of connected devices. As a result, messages have to be transmitted out of every port of the hub, greatly degrading the overall efficiency of the network.","An Ethernet switch operates at the data link layer (layer 2) of the OSI model to create a separate collision domain for each switch port. Each computer connected to a switch port can transfer data to any of the other ones at a time, and the transmissions may not interfere, with the limitation that, in half duplex mode, each line can only either receive from or transmit to its connected computer at a certain time. In full duplex mode, each line can simultaneously transmit and receive, regardless of the partner.","PoE Switch  transmits both data and power to the present invention's Power Station . The present invention's Power Station  is a power management and distribution switch architected to enable the next phase of the PoE-powered LED lighting evolution. The Power Station  is also a combiner that aggregates power from several PoE ports into several common power buses operating on Power Station . The Power Station  provides a solution to intelligently manage and distribute power provided by PoE sources, including switches and Mid-Spans, to high efficiency LED lights, while maximizing operational cost savings. The Power Station  is future-enabled with vertical and horizontal power regulation and distribution across multiple channels operating on multiple ports to optimize port usage for the LED industries efficiency gains, and to allow for LED lights with different power requirements to operate on the same Power Station . The present invention's digital intelligent Lighting System Controller is fully integrated in the Power Station . Optionally, the Lighting System Controller is designed to include an industrial bus controller for managing and operating relays, solenoids, PLCs, and for communicating with building automation systems, etc. In addition, the Power Station 's back-end systems are designed to take advantage of the Cisco Integration Platform, and the Cisco Intercloud product offering. Overall, the present invention's Power Station  offers unparalleled cost savings for PoE-powered LED lighting networks. The Power Station  uses the PoE Switch  to power and communicate with a sensor network, other Power Station s, and back-end systems. The present invention's PoE switch powered solution is robust, agile, and takes advantage of the inherent features and benefits of PoE switches, such as, but not limited to, security and unified communications.","The present invention's Power Station  is a modular platform that may be reconfigured internally to provide a variety of port configurations, such as, but not limited to:","an 8 port power station,","a 12 port power station,","a 16 port power station,","a 20 port power station,","a 24 port power station,","a 28 port power station,","a 32 port power station,","a 36 port power station,","a 40 port power station,","a 44 port power station,","a 48 port power station,","a 60 port power station,","a 72 port power station,","a 96 port power station,","a 144 port power station,","a 192 port power station,","etc.","The Power Station s are designed for scalability.

The net result is the most efficient, and robust lighting system possible, one that is powered by PoE switches, and managed by the Power Station  with integrated Lighting Controller .","The present invention Power Station  provides a power management and distribution solution that is future-proofed. The efficacy of LEDs follows Moore's law, so PoE, PoE+, and UPoE power will nearly always be out of sync when optimizing available power to create logical lighting circuits. The Power Station  is a modular component in a PoE Switch -Power Station  combination, by conditioning standard PoE power to meet complex installation environments, and to meet the ever-changing landscape of increasing LED efficiencies.","Power Station  is comprised of the following: Power Bus and Back-plane , Controller , Lighting Controller , Shared Memory , optional Industrial Controller , Line Cards A, B, C, Power Conditioning Modules A, B, C, Micro-Controllers A, B, C, Input Power and Data Ports A, B, C, D, E, F, H, I, J and Output Power Ports A, B, C, D, E, F, H, I.

C).","Power Bus and Back-plane  may be configured as a Distributed Power Architecture, or an Intermediate Bus Architecture.","Controller  may be a field-programmable gate array integrated circuit designed to be configured by a customer or a designer after manufacturing. The FPGA configuration is generally specified using a hardware description language (HDL), similar to that used for an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC). Alternatively, Controller  may be configured as at least one micro-controller. A microcontroller, often abbreviated \u03bcC, uC or MCU, is a small computer on a single integrated circuit containing a processor core, memory, and programmable input\/output peripherals. Program memory in the form of Ferroelectric RAM, NOR flash or OTP ROM is also often included on chip, as well as a typically small amount of RAM. Microcontrollers are designed for embedded applications, in contrast to the microprocessors used in personal computers or other general purpose applications. Microcontrollers make it economical to digitally control even more devices and processes. Mixed signal microcontrollers are common, integrating analog components needed to control non-digital electronic systems. Some microcontrollers may use four-bit words and operate at clock rate frequencies as low as 4 kHz, for low power consumption (single-digit milliwatts or microwatts). They will generally have the ability to retain functionality while waiting for an event such as a button press or other interrupt; power consumption while sleeping (CPU clock and most peripherals off) may be just nanowatts, making many of them well suited for long lasting battery applications. Other microcontrollers may serve performance-critical roles, where they may need to act more like a digital signal processor (DSP), with higher clock speeds and power consumption.","Typically, FPGAs contain an array of programmable logic blocks, and a hierarchy of reconfigurable interconnects that allow the blocks to be \u201cwired together\u201d, like many logic gates that can be inter-wired in different configurations. Logic blocks can be configured to perform complex combinational functions, or merely simple logic gates like AND and OR. In most FPGAs, logic blocks also include memory elements, which may be simple flip-flops or more complete blocks of memory.","Controller  includes, but is not limited to, blocks designed for use as the Lighting Controller 's Shared Memory , and an optional Industrial Controller .","In the preferred embodiment, Lighting Controller  is based on the DMX512A protocol. However, Lighting Controller  can be designed as a control system device, or set of devices, to manage, command, direct or regulate the behavior of other the LaaS system. The Lighting Controller  can be an open loop control system and\/or a closed loop control systems. In open loop control systems output is generated based on inputs. In closed loop control systems current output is taken into consideration and corrections are made based on feedback. A closed loop system is also called a feedback control system. A hybrid control system may use both an open and closed loop control system.","DMX is a standard for digital communication networks that are commonly used to control stage lighting and effects. It was originally intended as a standardized method for controlling light dimmers, which prior to DMX512, had employed various incompatible proprietary protocols. It soon became the primary method for linking controllers such as a lighting console, to dimmers and special effects devices such as fog machines and intelligent lights. DMX has also expanded to uses in non-theatrical interior and architectural lighting, ranging from strings of Christmas lights to electronic billboards. DMX can now be used to control almost anything, reflecting its popularity in theaters and other venues.","DMX512 employs EIA-485 differential signaling at its physical layer, in conjunction with a variable-size, packet-based communication protocol. It is unidirectional.","DMX512 does not include automatic error checking and correction, and so is not an appropriate control for hazardous applications.","In 1998 the Entertainment Services and Technology Association (ESTA) began a revision process to develop the standard as an ANSI standard. The resulting revised standard, known officially as \u201cEntertainment Technology\u2014USITT DMX512-A-Asynchronous Serial Digital Data Transmission Standard for Controlling Lighting Equipment and Accessories\u201d, was approved by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in November 2004. It was revised again in 2008, and is the current standard known as \u201cE1.11\u20142008, USITT DMX512-A\u201d, or just \u201cDMX512-A\u201d.","In January 2011 ESTA merged with PLASA, a similar organization in the UK. The new organization is called Plasa. All ESTA standards are now maintained by Plasa.","A standard deployment of a DMX512 network employs a multi-drop bus topology with nodes strung together in what is commonly called a daisy chain. A network consists of a single DMX512 controller\u2014which is the master of the network\u2014and one or more slave devices. For example, a lighting console is frequently employed as the controller for a network of slave devices such as dimmers, fog machines and intelligent lights.","Each slave device has a DMX512 \u201cIN\u201d connector and usually an \u201cOUT\u201d (or \u201cTHRU\u201d) connector as well. The controller, which has only an OUT connector, is connected via a DMX512 cable to the IN connector of the first slave. A second cable then links the OUT or THRU connector of the first slave to the IN connector of the next slave in the chain, and so on. For example, the block diagram below shows a simple network consisting of a controller and three slaves.","The specification requires a \u2018terminator\u2019 to be connected to the final OUT or THRU connector of the last slave on the daisy chain, which would otherwise be unconnected. A terminator is a stand-alone male connector with an integral 120\u03a9 resistor connected across the primary data signal pair. This resistor matches the cable's characteristic impedance. If a secondary data pair is used, a termination resistor is connected across it as well. Although simple systems (i.e., systems having few devices and short cables) may sometimes function normally without a terminator, the standard requires its use. Some DMX slave devices have built-in terminators that can be manually activated with a mechanical switch or by software, or by automatically sensing the absence of a connected cable.","A DMX512 network is called a \u201cDMX universe\u201d. Each OUT connector on a DMX512 controller can control a single universe. Smaller controllers may have a single OUT connector, enabling them to control only one universe, whereas large control desks (operator consoles) may have the capacity to control multiple universes, with an OUT connector provided for each universe.","DMX512 data are transmitted over a differential pair using EIA-485 voltage levels. DMX512 electrical specifications are identical to those of the EIA-485-A standard, except where stated otherwise in E1.11.","DMX512 is a bus network no more than 1,200 meters (3,900 ft.) long, with not more than 32 unit loads on a single bus. If more than 32 unit loads need to communicate, the network can be expanded across parallel buses using DMX splitters. Network wiring consists of a shielded twisted pair, with a characteristic impedance of 120 Ohms, with a termination resistor at the end of the cable furthest from the controller to absorb signal reflections. DMX512 has two twisted pair data paths, although specification currently only defines the use of one of the twisted pairs. The second pair is undefined, but required by the electrical specification.","Alternatively, the present invention may employ a DMX over Ethernet protocol to extend the number of DMX universes and channels that can be controlled from a centralized Lighting Controller .","Due to the layered structure of the TCP\/IP protocol suite that makes up the transmission standard used on Ethernet networks, multiple, unrelated pieces of data are sent down the same network. Tracking backup information such as lighting program parameters, firmware updates, RDM (Remote Device Management) information, and much more can be run down the one network, without any of the costly, time-consuming cable re-arrangement that is normally required when a lighting system's programmed configuration is changed","A significant benefit of Ethernet is its \u201cstar-topology\u201d wiring layout. While DMX uses a \u201cdaisy-chaining\u201d method, the star-topology of Ethernet leads to a much more robust network. The lack of daisy-chaining support may seem like a disadvantage at first, but the extra resilience of a network utilizing a star-topology means a fault in a device or cable may generally have a much smaller impact over the whole network and make it easier to trace. This coupled with the lower cost of cable may make a network utilizing Ethernet a safer, more robust system than anything built using the DMX protocol. The lack of \u201cinputs\u201d and \u201coutputs\u201d in Ethernet means plug any device, be it a console or fixture, into any port without needing to worry about the direction of travel. All devices may automatically communicate with each other as required, as a result of the TCP\/IP protocol suite.","One of the most under-estimated advantages of a DMX over Ethernet implementation is Ethernet's ability to leverage the wide range of technologies developed by the IT industry. Inexpensive, yet highly reliable switches and cables can be used and there's a host of sub-protocols supported by most switches. An example of this would be Spanning Tree Protocol (IEEE 802.1D) which allows redundant links between switches such that should one go down for whatever reason, the other can take over seamlessly. Another useful technology is Virtual LANs, or VLANs (IEEE 802.1Q) which allows multiple venues all on the one network to segment the network into discrete virtual networks, guaranteeing no inadvertent control of one room from another. Streaming ACN makes use of the multicasting protocol to intelligently route universes of DMX only where it's required, with no manual reconfiguration. All of these features come in commonly available switches that are extremely reliable and often available much cheaper than the largely featureless DMX splitters in use today.","There is not yet a universal agreement between manufacturers as to which DMX-over-Ethernet protocol to use. Some protocols are fairly open and used by many manufacturers, while others remain proprietary and are typically only used by the manufacturer that developed them. There are typically five main protocols: ArtNet, Pathport, ShowNet, ETC Net2 and Streaming ACN.","ArtNet is a simple protocol designed purely for encapsulating DMX data within Ethernet, nice and simply. ArtNet has introduced the lighting world to DMX-over-Ethernet and is the most widely used DMX-over-Ethernet protocol in use today. However, there are some constraints that may limit its long-term usefulness. The numbering of universes from 0 rather than 1 is not very user-friendly, and can lead to confusion and incompatibility between manufacturers. Similarly, the lack of support for multicasting can make its transmission inefficient in large events utilizing many universes. For these and other reasons, ArtNet's future is in doubt against the more robustly defined Streaming ACN protocol.","Pathport, ShowNet and ETC Net2 are protocols designed by Pathway, Strand and ETC respectively. Their penetration is not as wide-spread as ArtNet, but they are used by a few consoles and devices. The Pathport protocol is supported by both MA's GrandMA and Jands' Vista for example, while Strand's ShowNet is the only protocol available in their 300 and 500 series desk. ETC Net2 is the protocol used for ETC's previous generation of consoles.","Streaming ACN is probably the best DMX-over-Ethernet protocol available. Not only does it avoid some of the pitfalls of its predecessors, but it also adds some new features that extend the functionality allowed in DMX. This feature allows visualization software to use a different stream of DMX than that is being used by the dimmers and fixtures, embedded priority information and an \u201cend-of-sequence\u201d function.","One of the most important things to consider in designing a DMX-over-Ethernet protocol is the range of DMX-over-Ethernet protocols supported. While most support ArtNet, currently the most popular protocol, there is still a significant amount of equipment out there that does not support ArtNet. Streaming ACN may become the preferred protocol driving lighting equipment. Pathport nodes are unique in the large range of protocols they support. ArtNet, Pathport, ShowNet, ETC Net2 and Streaming ACN (ETC Net3) are all supported by Pathway's Pathport nodes.","The best approach for DMX and Ethernet protocol is with infrastructure that is entirely Ethernet based. This allows DMX-to-Ethernet nodes to be placed where required that convert the DMX-over-Ethernet signal to legacy DMX for only the last couple of meters to the lights. It's generally important to feed more than one run of Ethernet to a specific location so there is not only one for a DMX-to-Ethernet node, but also for native Ethernet devices, such as configuration devices and future devices to plug directly in. Some nodes allow their ports to be configured as either output or input, regardless of the gender of the physical port. This allows a node typically used for output to become an input node with no more hardware except a simple gender-changer adaptor.","Lighting Controller  can receive data from Switches and Sensors  to turn on, turn off, or dim LED A, B, and\/or LED A, B, and\/or LED A, B.","Controller  also includes Shared Memory , and optional Industrial Controller .","Shared Memory  is an electronic data storage device, implemented on a semiconductor-based integrated circuit. It is made in many different types and technologies.","Semiconductor memory has the property of random access, which means that it takes the same amount of time to access any memory location, so data can be efficiently accessed in any random order. In a semiconductor memory chip, each bit of binary data is stored in a tiny circuit called a memory cell consisting of one to several transistors. The memory cells are laid out in rectangular arrays on the surface of the chip. The 1-bit memory cells are grouped in small units called words which are accessed together as a single memory address. Memory is manufactured in word length that is usually a power of two, typically N=1, 2, 4 or 8 bits.","Data is accessed by means of a binary number called a memory address applied to the chip's address pins, which specifies which word in the chip is to be accessed. If the memory address consists of M bits, the number of addresses on the chip is 2M, each containing an N bit word. Consequently, the amount of data stored in each chip is N2M bits. The memory storage capacity for M number of address lines is given by 2M, which is usually in power of two: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256 and 512 and measured in kibibits, mebibits, gibibits or tebibits, etc. Currently 2014 is the largest semiconductor memory chip and holds a few gibibits of data, but higher capacity memory is constantly being developed. By combining several integrated circuits, memory can be arranged into a larger word length and\/or address space than what is offered by each chip, often but not necessarily a power of two.","The two basic operations performed by a memory chip are \u201cread\u201d, in which the data contents of a memory word is read out (nondestructively), and \u201cwrite\u201d in which data is stored in a memory word, replacing any data that was previously stored there. To increase data rate, in some of the latest types of memory chips such as DDR SDRAM multiple words are accessed with each read or write operation.","In addition to standalone memory chips, blocks of semiconductor memory are integral parts of many computer and data processing integrated circuits. For example the microprocessor chips that run computers contain cache memory to store instructions awaiting execution.","Shared Memory  is used by both the Lighting Controller , and the optional Industrial Controller . Shared Memory  is used to store data necessary for the semi-automatic, or automatic, control of the LaaS and MaaS system.

The Line Cards A, B, C plug into a modular chassis (not shown) of the Power Station .","Line Card A, B, C also includes Power Conditioning Modules A, B, C respectively. The Power Conditioning Modules A, B, C convert the standard electrical output of PoE, PoE+, or PoE++, or non-standard PoE versions to the proper voltage and amperage required to power LED A, B, or LED A, B, or LED A, B. One advantage of the present invention's Power Station  is it is LED fixture agnostic, and LED fixtures from different manufacturers can be powered on the same Intelligent Lighting Network by the same Power Station .","Line Card A, B, C also includes Micro-Controller A, B, and C.

The wireless communications can be used to turn lights on, off, or dim. In addition, the Line Card A, B, C configured as at least one electrical wall outlet that is located near a free-standing, or mobile, lamp fixture that is includes screw-based LED lights can be grouped logically together by Controller , and controlled as group, or according to triggers from Switches and Sensors .","LED A, B, LED A, B, and LED A, B are fixtures that produce light via a light-emitting diode (LED). LED lamps have a lifespan and electrical efficiency that is several times better than incandescent lamps, and significantly better than most fluorescent lamps, with some chips able to emit more than 100 lumens per watt.","Like incandescent lamps and unlike most fluorescent lamps (e.g. tubes and compact fluorescent lamps or CFLs), LEDs come to full brightness without need for a warm-up time. The life of fluorescent lighting is also reduced by frequent switching on and off.","Some LED lamps are made to be a direct compatible drop-in replacement for incandescent or fluorescent lamps. The LED lamp packaging may show the lumen output, power consumption in watts, color temperature in kelvins or description (e.g. \u201cwarm white\u201d), operating temperature range, and sometimes the equivalent wattage of an incandescent lamp of similar luminous output.","Most LEDs do not emit light in all directions, and their directional characteristics affect the design of lamps, although omnidirectional lamps which radiate light over a 360\u00b0 angle are becoming more common. The light output of single LEDs is less than that of incandescent and compact fluorescent lamps. In most applications multiple LEDs are used to form a lamp, although high-power versions (see below) are becoming available.","LED chips need controlled direct current (DC) electrical power. An appropriate circuit is required to convert alternating current from the supply to the regulated low voltage direct current used by the LEDs. LEDs are adversely affected by high temperature, so LED lamps typically include heat dissipation elements such as heat sinks and cooling fins.","AutoID A, B, C, D, E, F (aka Automatic Identification and Data Capture (AIDC)) refers to the methods of automatically identifying objects, collecting data about them, and entering that data directly into computer systems, without human involvement. Technologies typically considered as part of AIDC include bar codes, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), biometrics, magnetic stripes, Optical Character Recognition (OCR), smart cards, and voice recognition. AIDC is also commonly referred to as \u201cAutomatic Identification,\u201d \u201cAuto-ID,\u201d and \u201cAutomatic Data Capture.\u201d","AIDC is the process or means of obtaining external data, particularly through analysis of images, sounds or videos. To capture data, a transducer is employed which converts the actual image or a sound into a digital file. The file is then stored and at a later time it can be analyzed by a computer, or compared with other files in a database to verify identity or to provide authorization to enter a secured system. Capturing of data can be done in various ways and the best method depends on application.","AIDC also refers to the methods of recognizing objects, getting information about them and entering that data or feeding it directly into computer systems without any human involvement. Automatic identification and data capture technologies include barcodes, RFID, barcodes, OCR, magnetic stripes, smart cards and biometrics (like iris and facial recognition system).","Radio frequency identification (RFID) is relatively a new AIDC technology which was first developed in 1980s. The technology acts as a base in automated data collection, identification and analysis systems worldwide.","RFID and barcodes are the primary AutoID (aka AIDC) technologies that would be used to mark LED A, B, LED A, B, and LED A, B.","In the present invention, AutoID A, B, C, D, E, F configured as RFID tags would be used during installation to capture the ID of the light and its physical location by RFID triangulation. These identities and locations would be compared to the RCP (Reflected Ceiling Plan) for the installation. In this manner, the Intelligent Lighting Network System may become self-aware, and capable of becoming self-configuring. The DMX channels for a light, or string of lights, can be assigned on-the-fly. In addition, during installation, Lighting Controller  can access tables in Shared Memory  that define national and local code lighting levels for various building types, and spaces, and room types. Using the lighting systems sensors in Switches and Sensors  the Intelligent Lighting Network System can be configured and adjusted automatically.","Access Point  is a WiFi access point that is used to communicate wireless with the Intelligent Lighting Network System, and to monitor WiFi Radio MAC addresses. In addition, Access Point  includes a Bluetooth Radio that can monitor Bluetooth Radio MAC addresses. One example of such an Access Point  is the Meraki MR series, which tracks probing MAC addresses from associated and non-associated clients. This data is exported in real time from the access points to Meraki's cloud for analytics. Information is then calculated and presented in the Meraki dashboard to display metrics such as user dwell-time, repeat visits and capture rate (people passing by vs. coming inside a site). This information can be used by retailers, hospitality, and enterprise customers to understand foot traffic and visitor behavior across sites, and can facilitate an optimization of opening hours, marketing initiatives, and staffing policies.","Digital Signage and Marketing System  is comprised of digital signs (not shown), digital advertising and messaging players (not shown), client GUIs (not shown), customer GUIs (not shown), cameras (not shown), optional kiosks (not shown), social media marketing engine (not shown), and apps for receiving coupons, discounts, and offers generated by the Digital Signage and Marketing System .","Cables A, B, C, D, E, F, H, I, J, K, L M, N, O, P, Q are used in electrical and electronic systems for transmitting electric power or telecommunication signals from one place to another.
