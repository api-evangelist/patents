title: Method and system of confidence interval methodology for ratio means
abstract: A method and system for determining whether the number of samples taken from a population of units where the distribution of X and Y variables are unknown by evaluating ratio mean measurements on a computer to determine a confidence interval. The method comprising: inputting samples from the total population with each unit sample having at least two variables X and Y; redefining the multivariate data that comprises the two variables X and Y; estimating the mean; computing the standard error; using a bootstrapping method, generating boot strap samples, computing a Z distribution based upon the bootstrap samples; and computing the confidence interval. The system comprises a processor for performing the steps of the method.

Bootstrapping is implemented by creating a number of resamples of the observed sample data set equal in size; obtained by random sampling with replacement from the original dataset.","The military and many other government and private organizations have the need to evaluate ratio mean measurements to help them make informed life cycle management decisions.  is an illustration of a sample ratio mean. A ratio mean is the ratio of the means of two random variables, X and Y, whose corresponding terms are paired. The pairs are assumed to be independent. In , the correlation between X & Y may be positive, negative or zero. The X & Y in  are considered independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), with some unknown distribution.","For example, the Army tracks and evaluates the performance of many weapon systems using ratio mean metrics, such as the maintenance ratio (MR).

The entire population performance is inferred based on a sample of vehicles using approximate confidence intervals (CI) for ratio means. There is need to develop an efficient methodology that provides for the effective use of confidence intervals. Generally speaking, the documented standard error (SE) estimate for a ratio mean (accounts for variation in both variables and correlation) is not dependable for samples under 30 or larger samples with increased variation in both variables. Therefore, another approach is needed.","A preferred embodiment of the present invention is directed to confidence interval methodology for ratio means, in which a pre-existing nonparametric bootstrap-t framework is combined with innovative inputted data determinations to compute approximate confidence intervals for a ratio mean metric.

The likelihood the interval contains the parameter is determined by the confidence level or confidence coefficient.","As used in the following claims, the terminology \u201ccomputer\u201d means processor, microprocessor, controller, microcontroller, multiprocessor, CPU, or computer network.","As used in the following claims, the terminology \u201csample\u201d means a number of unts which is a random sample of the population. For ratio mean problems, the sample is paired values X(i) and Y(i) where i is the iunit.","As used in the following claims, the terminology \u201cprocessor\u201d means computer, microprocessor, controller, microcontroller, multiprocessor, CPU, or computer network.","As used in the following claims, the terminology \u201credefined\u201d means each element of the ratio sample, i.e. each paired term, is redefined using the equation",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0094","num":"0093"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00012","num":"00012"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["adjRM","k"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mi":"n","mo":"*","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["X","k"]},"mo":"\/","mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"j","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"n"},"mo":"\u2062","msub":{"mi":["Y","j"]}}}}}}},"br":{}},"Although various preferred embodiments of the present invention have been described herein in detail to provide for complete and clear disclosure, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that variations may be made thereto without departing from the spirit of the invention.","It should be emphasized that the above-described embodiments are merely possible examples of implementations.
