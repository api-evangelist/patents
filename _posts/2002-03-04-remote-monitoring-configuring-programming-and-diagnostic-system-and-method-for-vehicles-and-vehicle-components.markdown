No. 09\/640,785, filed Aug. 18, 2000 now abandoned entitled \u201cSystem, Method and Computer Program Product for Remote Vehicle Diagnostics, Monitoring, Configuring and Reprogramming\u201d to Bromley et al., the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. This application also claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/351,165 entitled \u201cWireless Communication Framework\u201d, filed Jan. 23, 2002, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The present invention relates generally to computer data and information systems, and more particularly to computer tools for storing, processing, and displaying vehicle information.","It is common for companies to own a large number, or fleet, of commercial motor vehicles. Typical examples of such companies include commercial courier services, moving companies, freight and trucking companies, truck leasing companies, as well as passenger vehicle leasing companies and passenger carriers. To maintain profitability, a company owning a vehicle fleet ideally minimizes the time spent in vehicle maintenance and repair. Maintaining optimum vehicle performance often involves removing vehicles from service to conduct fault analysis, scheduled maintenance, diagnostics monitoring and parameter modifications.","Further, companies that manufacture vehicle components may wish to have a central database to access information for product improvements, warranty service, diagnostics, and other component data after components have been installed on the vehicle. Because different companies and different industries have different vehicle data gathering and reporting needs, current solutions involve constructing specialized systems for each particular user application.","There is a desire for a system that can monitor, configure, program and diagnose vehicles and\/or vehicle components while allowing customization of the vehicle data to accommodate the different needs of different users and different.","Accordingly, one embodiment of the present invention is directed to a system for monitoring, configuring, programming and\/or diagnosing operation of at least one vehicle, comprising an on-board unit disposed on the vehicle to send and receive data corresponding to at least one vehicle operating characteristic, a plurality of modular applications, each application having an associated function that processes the data corresponding to said at least one vehicle operating characteristic obtained via the onboard unit, and an interface that allows selection among the plurality of modular applications to create a customized.","Another embodiment of the invention is directed to an on-board unit disposed on a vehicle for use in a system for monitoring, configuring, programming and\/or diagnosing operation of at least one vehicle, comprising at least one on-board unit interface to support communication between the on-board unit and at least one device outside the on-board unit, a processor that manages the data sent and received by the on-board unit via said at least one interface, and a memory coupled to the processor.","A further embodiment of the present invention is directed to a method for monitoring, configuring, programming and\/or diagnosing operation of at least one vehicle, comprising obtaining data corresponding to at least one vehicle operating characteristic from an on-board unit on the vehicle, providing a plurality of modular applications that are selectable by the user to create a customized system, and processing the data corresponding to at least one vehicle operating characteristic obtained via the on-board unit according to at least one function associated with at least one selected modular application.","Further embodiments and variations of the invention will be apparent from the drawings and description below.","System Functionalities and Architecture",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","100","100"]},"Referring to the Figure, the system  may include an application service provider (ASP) infrastructure  that acts as a gateway between a plurality of vehicles , each vehicle having an associated on-vehicle computer (e.g., an onboard unit or \u201cOBU\u201d ) and customizable interface . The interface  allows a user or machine to select among various applications, such as third-party applications  as well as original, system-supplied applications , to obtain and analyze various data from the vehicles . The applications may include, for example, tools for obtaining real-time fleet characteristics, trend analysis and diagnostics, to perform manual, dynamic or rule-based configuration, as well as allow fleet managers to provide real-time driver\/fleet notification. To ensure that the user receives data that is meaningful to the user's specific application, the user interface  can be customized to operate applications selected by the user. In the example shown in , different types of users may select different applications as a customized application group  to accommodate their specific data monitoring and reporting needs applicable to their own business.","For example, as illustrated in , a dealer\/repair facility may select from the offered applications , , vehicle configuration, scheduled maintenance, remote diagnostics, and concierge services as its application group , while a truck manufacturer may select a different collection of applications , such as warranty service\/campaign support, vehicle history, and guided diagnostics. By offering a variety of modular applications , , that can be selected and combined according to the needs of a particular user, the same infrastructure  can be customized and used by different users for different purposes with little or no modification of the infrastructure  itself. Further, by allowing users to access third-party applications  through the same infrastructure as system supplied applications , the system  can leverage services not provided by the system  itself, further increasing flexibility and adaptability.","Further, in an embodiment of the inventive system using an ASP-based model, an application service provider provides and allows access, on a subscriber basis, to a remote vehicle diagnostics, monitoring, configuration and reprogramming tool via the Internet. That is, the application service provider provides the hardware (e.g., servers, an on-vehicle computer) and software (e.g., database) infrastructure, application software, customer support, and billing mechanism to allow its customers (e.g., fleet managers, vehicle distributors, vehicle dealers, original equipment manufacturers (\u201cOEMs\u201d), leasing\/rental companies, and the like) to remotely access the vehicles within a fleet. The tool can be used by subscribers to select and access the modular applications , .","Note that an ASP-based model can eliminate the need to physically distribute software to users. Instead, new features and updates can be immediately available to users because the system resides and runs on an application server. In one embodiment, applications that are not on the application server can reside on the OBU . The on-board unit applications can be loaded onto the OBU  during vehicle installation, and additional applications or application updates can be downloaded onto the OBU  through a wireless network connection.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","106","202","105","106","202","105","206"]},"The interface  can be, for example, a user interface and\/or a machine interface that allows a human or machine to access the infrastructure , which includes the server . The server  may include, for example, a series of servers that perform web page hosting, run applications, perform data storage, and\/or perform wireless communications network management. In this example, the server  includes a web\/application server a vehicle server and a communications server all of which are linked to a database server As shown in the Figure, the server  acts as a link between a web based client (user)  with the OBU , allowing user access and control to a vehicle data stream via the Internet  or other internetworking system.","The OBU  access the data from various vehicle components and may also generate vehicle data of its own to provide to the server . The OBU  may include a wireless communication module to provide a communication link to a wireless network, a vehicle data processing module to process data obtained from the vehicle components, and a vehicle interface connected to, for example, the vehicle data bus to gather data from the vehicle components for processing and managing time or process-critical functions with the vehicle systems, such as electronic control units. The OBU  may also include a global positioning system and a driver display interface.","Each of the system architecture components will be described in greater detail below.","Interface","The interface  may be a standard browser interface and\/or a machine-to-machine interface. In the browser interface, a human user accesses the system via a standard web browser. In one embodiment, the user gains access to the specific set of their authorized vehicles and functions after login and password authorization. In a machine-to-machine interface, server and vehicle data and functions may be accessible via a secure application program interface (API). A machine-to-machine interface allows other applications access to the system's  capabilities so they can gain remote access to the vehicle and the capabilities offered by the system. This allows the system  to interface with existing or planned back office applications and operations, making the system  suitable for integration with, for example, overall fleet operations or other systems.","Server","The server system is the fixed-based component of the system and, as explained above, can be an Internet-based system and use an ASP model. The end user can access the system from the interface , such as any commercially available web browser. As noted above, the server  in this embodiment includes the web application server the vehicle server and the communications server and the database server Each of these will be described in greater detail below.","The web application server contains the logic defining one or more applications to an end user. All the data needed for a specific user application is requested and sent to the OBU  via the wireless communication network . As will be explained in greater detail below, applications perform the necessary calculations and then package the results for presentation in a defined format to the user. Further, the web application server  is responsible for running business applications related to user activities, which may include performing business logic, interfacing to the systems databases for fleet, vehicle, component, and transaction activity, knowledge-base storage, and sending user requested vehicle queries or functions to the vehicle server and the communications server ","The vehicle server in the server  stores and processes vehicle-specific data and acts as a translator between the applications ,  and the specific vehicle and\/or vehicle component. More particularly, the vehicle server is responsible for processing data requests and vehicle responses and converting the outbound and inbound data into translated vehicle information.","The vehicle server translates user requests from the interface  into formats specific to the vehicle  to which the request is directed. The vehicle server conducts this translation without any user interaction or property selections. For example, the vehicle server may evaluate a message being sent to a particular vehicle and detect the vehicle type, the vehicle bus type, and the vehicle component or sub-component that is intended as the message recipient. The vehicle server then packages the message according to the specific communication protocol mandated by the recipient component. As a result, the vehicle server allows monitoring and control of different vehicles having different components through the same interface  for a given user and application.","As shown in , one embodiment of the inventive system allows communication between at least the vehicles  and the server  via a wireless network, such as a satellite or terrestrial based network. A communication server may be included in the server  to support wireless communications and provide a central location for supporting changes and improvements in wireless technology. In one embodiment, the communication server manages the communications activities between the OBU  and the vehicle server and processes vehicle\/component specific requests between the OBU  and the server ","In one embodiment, the communications server utilizes a wireless communications framework that provides a communication link between the server  and the vehicle . Although any wireless mobile communication system can be used in the inventive system , a flexible wireless communication infrastructure that is capable of handling multiple platforms and\/or multiple communication providers is preferred. One possible embodiment of such a framework is described in U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/351,165 entitled \u201cWireless Communication Framework\u201d, filed Jan. 23, 2002, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. To handle multiple communication providers and\/or platforms, the flexible wireless communication infrastructure may abstract the needs of a specific wireless communication provider, such as the message size, message format, and specific protocol details, into a standard messaging API understandable by multiple systems and platforms. In one embodiment, the communication server abstracts messages, and stores and forwards messages to ensure later delivery of messages to vehicles that are temporarily outside a wireless communication coverage area, and may even include least cost routing rules to select among multiple wireless networks to prioritize message routing based on cost and\/or criticality of the message.","The server  also includes a database server containing relational data tables designed to retain information pertaining to a user, a vehicle, a fleet, system transaction history and other relationships associated with a given vehicle . The database server also may be designed to retain the data resulting from any vehicular transaction, such as transactions between the OBU  and the server . In one embodiment, the database is structured such that authorized users can access vehicles in a number of ways, for example, by fleet ownership, leasing fleet, vehicle manufacturer, and component manufacturer. This structure enables the system  to provide each of these beneficiaries with specific, customized data and access in a format meaningful to each user.","On Board Unit (OBU)","As noted above, the OBU  provides the vehicle-side, real-time computing base for the system. In one embodiment, the OBU  is responsible for data stream processing, discrete measurements, vehicle position information, wireless communications, and real-time analysis of data. Within the system's overall framework, the OBU  acts as a vehicle server, providing vehicle specific data and functionality. In one embodiment, the OBU  may be an expandable custom hardware platform designed and manufactured to reside on a wide variety of vehicles with different component specifications and needs and is preferably capable of running multiple applications while acting as a vehicle data gateway for others.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIGS. 3A and 3B","b":["105","105","300","302","304","306","302","105","202","206","304","105","308","306","105"]},"The wireless interface  in one embodiment sends and receives data from the server  to and from the OBU  and abstracts communications from different wireless network devices to allow the OBU  to communicate with a flexible wireless communication infrastructure, such as the type described above with respect to the server . More particularly, the wireless interface  may encapsulate protocol differences among various wireless network devices to provide a standard output to the processor . In one embodiment, wireless network messages are routed from the server  to the wireless interface  for error checking and filtering. After filtering, commands are passed to the processor  and then routed to their respective vehicle components.","The processor  acts as the central processing unit (CPU) of the OBU  by managing the sending and receiving of requests between the server  and the vehicle  via the wireless interface . In one embodiment, the processor  has the logic and intelligence to carry out vehicle specific services such as diagnostic requests and processing. For example, the processor  may run specific applications that are loaded into the OBU's memory , ,  and coordinates activities between the vehicle datastream, GPS unit, wireless communications, and the remote server . Further, in one embodiment, the processor  can be updated through the wireless network to add and enhance its functionality. This capability eliminates requiring the vehicle to be at the service bay for software updates that enhance features and functionality.","The vehicle interface  allows the OBU  to support a wide variety of vehicle components and subcomponents. Possible interfaces that can be supported by the OBU include SAE J1708, SAE J1939, SAE OBDII\/CAN, ISO-9141, discrete I\/O, proprietary interfaces, and other interfaces (e.g., discrete or instrumentation interfaces). Further, the vehicle interface  provides a single point of contact for all vehicle components and control devices on the vehicle , allowing the communication between OBU software with the vehicle's actual data bus line as well as wireless communication devices, such as a satellite-based communications system.","In one embodiment, the vehicle interface  may include a data parser\/requester module  that contains software code logic that is also responsible for handling direct interfacing between the processor  and the vehicle data bus  for non-application specific (i.e., \u201cgeneric\u201d SAE J1708 or SAE1939 discrete measurement points) parameter readings, alerts, configuration or reprogramming data, as explained in greater detail below.","The vehicle interface  may also include, for example, one or more application specific modules , such as one for each manufacturer specific controller  within the vehicle , each containing software code logic that is responsible for handling interfacing between the processor  and the vehicle data bus  (via data parser\/requestor module  in this example) for application specific parameter readings, alerts, configuration or reprogramming data.","Note that the OBU  may act as a server and\/or data gateway for an application that places data directly on the vehicle data bus . In one embodiment, the OBU  uses an interface standard, such as TMC RP 1210A, as an element of the data gateway. Regardless of the specific standard used, any activity using the OBU  as a data gateway will involve data going through the processor .","In an embodiment of the present invention, the OBU  is designed to be compliant with the SAE's (-), Document No. J1455 (August 1994) standard, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, because it will be a component included (or installed) within vehicles . As indicated above, the OBU  is not limited to be compliant with any particular standard and can accommodate any on-board electronic system standard (e.g., SAE J1708, SAE J1939, SAE J1850, ISO 9141, proprietary data streams, etc.) for any sub-system (e.g., engines, transmissions, braking systems, instrument clusters, etc.) as long as the system  is capable of converting commands between the interface  and the OBU  according to whatever standard is used by a given vehicle electronic system. If the vehicle electronic system uses a proprietary standard, for example, the vehicle server and the associated application specific module  on the OBU  may be adapted to accommodate the proprietary standard.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":["FIG. 3B","FIG. 3B","FIG. 3B","FIGS. 3A and 3B"],"b":["105","105","313","314","315","316","318","300","320"]},"The application software and the application framework is built with both a software and hardware abstraction layer. This approach makes the framework adaptable to a number of alternative operating system and hardware platforms. One embodiment of the OBU  may use any known real-time operating system.","System Operation Examples","The overall system  can support many possible services and applications, examples of which are described below and illustrated in . As noted above, the system  shown in  illustrate one possible relationship between services and applications for a system  using an ASP-based model. In one embodiment, a group of core services  that perform vehicle-specific operations are available to the applications , . As noted above, the applications ,  allow a user to customize the interpretation and display of the vehicle-specific operations based on the user's own requirements. The core services  act as building blocks of services that can be selected or combined in any desired manner, and can be accessed by or with any applications ,  in the system ; in other words, the applications ,  act as a functional layer over the more primitive core services . For example, the core services  may be accessed by a help desk application to obtain vehicle location along with parametric data or by a service application to obtain parametric data and to perform functional tests. Because the system  can leverage other applications and services that the system  itself may not have and couple them with its own applications and services, the system  provides a flexible and adaptable platform that can accommodate many different needs.","In one embodiment, the applications may assemble the core services to perform specific functions. For example, one of the core services  may capture measured values and\/or change parameters or operational settings in the vehicle  while the applications ,  organize and process information from the core services  into groupings that are meaningful to a given user. A service outlet, for example, may want different data and\/or data organized in a different manner than a leasing organization or a component manufacturer.","As noted above and as shown in , the interface  can be a browser interface or graphical user interface (GUI) that allows a human user to access the system , or a machine-to-machine application programming interface (API). The user interface  allows the system  to act as a gateway between the user and the vehicle(s)  via the applications and services.","As noted above, the core services  provided by the system  act as building blocks that can be assembled by applications in a variety of ways that can best serve the user. Possible core services  include:\n\n","The list of core services  above is not meant to be exhaustive, but are simply examples of possible services that can be available directly to users or supplied to applications for further processing. Note that although the explanations below focus on obtaining data from a vehicle ECU , the system and functions described below are applicable for any vehicle data.","The \u201cParameters\u201d service may include a simple parameter retrieval service as well as more sophisticated parameter retrieval services that address limitations in obtaining vehicle data when, for example, the vehicle is turned off.  illustrates one simple process  for obtaining a parameter. When the OBU  receives a command from the server  to retrieve a data value at block , the OBU  sends a query message to the ECU  to obtain the ECU's current reading at block . Once the ECU  returns a parameter value at block , the OBU  retrieves the value and forwards it to the server at block . Note that frequently used parameters may be packaged and transmitted to the server  as a single message as a more efficient way of transferring data. Further, the specific means for getting a particular data item may depend on the specific requirements of a given ECU . For example, as is known in the art, data points corresponding to an anti-lock brake system may be obtained in a different manner than data corresponding to engine coolant temperature.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0061"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":"500"},"To carry out the snapshot process , the system  first initializes at block  by, for example, storing the diagnostic parameters to monitor, setting the time intervals at which parameter values are captured, selecting the number of captured values to be included in a single report, and selecting the event that will trigger reporting of the captured values. This information can be inputted into the OBU  via the interface . The parameter values to be captured can be any parameters accessible on the vehicle's electronic controllers by means of a diagnostic data stream or from discrete inputs on the OBU . The triggering event can be any non-continuous event that is monitored on the vehicle, such as the capture of an active trouble code from a vehicle controller or a parameter moving outside an established acceptable range.","Once the OBU  has been configured (block ), the OBU  maintains a number of historical value sets at block  by caching a selected number of parameter readings during normal vehicle operation. While the OBU  captures the parameter readings, it also waits for the triggering event to occur. Once the trigger event occurs (block ), the OBU  continues caching the configured parameter readings occurring after the event (block ). The number of historical value sets can be, for example, half the number of captures to be included in the final report, while the number of value sets taken after the triggering event can make up the other half. Note that the OBU  may, in another embodiment, capture parameter readings only before or after the triggering event as well or capture different numbers of values on either side of the event.","After all of the desired value sets have been captured and collected, all of the captured readings, both before and after the event, are combined into a final report at block . The report can be stored on the OBU  for later retrieval or sent via wireless connection to the application server for immediate viewing.","Another possible process that can be offered as a \u201cParameters\u201d service is a \u201cget stored values\u201d (GSV) process , as illustrated in , for collecting parameter values from a vehicle even if the vehicle is unable to provide current parameter values at the time of the query. The GSV process  addresses a situation where the vehicle controllers  are unable to respond to a query by the OBU  (e.g., while the vehicle is turned off) to respond to a query. This process is particularly useful in applications requiring remote retrieval of time-sensitive data, such as an odometer reading at the end of a scheduled period, or in any application where the vehicle operating state is unknown at the time of the query.","For the GSV process  to be effective, the OBU  should be designed to allow continuous remote access so that the OBU  is always ready for receiving and sending messages. The OBU  is initialized by receiving an instruction to periodically collect specified parameter data at a selected query time interval (block ). After receiving this command, the OBU  will periodically collect data at the specified query time intervals (block ). The values gathered by the OBU  are stored in the on-board unit's memory, such as a flash memory, at block  before the OBU  is shut down when the vehicle  is turned off.","If the OBU  receives a GSV \u201cretrieve\u201d command from the application server (block ), the OBU  checks the state of the vehicle controller  at block . If the vehicle controller  is accessible, then the OBU  collects the current values from the vehicle controller  at that time and sends the collected current values to the server . If the vehicle controller  is not available at the time of the command (e.g., if the vehicle is turned off), making the current values of the controller  unretrievable, the saved values in the OBU  are sent back to the server  as the retrieved values (block ).","By periodically collecting data at selected intervals while the vehicle controller is operational, the OBU  can at least obtain recent vehicle controller parameter readings before the controller  is inaccessible at some later time. As a result, the GSV process  allows the remote server  to obtain the most recent controller data if current data is not available at the time of the query. In short, the GSV process  returns the last known value in memory to the server  if the vehicle is turned on and will retrieve a backup value, which may still be the last known value in memory, if the vehicle is turned off.","Multiple \u201cAlerts\u201d services may also be provided as a core service in the system . In its simplest form, the \u201cAlert\u201d service monitors vehicle trouble codes and transmits a message to the OBU  when the trouble code occurs. For example, a fault code may come as solicited or unsolicited, depending on how the controller  in the OBU  is instructed to handle faults. To obtain an unsolicited fault, the OBU  monitors the vehicle data bus  for the occurrence of a fault and notifies the server  if a fault occurs. If only a set of individual faults are monitored, additional parsing shall be performed to filter out unwanted faults. For example, if a user only wishes to be informed of fault codes corresponding to a component breakdown, as opposed to being informed of all fault codes, the user can indicate this preference via the interface .","To obtain a solicited fault, the user may set up periodic queries to the OBU processor  in addition to setup notification. Note that the response message may match the message template even if no fault actually existed; in this case, additional parsing of the response message may be necessary to obtain useful information. For example, if the user solicits a request for information, the user may obtain a response based upon the criteria of that request, which may be different than the criteria for unsolicited notifications.","If desired, the \u201cAlert\u201d service may include additional functions such as providing the ability to add\/remove individual faults, canceling the alert function for a given fault when a fault alert is fired so that only the first fault occurrence (and not subsequent fault occurrences) trigger a notification message, or configuring the \u201cAlert\u201d service to be stored permanently in, for example, the database server until the user removes the service or until the service is cancelled by a fault occurrence.","With respect to the example shown in  and as noted above, the \u201cAlerts\u201d service may include among its functions the detection of a particular event by checking whether a monitored value exceeds a selected threshold. Note that although this example focuses on one diagnostic parameter, any number of diagnostic parameters may be combined into an algorithm to detect threshold limit boundaries. Further, values may be monitored over time, rather than as one single alert-triggering event, to monitor patterns and trends and to detect events more accurately.","As an example of a \u201cAlert\u201d service that monitors over time,  shows an \u201cOver RPM\u201d threshold alert example that detects if a vehicle driver is abusing the vehicle engine. In this example, the Over RPM threshold alert considers the amount of time that the RPM level exceeds a specified limit (6000 RPM in this example) rather than simply generating an alert each time the RPM exceeds the level. The time delay ensures that alerts are generated only for events that may cause genuine concern.","As shown in  if the RPM exceeds 6000 RPM for a brief period that is less than 2 seconds (at ), the \u201cAlert\u201d service does not generate an alert. However, if the RPM does exceed 6000 RPM for more than two seconds (at ), the service fires an alert  and resets itself (at ) when the RPM drops back below 6000 RPM. The actual circuitry for monitoring RPM and implementing this example of the \u201cAlert\u201d service in the system  (e.g., on the OBU ) is well within the skill of those in the art. Further, the time delay concept shown in  can be used for any parameter where undesirable operation is preferably detected via time and value thresholds.","The \u201cAlert\u201d services may also include a tamper alert feature, as shown in , that allows the user to monitor any unauthorized alteration of configurable parameters. This feature  generally contains a setup process  and a tamper check process . When a user requests the tamper alert service (block ), OBU  captures the value of the parameter at the time of the request and saves the parameter value to a file in the OBU's memory (e.g., flash memory  or DRAM ) at block . Note that this parameter retrieval process may involve using the \u201cParameters\u201d service as explained above to query the ECU or other vehicle controller or component .","The actual tamper check process is conducted when, for example, the vehicle is initially turned on. At this point, the OBU  checks the parameter again to get its current value at the time the vehicle ignition is turned on (block ). If the current value is different than the saved value (block ), a tamper alert message will be returned to the user (block ). If the compared values are the same at block , however, the vehicle continues operation as usual without transmitting any tamper alert signal (block ). In one embodiment, the user may add\/remove individual tamper alerts, and the tamper alert may be cancelled at block  once the alert is fired.","A \u201cChange Parameters\u201d function may also be included as part of a configuration core service, as shown in . This feature may allow a user to remotely insert or update, for example, a parameter or message definition in the vehicle. As shown in , the function  includes receiving a parameter change request (block ), receiving the specific parameter to be changed in the vehicle (block ), changing the parameter (block ), and saving the parameter in memory (block ). In one embodiment, the updated parameter definitions are stored permanently in memory until the next change request. Further, in one embodiment, the updated definition takes effect as soon as the update is completed.","The core services can be accessed by one or more applications, as noted above. The system  may include the ability to leverage other services that it may or may not have, such as, Fuel Tax Reporting\/State Line Crossing applications, Asset tracking\/utilization programs, Driver Performance applications, On-line Vehicle Documentation, detailed mapping applications, etc. This flexibility, coupled with modular services and applications ,  that can be added, subtracted, and combined at will, provides for a very flexible and adaptable platform.","Applications","As described above, the system  allows users to customize their own vehicle monitoring, programming and diagnostics systems based on their own specialized needs by offering a plurality of applications that can be selected and combined in a modular fashion as desired by the user. The applications may include service offerings such as Remote Diagnostics, Fuel Economy, Trip Reporting, Automatic Vehicle Location based upon GPS or satellite based system information, and others. The applications listed here and described in greater detail below are only examples and are not meant to be limiting or comprehensive in any manner. Those of skill in the art will understand that other applications may also be included as possible application options.","A \u201cRemote Diagnostics\u201d application, for example, provides the ability to perform component analysis before or during a vehicle breakdown and allows vehicle maintenance locations to receive parametric information from a vehicle prior to its arrival, or prior to dispatching a technician to the vehicle. Further, the \u201cRemote Diagnostics\u201d application allows a technician to perform selected diagnostic tests on the vehicle or system, with the test process being managed by the OBU . In one embodiment, the \u201cRemote Diagnostics\u201d application allows a user to view parameters, active and inactive fault codes, and vehicle configurations, for example, and may also allow authorized users to perform functional tests and configuration changes on the vehicle. Remote Diagnostics may be initiated when, for example, a vehicle notifies the fleet based upon a series of established alerts or when the diagnostics are requested manually by a fleet authorized user. In practice, the application may provide diagnostic applications via the inventive system . When the user logs on to the system  via the interface , for example, he or she may be presented with a list of vehicles that have reported alerts or notifications that may need attention. If no alerts are active, the user is provided a list of vehicles for which he or she is responsible. At this point the user may elect to use a remote diagnostics application, such as the remote diagnostics application described below and shown in , , to perform further analysis on the vehicle to determine the severity of the problem.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0076","num":"0081"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["900","902","904","906","908","910","912","910","914","916","918","912","920","922","924"]},"A \u201cLeased Vehicle Management\u201d (LVM) application is another possible option to generate periodic status reports summarizing selected parameters for each vehicle in a fleet, such as total vehicle distance, total idle fuel, total idle time, total fuel used, and\/or total fuel economy.  is a block diagram illustrating one possible example architecture for the Leased Vehicle Management application . In this example, the user reaches a main page  that allows the user to choose between a group details page  and the task details page . Group details  correspond to all information for a selected vehicle group, while task details  correspond to all information for a selected task. The group details page  may allow the user to, for example, create new tasks (e.g., the timing of data collection for a selected vehicle group) , generate a report list , or generate more detailed reports listing specifying, for example, parameter values for a selected report . The task details page includes similar options, allowing the user to view reports for a selected task  and generate more detailed reports . The task details page  also allows a user to stop a task  or delete a task .","An \u201cEngine Management\u201d application may also be an option to target fleets whose vehicles encounter varying road and traffic conditions, and varying load types and weights. The objective of the \u201cEngine Management\u201d application is to improve overall fleet fuel economy via dynamic control of a vehicle's operational characteristics, in particular, horsepower ratings and maximum road speed limits. Traditionally such operating parameters have been established once at a fleet wide level, not taking into consideration some of the variables listed above. In addition, making these changes required physical contact with the vehicle, necessitating undesirable vehicle downtime. Dynamic adjustments based upon operating conditions can provide reductions in vehicle operational costs, thus resulting in significant savings at a fleet level. With this application the user will be able to dynamically configure the vehicle wherever it may be; tailoring its operational characteristics based upon route, load, and other vehicle operation factors. The \u201cEngine Management\u201d application may include both measured parameters and programmable parameters. Examples of programmable parameters include Vehicle Road Speed Limit, Engine Horsepower\/Torque, Engine Idle Shutdown Time and Cruise Control Settings.","A \u201cTrip Report\u201d application may also be provided as an option. This application allows the fleet manager to obtain trip information from the vehicle on a near-real-time basis. The user can analyze trip information for single vehicles as well as any increment of their fleet. This application primarily uses measured parameters such as odometer readings, total trip fuel, idle fuel, average fuel economy, vehicle route taken, and others. It also uses some parameters to derive data, such as total idle hours and the type of idle hours recorded. The output from this application can also be used as input to the billing systems of leasing companies who charge customers based upon mileage.","A \u201cMaintenance Alert\u201d application allows the fleet manager to establish a series of maintenance triggers based upon key parameters. When a parameter threshold is encountered, the fleet manager will be notified automatically by the system, thus initiating a maintenance event without physical contact with the vehicle. For example, a fleet may establish a preventive maintenance cycle based upon odometer reading. If the server  is made aware of the interval, it can notify the fleet of the precise moment when that interval occurs. Alerts may provide notification on parameters such as diagnostic codes, fluid levels and parameter ranges as well as unauthorized tampering with the vehicle.","A \u201cVehicle Configuration\u201d application may be offered to allow a fleet manager to set certain parameters for multiple vehicles in a fleet so that the selected vehicles will operate within its established standards. Examples of parameters include horsepower ratings, maximum road speed limits, maximum and minimum cruise control set speeds and maximum engine idle time before shutdown. Traditionally, this step has required a physical connection of a diagnostic application or tool to the vehicle, but physical connections are time-consuming and require the same step to be repeated on every vehicle that is serviced. The wireless nature of the \u201cVehicle Configuration\u201d application allows operational settings and alerts for several vehicles within a fleet at one time by allowing the user to identify selected vehicles, set parameters, and initiate an automated process where each vehicle is systematically configured with the same parameter settings.","A \u201cWarranty Management\u201d application may also be offered as part of a data mining strategy used by, for example, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to help diagnose warranty relationships between major components or to assess warranty claims for validity. This application would, for example, obtain detailed vehicle data from the database server using both fleet specific and system-wide data mining, and then correlate the data with warranty requirements.","As noted above, the possible modular applications described herein are meant as illustrative examples only. Further, as noted above, the applications ,  accessed by the infrastructure  can be generated by third parties and offered as modules for incorporating into a particular user's interface  and accessing the OBU  and other system-supported core services and applications. The modular functionality offered by independent applications ,  allows disparate users to access the same vehicle data via the same OBUs  and the same infrastructure , but be offered customized data, functionalities, and interfaces that are meaningful to that user's industry as determined by the particular modular applications selected by the user. The specific manner for implementing the applications via, for example, computer programs, is within those of skill in the art.","The inventive system therefore provides a modular wireless vehicle diagnostics, command and control system that is customizable to a user's specifications. More particularly, the modular applications ,  provide much versatility and allow users from disparate industries to use the same overall inventive system  by selecting the applications ,  relevant to their particular industry. Further, by creating a wireless diagnostics and command and control service, the invention provides real-time remote access to vehicles and vehicle systems via, for example, the Internet and wireless networks. In one embodiment, the inventive system allows users to connect to multiple data points on any given vehicle to interpret and analyze the vehicle data in real time, change vehicle parameters as needed and create historical databases to guide future decisions. Further, by monitoring vehicle operation in real time and providing customized reports for each vehicle, the inventive system achieves high operating efficiency, lowered maintenance costs and downtime, and even allows pre-ordering of parts as vehicles approach scheduled maintenance.","Note that the capabilities described above are meant to be illustrative and not limiting. The system  can be adapted to, for example, establish a setting that is applied to selected group of vehicles with a single command rather than individually establishing a setting for each vehicle. The aspects of the request, including authorization, vehicle\/component differences, password differences, and configuration limitations of the specific request, may be managed by, for example, the server . In another embodiment, the system  can view each vehicle  as a single entity to allow the user to communicate with multiple ECU's on the same vehicle  at the same time. For example, data can be obtained from an Engine ECU and Transmission ECU at the same time, with the resultant data from each controller correlated to the other to add more detail to the data offered to the user.","Variations of the system described above are possible without departing from the scope of the invention. For example, selected applications may be run locally on proprietary equipment owned by the customers (i.e., the fleet managers, vehicle distributors, vehicle dealers and the like) as a stand alone software application instead of over the Internet. Further, the OBU  can be equipped with, for example, a bar code scanner and\/or other human user interface to facilitate data capture. Other user interfaces and functions, such as a handheld diagnostics tool, workflow integration tool, links between data captured by different applications, and tools to provide advance warning of vehicle faults or pre-arrival diagnostics information may also be included as application modules or core services or even integrated within the application modules themselves. Note that one or more additional servers can also be incorporated into the system to, for example, accommodate additional data management functions and\/or provide interfaces for integrating with existing applications.","Information obtained via the inventive system can also be used to, for example, re-calibrate vehicle components, perform firmware downloads, perform component failure analysis, determine wear characteristics, analyze quality of components used in their manufacturing processes, retrieve and manage warranty information, receive indications of vehicle maintenance needs, monitor vehicle use and abuse, and\/or monitor lessee trip information, perform proactive data analysis, perform pre-arrival diagnostics, re-calibrate vehicle components, and\/or perform firmware downloads. Note that this list of options is not exhaustive and those of skill in the art will understand that other variations in the data obtained via the inventive system and how the data is presented and used can vary without departing from the scope of the invention.","It should be understood that various alternatives to the embodiments of the invention described herein may be employed in practicing the invention. It is intended that the following claims define the scope of the invention and that the method and apparatus within the scope of these claims and their equivalents be covered thereby."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIGS. 3A and 3B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 11"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
