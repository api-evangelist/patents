title: Process for synthesizing 1,5 dinosyl-3,3,7,7-tetrakis(difluoramino)octahydro-1,5-diazocine (DNTDFD)
abstract: A process for synthesizing 1,5-Dinosyl-3,3,7,7-tetrakis(difluoramino) octahydro-1,5-diazocine (DNTDFD) by reacting tetrahydro-1,5-bis(4-nitrobenzenesulfonyl)-1,5-diazocine-3,7-(2H, 6H) dione with HNF2/oleum initially approximately between −5 and 0 degrees C., and allowing the temperature to rise to between 10 degrees C. and ambient temperature during said reaction to initiate difluoramination producing product DNTDFD. A 2:1 mixture of FREON® 11 refrigerant and pentane or cyclopentane, or pentane alone is used as a diluent and absorbent for the reagent difluoramine. The present invention reduces the time required to produce DNTDFD from about two weeks to one to three days and reduces the need to use relatively large quantities of FREON® 11, a compound which is damaging to the environment.

Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to the production of solid fuel propellant oxidizers and, in particular, to an improved process for synthesizing 1,5-Dinosyl-3,3,7,7-tetrakis (difluoramino)-octahydro-1,5-diazocine (DNTDFD), which is a critical intermediate compound used in the production of 3,3,7,7-tetrakis (difluoramino) octahydro-1,5-dinitro-1,5-diazocine (HNFX), an efficient explosive and solid fuel propellant oxidizer.","2. Description of the Background","The compound HNFX is a valuable component in rocket propellant formulations because of its high explosive and oxidizing properties. HNFX is synthesized from commercially available materials using a multiple step process. The initial phase of some known processes leads to the intermediate compound DNTDFD, a critical intermediate for certain effective methods of producing HNFX. DNTDFD is processed into HNFX by one of a variety of methods, some of which are detailed in \u201cNitrolysis of a Highly Deactivated Amide by Protonitronium. See, , Robert D. Chapman, Journal of Organic Chemistry (1999, 64, 960\u2013965).","The known methods for producing DNTDFD are described in , Robert D. Chapman, Journal of Organic Chemistry (1998, 63, 1566). The compound HNFX is similar to another explosive and propellant oxidizer, TNFX. The process of preparing TNFX is detailed in U.S. Patent Application No. 2000\/0161248, to Chapman and in U.S. Pat. No. 6,417,355, also to Chapman. The precursor to TNFX is a compound very similar to DNTDFD. Both compounds are synthesized by a lengthy process requiring fluctuating temperature conditions. In preparing the precursor to TNFX, the reaction proceeds slowly and must be encouraged by cycling the temperature between \u221215 degrees C. and 0 degrees C. throughout the process, which reaches completion in two weeks time.","The process of preparing DNTDFD, as described in , Robert D. Chapman, Journal of Organic Chemistry (1998, 63, 1566 at 1570), requires a solution of fuming sulfuric acid, to which CHClis added and cooled to \u221215 degrees C. Gaseous HNFis absorbed into the layer of CHCl. The temperature is raised, briefly, so that the HNF2, may be absorbed and the mixture is recooled. Tetrahydro-1,5-bis(4-nitrobenzenesulfonyl)-1,5-diazocine-3,7-(2H, 6H) dione is added to the mixture, which is stirred for 15 days. The solution is basified and precipitated. The product, DNTDFD, is obtained. During the course of the reaction, temperature is allowed to rise gradually from \u221215 degrees C. to \u22128 degrees C. An alternate method is described, which involves the absorption of HNFgas into a layer of FREON\u00ae 11 trichlorofluoromethane and the addition of tetrahydro-1,5-bis(4-nitrobenzenesulfonyl)-1,5-diazocine-3,7-(2H, 6H) dione. This method involves cycling the temperature between \u221215 degrees C. and 0 degrees C. and requires 11 days.","Typically, FREON\u00ae 11 solvent is used as a diluent and absorbent for the difluoramine reagent. The process produces a yield of 52% of (crude) DNTDFD.","The DNTDFD is then processed into HNFX by one of the methods referenced above. There is a need for a more efficient process, which can more quickly and economically produce the intermediate compound, DNTDFD.","Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a process for more quickly synthesizing DNTDFD, in an efficient manner.","It is a further object to provide a process requiring a reduced amount of FREON\u00ae 11, a compound which is damaging to the environment.","In accordance with the stated objects, a process is provided for synthesizing the critical intermediate compound, DNTDFD. The precursor of DNTDFD, tetrahydro-1,5-bis(4-nitrobenzenesulfonyl)-1,5-diazocine-3,7-(2H, 6H) dione, is formed by oxidation of dinosyldiazocinediol. Known means are used to produce the oxidation reaction and yield tetrahydro-1,5 bis (4-nitrobenzenesulfonyl)-1,5-diazocine-3,7-(2H, 6H) dione.","The novelty in the present invention comprises initiating a reaction of tetrahydro-1,5-bis-(4-nitrobenzenesulfonyl)-1,5-diazocine-3,7-(2H, 6H) dione with HNF2\/oleum, to achieve difluoramination. The reaction is initiated at a temperature between approximately \u22125 and 0 degrees C. The temperature is allowed to rise to between 10 degrees C. and ambient temperature during the course of the reaction. The reaction completes in one to three days and yields up to 61% (crude) DNTDFD. A 2:1 mixture of FREON\u00ae 11 refrigerant and pentane or cyclopentane, or pentane alone, is used as a diluent and absorbent for the reagent difluoramine. After the reaction begins, it is not necessary to monitor the temperature or to continue to cool the constituent compounds; although the yield improves if the compounds are cooled.","The present invention reduces the time required to produce DNTDFD from about two weeks to one to three days and reduces the need to use relatively large quantities of FREON\u00ae 11, a compound which is damaging to the environment.","The present invention is an improved process for synthesizing 1,5-Dinosyl-3,3,7,7-tetrakis (difluoramino) octahydro-1,5-diazocine (DNTDFD), which is a critical intermediate compound used in the production of 3,3,7,7-tetrakis (difluoramino)-octahydro-1,5-dinitro-1,5-diazocine (HNFX), an efficient explosive and solid fuel propellant oxidizer.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"The precursor of DNTDFD, tetrahydro-1,5-bis(4-nitrobenzenesulfonyl)-1,5-diazocine-3, 7-(2H, 6H) dione, is formed by oxidation of dinosyldiazocinediol in a conventional manner. A suitable (and typical) process for this is described in the article entitled \u201c\u201d, Robert D. Chapman, (cited above). The compound, DNTDFD is then prepared directly from tetrahydro-1,5-bis-(nitrobenzenesulfonyl)-1,5-diazocine-3,7-(2H 6H) dione, by difluoramination. The process of the present invention simplifies this step.","As shown in  (dotted lines) a reaction of tetrahydro-1,5-bis(4-nitrobenzenesulfonyl) 1,5-diazocine-3,7-(2H, 6H) dione with HNF2\/oleum is initiated to achieve difluoramination. The reaction is initiated at between approximately \u22125 and 0 degrees C.

CAUTION: Difluoramine and the difluoramino compounds described here are explosives and must be handled using appropriate safety measures. Difluoramine was generated from aqueous difluorurea solution (from 6.6 g urea and 125 ml of water) by the standard procedure (Chapman et al, J. Org. Chem. (1998, 63, 1566)). It is advisable to generate most of the difluoramine slowly at a temperature between 50 and 70 degrees C. to avoid sudden increases of difluoramine concentration. After drying by passing through a cold trap cooled with ice, then through a column of Drierite, the difluoramine\/nitrogen gas stream was passed into the reaction flask above the liquid level.","The reaction vessel was a 50 ml, three-neck flask. It was fitted with a Dewar-type dry-ice condenser (to be filled with dry-ice\/acetone) vented via a bubbler, an L-tube for solids addition, and a magnetic stirring bar.","The substrate, 0.906 g, was added to the L-tube. The system was purged with dry nitrogen for about an hour. The condenser was charged with coolant. 30% Oleum, 7 mL, was added to the reaction flask followed by 10 mL of pentane (1) and 5 mL of FREON\u00ae 11. Stirring was initiated.","Difluoramine was generated as described above. About 0.5 hours after difluoramine generation was complete, the nitrogen flow was redirected to isolate the reaction vessel from the generation unit. Cooling of the reaction flask was started with an ice-water bath. Difluoramine was allowed to interact with the oleum for about 1 hour. With continued cooling the substrate was added slowly via the L-tube. 0.5 mL 100% sulfuric acid was added through the L-tube to help wash remaining substrate into the reaction flask.","After about an hour the nitrogen flow was redirected again to the exit of the dry-ice condenser, thus eliminating nitrogen flow through the reaction vessel. The dry-ice in the condenser was allowed to evaporate and was replaced by the immersion probe of a chiller capable of cooling the acetone in the condenser to \u221240 degrees C. The ice-water bath was allowed to warm to near room temperature over an hour and was then removed. The system was allowed to react overnight.","After a reaction time of 19 hours (from completion of substrate addition) the bottom layer (oleum phase) was added dropwise to crushed ice, using agitation to prevent local overheating. The ice was allowed to melt and the suspension was filtered. The product was dried in air, and thus was obtained 0.595 g (48%) of crude product.","The product had no carbonyl band in the IR and was easily and completely soluble in acetone. It showed a 19F signal at 28.7 ppm (d6-acetone), and a 1H signal at 4.36 ppm (CH2, d6-acetone).","(1) Pentane was purified by stirring with 30% oleum (20:1), followed by stirring of the pentane phase with MgSO4 and filtering. It was stored over molecular sieves.","The same procedure was used as in EXAMPLE 1. However, dry-ice\/acetone was used for cooling the condenser during the day, and was allowed to evaporate over night. No additional cooling was used. The yield and purity of product was the same as in example 1.","The same procedure was used as in EXAMPLE 1, except that 11.6 mL of 30% oleum was used. The yield and purity of product was the same as in EXAMPLE 1.","Difluoramination of 1,5-Dinosyl-perhydrodiazocine-3,7-dione at 10\u201315 degrees C. CAUTION: See example 1.","Difluoramine was generated from aqueous difluorurea solution (from 6.6 g urea and 100 ml of water) by the standard procedure as described in example 1. The difluoramine\/nitrogen gas stream was passed through a cold trap cooled with ice, through a column of Drierite, and then into the reaction flask above the liquid level.","The reaction vessel was a 100 mL jacketed four-neck flask (ACE Glass). It was fitted with a Dewar-type dry-ice condenser (to be filled with dry-ice\/acetone) vented via a bubbler, an L-tube for solids addition, and a magnetic stirring bar. The jacket was connected to a circulating bath with 1:1 ethyleneglycol\/water as the cooling fluid.","The generating unit, reaction vessel, and bubbler were connected via appropriately placed T-stopcocks to allow redirecting the nitrogen flow directly into the reaction flask or directly into the bubbler as needed (see below). A flow of dry nitrogen was maintained throughout the experiment.","The substrate was added to the L-tube. The entire system was purged with dry nitrogen for about an hour. The condenser was charged with coolant. The reaction vessel was cooled to 10 degrees C. Stirring was initiated. Pentane (1) and FREON\u00ae 11 were added to the reaction vessel, followed by 30% oleum. Reagent amounts are shown in Table I.","Cold (<5 degree C.) difluorourea solution was added to the generating flask followed by dropwise addition with stirring of concentrated sulfuric acid (20 mL). Difluoramine generation was initiated as described above. After completion of acid addition to the difluorurea solution, the reaction vessel was cooled to 5 degrees C.; when the generating bath temperature had reached 50 degrees C., the reaction vessel was cooled to 0 degrees C. and difluoramine generation was completed. Difluoramine was allowed to interact with the oleum for 1 hour after completion of the generation. About 0.5 hours after completion of difluoramine generation, the nitrogen flow was redirected to isolate the reaction vessel from the generation unit and the reaction vessel was cooled to \u22125 degrees C. After another half hour, the nitrogen flow was redirected again to the exit of the dry-ice condenser, thus eliminating nitrogen flow through the reaction vessel.","The substrate (Table 1) was added slowly via the L-tube (15\u201330 minutes). The L-tube was removed and replaced by a stopper. The L-tube was rinsed with water and residual diketone was recovered, dried, and weighed. The reaction was allowed to proceed at \u22125 degrees C. for the time shown in Table 1, and the temperature was then gradually raised as indicated in Table 1.","During the warm-up period, the dry-ice in the condenser was allowed to evaporate and was replaced by the immersion probe of a chiller capable of cooling the acetone in the condenser to \u221240 degrees C. The system was allowed to react at 10 or 15 degrees C. for the time shown in Table 1.","At the end of the reaction period the reaction flask was cooled to 0 degrees C. and the contents of the flask were transferred to a separatory funnel. The bottom layer was added dropwise to crushed ice with agitation. The solids were filtered off, washed with water, triturated with an aqueous solution of sodium bicarbonate (see Table 1), filtered again and washed with water. After drying in air at 50 degrees C., the crude product was weighed and was characterized by 1 H and 19F NMR and by HPLC.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Reaction Conditions and Reagent Amounts for Two Difluoramination"},{"entry":"Runs with Different Difluoramine\/Substrate Ratios (Examples 4 and 5)."}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Example 4","Example 5"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Urea (g; mmol) used to make","6.6; 100","6.6; 100"]},{"entry":"difluoramine"},{"entry":["Water (mL)","100","100"]},{"entry":["Conc.
