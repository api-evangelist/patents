RedPath Integrated Pathology has developed a unique testing method to address this issue. A pancreatic cyst fluid is inherently a lower volume specimen type, and often times the volume of the specimen collected does not meet the volume requirement for CEA testing. The ability to perform upfront dilutions on pancreatic cysts specimens and provide an accurate CEA value, as compared to undiluted CEA measurements, was the goal in the development of this methodology improvement.","CEA Method Development","The development process for this methodology evolved through trial and error of different applications and the correlating analyses of each result set. Pancreatic cyst fluids with excess volume were used for all developmental testing of this method, and dilutions performed on specimens were compared to the CEA values obtained from testing the specimens neat (undiluted).","A number of different off-shelf diluents were tested comparatively. During this testing, it was found that Saline showed improvement as a diluent versus Diluent Universal (UD, Roche), which is currently the diluent used to perform dilutions for clinical CEA testing. However, the use of saline alone was not enough to improve the accuracy of the CEA value for all pancreatic cyst fluid specimens when diluted.","An in-house diluent, \u201cSolution CEA\u201d, was developed and tested in effort to improve the accuracy of all diluted pancreatic cyst fluid specimens. This diluent was found to be effective on some specimens but to over perform for certain pancreatic cyst fluid specimens. When specimens were tested in parallel with saline and Solution CEA dilutions the comparative data was reviewed and a pattern evolved with the incorporation of the Amylase results into the analysis. It was determined that specimens with an Amylase value of less than 15,000 were more accurate with the use of saline as a diluent when compared to the neat CEA values. However, specimens with an Amylase value of greater than 15,000 were more accurate with the use of Solution CEA as the diluent when compared to the neat CEA values.","As more testing was conducted to verify the method and increase the \u201cn\u201d of specimens tested, it was identified through statistical analysis that the effect of the Solution CEA as a diluents could be mathematically replicated through the use of a correction factor (CF). Different CFs were trained and tested on varying dilution points. It was found through this testing that it was essential to both train and validate the method on data sets with pancreatic cyst fluids divided proportionately, since differ methods of testing were required for specimens based on the Amylase result (please refer to Validation Methods, below).","New CEA Method for Validation","All pancreatic fluid specimens requiring an upfront dilution will be diluted using saline as the diluent, and will be diluted using a 1:10 dilution point. Any specimen that requires a dilution and has an Amylase value of greater than 15,000 will have a correction factor (CF) of 0.7 applied to the CEA value to determine the final CEA result reported.","Example: Amylase=16,000","CEA value after 1:10 dilution=400 (value after adjusted for dilution factor)","Final CEA Result for 1:10 dilution=400 multiplied by 0.7=280","Validation Methods","Linearity, Accuracy, Sensitivity & Specificity","To validate the method for dilution of pancreatic cyst fluid specimens, parallel specimen testing for CEA was completed. Each specimen was diluted in UD (old method) and saline (new method) with re-testing of CEA & Amylase on a neat specimen aliquot for result comparison. The validation specimen set was comprised of an equal number of specimens divided into 4 categories. These four specimen categories are:\n\n","For this validation, 92 pancreatic cyst fluid specimens were accrued with 23 specimens in each of the four categories described above. Each specimen was accrued and tested as follows:\n\n","To determine precision, pancreatic cyst fluid specimens were collected to perform parallel specimen testing for CEA. Prior to the precision study, each specimen was re-tested for CEA & Amylase using a neat specimen aliquot for result comparison. Parallel testing was performed in triplicate on specimen dilutions in UD (old method) and Saline (new method). Each dilution was tested over 3 different run scenarios:\n\n","For this validation, 16 specimens were accrued with 4 specimens in each of the four categories described above in the \u201cLinearity, Accuracy, Sensitivity & Specificity\u201d section. Each specimen was accrued and tested as follows:\n\n","Intraclass Correlation (ICC), concordance correlation (CC), and bias were used to measure the agreement between CEA values obtained on neat pancreatic fluid specimens versus diluted pancreatic fluid specimens (both old and new dilution methods). See .","The concordance for the old and new dilution method compared to neat (undiluted) CEA values were determine when data was analyzed in clinically relevant categories. The categories were defined by using 192 ng\/mL as the cut-off between Low CEA and High CEA.

Values at or above 192 ng\/mL indicate mucinous cysts; values below this cut-off indicate non-mucinous cysts.

Many modifications and variations can be made without departing from its spirit and scope, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Functionally equivalent methods and apparatuses within the scope of the disclosure, in addition to those enumerated herein, will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the foregoing descriptions. Such modifications and variations are intended to fall within the scope of the appended claims. The present disclosure is to be limited only by the terms of the appended claims, along with the full scope of equivalents to which such claims are entitled. It is to be understood that this disclosure is not limited to particular methods, reagents, compounds, compositions or biological systems, which can, of course, vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only, and is not intended to be limiting.","With respect to the use of substantially any plural and\/or singular terms herein, those having skill in the art can translate from the plural to the singular and\/or from the singular to the plural as is appropriate to the context and\/or application. The various singular\/plural permutations may be expressly set forth herein for sake of clarity.","It will be understood by those within the art that, in general, terms used herein, and especially in the appended claims (e.g., bodies of the appended claims) are generally intended as \u201copen\u201d terms (e.g., the term \u201cincluding\u201d should be interpreted as \u201cincluding but not limited to,\u201d the term \u201chaving\u201d should be interpreted as \u201chaving at least,\u201d the term \u201cincludes\u201d should be interpreted as \u201cincludes but is not limited to,\u201d etc.). It will be further understood by those within the art that if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is intended, such an intent will be explicitly recited in the claim, and in the absence of such recitation no such intent is present. For example, as an aid to understanding, the following appended claims may contain usage of the introductory phrases \u201cat least one\u201d and \u201cone or more\u201d to introduce claim recitations. However, the use of such phrases should not be construed to imply that the introduction of a claim recitation by the indefinite articles \u201ca\u201d or \u201can\u201d limits any particular claim containing such introduced claim recitation to embodiments containing only one such recitation, even when the same claim includes the introductory phrases \u201cone or more\u201d or \u201cat least one\u201d and indefinite articles such as \u201ca\u201d or \u201can\u201d (e.g., \u201ca\u201d and\/or \u201can\u201d should be interpreted to mean \u201cat least one\u201d or \u201cone or more\u201d); the same holds true for the use of definite articles used to introduce claim recitations. In addition, even if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is explicitly recited, those skilled in the art will recognize that such recitation should be interpreted to mean at least the recited number (e.g., the bare recitation of \u201ctwo recitations,\u201d without other modifiers, means at least two recitations, or two or more recitations). Furthermore, in those instances where a convention analogous to \u201cat least one of A, B, and C, etc.\u201d is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., \u201ca system having at least one of A, B, and C\u201d would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and\/or A, B, and C together, etc.). In those instances where a convention analogous to \u201cat least one of A, B, or C, etc.\u201d is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., \u201ca system having at least one of A, B, or C\u201d would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and\/or A, B, and C together, etc.). It will be further understood by those within the art that virtually any disjunctive word and\/or phrase presenting two or more alternative terms, whether in the description, claims, or drawings, should be understood to contemplate the possibilities of including one of the terms, either of the terms, or both terms. For example, the phrase \u201cA or B\u201d will be understood to include the possibilities of \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d or \u201cA and B.\u201d","In addition, where features or aspects of the disclosure are described in terms of Markush groups, those skilled in the art will recognize that the disclosure is also thereby described in terms of any individual member or subgroup of members of the Markush group.","As will be understood by one skilled in the art, for any and all purposes, such as in terms of providing a written description, all ranges disclosed herein also encompass any and all possible subranges and combinations of subranges thereof. Any listed range can be easily recognized as sufficiently describing and enabling the same range being broken down into at least equal halves, thirds, quarters, fifths, tenths, etc. As a non-limiting example, each range discussed herein can be readily broken down into a lower third, middle third and upper third, etc. As will also be understood by one skilled in the art all language such as \u201cup to,\u201d \u201cat least,\u201d and the like include the number recited and refer to ranges, which can be subsequently broken down into subranges as discussed above. Finally, as will be understood by one skilled in the art, a range includes each individual member. Thus, for example, a group having 1-3 substituents refers to groups having 1, 2, or 3 substituents. Similarly, a group having 1-5 substituents refers to groups having 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 substituents, and so forth."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 8"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
