title: Low complexity echo compensation system
abstract: An echo reduction system includes a signal analysis filter that converts an input into sub-band signals. A signal down-sampling circuit down-samples the sub-band signals at a first down-sampling rate. An echo analysis filter converts a loudspeaker signal into echo sub-band signal that are further processed by an echo down-sampling circuit. The circuit down-samples the echo sub-band signals at a second down-sampling rate to generate down-sampled echo sub-band signals. An echo compensation filter folds the down-sampled echo sub-band signals with an estimated impulse response of a loudspeaker-room-input system. A second echo down-sampling circuit down-samples the folded down-sampled echo sub-band signals at a third down-sampling rate to generate estimated echo sub-band signals. The first down-sampling rate is equal to the product of the second and third down-sampling rates.

The Generalized Sidelobe Canceller may include a first or lower adaptive signal processing path with a blocking matrix and an adaptive noise-canceling circuit. The Generalized Sidelobe Canceller may include a second or upper non-adaptive signal processing path with a fixed beam-former. The beam-forming circuit  may process the signals using a process described by \u201cAn alternative approach to linearly constrained adaptive beamforming,\u201d by Griffiths, IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation, vol. 30, p. 27, 1982, which is incorporated by reference.","The beam-forming circuit  may combine the sub-band error signals \u201ce(n)\u201d for each of the \u201ck\u201d input channels to generate beam-formed sub-band signals. A beam-formed filter circuit  may receive the beam-formed sub-band signals and may suppress a residual echo to enhance the quality of the beam-formed sub-band signals. The beam-formed filter circuit  may include a Wiener filter. The Weiner filter may reduce background noise in the frequency domain according to Equation 8 below:\n\n()=1()\/()\u2003\u2003(Eqn. 8)\n\nwhere \u015c(e, n) may denote an estimated short-time power density of the background noise, and\n\nwhere \u015c(e, n) may denote a short-time power density of the full-band error signal.\n","The beam-formed filter circuit  may generate enhanced sub-band signals \u201c\u015d(n).\u201d A synthesis filter bank  may receive the enhanced sub-band signals \u201c\u015d(n).\u201d The synthesis filter bank  may include a plurality of up-sampling circuits  and corresponding synthesis sub-band filters . Each up-sampling circuit  may receive the corresponding enhanced sub-band signals \u201c\u015d(n).\u201d The up-sampling circuits  may up-sample the sub-band signals using the factor \u201cr\u201d as the up-sampling factor. The up-sampling factor \u201cr\u201d may be equal to the first down-sampling factor \u201cr,\u201d where r=(r)(r). Each synthesis sub-band filter  may include high-pass filters, band-pass filters, and\/or low-pass filters to reduce or eliminate artifacts. A summing circuit  may sum the output of each of the synthesis sub-band filters  to generate a synthesized speech signal \u201c\u015d(n).\u201d","The logic, circuitry, and processing described above may be encoded in a computer-readable medium such as a CDROM, disk, flash memory, RAM or ROM, an electromagnetic signal, or other machine-readable medium as instructions for execution by a processor. Alternatively or additionally, the logic may be implemented as analog or digital logic using hardware, such as one or more integrated circuits (including amplifiers, adders, delays, and filters), or one or more processors executing amplification, adding, delaying, and filtering instructions; or in software in an application programming interface (API) or in a Dynamic Link Library (DLL), functions available in a shared memory or defined as local or remote procedure calls; or as a combination of hardware and software.","The logic may be represented in (e.g., stored on or in) a computer-readable medium, machine-readable medium, propagated-signal medium, and\/or signal-bearing medium. The media may comprise any device that contains, stores, communicates, propagates, or transports executable instructions for use by or in connection with an instruction executable system, apparatus, or device. The machine-readable medium may selectively be, but is not limited to, an electronic, magnetic, optical, electromagnetic, or infrared signal or a semiconductor system, apparatus, device, or propagation medium. A non-exhaustive list of examples of a machine-readable medium includes: a magnetic or optical disk, a volatile memory such as a Random Access Memory \u201cRAM,\u201d a Read-Only Memory \u201cROM,\u201d an Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (i.e., EPROM) or Flash memory, or an optical fiber. A machine-readable medium may also include a tangible medium upon which executable instructions are printed, as the logic may be electronically stored as an image or in another format (e.g., through an optical scan), then compiled, and\/or interpreted or otherwise processed. The processed medium may then be stored in a computer and\/or machine memory.","The systems may include additional or different logic and may be implemented in many different ways. A controller may be implemented as a microprocessor, microcontroller, application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), discrete logic, or a combination of other types of circuits or logic. Similarly, memories may be DRAM, SRAM, Flash, or other types of memory. Parameters (e.g., conditions and thresholds) and other data structures may be separately stored and managed, may be incorporated into a single memory or database, or may be logically and physically organized in many different ways. Programs and instruction sets may be parts of a single program, separate programs, or distributed across several memories and processors. The systems may be included in a wide variety of electronic devices, including a cellular phone, a headset, a hands-free set, a speakerphone, communication interface, or an infotainment system.","While various embodiments of the invention have been described, it will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that many more embodiments and implementations are possible within the scope of the invention.
