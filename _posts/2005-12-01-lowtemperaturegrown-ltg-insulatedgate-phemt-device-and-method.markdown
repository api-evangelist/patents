Nichols, D. Xu, X. Yang, M. Pizzella, W. Kong, GOMACTech-05, pp. 403-406, April 2005, which is incorporated herein by reference.","Several types of field-effect-transistors (FETs) are available for use at microwave\/millimeter-wave frequencies. These high-frequency FETs include metal-semiconductor-field-effect-transistors (MESFETs) and high-electron-mobility-transistors (HEMTs). A HEMT is distinguished from a MESFET in that in a HEMT, charge is transferred from a charge donor layer to an undoped channel layer.","There are generally two types of HEMTs. One type is referred to simply as a HEMT, whereas the other type is referred to as a pseudomorphic-HEMT or PHEMT. The difference between a HEMT and a PHEMT is that in the PHEMT, one or more layers of the PHEMT have a lattice constant that differs significantly from the lattice constant of other materials that compose the device. As a result of this lattice mismatch, the crystal structure of the material forming the PHEMT channel layer is strained. Although this lattice mismatch (and the corresponding strain) makes growth of PHEMTs more difficult than the growth of HEMTs, several performance advantages are obtained. For example, the charge density transferred into the PHEMT channel layer is increased, often resulting in high electron mobility and high electron saturated velocity. As a result, a PHEMT can develop higher power levels and can operate at higher frequencies with improved noise properties as compared to a HEMT.","In particular, the gallium arsenide (GaAs) PHEMT has played a major role in microwave\/millimeter-wave amplification and control applications. However, to enable still more capable systems, there continues to be significant efforts aimed at improving the breakdown voltage and the power-handling performance of a GaAs PHEMT. An improvement to the PHEMT structure can be achieved for power and switch devices by emulating the metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) device structures commonly found in Silicon-based FET technology. The primary limitation why such a similar device has not found its way into GaAs technology is the notable absence of a viable gate-insulator material.","Previous attempts for such a gate-insulator layer include the use of oxides, sapphire materials, and aluminum oxides. However, these attempts have typically been unsuccessful because once a GaAs wafer is removed from a processing chamber (typically a molecular-beam-epitaxy chamber), the surface of the wafer often forms holes, i.e., \u201cpins\u201d, such that it is difficult to impossible to form an oxide or other type of insulator on the wafer surface in a chemical-vapor-deposition (CVD) chamber.","An embodiment of a pseudomorphic-high-electron-mobility-transistor (PHEMT) includes a substrate, a low-temperature-grown (LTG) GaAs gate-insulator layer disposed on the substrate, and a gate electrode disposed on the gate-insulator layer.","The following discussion of an embodiment of the invention illustrates the use of a highly-insulating crystalline material known as low-temperature-grown (LTG) GaAs as a PHEMT gate insulator. LTG GaAs is lattice-matched to the underlying GaAs and exhibits properties that make it suited for use as a gate insulator in a GaAs PHEMT device. As a material, LTG GaAs is deposited, or grown, by molecular-beam-epitaxy (MBE) at a relatively low substrate temperature (\u02dc200\u00b0 C.) as compared with the deposition temperature of conventional conducting GaAs (\u02dc600\u00b0 C.). The low growth temperature results in a material exhibiting a combination of high breakdown field, high resistivity, and short photoexcited-carrier lifetime.

The LTG GaAs buffer layer  is grown at approximately 200\u00b0 C. within a tolerance of approximately \u00b110\u00b0 C. This causes the carriers within the buffer layer  to have a low mobility and thus causes the buffer layer to have a high resistance. The buffer layer  is also undoped, and has a thickness in the range of approximately 0.5 microns (\u03bcm) to approximately 1.0 \u03bcm.","The first spacer layer  is disposed on the LTG GaAs buffer layer , and improves the mobility of charge within the first undoped AlGaAs layer .","In one embodiment, the first spacer layer  is a combination of multiple layers as discussed below in conjunction with .","Referring to , the first spacer layer  includes a first doped layer , a super-lattice layer , and a second doped layer .","The first doped layer  is disposed on the LTG GaAs buffer layer , and has a thickness of approximately 100 \u212b. In one embodiment, the first doped layer  is an AlAs layer doped with silicon. But the layer  may also be an AlGaAs layer having approximately 50% or more aluminum.","The super-lattice layer  is disposed on the first doped layer , is a super-lattice GaAs\/AlGaAs layer, and has a thickness in the range of approximately 200 \u212b to approximately 800 \u212b.","The second doped layer  acts as a carrier barrier layer, is disposed on the super-lattice layer , is a doped AlGaAs layer, and has a thickness of approximately 50 \u212b.","Referring again to , the first undoped AlGaAs layer  is disposed on the first spacer layer , and has a thickness of approximately 50 \u212b.","The InGaAs channel layer  is disposed on the first undoped AlGaAs layer , is where the channel between the drain and source electrodes  and  is formed, and has a thickness in the range of approximately 90 \u212b to approximately 120 \u212b. The channel layer  may be doped so as to be conducting P- or N-type material.","The second undoped AlGaAs layer  is disposed on the InGaAs channel layer , and has a thickness of approximately 45 \u212b.","The doped AlGaAs layer  is disposed on the second undoped AlGaAs layer , and has a thickness of approximately 200 \u212b. During the formation of the doped AlGaAs layer , a silicon doping spike  is formed as indicated by the dashed line, where the concentration of the doping spike  is approximately 4\u00d710atoms\/cm. For example, the deposition of AlGaAs layer  is temporarily halted, and a layer of Si having a concentration of approximately 4\u00d710Si atoms is formed. Then, the remaining portion of the AlGaAs layer  is formed over the Si layer. Furthermore, it is contemplated that Si atoms from the spike layer  may diffuse into the upper and lower portions of the AlGaAs layer  or into other layers. The doping spike  effectively separates the positive dopant charges from the negative dopant charges in the InGaAs channel layer  to reduce or eliminate charge scattering.","The doped GaAs layer  is disposed on the doped AlGaAs layer , and has a thickness in the range of approximately 100 \u212b to approximately 500 \u212b, such as a thickness of approximately 300 \u212b in one embodiment. The GaAs layer  is doped with Si, and in one embodiment has a Si-doping concentration of approximately 2\u00d710atoms\/cm.","The second spacer layer  is disposed on the doped GaAs layer , and has a thickness in the range of approximately 25 \u212b to approximately 100 \u212b. In one embodiment, the second spacer layer  is an AlAs layer. But the layer  may also be an AlGaAs layer having approximately 50% or more aluminum.","The LTG GaAs gate-insulator layer  is disposed on the second spacer layer , and has a thickness in the range of approximately 200 \u212b to approximately 1000 \u212b, such as a thickness of approximately 500 \u212b. The LTG GaAs gate-insulator layer  is grown at approximately 200\u00b0 C. within a tolerance of approximately \u00b13\u00b0 C. Where the insulator layer  is thinner than the LTG GaAs buffer layer , the tolerance of the growing temperature for the insulator layer  may be less than the tolerance for the buffer layer . A relatively tight tolerance of the layer  growth temperature of about 200\u00b0 C. causes the insulator layer  to have a relatively low carrier lifetime, and thus a relatively high resistivity. The insulator layer  is undoped, but doping this and any of the other undoped layers is contemplated.","The gate electrode  is disposed on the LTG GaAs insulator layer .","The source electrode  and the drain electrode  each pass through the LTG GaAs insulator layer  and contact the second spacer layer . Although not shown in , the source  and the drain  are alloyed down through the layers , ,  and  until they contact or effectively merge into the channel layer  in which is formed a channel between the source  and the drain .","For switching applications, the LTG GaAs insulated-gate PHEMT  may offer several advantages over a conventional PHEMT. First, the LTG GaAs insulator layer  may significantly increase the isolation between the gate  and the conducting channel. This increased isolation may result in a nearly two-fold increase of the gate-drain breakdown voltage of the PHEMT , and may improve the power-handling capability of the device. Second, insofar as conventional PHEMTs are typically limited to a forward gate bias gate-to-source voltage below 0.6V, the insulated-gate PHEMT  may be capable of sustaining a forward gate bias of several volts. This relatively large forward bias acts to reduce the channel resistance and associated \u201con-state\u201d drain-to-source resistance of the PHEMT  where the PHEMT behaves like an N-type MOS transistor. Third, the capacitance associated with the LTG GaAs insulator layer  may enable the PHEMT  to exhibit an overall lower and more constant gate capacitance with a forward bias.
