The main objective of the 1995 Zak publication is to demonstrate that the mathematical formalism for DED can be based upon a terminal model of Newtonian dynamics, which allows one to relax Lipschitz conditions at some discrete points. A broad class of complex dynamical behaviors can be derived from a simple differential equation as described in the 1995 Zak publication and in Michail Zak \u201cIntroduction to terminal dynamics,\u201d 7, 59-87 (1993)1\n\nsin \u03c9, \u03c9=cos \u2003\u2003(Equation 1A)\n","In the publication by Michail Zak entitled \u201cTerminal Attractors for Addressable Memory in Neural Networks,\u201d Physics Letters A, Vol. 133, Issues 1-2, pages 18-22 (Oct. 31, 1988) (hereby incorporated by reference), terminal attractors are introduced for an addressable memory in neural networks operating in continuous time. These attractors represent singular solutions of the dynamical system. They intersect (or envelope) the families of regular solutions while each regular solution approaches the terminal attractor in a finite time period. According to the author (Zak), terminal attractors can be incorporated into neural networks such that any desired set of these attractors with prescribed basins is provided by an appropriate selection of the weight matrix.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,544,280 to Hua-Kuang Liu, et al. ('280 patent) (hereby incorporated by reference), discloses a unipolar terminal-attractor based neural associative memory (TABAM) system with adaptive threshold for alleged \u201cperfect\u201d convergence. It is noted that an associative memory or content-addressable memory (CAM) is a special type of computer memory in which the user inputs a data word and the memory is searched for storage of the data word. If the data word is located in the CAM, the CAM returns a list of one or more locations or addresses where the data word is located.","According to the '280 patent, one of the major applications of neural networks is in the area of associative memory. The avalanche of intensive research interests in neural networks was initiated by the work of J. J. Hopfield, \u201cNeural Networks and Physical Systems with Emergent Collective Computational Abilities,\u201d Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci, U.S.A., Vol. 79 p. 2254-258 (1982) (hereby incorporated by reference). U.S. Pat. No. 4,660,106 (in which Hopfield is listed as the inventor) (hereby incorporated by reference) discloses an associative memory modeled with a neural synaptic interconnection matrix and encompasses an interesting computation scheme using recursive, nonlinear thresholding. Further investigation reported that the storage capacity of the Hopfield Model is quite limited due to the number of spurious states and oscillations. In order to alleviate the spurious states problems in the Hopfield model, the concept of terminal attractors was introduced by M. Zak, \u201cTerminal Attractors for Addressable Memory in Neural Networks, Phys. Lett. Vol. A-133, pp. 18-22 (1988)(hereby incorporated by reference). However, the theory of the terminal-attractor based associative neural network model proposed by Zak determines that a new synapse matrix totally different from the Hopfield matrix is needed. This new matrix, which is very complex and time-consuming to compute, was proven to eliminate spurious states, increase the speed of convergence and control the basin of attraction. Zak's derivation shows that the Hopfield matrix only works if all the stored states in the network are orthogonal. However, since the synapses have changed from those determined by Hebb's law, Zak's model is different from the Hopfield model, except for the dynamical iteration of the recall process. According to the '280 patent, the improvement of the storage capacity of the Hopfield model by the terminal attractor cannot be determined based on Zak's model. The '280 patent discloses a TABAM system which, unlike the complex terminal attractor system of Zak, supra, is not defined by a continuous differential equation and therefore can be readily implemented optically.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,188,964 hereby incorporated by reference, purportedly discloses a method for generating residual statics corrections to compensate for surface-consistent static time shifts in stacked seismic traces. The method includes a step of framing the residual static corrections as a global optimization problem in a parameter space. A plurality of parameters are introduced in N-dimensional space, where N is the total number of the sources and receivers. The objective function has a plurality of minimum in the N-dimensional space and at least one of the plurality of minimum is a global minimum. An iteration is performed using a computer; a plurality of pseudo-Lipschitz constants are used to construct a plurality of Pijavski cones to exclude regions on the N-dimensional space where the global minimum is unlikely until a global minimum is substantially reached. See Col. 7, lines 1-10. Using described procedures, it is reported that a reasonably good estimate of the global maximum may be determined. See Col. 9, Lines 45-51.","A preferred embodiment of the present invention is directed to the use of analog VLSI technology to implement non-Lipschitz dynamics in networks of coupled neurons for information processing. A component in the analog circuit implementation is an attractor\/repeller neuron which faithfully approximates the modulated terminal dynamics {dot over (v)}=s(t)sgn(v)+\u03b5(t). The attractor\/repeller neuron may be programmable to become either a terminal attractor or terminal repeller. A preferred embodiment comprises a programmable interconnected network of eight non-Lipschitz neurons implemented in analog VLSI as illustrated in . Measurements on the fabricated chip have confirmed the generation of proper terminal dynamics. A circuit board has been developed to interface the chip with instrumentation and to configure the chip in different modes of operation.","The method and network use both terminal attractors and terminal repellers in the construction of an analog circuit to achieve a non-Lipschitz dynamics process which can solve important mathematical and physics, problems. The analog circuit uses \u201cnoise\u201d in the circuit where the system is near the attractor\/repeller points to introduce randomness into the branching of the dynamical paths. If the analog circuit were cooled to low temperature or otherwise implemented in a quantum system the noise there would come from quantum effects. Because of the non-Lipschitz properties, the method can be used to: a) make neural network analog circuits, b) improve the speed of circuits, and c) increase the speed of computer calculations.","A preferred embodiment comprises a network of coupled neurons for implementing Non-Lipschitz dynamics for modeling nonlinear processes or conditions comprising: a plurality of attractor\/repeller neurons, each of the plurality of neurons being configurable in attractor and repulsion modes of operation, the plurality of attractor\/repeller neurons being programmable by an external control signal; a plurality of synaptic connections; at least a portion of the plurality of neurons being interconnected by the synaptic connections for passage of data from one neuron to another; and feedback circuitry for incrementing and decrementing an analog voltage output depending upon the output of the synaptic connection; whereby by the circuit solves Non-Lipschitz problems by programably controlling the attractor and repulsion modes of operation.","The invention may be used to solve problems such as the Fokker-Plank equation, Schr\u00f6dinger equation, and Neural computations.","These and other aspects of the embodiments herein will be better appreciated and understood when considered in conjunction with the following description and the accompanying drawings.

Zak, J P Zbilut and R E Meyers, , Lecture Notes in Physics 49, Springer-Verlag (1997). A fundamental component in the non-Lipschitz models is the terminal attractor:\n\n()+\u03b5()\u2003\u2003(Equation 22A)\n\nwhere the function q(v) is monotonically decreasing and zero at the origin, but with a singularity in the first-order derivative.

The singularity in the first order derivative now allows the state variable v to escape the equilibrium in finite time, even in the absence of noise \u03b5(t). Variable timing in the escape of terminal repellers contribute randomness to an otherwise deterministic system.\n","For information processing, it is desirable to modulate the terminal dynamics of v(t) with an external signal s(t), that can switch between terminal attraction and repulsion modes of operation:\n\n()()+\u03b5()\u2003\u2003(Equation 24A)\n\nwhere s(t)>0 for terminal attraction, s(t)<0 for terminal repulsion, and s(t)=0 for stationary dynamics. The timing of the signal s(t) allows to enforce zero initial conditions on the state variable v(t) in attractor mode, for subsequent repulsion as influenced by \u03b5. The critical dependence of the trajectory v(t) on initial conditions in the noise (or signal) \u03b5(t) can be exploited to generate coupled nonlinear chaotic dynamics in a network of neurons.

See, for example, M. Zak, JP Zbilut and R E Meyers, , Lecture Notes in Physics 49, Springer-Verlag (1997) (hereby incorporated by reference)\n\nCircuit Model\n","The main difficulty in the circuit implementation of non-Lipschitz terminal attraction and repulsion lies in precise realization of the singularity of the first order derivative in the state variable. Strictly speaking, it is impossible to implement the desired singularity as it would require an amplifier with both infinite gain and infinite bandwidth. A suitable approximation that generates terminal dynamics within the limits of noise in the circuits is desired.","Terminal Attractor ","Without loss of generality a binary quantizer element for q(v) is considered:\n\n()=\u00b7()\u2003\u2003(Equation 27A)\n\nconveniently implemented using a high-gain inverting amplifier , quantizing the analog voltage v to a digital voltage q.  shows the implementation of the terminal attractor  using the quantization model (Equation 27A). Two complementary MOS differential pairs (, ) steer a current of polarity controlled by q into a capacitor () on the node v, generating the dynamics (Equation 22A). The temporal scale of the terminal dynamics is given by the capacitance and the tail currents of the differential pairs, set by nMOS and pMOS bias voltages Vand V, respectively.\n","Parasitics on the q node effect a delay in the quantization which could potentially give rise to limit cycle oscillations in v(t) around the terminal attractor state. The amplitude of these oscillations can be made arbitrarily small by increasing the dominance of the pole corresponding to the v node. This is accomplished by increasing the capacitance on v, and decreasing the amplitude of the tail currents. It is also possible to internally compensating the amplifier, at the expense of the sharpness of the singularity in the characteristic q(v).","Terminal Repeller ","The terminal attractor circuit  can be modified to implement terminal repulsion by inclusion of an additional inversion stage between the inverting amplifier output and the current-steering differential pairs. Terminal repeller  comprises subcircuits A (also appearing in  as shown in . The inversion stages are shown in the terminal repeller  of  as two additional inverting amplifiers. The reason for using complementary (pseudo-nMOS and pseudo-pMOS) structures for inverting amplifiers is to provide hysteresis in the positive feedback dynamical response of q(v). The pseudo-nMOS amplifier (top) provides a threshold near the lower supply range, and the threshold of the pseudo-pMOS amplifier (bottom) approaches the higher supply.","The delay introduced by the extra stage is not a source of concern as positive feedback excludes the possibility of limit oscillations. More immediately of concern are effects of transistor offset and mismatch in the circuit implementation. These effects can be minimized by reusing the same circuit components for implementing both terminal attraction and repulsion in alternating modes of operation.","Non-Lipschitz Neuron ","The non-Lipschitz neuron implements the modulated form (Equation 24A) and in effect combines both terminal attraction and repulsion circuits of  in a single circuit, shown in . The modulation signal s(t) takes one of three levels {\u22121, 0, +1}, supplied in the form of switch control signals R (Repel), I (Inert) and A (Attract), respectively. The signals A and R are complementary (set globally by a single R\/overline A control line), and configure the circuit either as the attractor of , or the repellor of . Signal I breaks either of the two feedback loops and leaves v in a high-impedance (inert) state.","By using the same quantizer element in all three operation modes, it is possible to initialize the node voltage vin attraction mode to the same equilibrium value as in repulsion mode. Switching s(t) (R\/overline A) then turns the equilibrium point from terminally stable to terminally unstable. The hysteresis [dead zone of feedback from the output q(v)] in repulsion mode allows to integrate the external neural signal \u03b5(t) over time before positive feedback selects a definite direction in the output. For a zero signal component of \u03b5, noise present internally in the circuit will cause the output to randomly decide polarity.","Synaptic and Neural Network Dynamics","Synaptic connectivity according to Equation (26A) is implemented using the current-inode circuit cell shown in . The circuit takes a digital input qthat selects between one of two current sources T (q=1) and T (q=\u22121), to contribute a current Tqonto an integration node x() Both current sources are bipolar, and are implemented as the difference between positive currents collected on the drain terminals of nMOS , A and pMOS transistors , A. The nMOS current sinking transistors , A are supplied with bias voltages T and T (near GND) on the gate terminals, and similarly the pMOS current sourcing transistors , A are supplied with bias voltages T and T (near Vdd). The hashmarks shown in  indicate that the states qcouple to several x(integration nodes ) in the form of several synapses T. The source terminals are switched by q(and ) rather than gate terminals, to avoid switch injection noise during transients and to allow precise control of very small currents, as needed to attain large dynamic range in neural integration times.","Referring now to , the values for the currents Tmay be determined as follows. T onto nMOS  generates a current out of x(negative into x) when qis logic high. Conversely, T onto nMOS A generates a current out of x(negative into x) when qis logic low; T onto pMOS  generates a current into x(positive into x) when qis logic high; and T onto pMOS A generates a current into x(positive into x) when qis logic low. Therefore, the network implements the following net current into x, integrated onto node  in :\n\n(()+())\n\nwhere qtakes-values 0 (logic low) and 1 (logic high), and is its complement. The constant values for the generated currents T, T, T, T in this model are controlled by the voltages (and are exponential in the voltages) on these T, T, T, T nodes.\n","In this regard, see G.
