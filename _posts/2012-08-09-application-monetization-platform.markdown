{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND","DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61\/521,733 filed on Aug. 9, 2011 and of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61\/669,443 filed on Jul. 9, 2012 both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. This application is related to commonly-owned and concurrently filed PCT Application Serial No. PCT\/US2012\/050208.","This application generally relates to implementing aspects of gambling and\/or betting into third party gaming applications.","Developments in computing technology in recent years have led to an increased market for applications that are executable on various different types of computer devices including handheld devices such as mobile smart phones, tablet computers, etc., as well as more traditional computer devices such as desktops or laptops. One popular genre of applications are gaming applications where users play virtual games of varying complexity. Although there are many applications in circulation, developers' current methods for monetizing the applications are often inadequate.","One existing gaming application monetization method relies on in-game advertising. Advertisements are provided within the application itself and provide revenue to the developer based on interactions between the users and specific advertisements (e.g., number of impressions, number of click-throughs, etc.). Many gaming application users, however, consider the advertisements to be a nuisance at best. A developer that includes advertisements, or too many advertisements, in its gaming application risks driving away potential users.","According to another existing gaming application monetization method, developers charge users for access to the code implementing the application itself. The purchased access may include a download of the code (e.g., in executable form) to the user's computer device and\/or access the application as executed at a remote server. It is often difficult, however, to persuade users to pay for an application before the user has played the associated game.","According to yet another monetization method, users are initially provided with access to gaming applications for free. Once a user has begun to access the application, the user is provided with opportunities to purchase extras, such as virtual goods used within the game and\/or additional levels. This method has the capacity to generate a high revenue per user for users that are motivated enough to purchase virtual goods and levels. Typically, however, a large number of users simply play the free portions of the game without purchasing extras, that is the free-to-paid conversion is often relatively low. Thus, the average customer lifetime value (CLV) and average revenue per user (ARPU) are often low.","The features and advantages described in the specification are not all inclusive and, in particular, many additional features and advantages will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in view of the drawings, specification, and claims. The language used in the specification has been principally selected for readability and instructional purposes, and may not have been selected to delineate or circumscribe the disclosed subject matter.","The figures and the following description relate to example embodiments of the invention by way of illustration only. Alternative example embodiments of the structures and methods disclosed here may be employed without departing from the principles of what is claimed.","To improve monetization of game and other applications, developers may incorporate functionality to allow users to place monetary wagers or bets within an application. Entities offering monetary wagers or bets to the public are often subject to significant licensing, and regulatory requirements. The expenses and liabilities associated with obtaining and maintaining appropriate licenses as well as complying with relevant regulatory schemes can constitute a significant barrier to entry for application developers. For example, a developer or other entity offering a gambling application must identify jurisdictions where a gambling license is required and, for each jurisdiction, engage in onerous expensive and often time-consuming procedures to obtain the required licenses. Even after appropriate licenses are obtained, the licensed entity must comply with strict regulations relating to game play, accounting, and even banking services.","Various example embodiments are directed to systems and methods for facilitating the incorporation of monetary wagers or bets into third-party applications. For example, the systems and methods described herein may obviate the need for individual developers to obtain gambling licenses. A gaming management system may be implemented by a facilitating business entity or facilitating entity having one or more gambling licenses. The gaming management system provides third-party application developers with functionality to incorporate monetary wagers or bets into their gaming applications. For example, developers may allow application users to wager on outcomes of one or more contingent events, described in more detail below. Allowable parameters of contingent events and bets that may be placed are controlled by the gaming management system. In this way, the gaming management system may ensure that any bets placed are in compliance with applicable regulations and\/or with previously approved contingent event forms. When the resulting applications are executed, users may place bets through the gaming management system. For example, the gaming management system may: determine an outcome for each contingent game event, determine winnings or losses, and distribute the winnings or losses to the user. In this way, the applications may utilize a gambling license or licenses held by the facilitating entity. Accordingly, the developer may develop the applications, distribute the applications, and obtain users, while the facilitating entity may operate gambling aspects of the game in accordance with applicable regulations and licenses (e.g., held by the facilitating entity).","As used herein, the term \u201cgambling license,\u201d \u201clicense\u201d or \u201cgaming license\u201d refers to a license that is held by an entity offering betting, wagering or other gaming to the public. In some jurisdictions, a gambling license may be required to offer certain types of betting, wagering or other gaming to the public.","Contingent events, also referred to as contingent game events, may be situations within a game or other type of application that have an unknown outcome and may be the subject of a bet or wager. A contingent event may have at least two potential outcomes. Each potential outcome may be associated with a probability that the potential outcome will occur. Probabilities for different potential outcomes may be fixed (e.g., set in advance) and\/or parameterized (e.g., determined based on circumstances of game play surrounding the contingent event). The gaming management system may resolve contingent events based on the probabilities for the potential outcomes. For example, the gaming management system may randomly select one of the potential outcomes based on the relevant probabilities (e.g., utilizing a random number generator or any other suitable type of method or device). The selected outcome may be referred to as the outcome of the contingent event.","Contingent events may be any type of event that can occur in the context of a game or other type of application where the outcome is initially unknown. It will be appreciated, however, that different types of applications can manifest contingent events in different forms. For example, some use cases involving contingent events relate to applications that implement games traditionally associated with gambling, such as slot machine games, card games, craps games, etc. In games such as these, contingent events may be similar to the unknown events on which physical versions of the game are played. For example, in a slot machine game, a virtual pull of the slot machine lever is a contingent event. Each potential configuration of the slot machine reels may correspond to a potential outcome, with the probability of each potential outcome corresponding to the configuration of the reels. In a craps game, each roll of the dice is a contingent event, with each potential configuration of the dice corresponding to a potential outcome. In card games, such as poker, blackjack, etc., the deal is a contingent event. Potential outcomes may correspond to potential cards and\/or hands held by each player after the deal. In some example embodiments, contingent events may be compound. For example, the outcome of a hand of poker can depend on multiple rounds of betting and multiple deals. Examples of games implementing traditional gambling wagers include SLOTS and POKER, both available from ZYNGA.","Other use cases for contingent events relate to games that are not typically associated with gambling. For example, one currently popular genre of social network games involves the planting and raising of crops, animals, etc. Examples of games in this genre include FARMVILLE and CITYVILLE, both available from ZYNGA, FARMTOWN available from SLASHKEY, etc. In these games, users virtually \u201cplant\u201d crops. When the crops are ready, the user may virtually \u201charvest\u201d the crops for in-game rewards, such as virtual currency, experience points, etc. In one example of a game implemented with the gaming management system described herein, the planting of a crop is a contingent event. The user's wager may take the form of a payment for the seeds or other resources necessary to plant the crop. The user's winnings (if any) may be determined based on the success of the harvest. Potential outcomes of the contingent event include a successful harvest, an unsuccessful harvest and\/or various gradations between a successful and unsuccessful harvest. Contingent events corresponding to the planting of crops, in some example embodiments, may be parameterized. For example, the probability of a successful harvest outcome may be based on predetermined factors, but may also be based on user behavior (e.g., whether the user waters the crops, whether the user harvests the crops on time, whether the user feeds or waters an animal, etc.).","Another use case for contingent events relates to games of skill. A contingent event may be a particular play or set of plays (e.g., a set of plays making up a level). The potential outcomes for each contingent event may reflect the possible results of a play. The probability for each potential outcome may be determined based on the difficulty of the play or level. In some example embodiments, the probability for a given outcome may be parameterized (e.g., based on the user's skill level or past history with the game. Examples of games of skill that may utilize contingent events as described include the various iterations of ANGRY BIRDS available from ROVIO ENTERTAINMENT, LTD. For example, a contingent event may be a bird launch or series of bird launches. Potential outcomes of the contingent event may relate to the number of enemies defeated.","Another example use case relates to a currently popular genre of games involves conflicts between different users, with each user corresponding to an individual and\/or army that is a party to the conflict. Examples of games in this genre include MAFIA WARS and MAFIA WARS 2 from ZYNGA. In games of this genre, fights or conflicts between players are one example contingent event type. For example, a user may bet that they will win a conflict, that they will win a conflict in a certain number of turns, with at least a certain amount of energy remaining, etc. Potential outcomes may correspond to potential outcomes of the conflict. In some example embodiments, the probabilities of each potential outcome may depend on properties of the users involved. Such properties may be parameters of the contingent event and can include, for example, skill and\/or experience points associated with each user, game items possessed by each user (e.g., weapons), etc.","In some example embodiments, not limited to conflict-type games, contingent events may be utilized to cross-sell other products within applications such as, for example, level packs, virtual goods, etc. For example, applications may be configured to prompt users to purchase additional level packs, virtual goods, etc. by advertising that the promoted purchases will increase the user's probability of winning wagers on contingent events. Such prompts may be provided at any time during game play. In some example embodiments, the prompts may be provided after the user has lost a wager. For example, the application may be configured to inform the user that possession of a particular virtual good would have increased the user's chances of winning.","It will be appreciated that contingent events may be applied to any type of game or other application involving an event with an unknown outcome upon which the user can wager or place a bet. The contingent event examples provided herein are intended only as examples. Also, it will be appreciated that games and other application types using contingent events may be provided directly to a user and\/or via an intermediate application or game. For example, the user's character within the intermediate game may play a contingent event game. For example, an application may implement a casino comprising various gambling games for avatars of the game SECOND LIFE from LINDON LABS and\/or similar games.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","102","102"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["104","106","104","106","104","106","107","107","102","104","100","116","116","116"]},"The gaming management system  may comprise various functional components , , ,  that may be implemented, for example, as software code executed by the gaming management system . An application program interface (API)  provides an interface allowing the gaming application  to communicate with the gaming management system . For example, the API  may support commands (described herein) allowing applications to pass an indication of a contingent event and associated parameters (if present). The outcome for the contingent event as determined by the gaming management system  may also be passed from the gaming management system  to the application. A random number generator (RNG)  may be programmed to resolve contingent events (e.g., select a potential outcome from the plurality of potential outcomes based on the probabilities of the potential outcomes). An accounting layer  is programmed to track the financial results of each contingent event. For example, the accounting layer  may determine the winnings or losses for the user or the house based on the outcome of each contingent event. The winnings or losses of the parties may be based on properties of the contingent event as well as parameters of the contingent event, such as an amount of a wager made by the user, a property of the user within the application, etc. A banking layer  may execute transactions to implement the outcome of a contingent event. The specific required transactions for a contingent event are determined, for example, by the banking layer  and\/or by the accounting layer .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0069"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["102","202","204","202","204","102","102","204","102","204","102","202","102","204","204","210","204","102","202","204","210","204","102","102","112","114","204","102","112"]},"During game play, the application  may encounter a contingent event. As described herein, the application  may provide the user  with an opportunity to place a wager on the contingent event. At , the user  may place a wager or take another gambling action. The application  may pass the contingent event as well as the wager of the user  and any other parameters for resolving the contingent event to the gaming management system  at  (e.g., via the API ). The gaming management system  may resolve the contingent event as described herein (e.g., utilizing the RNG ). Based on the outcome of the contingent event, the gaming management system  may determine the results of one or more bets placed on the contingent event. Winnings or losses to be attributed to the user  and the house (e.g., utilizing the accounting layer ). At , the gaming management system , for example utilizing the banking layer , may initiate account transfers to realize the results of the one or more bets. For example, winnings and\/or losses may be transferred to and\/or from accounts of the user  and\/or the house.

For example, some applications may have a virtual-only mode, where the user can earn only virtual currency and goods. In the virtual-only mode, contingent event resolution and the distribution of winnings and\/or losses may be handled by the application (without the gaming management system ) and\/or by the gaming management system . For example, the gaming management system  may also be configured to handle virtual wagers on contingent events. When a virtual wager is made, contingent event resolution may be handled by the RNG  and accounting layer  as described above. Virtual currency or other goods, in some example embodiments, may be recorded in a user's virtual account separate from the user's real money account. Also, for virtual wagers, it may not be necessary to utilize the banking module  to transfer funds, as no real money may change hands. The prompt at  may be triggered by various different in-game events. For example, the user may be prompted to wager real money automatically upon execution of the application. Also, in some example embodiments, applications may be configured to prompt the user to wager real money after the user has won a virtual wager, won a threshold amount of virtual currency (e.g., non-zero) or goods, etc. Also, in some example embodiments, wagers for virtual goods, currency, etc. may be handled by the application itself and\/or by a server operated by and\/or associated with the developer of the application. For example, gambling licenses may not be required to promote wagers for virtual goods.","At , the application may transfer an application authentication  to the gaming management system  (e.g., provided that the user chooses to wager real money). The application authentication may be, for example, an API credential or other way of identifying and authenticating the application to the gaming management system . It will be appreciated that the application may have previously been configured and integrated with the gaming management system  as described herein below. For example, the authentication  may indicate that at least one contingent event associated with the application has been approved, for example, as described below with respect to . Upon receiving the application authentication , the gaming management system  may verify the application authentication, thereby confirming that the application is configured to operate with the gaming management system . In various example embodiments, communications between the application and the gaming management system  may be secured. For example, the communications may be encrypted according to any suitable encryption method including, for example, a public key infrastructure (PKI). In some example embodiments, the user device or other computer device executing the application may be in communication with the gaming management system  via a secure connection, such as a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), Transport Layer Security (TLS) and\/or Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) connection.","At , the gaming management system  may authenticate the user of the application. Authentication of the user may comprise various actions to ensure that the user is eligible to wager via the application, that the user is registered with the gaming management system  and that the user has accounts and funds including money for wagering. For example, in some example embodiments, the gaming management system  may provide the user with an authentication interface through the application itself. An example of such an interface is described below with respect to . For example, determining whether the user is eligible to wager may involve verifying that the user is above a minimum gambling age, that the user is in a jurisdiction that allows gambling, etc. In some example embodiments, the gaming management system may determine a user's location, for example, based on an Internet Protocol (IP) address of the user.","Upon authentication, the gaming management system  may optionally provide the user's gaming balance  to the application at . The gaming balance  may represent an amount of money that the user has deposited under management of the gaming management system  that is available to wager. The gaming balance  may be a balance specifically dedicated to the application or in some example embodiments may be the user's total available balance or total balance dedicated to a class of applications including the application. The application may display the gaming balance  at . It will be appreciated that some jurisdictions may require that the gaming balance be displayed to the user prior to wagering. If the user is present in such a jurisdiction, the gaming management system  may not permit wagering on contingent events until or unless the balance is displayed.","The application may implement a game or other functionality directed to the user. Upon encountering a contingent event, the application may, at , direct a contingent event request  to the gaming management system . The contingent event request  may include information about the type of contingent event and the wager placed on the event by the user. If the event is parameterized, the contingent event request may also include parameters for the contingent event. The gaming management system  may evaluate the contingent event request  at . Evaluating the contingent event request  may comprise, for example, resolving the contingent event utilizing the RNG  and determining any winnings and\/or losses from the outcome utilizing the accounting layer . Any financial transfers resulting from the outcome of the contingent event may be initiated at  (utilizing the banking layer ). At , the gaming management system  may send results  of the contingent event to the application.

In example embodiments where each application or game has a single contingent event type the contingent event type  may also be referred to as a game type. The contingent event type  may be one of a select number of predetermined contingent event types supported by the gaming management system . The predetermined contingent event types may be configured by the gaming management system  and\/or a programmer thereof to comply with applicable regulations. Examples of predetermined contingent event types may include, for example, a slot machine event type, a generic event type, a poker event type, a blackjack event type, etc. The gaming management system  may receive the contingent event type  at .","At , the developer may provide a configuration  for the contingent event type indicated at . The gaming management system  may receive the configuration  at . The configuration  may define characteristics of the contingent event for resolving the contingent event and settling any wagers made on the contingent event. For example, a contingent event configuration may indicate the potential outcomes for the contingent event, a probability for each potential outcome, parameters for wagers on the contingent event, etc. In some example embodiments, the configuration  may indicate parameters that are to be passed to the gaming management system  to determine probabilities of some or all of the potential outcomes of the contingent event. Such parameters may include, for example, characteristics of the user within a game (skill points, experience points, weapons possessed, etc.). In some example embodiments, the predetermined contingent event types may be supported by a framework for receiving configuration characteristics. According to the framework, the gaming management system  may prompt the developer for specific configuration characteristics corresponding to each contingent event type. For example, upon selecting a slot machine configuration type, the developer may be prompted for a number of reels, positions for the symbols on each reel, likelihoods of each reel returning specific symbols, etc. Also, for example, upon selecting a poker configuration type, the developer may be prompted for a game variation (e.g., five-card-draw, Texas hold-em, etc.), an ante amount, etc. As indicated above, some applications may have multiple contingent event types. For such applications, , , , , as described above, may be repeated for each contingent event type to be utilized by the application.","Upon receiving contingent event configurations for each contingent event in the application, the gaming management system  may provide the developer with an API credential , which may be received at . The API credential  may be incorporated into the application and may be provided to the gaming management system  during game play to indicate that the application is eligible to provide contingent event requests to the gaming management system . For example, referring back to , the API credential  may be all or part of the application authentication  transferred to the gaming management system  at . In some example embodiments, the received event configurations may be analyzed and tested before the API credential  is provided to the developer. For example, the received event configurations may be analyzed to determine contingent event parameters, such as the return to player, the variance, the overall win percentage, etc. These calculated values may be compared to allowable values. The allowable values may correspond to contingent events that meet regulatory criteria of one or more gambling licenses (e.g., held by the party implementing the gaming management system ) and\/or by contingent event forms that have already been approved by applicable regulators and\/or otherwise cleared for regulatory approval. Provided that the calculated values meet the allowable values, the API credential  may be provided to the developer.","At , the gaming management system  may determine allowable event configuration characteristics  and provide the allowable configuration characteristics  to the developer, which receives the same at . The allowable configuration characteristics  may express the limits of characteristics that the contingent event or events may have while still being in compliance with applicable regulations. For example, determining allowable configuration characteristics  may comprise calculating configuration characteristics corresponding to the limits indicated by applicable regulations and\/or by contingent event forms already approved by applicable regulators. It will be appreciated that the developer may desire to change the characteristics indicates at  upon seeing the full range of allowable characteristics. Accordingly, the developer may provide contingent event characteristic changes  at . The changes may be received at . It will be appreciated that the various actions of the process flow  may be performed in any suitable order. For example, the actions , ,  and  may, in some example embodiments, be performed before the API credential  is generated and provided at  and . Upon receiving the API credential , the developer may create the application. The application may be coded in any suitable language capable of generating messages according to the API  utilizing the received API credential. Example languages that may be used include Objective-C, Java and Javascript. As described above, the application may be configured to submit contingent event requests, such as , to the gaming management system  during game play, as described herein above with respect to .","Optionally, at , the developer may transfer house funds  to a developer account maintained by the gaming management system . The gaming management system  (e.g., the accounting layer  and\/or the banking layer ) may receive the funds at  and transfer the funds to the developer's developer account. For example, the developer account may be held by a financial institution and controlled by the gaming management system  (e.g., the banking layer  thereof) via the payment gateway . A minimum quantity of house funds  may be determined by the gaming management system , for example, based on the characteristics of the one or more contingent event types to be included with the system. In some example embodiments, the developer may not provide house funds. Instead, the facilitating entity may provide house funds for wagers. In return for providing the house funds itself, the facilitating entity may lower its compensation to the developer. The compensation may take the form of a percentage of the house edge for each wager. For example, when house funds are provided by the facilitating entity, the developer may receive a lower percentage of the house edge than when the developer provides the house funds itself.","Optionally, at , the developer may provide identities for one or more test users  to the gaming management system . The test users may be users associated with the developer that may be authorized by the gaming management system  to place wagers on contingent events prior to approval of the application. For example, the test users may be users associated with the developer. In some example embodiments, test users may be limited to wagering with funds of the developer (e.g., funds in a developer account). Upon receiving the identities of the test users at , the gaming management system  may configure itself to receive wagers on contingent events associated with the application from the test users.","At , the developer may request that the application be submitted for approval.

In some example embodiments, the recommendation engine  monitors the maximum or minimum wager allowed by a game or games selected by the user. In some example embodiments, the recommendation engine  monitors an amount of time between the placing of a wager and the resolution of the wager. For example, some users may prefer games where wagers are resolved quickly (e.g., a slot machine-style game), while other users may prefer games where wagers play out longer prior to resolution. The amount of time between the placing of a wager and the resolution of the wager may be related to a particular game or by decisions that the user makes within the game. In some example embodiments, the recommendation engine  monitors the win probability of wagers placed by the user as well as the payout amount for the wagers. In some cases, this value may be represented as a ratio of win probability over payout amount. In some example embodiments, the recommendation engine  monitors the degree of control that the user has over the outcome wagers that the users places. For example, wagers on a slot machine or roulette type game may provide the user with very little control over the outcome. On the other hand, games where wagers are based, at least in part, on the skill of the user (e.g., blackjack-style games, games of skill as described herein, etc.). In some example embodiments, the recommendation engine  monitors a risk tolerance of the user. The risk tolerance may be monitored based on wagers made by the user. For example, risk tolerance may be expressed based on an amalgam of amounts wagered by the use in view of the corresponding potential payouts. In some example embodiments, the recommendation engine  monitors a loss tolerance of the user. The loss tolerance may be determined, for example, based on recorded user losses and the user's reaction to the losses. For example, a loss tolerance may indicate that the user typically curtails further wagers upon losing a certain amount or amounts either instantaneously (e.g., in a single wager) or cumulatively (e.g., over two or more wagers).","In some example embodiments, additional game-play behavior metrics are considered by characterizing game play in terms of a decision node or nodes. A decision node within a game may be any point in the play of the game where the user is to provide input or make a decision. For example, in a slot machine game, each pull or virtual pull of the slot machine lever may represent a decision node. In a blackjack game, each opportunity for the user to stay or hit may represent a decision node. In a poker game, each ante, wager and draw may represent a decision node. Depending on the type of game implemented by a gaming application, decision nodes may be fixed and\/or may be variable. For example, in a slot machine style game, the decision node corresponding to a pull of the slot machine lever may be fixed. In other types of games, however, the placement and properties of decision nodes may be determined directly or indirectly by the user, for example, based on prior game play decisions made by the user. Examples of such games include, for example, games of skill, strategy games such as FARMVILLE, FARMTOWN, ANGRY BIRDS and the MAFIA WARS games described herein above.","In some example embodiments, the recommendation engine  monitors additional game play metrics for games characterized using decision nodes. A frequency of decision nodes may describe a frequency with which the user encounters decision nodes during game play. The frequency of decision nodes may be a function of a gaming application itself and\/or a function of user choices during game play. For example, a slot machine or blackjack style game may have a relatively constant frequency of decision nodes regardless of decisions made by the user. On the other hand, a strategy-style game such as FARMVILLE, MAFIA WARS, etc. may have a variable frequency of decision nodes based, at least in part, on the progression of the game and\/or the style of the user's play. Another example game play metric for games characterized using decision nodes is a quantity and\/or percentage of decision nodes that are gambling opportunity nodes. A gambling opportunity node may be a node that includes or is related to a contingent event upon which the user may place a wager. For example, in a blackjack style game, the decision to play may be a gambling opportunity node. Decisions to hit or stay may be decision nodes but may not be gambling opportunity nodes. Also, for example, in the context of a strategy game, the user may encounter decision nodes that do not provide gambling opportunities (e.g., a decision to plant a standard or non-premium crop, a decision to move between locations on a board, etc.) as well as decision nodes that do (e.g., a decision to plant a premium crop, a decision to fight another character, etc).","Referring back to  the recommendation engine  may, at , calculate user preferences based on the observed game-play behavior. The user preferences may be calculated in any suitable manner. In some example embodiments, user preferences may be calculated for each user. Also, in some example embodiments, user preferences may be calculated for groups of users. For example, not every user will make enough wagers or play gaming applications frequently enough to generate a statistically significant set of game play behavior metrics. Accordingly, users, and game play behavior metrics, may be grouped together to determine user preferences. In various example embodiments, users are grouped together based on common characteristics. For example, users may be grouped based on similar backgrounds (age, profile, frequency of gaming, etc.) and\/or based on common or similar game play behavior metrics.","In some embodiments, calculating user preferences may comprise generating a perceived utility and a risk tolerance. The perceived utility may indicate the relative value to the user (or user group) of various combinations of game play behavior metrics. The perceived utility may be calculated and\/or expressed in various different forms. In some embodiments, the perceived utility is indicated in tabular form. For example, each observed game play behavior metric may be assigned a representative value for the user and\/or for all users in a group. The representative value may be, for example, a mean, a median, etc. Also, in various embodiments, the perceived utility may be indicated in functional form. For example, the gaming management system \u2032 may calculate a best-fit curve matching the values of one or more measured game play behavior metrics.","At , the gaming management system \u2032 may modify a user's game play based on the user preferences calculated at . In example cases where the user has played with the gaming management system \u2032 frequently enough for the gaming management system \u2032 to generate a threshold quantity of user game play behavior metrics for the user, the modifications to the gaming application may be based on user preferences specific to the user. In some example embodiments, and in cases where the gaming management system \u2032 has less than the threshold quantity of user game play behavior metrics for the user, the modifications may be based on the user preferences of a class of users including the user. For example, the gaming management system \u2032 may receive data describing the user (e.g., from the user). The information may include demographic information, geographic information, etc. Based on the user information, the gaming management system \u2032 may assign the user to a group of users and modify game play based on user preferences of the assigned group.","The gaming management system \u2032 may modify game play in any suitable manner. For example, in some embodiments, the gaming management system may modify a set of games presented to the user for play (e.g., via a user interface). For example, the set of games presented to the user for play may include games having game play characteristics close to and\/or matching the user preferences. Also, in some embodiments, the gaming management system \u2032 modifies gaming applications to match user preferences. For example, the gaming management system \u2032 may modify a maximum or minimum wager amount, a game speed, etc. to match the user preferences. In some embodiments, modifications to gaming applications are implemented by pushing code updates to a user device . In other embodiments, modifications to gaming applications are implemented by the gaming management system \u2032 itself. In example embodiments the user preferences may indicate that a particular user or group of users prefers to play games where the maximum wager is under a particular amount (e.g., $1.00). The gaming management system \u2032 may modify either applications and\/or wager parameters provided to applications in order to present games to the user with maximum wager amounts below a particular amount.","At , the recommendation module  may monitor the user's use of modified game play and, at , may determine whether the modified game play has lead to an increase in the user's utilization of the gaming management system \u2032. Again, the monitoring and determination may be based on a single user and\/or may be based on groups of users. Feedback data determined at  and  may be utilized at  to calculate user preferences. For example, feedback data may be utilized to distill user game play behavior metrics into user preferences, as described above.","Any patent, publication, or other disclosure material, in whole or in part, that is said to be incorporated by reference herein is incorporated herein only to the extent that the incorporated materials does not conflict with existing definitions, statements, or other disclosure material set forth in this disclosure.
