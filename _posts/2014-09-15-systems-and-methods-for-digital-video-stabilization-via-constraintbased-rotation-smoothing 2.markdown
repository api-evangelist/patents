{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["PRIORITY","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","Digital Video Stabilization and Rolling Shutter Correction Using Gyroscopes"],"p":["This application is a continuation of U.S. Non-Provisional patent application Ser. No. 14\/101,252, filed Dec. 9, 2013, which claims the benefit of priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/735,976, filed Dec. 11, 2012, which is hereby incorporated by reference.","The subject matter of the present disclosure relates to signal processing. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to systems and methods for image and video processing.","Digital still cameras capable of capturing video have become widespread in recent years. While the resolution and image quality of these consumer devices has improved up to the point where they rival digital single-lens reflex cameras (DSLRs) in some settings, their video quality may still be significantly worse than that of film cameras. The reason for this gap in quality may be twofold. First, compared to film cameras, cell phones may be significantly lighter. As a result, hand-held video capture on such devices may exhibit a greater amount of camera shake. Second, cell-phone cameras may have sensors that make use of a rolling shutter (RS). In an RS camera, each image row may be exposed at a slightly different time, which, combined with undampened camera motion, may result in a \u201cwobble\u201d in the output video.","Video stabilization is a family of techniques used to reduce high-frequency frame-to-frame jitter produced by video camera shake. In professional cameras, mechanical image stabilization (MIS) systems are commonly used. For example, in an MIS system, the operator may wear a harness that separates the camera's motion from the operator's body motion. Other MIS systems stabilize the optics of the camera rather than the camera body itself. These systems may move the lens or sensor to compensate for small pitch and yaw motions. These techniques work in real time and do not require computation on the camera. However, they are not suitable for mobile devices and inexpensive cameras, because of their price and size. Digital video stabilization systems may employ feature trackers to stabilize videos post-capture. However, these systems may be sensitive to noise (e.g., fast moving foreground objects) and require distinctive features for tracking. As a result, digital stabilization based on feature tracking often breaks down, especially in adverse lighting conditions and excessive foreground motion. In addition, extracting and matching visual cues across frames can be computationally expensive. Furthermore, the expense grows with the resolution of the video. In some instances, this may be too costly to perform video stabilization in real time. Consequently, such approaches are rarely employed in current digital cameras. Instead, manufacturers can opt for more robust (and expensive) mechanical stabilization solutions for high-end DSLRs.","To stabilize digital video, computer implemented methods, systems, and computer readable media, in an embodiment, may provide digital video data including a set of image frames having associated time stamps and a set of camera orientation data having associated time stamps. A smoothed set of camera orientation data may be generated by minimizing a rate of rotation between successive image frames while minimizing an amount of empty regions in a resulting set of smoothed image frames reoriented based on the smoothed set of camera orientation data.","In an embodiment, the amount of empty regions in the resulting set of smoothed image frames may be minimized to zero.","In an embodiment, the amount of empty regions in the resulting set of smoothed image frames may be minimized below a threshold value.","In an embodiment, the set of image frames may be warped based on the associated time stamps for the set of image frames and the smoothed set of camera orientation data to form a set of corrected image frames.","In an embodiment, the warping of the set of image frames based on the associated time stamps for the set of image frames and the smoothed set of camera orientation data to form a set of corrected image frames may include dividing an individual image frame into a plurality of subsections. Each subsection may have an associated time stamp and camera orientation. The warping of the set of image frames based on the associated time stamps for the set of image frames and the smoothed set of camera orientation data to form a set of corrected image frames may include realigning each subsection based on the associated time stamp and camera orientation to form an individual corrected image frame.","In an embodiment, the set of corrected image frames may be displayed as a video.","In an embodiment, the amount of empty regions in the resulting set of smoothed image frames may be minimized below a threshold value.","In an embodiment, the amount of empty regions below the threshold value may be inpainted.","In an embodiment, the set of camera orientation data having associated time stamps may be provided from a gyroscope of a handheld device.","In an embodiment, the set of image frames may be provided from a camera of a handheld device.","In an embodiment, the set of camera orientation data having associated time stamps may be provided from a gyroscope of a handheld device including a mobile phone and a digital camera. The set of image frames may be provided from the digital camera.","In an embodiment, the generating of the smoothed set of camera orientation data includes an iterative optimization based on gradient descent.","In an embodiment, the generating the smoothed set of camera orientation data may include filtering based on a Gaussian filter.","In an embodiment, the generating of the smoothed set of camera orientation data may include filtering based on a temporal derivative.","In an embodiment, the set of camera orientation data may include rotations without any translations.","In an embodiment, the set of camera orientation data may include vectors having both rotations and translations.","In an embodiment, the generating the smoothed set of camera orientation data is performed by a social networking system.","In an embodiment, the set of image frames having associated time stamps and the set of camera orientation data having associated time stamps may be uploaded to the social networking system by a user of the social networking system.","Many other features and embodiments of the invention will be apparent from the accompanying drawings and from the following detailed description.","The figures depict various embodiments of the present invention for purposes of illustration only, wherein the figures use like reference numerals to identify like elements. One skilled in the art will readily recognize from the following discussion that alternative embodiments of the structures and methods illustrated in the figures may be employed without departing from the principles of the invention described herein.","Rolling shutter correction is a technique for removing image warping produced by intra-frame camera motion. High-end cameras use charge-coupled device (CCD) sensors, which have a global shutter (GS). In a GS camera, including many DSLRs, all pixels on the CCD sensor are read out and reset simultaneously. Therefore all pixels collect light during the same time interval. Consequently, camera motion during the exposure results in some amount of image blur on these devices. In contrast, low-end cameras typically make use of complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) sensors. In particular, these sensors employ a rolling shutter, where image rows are read out and reset sequentially. This approach may require less circuitry compared to CCD sensors and may make CMOS sensors cheaper to manufacture. For that reason, CMOS sensors are frequently used in cell phones, music players, and some low-end camcorders. The sequential readout, however, means that each row is exposed during a slightly different time window. As a result, camera motion during row readout will produce a warped image. Fast moving objects will also appear distorted.","Image readout in an RS camera is typically in the millisecond range. Therefore, RS distortions are primarily caused by high-frequency camera motions. MIS systems could, therefore, be used to stabilize the camera. While this approach removes rolling shutter warping, in practice the price range and size of MIS systems make it not suitable for RS cameras. Some digital rolling shutter rectification techniques may correct RS artifacts in a single image, but require user input. In contrast, some embodiments of the present disclosure may correct RS artifacts for single images without requiring user input.","For video, rectifying RS in a sequence of frames using feature tracking to estimate the camera motion from the video may present problems. Once the camera motion is known during an RS exposure, it can be used to rectify the frame. Since this approach relies on feature trackers, it has the same disadvantages previously discussed in the case of video stabilization.","Digital video stabilization techniques may include cropping or zooming input video frames. This may allow individual frames to be translated, rotated, or warped to counteract undesired deformations introduced by hand shake. The amount of cropping may determine how much leeway (or \u201cwiggle room\u201d) is available to remove these deformations. If, for example, the frame is translated too far, empty regions (e.g., regions which have no pixel data) may be visible. Some embodiments of the present disclosure not only smooth out the camera motion by counteracting hand shake, but may also do so while preventing empty regions from showing up. It should be appreciated that other methods for providing the leeway for stabilization, other than cropping or zooming, may also be implemented. For example, inpainting techniques may be implemented to fill empty regions introduced by stabilization. Inpainting may be used in lieu of, or in addition to, cropping or zooming. For instance, in an embodiment, a function may be implemented to determine whether a given deformation results in a frame with all pixels set (whether by inpainting, zooming, cropping, etc.) to satisfaction or not.","Systems and methods are provided for digitally stabilizing videos by computing smooth camera rotations that satisfy empty-region prevention constraints. This may enable maximally smooth camera rotations to be produced for a given crop or zoom factor.","The digital video stabilization process may begin, for example, with video being captured by a camera or device including a camera, such as a mobile phone, tablet, watch, wearable gear, etc. The video may include a number of successive image frames that are captured. The video may be shaky due to the device's size and weight. The rolling shutter used by sensors in the camera may produce warping in the output image frames. Gyroscopes may be used to measure the camera's motions (e.g., rotations) during video capture. The measured camera motion may be used to stabilize the video and to rectify the rolling shutter to result in the stabilized video having output frames with corrected images.","Techniques of the present disclosure may improve video quality of RS cameras. In an embodiment, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) gyroscopes are implemented to measure camera rotations. Other gyroscopes and motion sensing devices may also be implemented. The gyroscopic measurements may be used to perform video stabilization (e.g., inter-frame motion compensation) and rolling shutter correction (e.g., intra-frame motion compensation). This approach may be both computationally inexpensive and robust, which may make it particularly suitable for real-time implementations on mobile platforms for instance.","Systems and methods based on a unified model of a rotating camera and a rolling shutter may utilize the model to compute a warp that simultaneously performs rolling shutter correction and video stabilization. Optimization techniques may be provided that automatically calibrate the gyroscope and camera. This may permit the recovery of unknown parameters, such as gyroscope drift and delay, as well as the camera's focal length and rolling shutter speed, from a single video and gyroscopic capture. As a result, any combination of gyroscope and camera hardware may be calibrated without the need for a specialized laboratory setup. A device including the camera may also include a motion sensing device, such as a gyroscope. For example, many smartphones have cameras and motion sensing devices, such as gyroscopes and accelerometers. In this way, real-time video stabilization and rolling shutter correction may be provided without requiring the use of feature trackers or MIS systems. Furthermore, inexpensive MEMS gyroscopes may be implemented to measure camera motion directly. Inertial measurement units (IMUs) may be used for image de-blurring and for aiding a KLT feature tracker","Measuring camera motion using motion sensing devices, such as gyroscopes, permits digital video stabilization and RS rectification to be performed with high computational efficiency. This approach may be robust even under poor lighting or substantial foreground motion, because the video's content is not used for motion estimation. Furthermore, as stated above, many camera-enabled mobile phones are already equipped with gyroscopes or other motion sensing devices. Compared to MIS systems, MEMS gyroscopes may be significantly less inexpensive, more versatile, and less bulky.","In an embodiment, video stabilization may proceed in three stages: camera motion estimation, motion smoothing, and image warping. Rolling shutter rectification may proceed in a similar manner, except the actual camera motion may be used for the warping computation rather than the smoothed motion. As will be discussed in further detail herein, both video stabilization and rolling shutter correction may be performed in one warping computation under a unified framework.","In an embodiment, camera motion may be modeled in terms of rotations only. It should be appreciated that translations may be measured in addition to, or in place of, rotations in other embodiments. In some instances, translations may be difficult to measure accurately using IMUs for example. Moreover, accelerometer data may require being integrated twice to obtain translations. In contrast, gyroscopes measure the rate of rotation. Therefore, gyroscopic data may require only a single integration to obtain the camera's orientation. As a result, translation measurements may be significantly less accurate than orientation measurements in some instances. Furthermore, translation measurements may be complicated by objects at different depths moving by different amounts. In an embodiment, stereo or feature-based structure from motion (SfM) algorithms may be implemented to obtain depth information. Warping frames in order to remove translations may be performed in some embodiments, but may be complicated by parallax and occlusions.","Modeling camera translations in systems may present issues. For example, an optimizer may fall into a local minimum while attempting to reconstruct translations from a feature tracker. An algorithm may assume that the camera is imaging a purely planar scene (e.g., constant depth). Therefore, translation reconstruction may be complicated due to unmodeled parallax in the video.","Embodiments modeling camera rotation only in terms of rotations, or primarily in terms of rotations, may minimize the problems encountered with translations. Camera shake and rolling shutter warping occur primarily from rotations since translations attenuate quickly with increasing depth, and objects are typically sufficiently far away from the lens that translational camera jitter does not produce noticeable motion in the image.","Example Camera Model","In an embodiment, a rotational rolling shutter camera model that is based on a pinhole camera model is provided.  illustrates an example pinhole camera model , according to an embodiment. A ray from a camera center c to a point x in the scene will intersect the image plane at point x. Therefore the projection of the world onto the image plane depends on the camera's center c, the focal length f, and the location of the camera's axis (o, o) in the image plane. In a pinhole camera the relationship between image point x in homogeneous coordinates and the corresponding point X in 3D world coordinates may be specified by example equation (1).\n\n, and \u2003\u2003(1)\n\nHere, \u03bb is an unknown scaling factor and K is the intrinsic camera. Kmay be specified by example equation (2).\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msup":{"mi":"K","mrow":{"mo":"-","mn":"1"}},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":[{"mn":"1"},{"mn":"0"},{"mrow":{"mo":"-","msub":{"mi":["o","x"]}}}]},{"mtd":[{"mn":"0"},{"mn":"1"},{"mrow":{"mo":"-","msub":{"mi":["o","y"]}}}]},{"mtd":[{"mn":"0"},{"mn":"0"},{"mi":"f"}]}]}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"2"}}]}}}},"br":{},"sub":["x","y"]},"Warping may occur from high-frequency camera rotations. For example, high-frequency camera rotations while the shutter is rolling from top to bottom may cause the output image to appear warped. This warped image may be modeled mathematically.","The world origin may be set to the camera origin. The camera motion may then be described in terms of its orientation R(t) at time t. Thus, for any scene point X, the corresponding image point x at time t may be given by example equation (3).\n\n()\u2003\u2003(3)\n","The rotation matrices R(t)\u03b5 SO(3) may be computed by compounding the changes in camera angle \u0394\u03b8(t). The spherical linear interpolation (SLERP) of quaternions may be used in order to interpolate the camera orientation smoothly and to avoid gimbal lock. The change in angle between gyroscope samples may be sufficiently small that Euler angles work as well as rotation quaternions. \u0394\u03b8(t) may be obtained directly from gyroscope measured rates of rotation \u03c9(t), as specified in the following example equation (4).\n\n\u0394\u03b8()=(\u03c9()+\u03c9)*\u0394\u2003\u2003(4)\n\n\u03c9is the gyroscope drift and tis the delay between the gryoscope and frame sample timestamps. These parameters are additional unknowns in that model that may also be recovered.\n","Rolling shutter may also be introduced into the camera model. In an RS camera, each image row is exposed at a slightly different time. Camera rotations during this exposure may, therefore, determine the warping of the image. Translational camera jitter during rolling shutter exposure does not significantly impact image warping because objects are typically far away from the lens. For example, if the camera sways from side to side while the shutter is rolling, then the output image will be warped as shown in . The time at which point x was imaged in frame i depends on how far down the frame it is. It may be determined that x was imaged at time t(i, y), as specified by the example equation (5).\n\n()=, where =(1)\u2003\u2003(5)\n\ny is the image row corresponding to point x. h is the total number of rows in the frame. tis the timestamp of the i-th frame. The tterm indicates that the farther down in a frame, the longer it took for the rolling shutter to get to that row. Hence, tis the time it takes to read out a full frame going row by row from top to bottom. A negative tvalue would indicate a rolling shutter that goes from bottom to top. Automatically recovering the sign and value of tis described in further detail herein.\n","The relationship between image points in a pair of frames for two different camera orientations may be derived.  illustrates a graphical representation of two camera orientations and their corresponding image planes, according to an embodiment. Graphical representation  includes two camera orientations  and . Camera orientation  includes image plane i. Camera orientation  includes image plane j. An image of scene point X appears in the two frames where the ray  intersects the image planes i and j. For a scene point X, the projected points xand xin the image plane of two frames i and j, respectively, may be specified by the following example equations (6).\n\n(()), and (())\u2003\u2003(6)\n","If these equations are rearranged and if X is substituted for, a mapping of all points in frame i to all points in frame j is obtained, as specified by example equation (7).\n\n(())(())\u2003\u2003(7)\n","While the relationship between two frames have been described in relation to the same video, in other embodiments, the frames may be mapped from one camera that rotates according to R(t) to another camera that rotates according to R\u2032(t). In an embodiment, both camera centers may be assumed to be at the origin. The warping matrix W that maps points from one camera to the other may be specified according to the following example equation (8).\n\n()=\u2032()()\u2003\u2003(8)\n","Equation 7 may now be specified more compactly according to the following example equation (9).\n\n((),()), where \u2003\u2003(9)\n","W depends on both image rows yand yof image points xand x, respectively. This warping matrix may be used to match points in frame i to corresponding points in frame j, while taking the effects of the rolling shutter into account in both frames.","This formulation of a warping matrix provides for rolling shutter correction and video stabilization. A synthetic camera may be created that has a smooth motion and a global shutter. This camera's motion may be computed by applying a Gaussian low-pass filter, for example, to the input camera's motion, which results in a new set of rotations R\u2032. The rolling shutter duration tfor the synthetic camera may be set to 0 as for a global shutter. W(t, t(i, y)) may then be computed at each image row yof the current frame i, and the warp may be applied to that row. The first term of W may now only depend on the frame time t. This operation may map all input frames onto the synthetic camera, and as a result, simultaneously remove rolling shutter warping and video shake.","In certain embodiments, W(t, t(i, y)) is not computed for each image row y. Instead, the input image may be subdivided and the warp computed at each vertical subdivision.  illustrates an example transformation to correct warp, according to an embodiment. Warped input image frame  shows a subdivided warped image that was captured by an RS camera. The warp is computed at each vertical subdivision, as shown in image frame . Image frame  shows a piecewise linear approximation of non-linear warping. As shown by resulting image frame , various numbers of subdivisions may be sufficient to eliminate artifacts. For example, in an embodiment, 10 subdivisions may be sufficient to eliminate visual artifacts. A warped mesh from the input image was created that is a piecewise linear approximation of the non-linear warp. While ten subdivisions may be sufficient to remove any visible RS artifacts, other embodiments may include a different number of subdivisions. The sampling approach may be referred to as inverse interpolation. Inverse interpolation may be easy to implement on a graphical processing unit (GPU) using vertex shaders. The GPU's fragment shader may take care of resampling the mesh-warped image using bilinear interpolation. RS warping in actual videos may not be strong enough to produce aliasing artifacts due to bilinear inverse interpolation. As a result, inverse interpolation may work well in practice. Rolling shutter correction using global image warps may assume that camera rotation is more or less constant during rolling shutter exposure. A linear approximation may fail to rectify the rolling shutter, as shown by image frame  in .","Camera and Gyroscope Calibration","Calibration techniques are provided for recovering the unknown camera and gyroscope parameters described herein. The calibration may enable the computation of W directly from the gyroscope data. The unknown parameters in the model described herein may include: the focal length of the camera f, the duration of the rolling shutter t, the delay between the gyroscope and frame sample timestamps t, and the gyroscope drift w.","In some instances, one or more of these parameters, such as the camera's focal length f, may be specified by the manufacturer. In some instances, these parameters may be measured experimentally. For example, a quickly flashing display may be used to measure the rolling shutter duration t. However, these techniques may tend to be imprecise and error prone. These techniques may also be tedious. The duration of the rolling shutter may typically be in the millisecond range. As a result, a small misalignment in tor tmay cause rolling shutter rectification to fail.","In an embodiment, these parameters may be estimated from a single video and gyroscope capture. For example, the user may be record a video and a gyroscope trace while standing still and shaking the camera while pointing at a stationary object, such as a building. The duration of the clip may vary in different embodiments. In an embodiment, a short clip (e.g., ten seconds or less in duration) may be sufficient to estimate all the unknown parameters. This calibration step may only need to be done once for each camera and gyroscope arrangement.","In an embodiment, matching points are identified in consecutive video frames. The matching points may be identified using, for example, the scale invariant feature transform (SIFT). Outliers may be discarded using, for example, random sample consensus (RANSAC). The result may be a set of point correspondences xand xfor all neighboring frames in the captured video. Given this ground truth, calibration may be formulated as an optimization problem where the mean-squared re-projection error of all point correspondences may be minimized. This is specified in the following example equation (10).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":"J","mo":"=","mrow":{"munder":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["i","j"],"mo":","}}},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msup":{"mrow":{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"mrow":{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["x","j"]},"mo":"-","mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":"W","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"t","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"j","mo":",","msub":{"mi":["y","j"]}}}},{"mi":"t","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"i","mo":",","msub":{"mi":["y","i"]}}}}],"mo":","}}},"mo":"\u2062","msub":{"mi":["x","i"]}}}}},"mn":"2"}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"10"}}]}}}}},"A number of non-linear optimizers may be used to minimize the objective function. Coordinate descent by direct objective function evaluation may converge quickly, and is implemented in one embodiment. Each time a step is taken where the objective function J does not decrease; the step direction is reversed and the step size of the corresponding parameter is decreased. The algorithm may terminate when the step size for all parameters drops below a desired threshold, such as when a target precision is achieved. The convergence may occur quickly in some instances. For example, in one embodiment, the convergence may occur in 2 seconds or less for a calibration video of about 10 seconds in duration.","In an embodiment, the optimization may be initialized by setting the focal length such that the camera has a field of view of 45\u00b0. All other parameters may be set to 0. With these initial conditions, the optimizer may converge to the correct solution for the dataset. More generally, falling into a local minimum (e.g., when the delay between the gyroscope and frame timestamps is large) may be avoided by restarting the coordinate descent algorithm for a range of plausible parameters, and selecting the best solution. The average re-projection error for correctly recovered parameters may be, for example, around 1 pixel.","An additional unknown in the model may be the relative orientation of the gyroscope to the camera. For example, rotations about the gyro's y-axis may correspond to rotations about the camera's x-axis.","To discover the gyroscope orientation, the 3 rotation axes may be permuted and the optimizer may be run for each permutation. The permutation that minimizes the objective best may correspond to the camera's axis ordering. The re-projection error may be significantly larger for incorrect permutations. Therefore, this method may work well in practice.","While it has been assumed that the camera has a vertical rolling shutter, the RS model may be easily modified to work for image columns instead of rows. Finding the minimum re-projection error for both cases may indicate whether the camera has a horizontal or vertical rolling shutter.","Finally, the results achieved by calibration may be demonstrated by analyzing the video and gyroscope signals before and after calibration. Assuming rotations between consecutive frames are small, the translations in the image may be approximately computed from rotations as specified in the following example equation (11).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0070"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00003","num":"00003"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mrow":[{"mover":{"mi":"x","mo":"."},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"t"}},{"mi":"f","mo":"*","mrow":{"mover":{"mi":"\u03c9","mo":"^"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"t","mo":"+","msub":{"mi":["t","d"]}}}}}],"mo":"\u2248"},{"mi":"where","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mrow":{"mo":"{","mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mover":{"mi":"x","mo":"."},"mo":"=","msup":{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mover":[{"mi":"x","mo":"."},{"mi":"x","mo":"."}],"mo":","}},"mi":"T"}}}},{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mover":{"mi":"\u03c9","mo":"^"},"mo":"=","msup":{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":["\u03c9","y"]},{"mi":["\u03c9","x"]}],"mo":","}},"mi":"T"}}}}]}}}],"mo":","}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"11"}}]}}}}},"Equation (11) assumes there are no effects due to rolling shutter (e.g., t=0), and rotations about the z-axis (e.g., \u03c9) may be ignored. {dot over (x)} is the average rate of translation along x and y for all point correspondences in consecutive frames. If the optimizer converged to the correct focal length f and gyroscope delay t, then the two signals should align. Before calibration, the amplitudes of the signals x and f*\u03c9y(t+t) do not match because the initial estimate for f is too low. The signals may be shifted when tis initialized to 0. After calibration, the signals may be well aligned because accurate focal length and gyroscope delay have been recovered. Precise gyroscopes, such as MEMS gyroscopes, enable the gyroscope data to match the image motions, resulting in the improved video stabilization and rolling shutter correction.","Constraint-Based Rotation Smoothing","In some aspects of the present disclosure, system and methods may be provided for computing an optimally smooth camera motion under the constraint that empty regions are not visible, or below a minimum threshold value.  illustrates an example digital video stabilization module, according to an embodiment. Digital video stabilization module  is shown including an input module , a smoothing module , and a warping module .","Input module  may provide inputs to be stabilized the smoothing module  and the warping module . Input module  may receive the inputs associated with the video that is to be stabilized. For example, inputs may include a set of N frames F, corresponding times tfor the N frames F, and camera orientations \u03b8, where i={1 . . . N}.","Smoothing module  computes a set of new smoothed camera orientations \u03c6, such that a constraint function f(\u03c6, t) is satisfied. Smoothing module  may include rate of rotation module  and constraint determination module .","Rate of rotation module  computes the rate of rotation to ensure a sufficiently small rate of rotation is maintained for the generation of smooth camera orientations. Constraint determination module  determines whether a constraint is met for target orientations \u03c6at time t. For example, in one embodiment, the constraint function f(\u03c6,t) may return 1 or 0 depending on whether empty regions are visible or not, respectively, given a target orientation \u03c6at time t.","For example, the constraint determination module  may determine whether a minimal amount of empty regions (e.g., below a threshold amount) are produced in successive image frames. If the amount of empty regions falls below the threshold amount, then the constraint is met (e.g., the amount of empty regions does not exceed the threshold amount), and the target orientation \u03c6 and its corresponding time t may be used to generate a smooth orientation that has a sufficiently small rate of rotation that does not generate an amount of empty spaces above a threshold value. If the constraint is not met (e.g., the amount of empty regions exceeds the threshold amount), then the corresponding target orientation \u03c6 may be adjusted to maintain a sufficiently small rate of rotation while satisfying the constraint. In an embodiment, the threshold amount of empty regions is zero. In another embodiment, the threshold amount of empty regions is approximately zero or a negligible value that is determined to be undetectable by the human eye. In yet another embodiment, the threshold amount of empty regions is a value that prevents cropping, zooming, or inpainting to be used effectively, such as to eliminate all empty regions, or approximately all empty regions. In other embodiments, the threshold amount of empty regions may be set as desired based on the application and level of tolerance.","Warping module  generates warped frames based on the set of new smoothed camera orientations \u03c6computed by the smoothing module . For example, the warping module  may implement a warping function g(F, \u03c6, t) that takes as input a frame F, a smoothed orientation \u03c6 and its corresponding time t, and generates a warped frame F\u2032. Given the smoothly varying \u03c6over tas output by the smoothing module , and appropriate choices of functions f and g, the resulting warped frames F\u2032will compose a stabilized output video. The function f may depend on the choice of warping function g, and may simply indicate whether, after applying the warping function g, empty regions would be visible in the frame or not.","The specific warping function implemented may vary in different embodiments. Different warping functions may be appropriate for various cameras or desired approximations. For example, the warping function implemented may be based on whether a camera has a rolling shutter and minor lens aberrations or whether it has a global shutter. For instance, in one embodiment, for cameras with a global shutter, a homography warping function may be implemented. Other approximations, such as affine transformations, or a rotation plus a translation in the frame's image space may be implemented.","In an embodiment, the \u03b8input are rotations in the SO(3) group. There are a variety of ways to represent rotations, such as by rotation matrixes and quaternions. Representations that lie in SO(3) may be converted into a representation that facilitates smooth interpolation, such as quaternions rather than Euler angles. The \u03b8rotations may be computed from an image-based feature tracker, for example, or by directly measuring and integrating gyroscope readings. Any other method that produces accurate estimates of the camera's orientation may be implemented in other embodiments.","While \u03b8 has been described in terms of camera rotations, in other embodiments \u03b8 may include a vector that holds both rotations and translations of the camera in 3D space. For instance, vectors that include both rotations and translations may be produced by a structure from motion algorithm. In an embodiment, \u03b8 may include translations or rotations in the frame's image space, or other less accurate but potentially computationally cheaper approximations. As long as \u03b8 can be smoothly interpolated and the resulting \u03c6 can be input to a corresponding f and g function, the digital video stabilization may be achieved.","The phrase \u201csmooth camera motion\u201d may be used herein to refer to small changes in the rate of rotation. This is distinguished from small changes in rotation of neighboring frames. Small changes in the rate of rotation may produce orientations that ease in and out of imposed constraints over time. Small changes in rotation of neighboring frames interpolates to and from the constraints while producing discontinuities in orientation derivatives at the time where the constraint is enforced.","The constraint-based rotation smoothing may include an optimization that includes minimizing an energy function based on rate of rotation and the constraint.","In an embodiment, the energy function, J, to be minimized may be specified by the following example equation (12).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0085","num":"0084"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00004","num":"00004"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":"J","mo":"=","mrow":{"mrow":[{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":[{"mi":"i","mo":"=","mn":"2"},{"mi":"N","mo":"-","mn":"1"}]},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":{"msup":{"mrow":{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"mrow":{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"mrow":{"mfrac":[{"mrow":[{"msub":[{"mi":"\u03d5","mrow":{"mi":"i","mo":"+","mn":"1"}},{"mi":["\u03d5","i"]}],"mo":"-"},{"msub":[{"mi":"t","mrow":{"mi":"i","mo":"+","mn":"1"}},{"mi":["t","i"]}],"mo":"-"}]},{"mrow":[{"msub":[{"mi":"\u03d5","mn":"1"},{"mi":"\u03d5","mrow":{"mi":"i","mo":"-","mn":"1"}}],"mo":"-"},{"msub":[{"mi":["t","i"]},{"mi":"t","mrow":{"mi":"i","mo":"-","mn":"1"}}],"mo":"-"}]}],"mo":"-"}}},"mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mi":["s","t"],"mo":[".",".","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mrow":{"mi":"f","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":["\u03d5","i"]},{"mi":["t","i"]}],"mo":","}}}}}},{"mn":"0","mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mo":"\u2200","mi":"i"}}],"mo":"="}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"12"}}]}}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0086","num":"0085"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00005","num":"00005"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":"J","mo":"=","mrow":{"mrow":[{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":[{"mi":"i","mo":"=","mn":"2"},{"mi":"N","mo":"-","mn":"1"}]},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msup":{"mrow":{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"mrow":{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"mrow":{"mfrac":[{"mrow":[{"msub":[{"mi":"\u03d5","mrow":{"mi":"i","mo":"+","mn":"1"}},{"mi":["\u03d5","i"]}],"mo":"-"},{"msub":[{"mi":"t","mrow":{"mi":"i","mo":"+","mn":"1"}},{"mi":["t","i"]}],"mo":"-"}]},{"mrow":[{"msub":[{"mi":["\u03d5","i"]},{"mi":"\u03d5","mrow":{"mi":"i","mo":"-","mn":"1"}}],"mo":"-"},{"msub":[{"mi":["t","i"]},{"mi":"t","mrow":{"mi":"i","mo":"-","mn":"1"}}],"mo":"-"}]}],"mo":"-"}}},"mn":"2"}},{"mi":"\u03bb","mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"i","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"N"},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":{"mi":"f","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":["\u03d5","i"]},{"mi":["t","i"]}],"mo":","}}}}}],"mo":"+"}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"13"}}]}}}},"br":{}},"A variety of optimization algorithms may be used to minimize the energy function J in either the form shown in example equation (12) or (13).

The LoG filter may be approximated with a Difference of Gaussians (DoG) or Difference of Boxes (DoB) filter. The kernel K may also be adjusted by convolving a LoG filter with a Gaussian filter. This may control how gradually the rate of rotation should change (or the amount of easing in and out of constraints). The choices of the LoG\/DoG\/DoB and\/or Gaussian filters may affect the coefficients and size of kernel K, but as long as the kernel computes a form of a temporal derivative, the optimized orientations may exhibit some form of easing in and out of the constraints.","In an embodiment, the applying of the kernel to the quaternions is doing linear weighting of the 4D vectors. In theory, interpolating quaternions using spherical linear interpolation (slerp) may be an accurate method. For small changes in angles, linear interpolation plus a normalization of the resulting quaternion (lerp) at each iteration is sufficient to produce sufficiently accurate results. Such results may be achieved because sin(\u03b8)\u2248\u03b8 when \u03b8 is small. The change in angle induced by handshake (e.g., changes that are to be rectified) are typically not large. Furthermore, reasonable levels of cropping, zooming, or inpainting factors may not leave much leeway. Only small angles may not produce empty regions. Thus, the angle induced by handshake between quaternions of consecutive orientations may not be large in practice, and the approximation may be both accurate and computationally efficient. Furthermore, for rapid camera rotations (e.g., the user quickly panning left), the constraint function f may dominate the resulting orientations. Thus, any inaccuracies from lerp may not be noticeable.","In an embodiment, the constraint-based rotation smoothing may be specified in terms of the following example algorithm (1).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0094","num":"0093"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Algorithm 1 Constraint-Based Rotation Smoothing"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"168pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"for i = 1..N do"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"154pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"\u03c6\u2190 \u03b8"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"168pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"end for"]},{"entry":[{},"for j = 1..numiter do"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"154pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"for i = 3..(N \u2212 2) do"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"140pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"if f(n(\u03c6\u2212 CK\u03a6), t) = 0 then"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"126pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"\u03c6\u2190 n(\u03c6\u2212 CK\u03a6)"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"140pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"end if"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"154pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"end for"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"168pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"end for"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}},"br":{},"sub":["i ","i "]},"n(\u03c6) is the normalization step in lerp and may be defined as: n(\u03c6)=\u03c6\/\u2225\u03c6\u2225.

This approach may be less accurate for a particular video, but it may be faster because it doesn't require running the optimization algorithm multiple times.","Improving Computational Efficiency","There are a number of ways to improve the efficiency of algorithm (1), such as introducing approximations, using optimizers other than gradient descent, etc. In one embodiment, the size of the kernel in K in equation (15) may be reduced and the gradient may be updated as specified in the following example equation (20).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0114","num":"0113"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00011","num":"00011"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mo":"\u2202","mi":"J"},{"mo":"\u2202","msub":{"mi":["\u03d5","i"]}}]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mi":"C","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mn":"2","mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mi":"K","mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msub":{"mi":["\u03a6","i"]}},{"mi":"K","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msub":{"mi":"\u03a6","mrow":{"mi":"i","mo":"-","mn":"1"}}},{"mi":"K","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msub":{"mi":"\u03a6","mrow":{"mi":"i","mo":"+","mn":"1"}}}],"mo":["-","-"]}}}},{"mrow":{"mi":["where","K"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}},"mo":"=","msup":{"mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mo":"-","mn":"1"}}},{"mtd":{"mn":"2"}},{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mo":"-","mn":"1"}}}]}},"mi":"T"}}],"mo":","}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"20"}}]}}}}},"By reducing the size of the kernel (and reusing it), the computation of the gradient may be effectively sped up.

This may be achieved by running it in coarse to fine mode. For example, algorithm 1 may be initialized by supplying and solving for every 16th orientation \u03c6. Linear or cubic interpolation (e.g., slerp or squad) may then be used to compute the \u03c6, in between. A value for every 8th orientation is obtained. Algorithm 1 may be run again, but now optimizing every 8th orientation for smoothness and constraints. This may be repeated until algorithm 1 has been run over every orientation.","Running coarse to fine may permit algorithm 1 to be run for significantly fewer iterations at each step. The overall camera motion may be smoothed out and then the orientations may be refined to meet constraints at increasingly smaller frame intervals while still remaining smooth. In another embodiment, non-uniform sampling may be used. For example, instead of picking every 16th frame, frames may be picked based on how far the orientation has deviated from the previously picked frame. The segments may then be subdivided until a smoothed orientation has been computed for all frames.","Since coarser or non-uniform sampling may introduce larger consecutive changes in orientations, using the slerp modification presented in equation (21) may produce more accurate results.","Example Applications to Real-Time Stabilization","The following is provided as an example embodiment of adopting the algorithm to real-time settings. With N frames kept in memory, the algorithm is run in a sliding window fashion. Index i may denote the start of the sliding window, and i+N may denote the end. Orientations inside the sliding window may be malleable in that they may be updated by running the algorithm. These orientations may be specified by the following set (2).\n\n{\u03c6}\n","Orientations preceding the sliding window (e.g., \u03c6) may be fixed. The starting orientation may be \u03c6\u22121 and the rate of rotation (e.g., as measured by the gyroscope or computed from a feature tracker) may be integrated to obtain orientations {\u03b8, \u03b8, . . . , \u03b8}. This may be used as input for the optimization algorithm and compute {\u03c6, \u03c6, . . . , \u03c6}. The orientations {\u03c6, \u03c6} and {\u03c6=\u03b8, \u03b8=\u03b8} may be held fixed and may serve as the boundary conditions that ensure that motions are smooth going into and out of the sliding window.","Once the algorithm is run, the orientation of \u03c6which may be used to warp frame F, may be obtained. Once the frame has been warped, it may be passed along to the encoder and removed from the buffer of N frames. A new frame may then be received from the camera and the sliding window may be advanced by one frame.","The procedure may be repeated until the recording stops and all frames have been processed. For the very first frame, i=1, {\u03c6, \u03c6} may be undefined. \u03c6and \u03c6may be set to the identity quaternion. Once the last frame is received, the buffer may be flushed by using the orientations computed inside the final sliding window to warp their respective frames.","In some instances, a small buffer size (e.g., N=5) may not allow an easing in and out of constraints. In such cases, it may be necessary to modify the constraint function f to be a soft constraint that ramps up to a hard constraint. This may be referred to as function f\u2032(\u03c6, t). Instead of returning 0 or 1, f\u2032 returns a new orientation \u03c6\u2032, that may be pushed away from the frame border. The closer orientation \u03c6 comes to showing an empty region, the more f\u2032 may push the resulting \u03c6\u2032 away from the empty region.

The external system  is separate from the social networking system . For example, the external system  is associated with a first domain, while the social networking system  is associated with a separate social networking domain. Web pages , , included in the external system , comprise markup language documents  identifying content and including instructions specifying formatting or presentation of the identified content.","The social networking system  includes one or more computing devices for a social network, including a plurality of users, and providing users of the social network with the ability to communicate and interact with other users of the social network. In some instances, the social network can be represented by a graph, i.e., a data structure including edges and nodes. Other data structures can also be used to represent the social network, including but not limited to databases, objects, classes, meta elements, files, or any other data structure. The social networking system  may be administered, managed, or controlled by an operator. The operator of the social networking system  may be a human being, an automated application, or a series of applications for managing content, regulating policies, and collecting usage metrics within the social networking system . Any type of operator may be used.","Users may join the social networking system  and then add connections to any number of other users of the social networking system  to whom they desire to be connected. As used herein, the term \u201cfriend\u201d refers to any other user of the social networking system  to whom a user has formed a connection, association, or relationship via the social networking system . For example, in an embodiment, if users in the social networking system  are represented as nodes in the social graph, the term \u201cfriend\u201d can refer to an edge formed between and directly connecting two users.","Connections may be added explicitly by a user or may be automatically created by the social networking system  based on common characteristics of the users (e.g., users who are alumni of the same educational institution). For example, a first user specifically selects a particular other user to be a friend. Connections in the social networking system  are usually in both directions, but need not be, so the terms \u201cuser\u201d and \u201cfriend\u201d depend on the frame of reference. Connections between users of the social networking system  are usually bilateral (\u201ctwo-way\u201d), or \u201cmutual,\u201d but connections may also be unilateral, or \u201cone-way.\u201d For example, if Bob and Joe are both users of the social networking system  and connected to each other, Bob and Joe are each other's connections. If, on the other hand, Bob wishes to connect to Joe to view data communicated to the social networking system  by Joe, but Joe does not wish to form a mutual connection, a unilateral connection may be established. The connection between users may be a direct connection; however, some embodiments of the social networking system  allow the connection to be indirect via one or more levels of connections or degrees of separation.","In addition to establishing and maintaining connections between users and allowing interactions between users, the social networking system  provides users with the ability to take actions on various types of items supported by the social networking system . These items may include groups or networks (i.e., social networks of people, entities, and concepts) to which users of the social networking system  may belong, events or calendar entries in which a user might be interested, computer-based applications that a user may use via the social networking system , transactions that allow users to buy or sell items via services provided by or through the social networking system , and interactions with advertisements that a user may perform on or off the social networking system . These are just a few examples of the items upon which a user may act on the social networking system , and many others are possible. A user may interact with anything that is capable of being represented in the social networking system  or in the external system , separate from the social networking system , or coupled to the social networking system  via the network .","The social networking system  is also capable of linking a variety of entities. For example, the social networking system  enables users to interact with each other as well as external systems  or other entities through an API, a web service, or other communication channels. The social networking system  generates and maintains the \u201csocial graph\u201d comprising a plurality of nodes interconnected by a plurality of edges. Each node in the social graph may represent an entity that can act on another node and\/or that can be acted on by another node. The social graph may include various types of nodes. Examples of types of nodes include users, non-person entities, content items, web pages, groups, activities, messages, concepts, and any other things that can be represented by an object in the social networking system . An edge between two nodes in the social graph may represent a particular kind of connection, or association, between the two nodes, which may result from node relationships or from an action that was performed by one of the nodes on the other node. In some cases, the edges between nodes can be weighted. The weight of an edge can represent an attribute associated with the edge, such as a strength of the connection or association between nodes. Different types of edges can be provided with different weights. For example, an edge created when one user \u201clikes\u201d another user may be given one weight, while an edge created when a user befriends another user may be given a different weight.","As an example, when a first user identifies a second user as a friend, an edge in the social graph is generated connecting a node representing the first user and a second node representing the second user. As various nodes relate or interact with each other, the social networking system  modifies edges connecting the various nodes to reflect the relationships and interactions.","The social networking system  also includes user-generated content, which enhances a user's interactions with the social networking system . User-generated content may include anything a user can add, upload, send, or \u201cpost\u201d to the social networking system . For example, a user communicates posts to the social networking system  from a user device . Posts may include data such as status updates or other textual data, location information, images such as photos, videos, links, music or other similar data and\/or media. Content may also be added to the social networking system  by a third party. Content \u201citems\u201d are represented as objects in the social networking system . In this way, users of the social networking system  are encouraged to communicate with each other by posting text and content items of various types of media through various communication channels. Such communication increases the interaction of users with each other and increases the frequency with which users interact with the social networking system .","The social networking system  includes a web server , an API request server , a user profile store , a connection store , an action logger , an activity log , an authorization server , and a digital video stabilization module . In an embodiment of the invention, the social networking system  may include additional, fewer, or different components for various applications. Other components, such as network interfaces, security mechanisms, load balancers, failover servers, management and network operations consoles, and the like are not shown so as to not obscure the details of the system.","The user profile store  maintains information about user accounts, including biographic, demographic, and other types of descriptive information, such as work experience, educational history, hobbies or preferences, location, and the like that has been declared by users or inferred by the social networking system . This information is stored in the user profile store  such that each user is uniquely identified. The social networking system  also stores data describing one or more connections between different users in the connection store . The connection information may indicate users who have similar or common work experience, group memberships, hobbies, or educational history. Additionally, the social networking system  includes user-defined connections between different users, allowing users to specify their relationships with other users. For example, user-defined connections allow users to generate relationships with other users that parallel the users' real-life relationships, such as friends, co-workers, partners, and so forth. Users may select from predefined types of connections, or define their own connection types as needed. Connections with other nodes in the social networking system , such as non-person entities, buckets, cluster centers, images, interests, pages, external systems, concepts, and the like are also stored in the connection store .","The social networking system  maintains data about objects with which a user may interact. To maintain this data, the user profile store  and the connection store  store instances of the corresponding type of objects maintained by the social networking system . Each object type has information fields that are suitable for storing information appropriate to the type of object. For example, the user profile store  contains data structures with fields suitable for describing a user's account and information related to a user's account. When a new object of a particular type is created, the social networking system  initializes a new data structure of the corresponding type, assigns a unique object identifier to it, and begins to add data to the object as needed. This might occur, for example, when a user becomes a user of the social networking system , the social networking system  generates a new instance of a user profile in the user profile store , assigns a unique identifier to the user account, and begins to populate the fields of the user account with information provided by the user.","The connection store  includes data structures suitable for describing a user's connections to other users, connections to external systems  or connections to other entities. The connection store  may also associate a connection type with a user's connections, which may be used in conjunction with the user's privacy setting to regulate access to information about the user. In an embodiment of the invention, the user profile store  and the connection store  may be implemented as a federated database.","Data stored in the connection store , the user profile store , and the activity log  enables the social networking system  to generate the social graph that uses nodes to identify various objects and edges connecting nodes to identify relationships between different objects. For example, if a first user establishes a connection with a second user in the social networking system , user accounts of the first user and the second user from the user profile store  may act as nodes in the social graph. The connection between the first user and the second user stored by the connection store  is an edge between the nodes associated with the first user and the second user. Continuing this example, the second user may then send the first user a message within the social networking system . The action of sending the message, which may be stored, is another edge between the two nodes in the social graph representing the first user and the second user. Additionally, the message itself may be identified and included in the social graph as another node connected to the nodes representing the first user and the second user.","In another example, a first user may tag a second user in an image that is maintained by the social networking system  (or, alternatively, in an image maintained by another system outside of the social networking system ). The image may itself be represented as a node in the social networking system . This tagging action may create edges between the first user and the second user as well as create an edge between each of the users and the image, which is also a node in the social graph. In yet another example, if a user confirms attending an event, the user and the event are nodes obtained from the user profile store , where the attendance of the event is an edge between the nodes that may be retrieved from the activity log . By generating and maintaining the social graph, the social networking system  includes data describing many different types of objects and the interactions and connections among those objects, providing a rich source of socially relevant information.","The web server  links the social networking system  to one or more user devices  and\/or one or more external systems  via the network . The web server  serves web pages, as well as other web-related content, such as Java, JavaScript, Flash, XML, and so forth. The web server  may include a mail server or other messaging functionality for receiving and routing messages between the social networking system  and one or more user devices . The messages can be instant messages, queued messages (e.g., email), text and SMS messages, or any other suitable messaging format.","The API request server  allows one or more external systems  and user devices  to call access information from the social networking system  by calling one or more API functions. The API request server  may also allow external systems  to send information to the social networking system  by calling APIs. The external system , in one embodiment, sends an API request to the social networking system  via the network , and the API request server  receives the API request. The API request server  processes the request by calling an API associated with the API request to generate an appropriate response, which the API request server  communicates to the external system  via the network . For example, responsive to an API request, the API request server  collects data associated with a user, such as the user's connections that have logged into the external system , and communicates the collected data to the external system . In another embodiment, the user device  communicates with the social networking system  via APIs in the same manner as external systems .","The action logger  is capable of receiving communications from the web server  about user actions on and\/or off the social networking system . The action logger  populates the activity log  with information about user actions, enabling the social networking system  to discover various actions taken by its users within the social networking system  and outside of the social networking system . Any action that a particular user takes with respect to another node on the social networking system  may be associated with each user's account, through information maintained in the activity log  or in a similar database or other data repository. Examples of actions taken by a user within the social networking system  that are identified and stored may include, for example, adding a connection to another user, sending a message to another user, reading a message from another user, viewing content associated with another user, attending an event posted by another user, posting an image, attempting to post an image, or other actions interacting with another user or another object. When a user takes an action within the social networking system , the action is recorded in the activity log . In one embodiment, the social networking system  maintains the activity log  as a database of entries. When an action is taken within the social networking system , an entry for the action is added to the activity log . The activity log  may be referred to as an action log.","Additionally, user actions may be associated with concepts and actions that occur within an entity outside of the social networking system , such as an external system  that is separate from the social networking system . For example, the action logger  may receive data describing a user's interaction with an external system  from the web server . In this example, the external system  reports a user's interaction according to structured actions and objects in the social graph.","Other examples of actions where a user interacts with an external system  include a user expressing an interest in an external system  or another entity, a user posting a comment to the social networking system  that discusses an external system  or a web page within the external system , a user posting to the social networking system  a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) or other identifier associated with an external system , a user attending an event associated with an external system , or any other action by a user that is related to an external system . Thus, the activity log  may include actions describing interactions between a user of the social networking system  and an external system  that is separate from the social networking system .","The authorization server  enforces one or more privacy settings of the users of the social networking system . A privacy setting of a user determines how particular information associated with a user can be shared. The privacy setting comprises the specification of particular information associated with a user and the specification of the entity or entities with whom the information can be shared. Examples of entities with which information can be shared may include other users, applications, external systems , or any entity that can potentially access the information. The information that can be shared by a user comprises user account information, such as profile photos, phone numbers associated with the user, user's connections, actions taken by the user such as adding a connection, changing user profile information, and the like.","The privacy setting specification may be provided at different levels of granularity. For example, the privacy setting may identify specific information to be shared with other users; the privacy setting identifies a work phone number or a specific set of related information, such as, personal information including profile photo, home phone number, and status. Alternatively, the privacy setting may apply to all the information associated with the user. The specification of the set of entities that can access particular information can also be specified at various levels of granularity. Various sets of entities with which information can be shared may include, for example, all friends of the user, all friends of friends, all applications, or all external systems . One embodiment allows the specification of the set of entities to comprise an enumeration of entities. For example, the user may provide a list of external systems  that are allowed to access certain information. Another embodiment allows the specification to comprise a set of entities along with exceptions that are not allowed to access the information. For example, a user may allow all external systems  to access the user's work information, but specify a list of external systems  that are not allowed to access the work information. Certain embodiments call the list of exceptions that are not allowed to access certain information a \u201cblock list\u201d. External systems  belonging to a block list specified by a user are blocked from accessing the information specified in the privacy setting. Various combinations of granularity of specification of information, and granularity of specification of entities, with which information is shared are possible. For example, all personal information may be shared with friends whereas all work information may be shared with friends of friends.","The authorization server  contains logic to determine if certain information associated with a user can be accessed by a user's friends, external systems , and\/or other applications and entities. The external system  may need authorization from the authorization server  to access the user's more private and sensitive information, such as the user's work phone number. Based on the user's privacy settings, the authorization server  determines if another user, the external system , an application, or another entity is allowed to access information associated with the user, including information about actions taken by the user.","The social networking system  may include a digital video stabilization module . The digital video stabilization module  may compute a set of smooth camera orientations under the constraint that empty regions are not visible, or below a minimum threshold value. The digital video stabilization module  may then generate warped frames based on the set of new smoothed camera orientations. In an embodiment, the digital video stabilization module  may be implemented as the digital video stabilization  of .","Hardware Implementation","The foregoing processes and features can be implemented by a wide variety of machine and computer system architectures and in a wide variety of network and computing environments.  illustrates an example of a computer system  that may be used to implement one or more of the embodiments described herein in accordance with an embodiment of the invention.
