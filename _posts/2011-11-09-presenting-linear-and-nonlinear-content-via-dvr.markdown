{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Video content may be obtained from a variety of sources, including linear and non-linear sources. Linear content sources, such as broadcast television channels, provide content according to a specified schedule, whereas non-linear sources allow users to access available content on demand.","Digital Video Recorders (DVRs) often are utilized by television viewers to allow linear content to be consumed in an on-demand manner. DVRs may allow users to elect to record single instances of shows, or series of shows. After recording, a user may view a user-selectable list of recorded series and\/or shows to choose a show for playback. In this manner, a DVR provides a user with the option of watching linear content whenever and as often as desired.","Embodiments are disclosed that relate to the presentation of linear and non-linear content via a DVR system. For example, one disclosed embodiment provides, on a computing device, a method of identifying linear content and non-linear content for presentation via a video recording device. The method comprises detecting a trigger to perform a search for content items, and providing, responsive to the trigger, a search request to one or more metadata sources, each metadata source containing locations of one or more of linear content items and non-linear content items available at one or more content sources. The method further comprises receiving, responsive to the search request, from each metadata source a search response including metadata associated with available content at one or more of the content sources, and outputting a list of content items identifying one or more linear content items and one or more non-linear content items from one or more metadata sources.","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter. Furthermore, the claimed subject matter is not limited to implementations that solve any or all disadvantages noted in any part of this disclosure.","As mentioned above, current DVR systems may be designed to allow the recording and later playback of linear content, thereby permitting time-shifted consumption of linear content. A user may designate individual shows for recording, or may designate entire series for recording. Some DVR systems also may provide access to a Video on Demand (\u201cVOD\u201d) system of a linear content provider. In such DVR systems, access to such non-linear content may be provided via a different user interface screen than access to recorded linear content.","While current DVR systems may facilitate time-shifted consumption of video content, they also may suffer some drawbacks. For example, the definitions of series utilized by current DVR systems may be limited to multi-episode linear content series, such as television series. Thus, users wishing to view related non-linear content may have to seek out such content via other avenues, such as a through a computer network. Additionally, a user that schedules a show to record from a linear source may not be aware of an immediate availability of the show from a non-linear content source. Thus, the user may wait for the scheduled recording to occur, rather than choosing to view the show immediately from the non-linear content source. Similarly, a user of a current DVR system that joins a linear content broadcast midway through an item may not be aware that the full item is currently available at a non-linear content source. Thus, current DVR systems may lack the functionality to incorporate non-linear content with traditional linear content in a combined user experience.","Accordingly, embodiments are disclosed herein that relate to the presentation of linear content and non-linear content in an integrated user experience. As described in more detail below, the disclosed embodiments may allow a DVR system to present linear and non-linear content together in a single content series, as well as to alert a user when a desired linear content item may be available immediately and\/or in full from a non-linear content source. It will be understood that the term \u201cDVR system\u201d as used herein refers to any system for providing an integrated user experience for both linear content and non-linear content, and may refer to systems in which content is recorded remotely instead of locally.","Prior to discussing these embodiments in detail, an example use environment  for providing linear and non-linear content via DVR systems is described with reference to . Use environment  comprises a plurality of DVR systems , illustrated as an arbitrary number n of DVR systems. Each DVR system  is connected to a remote DVR service  via a network . As discussed in more detail below, the remote DVR service  may be configured to schedule recordings of content items for each DVR system  based upon series definitions and other user account information  stored on the remote DVR service  for each DVR system . The content items scheduled for recording may be obtained from one or more linear content sources  and also one or more non-linear content sources . It will be understood that, in other embodiments, scheduling and\/or other tasks described herein as being performed by DVR service  may be performed locally on each DVR system , or distributed between the DVR service  and each DVR system . Further, in some embodiments, the tasks described herein may be fully cloud-based, such that recording of linear content occurs remote from a user's playback locale, or may occur fully on a user's local device.","Each DVR system  is configured to record scheduled programs, and also to play back recorded programs upon user request. As such, each DVR system  comprises a logic subsystem  configured to execute instructions, and a data-holding subsystem  configured to store various data. For example, the data-holding subsystem  may store instructions  executable by the logic subsystem  to perform tasks related to recording and playback of content.","The data-holding subsystem  also may be configured to store recorded video content  and\/or record pointers  to available non-linear content. As will be described in more detail below, the DVR systems  are configured to present linear and non-linear content in an integrated user experience. With regard to non-linear content, as such content may be available on-demand, the content may be accessed at any time without recording a local copy. Therefore, in such instances, local storage space may be conserved by storing a pointer to a non-linear content item, rather than a copy of the non-linear content item. In other instances, a copy of a non-linear content item may be stored instead of a pointer, e.g. if a non-linear content item is due to expire (e.g. will no longer be available at a content source), if a network connection between a DVR system and a non-linear content source is unreliable, if local storage is preferred by a user, etc.","The linear content source , as mentioned above, provides a stream of linear scheduled content  to each DVR system  via a direct channel , and\/or via computer network  (e.g. Internet Protocol Television \u201cIPTV\u201d). It will be understood that a \u201cstream\u201d may, but is not limited to, a continuous bit stream, and a group of files accessed in succession (e.g. fragmented MP4). Examples of suitable linear content sources  include, but are not limited to, cable television and satellite television providers. The linear content source  further may provide other information to DVR systems , such as an Electronic Program Guide  (\u201cEPG\u201d), and non-linear content by VOD . The direct channel  may take the form of a coaxial cable, fiber optic cable, satellite link, or any other communication channel suitable for delivering linear content. While the embodiment of  depicts a single linear content source  for clarity, it will be understood that DVR systems  also may receive linear content from more than one linear content source.","As mentioned above, in some embodiments, each DVR system  may be implemented as a client device configured to receive recording scheduling information from the DVR service  based upon user account information  stored on the DVR service . The DVR service  further comprises a scheduler  configured to determine where shows and series may be accessed for recording and\/or playback, and to determine for each DVR system  scheduling information for local storage by each DVR system . Each DVR may then record and\/or present content based upon the scheduling information received from the DVR service . In other embodiments, as mentioned above, these tasks may be performed in part or wholly on each DVR system .","The DVR service  may further comprise a metadata service  for storing and searching metadata related to content available for recording and\/or playback. The metadata service  may be configured to receive content requests from the DVR service  and\/or each DVR system , and in response, to obtain information regarding the availability of content that matches the queries. The metadata service  may query locally stored metadata  and\/or external content sources. Locally stored metadata  may include previously received information, such as information from an electronic programming guide (EPG)  from linear content source , for example. This information may then be used by the DVR system  to schedule the recording of content and\/or otherwise provide access to non-linear content. The metadata service  further may include plugins  for interfacing with external content sources, as explained in more detail below.","The use environment  further comprises a metadata source  located external to the metadata service  but that is accessible to the metadata service  and searchable via a search service . Such an external metadata source  may allow the metadata service  to access metadata not stored locally but that may contain information relevant to video content items of interest to users of the DVR systems . While the embodiment of  depicts a single external metadata source  for clarity, it will be understood that any suitable number of external metadata sources may be accessed by metadata service .","Each external non-linear content source  likewise may include a search service  with which the metadata service  can interface to discover available content on the non-linear content source through queries. Further, each external non-linear content source also comprises a content service  configured to deliver non-linear content  to end-user devices, such as DVR systems . Examples of suitable non-linear content sources include, but are not limited to, television content web sites, movie content web sites, user-uploaded video web sites, and social networking web sites. It will be understood that the delivery of non-linear content  may be accomplished via any acceptable delivery mechanism, including but not limited to, a continuous bit stream, and successive access to each file in a group of files (e.g. Fragmented MP4).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","100","104","102","102","202","129"]},"Upon triggering, the scheduler  may initiate the search by providing a request to the metadata service  to conduct a metadata search. The metadata service  may search for relevant metadata locally (e.g. locally stored EPG data for a linear content source utilized by the requesting DVR system), and also may initiate searches for relevant content on external non-linear content sources.","The metadata service  may search for external non-linear content in any suitable manner. In the depicted embodiment, the aforementioned metadata service plugins  serve as interfaces between the metadata service  and external non-linear sources. The plugins  that are actually used in a search may be enabled and disabled through user selection. It will also be appreciated that new plugins may be added, such as through a system update process or through a user download.","Each plugin  is configured to interface with a particular corresponding external content source. As such, each plugin  may comprise an adapter  configured to translate metadata search queries provided to the plugin  into terms recognized by the corresponding external content source. Each plugin may supports the same type of search queries (e.g. search by title, program ID, series ID, and time\/channel) as supported by the metadata service . Each plugin  also may be configured to provide authentication information, user account information, and\/or other security information to corresponding external content sources that require such information for access. Such authentication information may be provided by a user in a setup process.","After performing any appropriate search query translation, each adapter  sends the search query, along with any appropriate authentication information, to the corresponding nonlinear content source , which searches for relevant content. Information regarding identified content, such as identifications of the content and the locations at which the identified content may be accessed, is then returned to the adapter , which returns the information to the metadata service  for provision to the scheduler . It will be appreciated that the depicted logical architecture  provides an extensible framework that allows the addition of external content source search capabilities simply by adding a plugin for each desired additional external content source.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","300","300","302","304","302","302","306","308","300","310","312"]},"At , method  comprises evaluating whether each candidate is available at multiple sources. If a candidate is available at multiple sources, method  may prioritize the sources at , and if not, method  proceeds to , discussed below. Sources may be prioritized based upon any suitable criteria. For example, in some embodiments, a DVR system user may specify one or more preferences. The preferences may be global (e.g. apply to all series) or may be specific to a particular series. For example, the user of the DVR may prefer content sources that allow downloading or recording over content sources that only allow for streaming. In another example, the user may prefer content sources at which the content is available immediately over content sources at which the content item may only be available at a later date. In another example, the DVR may automatically choose a lower-priority source over a higher-priority source if the higher-priority source is in use or unavailable. For example, if there are no more tuners available at that time to record from a (higher-priority) linear content source, the DVR may automatically choose a (lower-priority) non-linear content source. It will be understood that these methods of prioritizing content sources are presented for the purpose of example, and are not intended to be limiting in any manner.","Continuing, method  comprises, at , evaluating if each media content item has already been recorded. It will be understood that a media content item may be considered \u201cpreviously recorded\u201d if, for example, a copy of the item has been recorded to a storage device, a copy of the content item has been downloaded to a storage device, and\/or a pointer to the content has been stored in a storage device. It will be further understood that \u201cstorage device\u201d may refer to one or more local storage devices, one or more remote storage devices, or a combination thereof If the media content item has already been recorded, method  continues to , and if not, method  continues to . At , method  comprises evaluating whether each content candidate is preferred over the previously recorded instance. If the previously recorded content is preferred, method  comprises ignoring the candidate, as indicated at . In this way, each content candidate may be compared against any previously recorded content to determine if the content is available from a preferred source. For example, a user may prefer to record a live airing of a television program in place of a streaming version that has been previously recorded.","At , method  comprises evaluating if each media content item is currently available. If the media content item is not currently available, then method  proceeds to , while if the media content item is currently available, method  proceeds to . At , method  comprises scheduling a recording of a media content item. The schedule may be predicted  or known . For example, if the schedule is known, the recording may be scheduled for a specific date and time provided by the content item. If the schedule is not known, then the recording may be scheduled for a predicted date and time based on previous availability from the content source. The schedule may also be predicted using information (e.g. time\/date of the original airing, time\/date of future airings of the program and\/or series, etc.) provided by a linear content source, a non-linear content source, or a metadata source. At the predicted time, the content item may be recorded if available, or the predicted time may be updated if the content is still unavailable. Method  then proceeds to , discussed below.","At , method  comprises recording currently available content. The content may be linear content  or non-linear content . The linear content  may be recorded using a tuner . Tuner  may include, but is not limited to, one or more hardware-based tuners (e.g. Radio Frequency \u201cRF\u201d tuner), one or more software-based tuners (e.g. IPTV tuner), or a combination thereof The non-linear content  may be recorded via download  or storage of a pointer , wherein the pointer may comprise a URL or other unique identifier of the location of the non-linear content . Method  then proceeds to .","At , method  comprises updating the user interface to reflect changes made at  or . Method  may update an EPG , provide one or more notifications , update a scheduled recording list , and\/or update a recorded items list . The notifications may include but are not limited to EPG text and\/or icons, messages overlaying playback of media content, or general user notifications. Examples of such notifications are described in more detail below.","The identification of linear and non-linear content as described above may allow linear and non-linear content to be presented together in a common user interface, thereby presenting an integrated user experience.  shows a process flow depicting an embodiment of a method  for providing linear content and non-linear content to a user of a DVR in an integrated experience. At , method  comprises obtaining an update for a first content series. This update may include one or more linear content items for recording  and\/or one or more non-linear content items for recording . At , method  may comprise obtaining an update for a second content series. This update likewise may include one or more linear content items for recording  and\/or one or more non-linear content items for recording .","The update for linear content items  and\/or  may be obtained locally at a DVR system, for example, based upon an updated EPG received by the DVR system, or may be obtained from a remote DVR service. The non-linear content items  and\/or  may include streaming content, or content that is available for download. It will be understood that the first content series and\/or the second content series each may comprise any combination of non-linear content items and linear content items.","At , method  may record a copy of each content item. If the content is linear, a copy may be recorded to local storage at . In other embodiments, the linear content may be recorded to storage at a remote server that is then accessible by a client DVR device, or at any other suitable location. If the content is non-linear, recording of the content may include storing a pointer to the content at , or downloading a copy of expiring non-linear content at . In this way, the non-linear content may be accessed by streaming in order to conserve storage space. Further, if the content is set to expire from the streaming service, the non-linear content may be downloaded in order to ensure persistent access to the content (e.g. when a user has selected \u201ckeep until deleted\u201d during scheduling). Further still, if a non-linear content item has previously been recorded when a user selects \u201ckeep until deleted\u201d, the content item may be downloaded. If a download is not possible (e.g. the non-linear content source does not allow downloading), a new recording from another content source may be scheduled and may replace the previous content item once available. At , method  may comprise receiving a request to view available series, and in response, providing a user interface image to a display device, wherein the user interface image includes a representation of the first content series and\/or the second content series. For example, the user interface image may include a listing of scheduled and recorded content for each series. In this manner, non-linear content and linear content selections are presented on a common user interface for user convenience.","After display of the user interface image, method , at , may comprise receiving a request to view a recorded content item. As indicated at , the presentation of the content item may differ depending upon whether the item is linear or non-linear. If the content is linear, method  may comprise accessing a locally stored copy, as indicated at . Likewise, if the content is non-linear, method  may comprise accessing the content from a non-linear content source, as indicated at . Further, when accessing the non-linear content, method  may also comprise obtain a playback user interface, as indicated at . For example, in some instances, a non-linear content source may allow for playback within its playback experience user interface. As such, the user interface may be obtained along with the non-linear content from the non-linear content source. In other instances, a locally-stored playback user interface may be utilized. Further, as indicated at , if the non-linear content has been previously downloaded, the downloaded copy may be accessed instead of the non-linear content source.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["500","501","502","504","502","504"]},"Each series  or  may include one or more content items . The display of content items  may include such information as date recorded\/date scheduled to be recorded , source of content item , title of content item , and\/or expiration date . Further, a designator  (illustrated here as an asterisk) may be displayed to alert the user to a content item that is scheduled but not yet available. In the case of non-linear content, date  may indicate the predicted or known time the content item will be available, as discussed above regarding .","Designator  may have any suitable appearance. For example, in some embodiments, a designator  may comprise a change in the color or size of content item . For example, content items that are not yet available may be grayed-out. In other embodiments, a designator may not be shown. Instead, content items that are not yet available may not be displayed in a same user interface image as content items that are already available.","Expiration date  may indicate a content item  may no longer be available. If the content item  is linear, the expiration date  may indicate the time at which the content item will be deleted from a local and\/or remote storage. A linear content item may expire due to a user preference (e.g. keep program for 30 days) or may be programmatically removed in order to allow for further recordings (e.g. keep program until more space is needed). If the content item  is non-linear, the expiration date  may indicate the time at which the content item will no longer be available from a non-linear content source. Although it is depicted as text, expiration date  may have any suitable appearance. For example, an upcoming expiration date  may be represented with an icon (e.g. an exclamation point). In other embodiments, expiration date may not be shown. Instead, content items that are about to be expired may be represented with a different size and\/or color of text.","The use of multiple content sources may result in a particular content item being available from more than one content source.  shows a process flow depicting an embodiment of a method  of providing a notification alerting a user of a video recording device to an alternate source of a content item. Method  comprises receiving a trigger . The trigger may be generated by any suitable event. For example, the trigger may be programmatically generated when a user requests to access a content item at a first content source. In another example, the trigger may be generated when a user attempts to record or view a show that is already in progress.","At , method  comprises querying for content from a second content source in response to trigger , wherein the second content source comprises a more linear content source or a non-linear content source. Querying may include, at , translating the query for an external content source to interface with an external source's APIs. It will be understood that the query may be sent to any suitable number of second content sources.","Next, at , method  comprises receiving query candidates from one or more content sources. From the query candidates, at , method  next evaluates if the content is available from a second source. It will be understood that content \u201cavailable\u201d at a second source is not necessarily \u201cavailable now\u201d. In other words, content \u201cavailable\u201d at a second source may be available for recording\/viewing at a later date. If the content is not available, method  ends at .
