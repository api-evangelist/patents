title: High resolution projectile based targeting system
abstract: A projectile based targeting system for underwater objects includes a trainable gun terminal mounted in a waterproof housing. The gun terminal includes plural gun barrels terminating in waterproof breeches. Noise generating projectiles are launched from the gun barrels, and a fire control system selectively fires the projectiles from each of the plural gun barrels in a noise pattern. A host controller detects and processes noise generated by a launched pattern of the noise generating projectiles to give information about the objects. The projectiles each include a void region connected to an outer surface of the projectile by a hole formed in a neck of the projectile. Launching of the projectile creates a vaporous cavity around the projectile and thus the hole, thereby causing the void region to resonate at a noise generating frequency.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","(1) Field of the Invention","This invention generally relates to a system and apparatus to identify a position and near instantaneous track of an underwater object moving at any subsonic speed.","More particularly, the invention relates to a system and apparatus as described in which the position of the underwater object is determined by a reflection of a radiated sound field from at least one projectile interacting with the underwater object. The system consists of a multi-barreled gun that discharges a multiplicity of projectiles in a predetermined time sequence and\/or pattern. The projectiles themselves are designed to travel at a significant range and are modified to produce a high amplitude narrow frequency radiated noise. The entire system is coupled with a sonar tracking system and a trainable launcher. The preferred embodiment is described in connection with a submarine based gun and targeting system.","(2) Description of the Prior Art","The prior art for underwater targeting systems rely on the projection of an active sonar pulse or \u201cping\u201d P and the received return signal RP from a target  such as that shown in . The return signal RP is processed to determine the location of the underwater target . In the system of , the sound ping P leaves an acoustic transmitter T. The underwater object  is located at a distance d from a platform . The ping P as reflected off the target  becomes reflected ping RP, travels an approximate distance d back toward the platform  and is intercepted by a sonar receiver S. The information from the sonar receiver S is processed. A command is sent to a sonar array (not shown) to transmit a new ping P. Ideally, the new ping P is directed in the relative direction of travel of the underwater object  and the platform . The time delay in this system is (2*d\/c) where c is the sound speed of the environment. The determination of the location of the underwater object depends on the ability to transmit, receive and process the sonar information. The signal processing in general is more effective when high relative Doppler shift exists between the underwater object  and the background acoustic environment and the propagation distance is minimized. This system has been used successfully for target tracking and underwater imaging since World War II. The processing of the return signal RP may be complicated by a number of factors such as bending of acoustic waves in thermal or salinity gradients, multiple target reflection and the like. For torpedo defense application, both precise instantaneous target position and estimate of target track are critical to system performance. The system performance could be greatly improved with a more accurate tracking system.","Another known solution to the targeting problem is shown in . In the device of , the ping P is replaced by a projectile path P(path). The projectile P travels toward the underwater object  at high speeds and ideally would travel just below sonic speed. The projectile P is assumed to be a compact noise source. As the projectile P approaches the target , the radiated noise from the projectile P at point p will interact with the object . The amplitude of the reflected sound will be a function of both the amplitude of the projectile's radiated sound and the miss distance M. This reflected sound S then travels back to the platform  and is processed. This system yields more accurate information than the system of  because the position of the projectile P in space is known. The high rate of change in the Doppler return as the projectile P approaches and then passes the target  allows calculation of the miss distance. The processing of data in the  system relies on the knowledge of projectile position (this is a known quantity with an error associated with projectile dispersion) and sufficient signal to noise ratio and a prior understanding of the spectrum of the radiated noise of the projectile. The prior art does not teach an ideal projectile for this use.","Another concern for overall targeting is the determination of the object track. In general, three to five separate pings of data are required to determine the track of object .  shows that for either of the known approaches in  and , the target  will change position during the time between the transmission of the first ping or projectile and the processing of the fourth return. The distance the object migrates (Tmd) during that time in comparison to the initial standoff distance d is an important source of error in the understanding of the object's true position and track. The prior art does not address this problem.","The following patents, for example, disclose object detection systems, but do not disclose the determination of a position of an underwater object by reflection of a radiated sound field pattern from projectiles interacting with the underwater object.","U.S. Pat. No. 4,350,881 to Knight et al.;","U.S. Pat. No. 5,062,641 to Poillon et al.;","U.S. Pat. No. 5,481,505 to Donald et al.;","U.S. Pat. No. 5,614,657 to Harada;","U.S. Pat. No. 5,929,370 to Brown et al.; and","U.S. Pat. No. 6,405,653 to Miskelly.","Specifically, Knight et al. disclose an apparatus for indicating the location in a measurement plane through which a projectile passes. The apparatus includes an array of at least three transducers responsive to the airborne pressure wave produced by the projectile and positioned at predetermined locations along a line parallel to the movement plane. The apparatus further includes a device for measuring the velocity of the projectile and another for measuring the velocity of sound in air in the vicinity of the transducers. A computing means, responsive to the array of transducers, the velocity measuring means and the propagation of sound determination is provided which determines the location in the measurement plane through which the projectile passed and provides an output indicating that location. Also disclosed is a means, in combination with the position detecting means, for detecting and providing a positive indication of a projectile hit on a target member.","The patent to Poillon et al. discloses a system that accurately determines the location of the point of impact of a projectile, such as a golf ball, on a screen. A timer is provided that is activated when the projectile leaves a start point positioned at a known location. Upon impact of the projectile on the screen, a sound wave is produced that travels to a plurality of sound wave detectors. The system measures the time the sound wave travels to the plurality of sound wave detectors. These travel times are utilized to determine the point of impact of the projectile on the screen. The point of impact and flight travel time is used to determine the trajectory and velocity of the projectile. These parameters are then used to determine the distance the projectile would have traveled if unimpeded.","Donald et al. disclose a method and apparatus for detecting, processing and tracking sonar signals to provide bearing, range and depth information that locates an object in three-dimensional underwater space. An inverse beamformer utilizes signals from a towed horizontal array of hydrophones to estimate a bearing to a possible object. A matched field processor receives measured covariance matrix data based upon signals from the hydrophones and signals from a propagation model. An eight nearest neighbor peak picker provides plane wave peaks in response to output beam levels from the matched peaks within the specified limit of frequency, bearing change over time, range and depth to specify an object as a target and to display its relative range and depth with respect to the array of hydrophones.","Harada discloses a three dimensional measuring apparatus including a gun, a pedestal for the gun, three microphones, a pedestal of a product and a data processor. The gun shoots very small bullets at a target such as a casting product. The very small bullets explode or rupture and generate high frequency sound at the time of hitting against the target. The three microphones catch the high frequency sounds. All these sound data are gathered to the data processor, and processed into three-dimensional data of the surface of the product.","The patent to Brown et al. discloses a projectile propelled from a location in air, through an air\/water interface, and toward a submerged underwater object. The projectile includes a forward end that forms a cavitation void around the projectile in water, avoiding water drag on the remainder of the projectile. The projectile further includes an outwardly flared or finned rearward end that aerodynamically stabilizes the projectile in air and flare stabilizes it in water, in each case against yaw.","Miskelly discloses a supercavitating underwater projectile adapted to be fired from a gun or the like, comprising a front end or nose portion and a rear end portion. An auxiliary rocket motor is disposed within the rear end portion of the projectile for providing additional thrust after the projectile has been fired. Vents are disposed within the projectile and are in communication with the rocket motor and the exterior of the projectile for venting some of the combustion gases from the rocket motor to the exterior of the projectile near the nose portion thereof to increase the size of the cavitation bubble formed as the projectile travels through the water and thereby reduce hydrodynamic drag on the projectile.","It should be understood that the present invention would in fact enhance the functionality of the above patents by providing better resolution of the position of underwater objects, improved determination of the track of an underwater object, the ability to more effectively target underwater objects moving at high speed, better resolution of underwater objects and tracks in poor acoustic environments, decreased signal processing requirements to achieve a desired target resolution, and better ability to resolve multiple targets.","Therefore it is an object of this invention to provide a system for determining a nearly instantaneous track of an underwater object.","Another object of this invention is to provide a means to control a spectrum of radiated noise and amplitude from a projectile.","Still another object of this invention is to provide a system for accurately determining an instantaneous position of an underwater object.","A still further object of the invention is to provide a targeting system that minimizes effects of single projectile dispersion.","In accordance with one aspect of this invention, there is provided a projectile based targeting system for underwater objects, the system including a trainable gun terminal mounted in a waterproof housing, the gun terminal including plural waterproof breeches. Plural gun barrels are formed in a muzzle of the gun terminal, each of the plural gun barrels terminating in the waterproof breeches of the gun terminal. Noise generating projectiles are launched from the gun barrels by a fire control system which selectively fires the projectiles from each of the plural gun barrels in a noise pattern. A host controller detects and processes noise generated by a launched pattern of the noise generating projectiles. The projectiles each include a void region connected to an outer surface of the projectile by a passage formed in the projectile. Launching of the projectile creates a flowing vaporous cavity around the projectile and thus the passage, thereby causing the void region to resonate at a noise generating frequency.","In general, the present invention is directed to a high resolution projectile based targeting system. More specifically, and referring first to  of the present invention, there is shown a gun system  used in the novel projectile targeting system of the present invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["10","10","12","14","16","17","16","18","20","18","20","22","22","24","26","28","26","30","22","32","22"]},"In a preferred embodiment, each gun barrel , breech  and sabot separator  is mounted to pivot about the associated sealable aperture  within muzzle assembly  and mounting fixture . This allows firing of projectiles  at a selectable angular position. Angular positioning of each gun barrel  can be obtained by use of an actuator  joined to each gun. Actuators  are joined to fire control system  for control of positioning for each barrel . Large positioning adjustments for the entire gun terminal can be made by using trainable mounting fixture .","Fire control system  is joined to an acoustic targeting system . Acoustic targeting system  is joined to a transducer  in acoustic contact with the surrounding environmental water. Transducer  receives acoustic signals from the surrounding water and transmits them to acoustic targeting system . Acoustic targeting system  performs computations on the received signals and transmits targeting data to fire control system . These computations can be performed utilizing the position of the launched projectiles and analysis of the received reverberation. The position of the launched projectiles can be determined by knowledge of the projectile launch directions and times, by analysis of the received noise generated by the projectile or by a combination of these methods. Analysis of the received noise and reverberation utilizes the frequency of the original signal and Doppler shift of the received reverberation to give the position and path of target by means known in the art.","The projectile package is shown in detail in  and includes a projectile  in a sabot package . The sabot package  is separated from the projectile  in the gas decelerator area . The sabot petals could cause interference with neighboring projectiles and as such the projectiles  are fired with a minimum time delay such that each sequential projectile  clears the gas decelerator area  before the next projectile passes through the gas decelerator area .","The discharged projectiles  will enter water outside of a flooded section (not shown) of the platform  with a slight delay (on the order of the distance of the void\/gas decelerator area ). This delay can be increased to any desired length and typically will spread projectiles out at five meter intervals.","The actuators  are used to change a dispersion pattern of the projectiles  fired from the system . A wide or narrow projectile pattern or any combination therebetween may be used. The cutout shapes of the sealable apertures  in the muzzle face  of the gas decelerator  accommodate this range of motion.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 4A","FIG. 4A"],"b":["34","34","39","34","40","42","34","34","44","39","44","39","44","39"]},"A small, machined passage  is formed through a neck region  of the projectile  and, in this case, has a length approximately one fourth of the base diameter. The passage  is connected to a relatively large void region . In this case, the void region  is a right cylindrical section having a length of 1.5\u2033 and a radius of one half the base diameter. The void region  terminates in a solid end cap . In a typical projectile package (shown in ), effects of a pusher  and coupler  exert high local force on the projectile base  thus necessitating separation between the void region  and the base . Water vapor flowing through the cavity  causes the passage  and enclosed void  to act as a Helmholtz resonator. This produces a high amplitude noise source in the cavity  over a narrow frequency range. The amplitude of the noise is sufficient that transmitted noise through the cavity boundary  still produces a high radiated noise in fluid at a substantially single frequency.","The size of the passage  used will change the frequency of the noise. If the projectile  slows below supercavitation speed, fluid will flow directly over the cavity  and still produce a high amplitude noise.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 4C","b":["44","34","50","46","46","50","52","58","60","34"]},"Alternatives to the system and devices as described are understood to be included within the scope of the invention. Some alternatives are mounting of the gun system  on a separate platform, such as an autonomous UUV, from the sonar receiver\/host controller. Any number of gun barrels could be used. The gun system  could be used in combination with an existing active sonar system. Devices with alternative mechanical\/electronic means to produce sound could be built into the projectile. The \u201cnoisy\u201d projectiles could be fired from a Gatling gun (analogous to tracer bullets) in addition to standard projectiles to provide a near continuous closed loop targeting system. The projectiles may be designed with any number and size of enclosed volumes and any aperture pattern to produce any desired frequency of radiated noise or multiple frequencies of radiated noise in a single projectile.","In view of the above detailed description, it is anticipated that the invention herein will have far reaching application other than those of an underwater projectile targeting system.","This invention has been disclosed in terms of certain embodiments.
