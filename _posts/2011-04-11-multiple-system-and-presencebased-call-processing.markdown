{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/426,834 filed Dec. 23, 2010, and the present application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/941,385 filed Nov. 8, 2010, titled \u201cAutomated Device\/System Setup Based on Presence Information,\u201d the disclosure of both of these applications being hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.","With the advent of modern communications systems, users often have access to and utilize multiple communications devices. For example, a given user may operate a wireline telephone at his or her home, business, school or other facility. Simultaneously, the user may operate a wireless telephone or messaging device. And, the user may have one or more of his\/her communications devices\/systems associated with other systems for adding additional functionality or services. For example, a user may have his\/her wireline or wireless telephones associated with a television services system (e.g., a cable television services system so that, as calls are received at his\/her wireless or wireline telephones, caller identification information is displayed on the user's television set as the calls are being received.) Such multiple communications systems, while useful, may also lead to problems of system overlap or basic information annoyances. For example, if a user is sitting in his\/her living room watching television, the user may receive a telephone call on his\/her wireless telephone that is presently situated in another room even though his wireline telephone is next to him\/her in the living room. Conversely, the user may receive a call on the wireline telephone located in another room, but he\/she is currently holding his\/her wireless telephone. Or, a call may come in for the user's spouse who is not presently located in the home, and caller identification information for the incoming call may be displayed on the user's television causing use of a caller identification application associated with the user's television even though the intended recipient (e.g., the user's spouse) is not present to receive the information or call.","Thus, there is a need for multiple system and presence-based call processing and setup that allows users to set up call processing associated with multiple communications systems based on user preferences and user presence information. It is with respect to these and other considerations that the present invention has been made.","The above and other problems are solved by processing communications to and from multiple communications systems based on user preferences and based on presence information for one or more users of the communications systems. According to embodiments, a user who operates multiple communications systems may set preferences with each of the systems individually or through a centralized communications management system to control call processing to each of the systems based on prescribed user preferences and based on presence information for the user. For example, based on user preferences and user preference information, calls directed to a user's wireless telephone may be automatically forwarded or routed to his\/her wireline telephone if the user is physically located near the wireline telephone and vice versa. More particularly, such presence-based call processing may be performed on a more specific or granular basis. For example, if the user is physically located in a room having a wireline telephone, calls directed to the user's wireless telephone may be directed to his\/her wireline telephone and vice versa.","Other communications applications associated with one or more communications systems may be automatically activated or functionally modified based on user preferences and\/or user presence information. For example, if caller identification information for an incoming call is displayed on a user's television set, the display of the information may be suspended if the user is not physically present in the proximity of the television set. In addition to automatic call processing based on user preferences and user presence information, manual user interaction with communications systems in association with user preferences and user presence information may be enabled. For example, presence information may be utilized for enabling a user to manually select call processing for an incoming call to one or more communications devices.","The details of one or more embodiments are set forth in the accompanying drawings and description below. Other features and advantages will be apparent from a reading of the following detailed description and a review of the associated drawings. It is to be understood that the following detailed description is explanatory only and is not restrictive of the invention as claimed.","As briefly described above, embodiments of the present invention are directed to processing communications to and from multiple communications systems based on user preferences and based on presence information for one or more users of the communications systems. According to embodiments, a user who operates multiple communications systems may set preferences with each of the systems individually or through a centralized communications management system to control call processing to each of the systems based on prescribed user preferences and based on presence information for the user. For example, a user may set a preference with his\/her wireless telephone provider that when he\/she is at home, all calls should be automatically routed or forwarded to his\/her home wireline system or, alternatively, the user may set a system preference that automatically routes calls directed to the user's wireline telephone to the user's wireless telephone when the user leaves the physical proximity of the user's wireline telephone. More particularly, such presence-based call processing may be performed on a more specific or granular basis. For example, if the user is physically located in a room having a wireline telephone, calls directed to the user's wireless telephone may be directed to his\/her wireline telephone and vice versa.","In addition, other communications applications associated with one or more communications systems may be automatically activated or functionally modified based on user preferences and\/or user presence information. For example, if a user operates a television with advanced functionality, for example, as provided by an associated computing functionality such as a cable television services system set top box or Internet-based television control or services provisioning system, calls directed to the user's wireless and\/or wireline telephones may interact with the television set and associated functionality. For example, incoming calls to the user's wireless and\/or wireline telephones may cause a software application associated with the user's television set to display caller identification information for the incoming calls on the user's television set. According to embodiments, based on user preferences and\/or user presence information, interaction between the user's wireline and\/or wireless communications systems and the user's television and associated functionality may be modified based on user preferences and\/or user presence information.","According to embodiments, a given user may set preferences with his\/her wireless telephone services provider and with his\/her wireline telephone services provider and with the user's television services system provider and with any other of the user's voice communication system providers (e.g., VoIP, video conferencing system connected to a television or computer, video conferencing phone, etc.) that calls directed to one or more of the disparate systems are processed according to the user's preferences and to the user's presence information. For example, a user may identify a number of different callers according to their caller identification information such that incoming calls from the identified callers are processed according to specific user preferences and according to user presence information. For example, if the user is presently located away from his\/her home, and a call is received from a particular incoming caller at the user's home wireline telephone system, in addition to automatically routing the incoming call to the user's wireless telephone carried by the user at a location remote from the user's home wireline telephone, caller identification information that may otherwise be displayed on the user's television set via computing functionality associated with the user's television set (e.g., via a network-connected video content viewing device such as a cable services set top box or Internet-based television functionality) may be temporarily deactivated or overridden to prevent the caller identification information from being displayed on the user's television while the user is away from home. For example, if the user's spouse, children, friends or others are presently watching a television set at the user's home, according to these embodiments, caller identification information for an incoming call directed to the user while the user is away from home may not be displayed on the user's television set given that the user is not present in the proximity of the television set. That is, setting a preference that caller identification information should not be displayed on a home-based television set when the intended recipient of the incoming call is not present in the home will avoid needlessly utilizing the caller identification application and functionality associated with the television set and will avoid needlessly annoying anyone present in the home watching the television when the incoming call is received.","In addition to automatic call processing based on user preferences and user presence information, manual user interaction with communications systems in association with user preferences and user presence information may be enabled. For example, a functionality button or control on a user's wireless telephone handset, a functionality button or control on a user's wireline telephone set, and\/or a functionality button or control on a television control device, for example, a television remote control device, may be utilized for allowing the user to manually interact with communications systems for affecting call processing. For example, if the user is sitting in his\/her living room next to a home wireline telephone while watching television and the user receives an incoming wireless telephone call directed to his\/her wireless telephone located in another room, according to embodiments, caller identification information for the incoming wireless communication may be displayed on the user's television set. Upon seeing the display of the incoming call directed to the wireless telephone, the user may select a functionality button or control on the television remote control device or on the wireline telephone device to cause the incoming call directed to the wireless telephone to be automatically routed or forwarded to the wireline telephone so that the user may receive the call at the wireline telephone without having to physically retrieve the wireless telephone for receiving the call. Conversely, if the user is not in the physical proximity of the wireline telephone, and the user receives a telephone call directed to the wireline telephone system, and caller identification information for the incoming wireline telephone call is displayed on the user's television set, the user may select a functionality button or control on the television remote control device or wireless handset to cause the incoming wireline telephone call to be routed to the user's wireless telephone device so that the user may receive the call at the wireless telephone device without having to move to the location of the wireline telephone for receiving the call through the wireless telephone device.","As will be described below with reference to , preferences for each of the wireline telephone, wireless telephone and television services systems may be set at each of these systems separately, or may be set with each of these systems through a centralized management system where each of the types of service are provided by a single services provider or where each service provider is equipped to receive user preferences through a centralized management system such as a web services system operative to communicate with each services provider. In addition, as will be described below with reference to , presence information associated with a multitude of electronic devices operated by or in the proximity of a user may be utilized for automatically detecting user presence and for setting call processing configuration information for processing communications as described herein.","When a user of one or more electronic devices or systems moves into or out of the presence of the one or more devices or systems, detection or determination of the user's presence or lack of presence may be used to apply setup or settings changes to the one or more devices or systems. The user's presence relative to the one or more devices or systems may be detected according to a variety of means. As should be appreciated, a device may include any device capable of being uniquely identifiable and can either be detected or can detect and communicate its location. A wireless device carried by the user may be detected by a wireless presence detector, or alternatively, a wireless device may detect a change in physical presence (e.g., presence of a familiar Wi-Fi hotspot or known BLUETOOTH device, etc.), and may communicate presence information to a presence server. Online\/offline status of a user with respect to an Internet connection may be used to detect\/determine presence of the user. Use of a wireline or wireless telephone, a VoIP-technology equipped device, a video conferencing system device, cable television set-top box or other device connected to a services provider may be used to determine presence information for the user. Physical presence may also be determined via traditional wireless carrier location determining methodologies such as, but not limited to: triangulation, trilateration, multilateration, etc. Physical presence may be determined via a GPS or assisted GPS system. Other location-detection systems (e.g., RFID tags) may be incorporated into a frequently carried device (e.g., a wallet), and may be detected upon ingress or egress of a specific location.","These embodiments may be combined, other embodiments may be utilized, and structural changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is therefore not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined by the appended claims and their equivalents. Referring now to the drawings, in which like numerals refer to like elements throughout the several figures, embodiments of the present invention and an exemplary operating environment will be described.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["110","115","110","117","117","110","117","140","115","135","117"]},"A wireless telephone\/data network  with an associated wireless transmission point  (e.g., cell tower) is illustrated for providing wireless telephony and data services to one or more end points in the facility . For example, a wireless telephone  may be used for sending and receiving voice, video, and data communications via the wireless telephone\/data network . A computer  is illustrated for sending and receiving wireless data and other wireless-enabled communications via the wireless telephone\/data network . An IMS server  is illustrated in association with the wireless telephone\/data network  for managing and processing data associated with subscribers and subscriber features operated via the wireless telephone\/data network . According to one embodiment, an IMS (Internet Protocol Multimedia Subsystem) server is a system operative to allow for data services, including Internet services, and access to multimedia and voice applications via a wireless network .","Referring still to , a cable television\/data\/telephone network  is illustrated for providing cable television services  through a cable television\/set-top box combination . The cable television\/data\/telephone network  is also operative for providing cable-based wireline Internet services  to a computer  and cable-based wireline telephony services  to a wireline telephone . Voice service may also include VoIP via a computer, wireless device, or a VoIP phone. Video calling service  may be provided, and may include video calling via a wireless device, via a home or business video conferencing system, via a computer, a television, video conferencing phone, etc. CATV , data , voice , and video  services may be a combined service offered by a single communications services provider, or alternatively, may be independent services provided by various service providers. The term television\/data\/telephone network  will herein be used to describe any combination of CATV , data , voice , and video  services, whether provided independently or as a combined package. A web services platform  is illustrated in association with the cable television\/data\/telephone network  for allowing subscriber access to and management of one or more services, features, or data items maintained for and operated on behalf of the subscriber via the cable television\/data\/telephone network .","Operation of a wireline telephone\/data network , a wireless telephone\/data network  and a cable television\/data\/telephone network  are well known to those skilled in the art. According to embodiments, each of the networks , ,  may operate as independent communications services providers, or each of the networks or a combination of one or more of the networks may be operated via a single communications services provider operative for providing integrated services across the three networks , , , or combinations thereof.","As will be described in detail below, the three illustrated communications networks , ,  may be utilized for receiving presence information associated with a subscriber and for altering one or more settings of a given end point device based on a subscriber's presence in proximity to the end point device. For example, detection of the presence of a user\/subscriber in the proximity of the user's wireline telephone  may cause calls directed to the user's wireless telephone  to be automatically routed to the user's wireline telephone , or conversely, presence of a user\/subscriber outside of the proximity of the wireline telephone  may cause calls directed to the user's wireline telephone  to be automatically routed to the user's wireless telephone . For another example, if the user has set a preference that when the user is not present in the home or facility , calls directed to the user's wireline telephone  that cause a caller identification message to be displayed on the user's television  in association with the set top box  or other type of network-connected video content viewing device may be automatically routed to the user's wireless telephone , then the caller identification information that otherwise would be displayed on the user's television  may be suspended from display to avoid unnecessarily utilizing the caller identification application associated with the television  and to avoid annoying others watching the television  when the user associated with the incoming call is not present.","In addition, according to other examples, and as will be described below, manual user interaction with the three illustrated communications networks may be enabled based on user preference and user presence information. For example, if the user is sitting next to a wireline telephone and a call is received at the user's wireless telephone along with the display of a caller identification on the user's television  in association with the incoming wireless telephone call, the user may be able to manually redirect the call to the user's wireline telephone by selection of a functionality button or control on the user's wireline telephone  or on a remote control device associated with the user's television  and associated computer functionality, for example, the set top box . As another example, if a user is using a computer  and a call is received on the user's wireless phone , caller identification in association with the incoming wireless call may be displayed on the user's computer screen. The user may be able to manually redirect the call to another communication, such as his\/her desk phone by selection of a functionality control displayed on the user's computer screen.","Referring still to , a user, home, business, or other facility  is illustrated in which a variety of electronic devices may be situated and\/or utilized for providing a variety of services to users and which may be operated according to a variety of different settings particular to individual users. The cable television\/set-top box combination  is illustrative of a device combination with which a user may receive and view a variety of content items including television content, movies, sports, entertainment, and the like via a cable television\/data\/telephone network . The wireline computer , the wireline telephone , the wireline alarm system , or other wireline devices  may be operative for services provisioning and communications via the cable television\/data\/telephone services network  or via a wireline telephone\/data network . The wireless computer , the wireless telephone\/data device , a wireless-enabled alarm system  or other wireless devices  may be operative for sending and receiving telephony traffic and data services via the wireless telephone\/data network .","The wireline telephone  may be set up according to user preference such that various features, for example, call forwarding, caller identification, and the like are set up differently for different users. For example, if a given user is not physically in the proximity of the wireline telephone , the user may desire that calls from his\/her wireless telephone  should not be forwarded to the wireline telephone  until the user is in the physical proximity of the wireline telephone .","The computer  with Internet or other data services access via the wireless telephone\/data network  similarly may be set up for operation, including data access, differently based on the physical proximity of different users to the device. For example, as described above with respect to the computer , a parent or supervisor may desire that Internet or other data access via the computer  may be limited depending on the physical proximity of various users to the computer .","The wireless telephone\/data device  is illustrative of a portable or hand held computing\/communications device that may be set up to operate according to various operating features and\/or settings differently for different users. For example, a user may desire that when he\/she is in the physical proximity of the wireline telephone , that all calls directed to the wireless telephone  be automatically forwarded to the wireline telephone  so that the user does not receive telephone calls at both the wireless telephone  and the wireline telephone .","The alarm system  is illustrative of an alarm system that may be operatively associated with the facility  for providing security services for the facility . As should be appreciated, the alarm system  may be set up according to a variety of operating features and settings. According to embodiments, setup and\/or other settings for the alarm system  may be different for different users who are in the presence of the alarm system .","The other wireline\/wireless devices  are illustrative of any other device or system that may be operated in or in association with the facility  for which setup and\/or other settings may be modified depending on the presence of different users in proximity to the devices .","According to embodiments, when the physical presence of a specific user is detected in the physical proximity of one of the electronic devices illustrated in , the user's presence in the physical proximity of the devices may be utilized for modifying the operational setup or settings of one or more of the electronic devices. As used herein, the term \u201cspecific or particular user\u201d may refer to an actual specific user or may refer to a user associated with an electronic device or system. For example, if an actual specific user owns and operates a wireless telephone that is used to provide physical presence information of the user for changing settings of a given device or system when the user is in the physical presence of the device or system, then the presence of the example wireless telephone may be used for changing the example settings for that actual specific user. However, if another user (for example, the user's friend or relative) carries the example wireless telephone into the physical presence of the device or system in question, the presence of the wireless telephone may be interpreted as physical presence of the user who owns the wireless telephone as opposed to the person presently carrying the telephone. In such a case, the settings of the given device or system may be changed based on the physical presence of the wireless telephone instead of the physical presence of the user who owns the telephone.","As should be understood, physical proximity to the facility  (described herein) may vary according to the different requirements of the various electronic devices. For example, for changing settings to wireless data access for a wireless computing device , physical proximity within the range of a wireless transmitter\/receiver at the facility may suffice. On the other hand, for changing settings to an alarm system , physical proximity within the facility may be a requirement.","Presence information for a given user may be detected according to a variety of different means. According to one embodiment, if a given user is carrying a wireless communications device, for example, the wireless telephone , the presence of the wireless communications device  may be detected by a variety of detection means for determining that the device is now in the physical proximity of the facility .","Referring still to , a wireless presence detector  is illustrative of one or more means for detecting presence of a wireless communications device . For example, the wireless presence detector  may be a wireless fidelity (WIFI) transmitter\/receiver situated in the facility . When the wireless communications device  is brought within operational proximity of the WIFI transmitter\/receiver, the wireless communications device  may be programmed to automatically detect all WIFI access points within range. Upon detection of a WIFI transmitter\/receiver device, location information may be provided and utilized for indicating that the wireless communications device and an associated user are now in the physical proximity of the various devices illustrated in the facility . For example, a mobile phone  may be carried by a user. The mobile phone  may detect an SSID or base station MAC address of the user's home WIFI router via wireless transmission, and may then determine its physical location. Similarly, other wireless transmitter\/receiver devices or sensors may be utilized for providing presence information for determining locations of wireless devices with respect to a wireless presence detector  and the facility  (e.g., low-powered WIFI base stations or BLUETOOTH devices that may be utilized for broadcasting location information and not routing data traffic).","According to other methods, the wireless telephone\/data network  may determine the presence of a given wireless communications device ,  based on the transmission\/reception proximity of the devices to a wireless transmission point , for example, a wireless transmission antenna. In addition, satellite based geo-location receivers may be utilized for determining the physical location of the wireless devices ,  and for determining that these devices have been brought into the physical proximity of the facility  and of the devices associated therewith. Such satellite based geo-location receivers may be associated with global positioning satellite systems (GPS) of various types, as well as, other types of geo-location systems, such as assisted-GPS (A-GPS) with which a mobile telephone network may be used to provide a starting or \u201cseed\u201d location value of a mobile device to a GPS system to enhance the efficiency of GPS location convergence. Other detection means may include embedded radio frequency identification (RFID) tags or other location-detection systems (for example, common retail anti-theft tags applied to goods) that may be embedded in always-carried devices or articles of clothing or accessories and that may be used to provide physical presence information for a user (for example, when such detection means pass a scanner or are detected upon ingress or egress of a specific area). As should be appreciated, each of the wireless presence detector means or combinations thereof described above may be utilized for determining presence of a user in the physical proximity of the facility .","In addition, presence of a given user in the physical proximity of the facility  may be determined via other means. For example, if a user utilizes the set-top box  by selecting a prescribed viewing profile associated with a particular user, the selection of the particular user profile may be utilized for determining that the particular user is now in the physical proximity of the set-top box  and thus the facility . For example, in order to utilize a given viewing profile, for example, a prescribed set of viewing channels, a given user may be required to enter a password or other credentials via the set-top box . Entry of a password or other credentials by a given user may be utilized for determining that the user is now in the physical proximity of the set-top box  and thus the facility .","Likewise, particular utilization of a wireline device such as the wireline telephone  or wireline data services via the computer  may be utilized for determining that a particular user is in the physical presence of the devices ,  and thus in the physical presence of the facility . For example, if a particular user is required to enter a password or other credentials for data services, or specialized call processing via one of the devices , , entry of such password or credentials information may be utilized for determining that the particular user is in the physical presence of the devices ,  and thus in the physical presence of the facility . Simple online\/offline status of a given user likewise may be used to detect and\/or determine the user's physical presence in the proximity of the facility .","Use or interaction with other devices in the facility , for example, the alarm system  or other wireline\/wireless devices  may similarly be utilized for determining the physical proximity of a given user to those devices and to the facility . For example, if a particular user enters a password or other credentials into an alarm system , receipt of the password or other credentials may be utilized for determining that the particular user is now in the physical presence of the device\/system and in the physical presence of the facility .","According to embodiments, physical presence information received for a particular user via one of the means described above may be passed to a presence server , illustrated in , in operative communication with each of the networks , , . According to embodiments, the presence server  is a general purpose computing system operative to receive and store presence information for a particular user for utilization of the presence information for modifying feature setup or other settings associated with one or more of the devices illustrated in the facility . According to one embodiment, the presence server  may operate as a standalone presence server from which presence information may be pushed out to interested services\/systems or from which presence information may be pulled by interested services\/systems as described below. Alternatively, the presence server  may be associated with one or more of the networks , ,  for receiving presence information through the respective networks , ,  and for providing presence information to the networks , , . For example, presence information obtained via detection of a WIFI network via a wireless device ,  via a wireless presence detector  may be transmitted directly to the presence server  for subsequent use.","Alternatively, presence information determined from use of any of the devices illustrated in the facility  may be passed to the presence server via the individual networks , ,  through which the devices are operated. For example, if presence information for a particular user is determined based on the user's access to the cable television\/set-top box , presence information for the particular user may be passed to the presence server  via the cable television\/data\/telephone network . Similarly, presence information determined by the physical location on a wireless device ,  may be passed to the presence server  via the wireless telephone\/data network . Similarly, presence information for a particular user determined by the user's access to a wireline device ,  may be passed to the presence server  via the wireline telephone\/data network . Other devices, for example, the alarm system  may pass presence information for a particular user to the presence server  via a third party alarm system services provider or via one of the wireline, wireless, or cable-enabled communications networks , , . Alternatively, physical presence information may be detected and transmitted directly from a wireless device ,  to a second device or system for which operational settings or setup data may be changed.","According to an embodiment, a configuration server  or application may be utilized for mapping end-point devices comprising operational settings or setup data that may be changed, which presence-detection-enabling devices may be within range of the end-point devices, and which users and features may be mapped to each end-point device and\/or location. The configuration server  is illustrated in  as an independent component, but as should be appreciated the configuration server  may be an application integrated with both client-side devices and\/or systems at the facility , with server-side devices and\/or systems , , , or the configuration server  may operate independently of such devices or system where data is pulled from the server  by requesting devices\/systems or where data is pushed from the server  to requesting devices\/systems.","Having described a system architecture with which embodiments of the present invention may be practiced,  is a flow diagram illustrating a routine for automating device\/system setup based on user preferences and user presence information. As described above, embodiments of the present invention are directed to automated device\/system setup based on user presence information. When a user of one or more electronic devices or systems moves into the presence of the one or more devices or systems, detection or determination of the user's presence may be used to apply setup or settings changes to the one or more devices or systems. For purposes of illustration with respect to the description of  below, consider an example use case in which a user enters a home  where the user's presence in proximity of the home is used to make various settings changes to the user's communications devices\/systems as described herein.","The routine  begins at start operation  and proceeds to operation . At operation , user preferences are received by one or more of the communications networks , , . For example, a user may identify to each of the wireless and wireline telecommunications systems one or more callers to be associated with specialized call processing based on presence information for the user. For example, a user may provide a list of telephone directory numbers associated with a number of callers for whom the user requires specialized call processing when a call from one of the specified callers is received at the wireless and\/or wireline telephone systems directed to the user. For example, if a call is received from a particular caller, for example, the user's co-worker, and caller identification information for the incoming call is prescribed to be displayed on the user's television  via the cable\/data\/telephone network , the user may prefer that the caller identification information not be displayed on the television  when the user is not physically present near the television .","Thus, at operation , the user may pass preference information to the wireless and wireline telecommunications networks and to the cable\/TV\/data\/telephone network  such that, if presence information is detected and is passed to the communications networks\/systems indicating that the user is not physically present near the television , then incoming calls directed to a wireline telephone  in the home  should be forwarded to the user's wireless telephone  and caller identification information for the incoming calls should not be displayed on the television  to avoid use of the caller identification application associated with the television  and to avoid annoying others viewing the television  when the user for whom the call is received is not present in the proximity of the television .","Other examples of user preferences received at operation  include preferences for allowing the user to manually interact with the communications systems , ,  for incoming communications. For example, if an incoming call is directed to the user's wireless telephone, and if a caller identification information for the incoming call is displayed on the user's television , but if the user is physically located next to his\/her wireline telephone , the user may set a preference for allowing the user to selectively\/manually route calls directed to the wireless telephone to the wireline telephone via interaction with the television  through the set top box  by selecting an appropriate functionality button or control on a remote control device associated with the television . Thus, the user's preferences must be set at each of the communications systems\/networks , ,  so that appropriate call processing signaling is passed between the various networks\/systems for processing calls according to the user's preferences or manual selections.","At operation  a user enters the proximity of one or more electronic devices, for example, the electronic devices and\/or systems illustrated in the facility (e.g., home) . As should be appreciated, operation  is equally applicable to detection of the user leaving the proximity of the one or more devices. That is, the receipt of physical presence information of a particular user includes both \u201cin proximity\u201d and \u201cout of proximity\u201d information. In both cases, the operational settings or setup data of one or more electronic devices or systems may be changed. For example, just as settings for a device may be personalized for a user when the user enters the physical presence of the device, so may the settings for the device be changed to another configuration when the user leaves the physical presence of the device. At operation , presence information for the user is received via one or more presence detection or presence determination means, as described above with reference to , and as further described below with reference to operations  through .","At operation , if the user is carrying a wireless device , , for example, a wireless telephone, personal digital assistant (PDA), or wireless computer, the wireless device ,  may detect the presence of a wireless fidelity (WIFI) transmitter\/receiver for purposes of connecting with a WIFI with a hotspot for sending and receiving wireless signaling from the wireless device. According to embodiments of the present invention, when the wireless device detects a WIFI signal transmitted via a WIFI transmitter\/receiver, physical presence information associated with the wireless device may be passed through the wireless network  to the presence server  and may be stored for the user. Alternatively, physical presence information associated with the wireless device may be transmitted via an appropriate network to a target device contained in or operated in association with a facility.","At operation , the wireless presence detector  in the form of a non-WIFI wireless sensor may detect the presence of the wireless devices being carried by the user, and may likewise pass presence information for the user through the wireless network  to the presence server . As described above, a variety of other wireless presence detection means, for example, BLUETOOTH, infrared (IR), and the like may be equally utilized. In addition, as described above, such information may be passed to the presence server , or such information may be passed directly from a user-associated device, such as a carried mobile telephone, to a device or system for which operational settings or setup data may be changed based on the physical presence of the user.","At operation , one or more wireless-based positioning technologies (e.g., range detection, triangulation, trilateration, multilateration, observed time difference, time difference of arrival, angle of arrival, etc.) may be employed by the wireless network  for determining a location of a wireless device. For example, range detection may be employed by the wireless network , wherein a range from the user and his\/her wireless devices may be determined based on signal strength from the wireless device to a wireless transmission point  (e.g., wireless transmission tower) for determining whether the user and his\/her wireless devices are in prescribed physical proximity to the electronic devices contained in the facility . Presence information determined for the user via range detection may be passed through the wireless network  to the presence server .","At operation , a satellite-based geo-location receiver (e.g., GPS receiver) operated in the wireless device carried by the user may be utilized for determining global positioning satellite coordinates for the user. Such GPS coordinates may be transmitted through the wireless network  to the presence server  on a periodic basis. At the presence server , the GPS coordinates received for the wireless devices ,  may be compared with GPS coordinates of the facility . When the GPS coordinates of the wireless devices ,  carried by the user are within a prescribed proximity to the coordinates of the facility , a determination may be made at the presence server  that the user and his\/her wireless devices are now in the presence of the electronic devices contained in or operated in association with the facility .","At operation , online\/offline status of the user with respect to wireline or wireless data services (e.g., Internet connection) may be utilized to determine that the user is present in the facility . As described above with reference to , the online\/offline status of the user may be utilized by a data services provider, for example, the wireline telephone network , the wireless network  or the cable television\/data\/telephone network  for passing presence information to the server  for subsequent use.","At operation , utilization of a wireline telephone  may be utilized for passing presence information for the user from a wireline network  to the presence server . For example, if the user is identified through a password or other credentials to allow the wireline network  to determine that the present user of the wireline telephone  is the user for which presence information is of interest, the wireline network  may pass presence information for the user to the presence server .","At operation , utilization by the user of the set-top box  may allow a cable television\/data\/telephone network  to determine that the user is present in the facility . For example, selection of a particular user profile may allow the cable network  to determine that a particular user of interest is physically present in the facility , and presence information for the user may be passed to the presence server .","At operation , use of other electronic devices in the facility , for example, use of the alarm system , or use of other wireline or wireless devices by a particular user may be utilized for determining that the particular user is present in the facility . For example, a particular user may be required to enter a password or other credentials for activating, deactivating or otherwise interacting with an alarm system . Such information may be utilized for determining that the particular user is present in the facility , and such information may be passed through one or more of the networks , ,  or through a third party network, for example, a third party alarm system, to the presence server .","According to embodiments, use of an electronic device in the facility for indicating user presence may include notifying a network component (e.g., a wireless, wireline or cable services network component) of the use of the electronic device or of the use of another electronic device associated with the electronic device. That is, notification of the use of the one or more devices is passed to a network component operative to interpret the use of the electronic device or the use of another electronic device as an indication that the user is in a physical proximity of the electronic device. For example, a user's setting of channels on a set-top box may cause a notification to a cable services system that the user is in the presence of the set-top box.","At operation , presence information for a particular user detected or determined through one of the above-described means may be passed to the presence server for subsequent use. According to one embodiment, a database object may be maintained at the presence server , the configuration server , or other suitable storage location that may represent a list of \u201cinterested devices or systems\u201d that will receive physical presence information for a given user as the presence information changes.","At operation , presence information for a particular user may be passed to interested systems. For example, the presence information for one or more particular users located in the facility  may be passed to the wireline telephone network , the wireless network , or the cable television\/data\/telephone network , or other interested systems, or any other interested system responsible for managing or providing services to one or more electronic devices or systems in the facility . As should be appreciated, an interested system may be in a fixed geographical location, or may be in a variable geographic location. For example, physical presence information for a particular user may be passed to a car, wherein various settings may be applied depending on the presence of the particular user.","According to embodiments, presence information passed from the presence server  to interested systems may be passed to the systems on a push or pull basis. That is, on a periodic frequency, for example, once every ten seconds or once every five minutes, presence information may be pushed from the presence server out to each interested system that is registered with the presence server for receiving presence information for one or more particular users. Conversely, presence information may be pushed to an interested system upon detection of a change of presence information. For example, upon a user's arrival at home, an \u201cat home\u201d presence status may be pushed to his\/her home devices. Subsequent presence information may not be pushed to his\/her home devices until the next morning, when the user leaves his\/her home. Alternatively, presence information may be pulled from the presence server  by interested systems on a frequency established for each individual system. For example, the cable network  may pull presence information from the presence server for its customers\/subscribers once every five minutes. On the other hand, a wireless network  may pull presence information from the presence server  for its customers\/subscribers once every ten seconds. As should be appreciated, each individual interested system may need presence information for particular users on different frequencies depending on the services provided by the individual communications systems.","At operation , a determination is made as to presence-based settings applicable to one or more electronic devices operating in the facility . For example, if a particular user is detected as being present within the facility , all calls directed to the user's wireless telephone  may be routed to the user's wireline telephone  when the user is detected as being present in the proximity of the wireline telephone . Such an automatic routing may prevent the user from needlessly using wireless telephone usage units (for example, usage minutes) when the user is in the physical proximity of the wireline telephone . For another example, if the user is detected as being outside the proximity of the wireline telephone , all calls directed to the wireline telephone  may be automatically routed to the user at his\/her wireless telephone .","For another example, as described herein, if caller identification information is displayed on the user's television set  for incoming calls to the user's wireline telephone , and presence information detected for the user indicates the user is not in the proximity of the television set  and\/or the wireline telephone , calls may be automatically routed to the user at his\/her wireless telephone , and a display of caller identification information may be suspended so that needless use of the caller identification application associated with the television  is avoided and so that any annoyance to others viewing the television  is avoided so that caller identification information for the benefit of a user that is not present is not needlessly displayed.","At operation , presence-based settings are passed from the appropriate networks , ,  to the target devices contained in or operated in association with the facility . According to embodiments, user preferences may be stored at the backend systems of the networks , , , or may be stored at the client side at the one or more electronic devices in the facility . For example, call forwarding preferences implemented based on the user's presence at the facility  may be stored at a wireless or wireline network backend or via client side applications\/memory at local wireline and wireless telephones. For another example, user preferences that allow for a user to manually or selectively route a call to a wireless or wireline telephone based on the user's physical location relative to one or the other of the wireless or wireline telephone in association with caller identification information displayed on a user's television set  may be stored at each of the wireless and wireline networks ,  and at the cable TV\/data\/telephone networks . As should be appreciated, functionality for passing presence-based settings to the target devices may be maintained and operated in the networks , , , or functionality for processing presence-based settings changes to the target devices may be operated by client-side applications operated at the target devices at the facility  based on presence information passed to the target devices from the presence server via one or more of the networks , , .","At operation , presence-based settings are applied to the one or more target devices either from a backend application at one or more of the networks , ,  or via client-side applications operated on each of the one or more target devices based on presence information passed to the target devices. According to embodiments, presence-based settings are applied to personalize the settings or set up of the one or more electronic devices based on the user's presence in proximity of the one or more electronic devices. That is, one or more functionalities of the electronic device(s) may be personalized for the user based on one or more preferences of the user.","As should be appreciated, changes made to the operational settings or setup data for one or more target devices may be performed based on the physical presence of multiple users. For example, in a given household, two or more members of a family may be in the physical presence of the one or more target devices, and device settings associated with each of the members\/users may be applied. According to one embodiment, all settings associated with all physically present users may be applied simultaneously. For example, if one physically present user enters a user preference that all calls directed to the wireline telephone  at the user's home be directed to the user's wireless telephone , but if another user present at the same home enters a preference that all calls directed to the second user's wireless telephone  be directed to the wireline telephone , then the conflicting preferences may be resolved such that only those calls directed to the second user's wireless telephone are routed to the wireline telephone  and that such calls routed to the telephone  are not in turn routed back to the first user's wireless telephone . As should be appreciated, the various settings for various users and any hierarchical relationships between settings (e.g., parent versus child) may be stored as user profile data for the various users and may be accessed by a given device for application based on the physical presence of different users. Such data may be stored in the configuration server  or similar remote storage site, or such data may be stored on the client-side of any given interested target device or system.","At operation , manual or selective interaction with the communications systems , ,  may be allowed based on user preference and user presence information. For example, if a user is sitting next to a wireline telephone , and the user is presently viewing content on the television , a user preference may be entered by the user to allow the user to manually or selectively route calls directed to the user's wireless telephone  to the user's wireline telephone  when the user is presented with caller identification information for a call being received at the user's wireless telephone  on the user's television . That is, if caller identification information for a call coming into the user's wireless telephone  is displayed in the user's television , the user may be allowed to selectively or manually cause a forwarding of the call directed to the wireless telephone to the user's wireline telephone by pressing a functionality button or control on a remote control device associated with the television , or by selecting a similar functionality button or control on the wireline telephone . Conversely, if the user is not in the physical proximity of the wireline telephone , and if an incoming call is directed to the wireline telephone , and associated caller identification is displayed on the television , the user may be allowed to manually or selectively forward the call to the user's wireless telephone .","As should be appreciated, communications between the disparate communications systems , ,  may be affected by any suitable communications protocol operative for passing data between the communications for processing communications as described herein. For example, a call forwarding instruction passed via the television set  through a remote control device may be passed through the set top box  or other associated computing functionality functionally associated with the television  through to the cable TV\/data\/telephone network . Such information received at the cable television\/data\/telephone network  may be passed to the wireless telephone\/data network  via the IMS server  for causing a call directed to the wireless telephone  to be routed to the wireline telephone . In such a case, signaling from the wireless telephone\/data network  to the wireline telephone\/data network  through an intelligent network device or system, for example, the service control point  may be utilized for causing the call originally directed to the wireless telephone  to be forwarded to the wireline telephone . Thus, according to this example, a call originally directed to the wireless telephone  may be forwarded or routed to the wireline telephone  via a communication with the television services provider network  that ultimately corresponds or communicates with the wireless telephone\/data network  for forwarding the incoming wireless call to the wireline telephone . As should be appreciated, this is but one example of the numerous call flows that may be performed for processing incoming calls to the wireless and\/or wireline telephone calls via user preferences and user presence information.","At operation , any changes in presence information for one or more users present in or near the facility  are detected or determined. For example, if a particular user is presently in the facility , but leaves the facility , a determination that the particular user is no longer present in the  may be passed to the present server , and any settings changes applicable to the devices operated in the facility  may be made in accordance with the change in presence status for the particular user. The routine then may proceed back to operation  where physical presence information for one or more users may be detected and utilized as described herein.","As described above with reference to , one network with which embodiments of the invention may be practiced includes a cable television\/data\/telephone network .  is a simplified block diagram illustrating a cable services system (hereafter referred to as \u201cCATV\u201d) architecture that may serves as an exemplary operating environment for embodiments of the present invention.","Referring now to , digital and analog video programming, information content and interactive television services are provided via a hybrid fiber coax (HFC) network  to a television set  for consumption by a cable television\/services system customer. The functionality of the HFC network  allows for efficient bidirectional data flow between the client-side set-top box  and the server-side application server  of the present invention. Embodiments of the present invention are not limited to an HFC network , but may include other transport mediums included, but not limited to, an all fiber system, an all coax system, and an IP Ethernet-based system. According to embodiments of the present invention, the CATV system  is in the form of a distributed client-server computing system for providing video and data flow across the HFC network  between server-side services providers (e.g., cable television\/services providers) via a server-side head end  and a client-side customer via a client-side set-top box (STB) functionally connected to a customer receiving device, such as the television set .","On the client side of the CATV system , digital and analog video programming and digital and analog data are provided to the customer television set  via the set-top box (STB) . Interactive television services that allow a customer to input data to the CATV system  likewise are provided by the STB . As illustrated in , the STB  is a multipurpose computing device having a computer processor, memory and an input\/output mechanism. The input\/output mechanism receives input from server-side processes via the HFC network  and from customers via input devices such as the remote control device  and the keyboard .","Because a variety of different operating systems  may be utilized by a variety of different brands and types of set-top boxes, a middleware layer  is provided to allow a given software application to be executed by a variety of different operating systems. According to an embodiment of the present invention, the middleware layer  may include a set of application programming interfaces (API) that are exposed to client applications  and operating systems  that allow the client applications to communicate with the operating systems through common data calls understood via the API set. Referring still to , the head end  of the CATV system  is positioned on the server side of the CATV system and includes hardware and software systems responsible for originating and managing content for distributing through the HFC network  to client-side STBs  for presentation to customers via televisions . As described above, a number of services may be provided by the CATV system , including digital and analog video programming, interactive television services, telephone services, video-on-demand services, targeted advertising, and provision of information content.","The application server  is a general-purpose computing system operative to assemble and manage data sent to and received from the client-side set-top box  via the HFC network . As described above with reference to the set-top box , the application server  includes a middleware layer  for processing and preparing data from the head end of the CATV system  for receipt and use by the client-side set-top box . For example, the application server  via the middleware layer  may obtain data from third-party services  via the Internet  for transmitting to a customer through the HFC network  and the set-top box . For example, a weather report from a third-party weather service may be downloaded by the application server via the Internet . When the application server  receives the downloaded weather report, the middleware layer  may be utilized to format the weather report for receipt and use by the set-top box . According to one embodiment of the present invention, data obtained and managed by the middleware layer  of the application server  is formatted according to the Extensible Markup Language and is passed to the set-top box  through the HFC network  where the XML-formatted data may be utilized by a client application  in concert with the middleware layer , as described above. As should be appreciated by those skilled in the art, a variety of third-party services data, including news data, weather data, sports data and other information content may be obtained by the application server  via distributed computing environments such as the Internet  for provision to customers via the HFC network  and the set-top box .","According to embodiments of the present invention, the application server  obtains customer profile data from services provider data services  for preparing a customer profile that may be utilized by the set-top box  for tailoring certain content provided to the customer. According to an embodiment of the present invention, a customer profile may include communications applications provisioned on networked STBs, as well as, designations of individual STBs in a home, business or facility (e.g., \u201ckitchen STB,\u201d \u201cbedroom STB,\u201d \u201coffice STB,\u201d and the like).","As illustrated in , the services provider data services  include a number of services operated by the services provider of the CATV system  which may include data on a given customer. For example, a billing system  may include information such as a customer's name, street address, business identification number, Social Security number, credit history, and information regarding services and products subscribed to by the customer. An electronic mail system  may contain information such as electronic mail addresses, high-speed Internet access subscription information and electronic mail usage data. An authentication system  may include information such as secure user names and passwords utilized by customers for access to network services. The customer information database  may include general information about customers such as place of employment, business address, business telephone number and demographic information such as age, gender, educational level, and the like. As should be understood by those skilled in the art, the disparate data services systems , , ,  are illustrated as a collection of data services for purposes of example only. The example data services systems comprising the data services  may operate as separate data services systems, which communicate with a web services system (described below) along a number of different communication paths and according to a number of different communication protocols.","Although described herein with respect to setup changes to various electronic devices via server side and or client side applications, in alternative embodiments, the invention may be used in combination with any number of computer systems, such as in desktop environments, laptop or notebook computer systems, multiprocessor systems, micro-processor based or programmable consumer electronics, network PCs, mini computers, main frame computers and the like.
