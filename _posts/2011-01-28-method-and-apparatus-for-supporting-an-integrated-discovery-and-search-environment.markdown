{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Embodiments of the present invention relate to a graphical user interface. More specifically, embodiments of the present invention relate to a method and apparatus for supporting an integrated discovery and search environment.","Information search and retrieval systems have provided tools for finding information. Such tools provide the capability to search for data listed in directories by name, perform free-text searching, or to search using Boolean expressions in text form. These systems, however, did not account for the fact that a user performing a search may need to use more than one style or approach to effectively find the information being sought. For example, a free-text search such as those found commonly on traditional search engines may be helpful in some cases, but in other cases may not allow for the serendipitous discovery afforded by browsing through data displayed in an organized list.","In addition, many of the tools provided by the information search and retrieval systems suffered from drawbacks such as poor ease of use, lack of structure and controlled vocabulary, and difficulty in combining information from multiple facets. Furthermore, many of the tools allowed for searching of information in either a coarse-grained level or a fine-grained level of detail, but not both.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, a graphical user interface (GUI) includes a search term entry area, a hierarchical tree area, a search criteria tree area, and a search results area. Each of these components is integrated in such a manner to allow a user to iteratively discover, develop and execute a desired search objective. According to an alternate embodiment of the present invention, one or more mapping areas may be used in place of either the hierarchical tree area and\/or the search results area to display data elements or results in a different manner.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, the GUI supports complex information seeking patterns, approaches, and paradigms. The GUI facilitates the exploration and discovery of information though an iterative process. For example, the GUI allows for the mixing and matching of paradigms for searching. A user may start out with a directed free text search in the search term entry area, refine the query by editing the granularity of a given criterion, and create a Boolean search with the result and incorporate a search term discovered while browsing through a portion of a hierarchical tree in the hierarchical tree area.","In the following description, for purposes of explanation, specific nomenclature is set forth to provide a thorough understanding of embodiments of the present invention. It will be apparent to one skilled in the art that specific details in the description may not be required to practice the embodiments of the present invention. In other instances, well-known systems, devices, and components are shown in block diagram form to avoid obscuring embodiments of the present invention unnecessarily.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","110","110","110","110","120","130","135","120","140","110","140","110"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","200","110","200","120","130"]},"As shown, the computer system  includes a processor . The processor  is coupled to a CPU bus  that transmits data signals between the processor  and other components in the computer system . The computer system  includes a memory . The memory  may be a dynamic random access memory device, a static random access memory device, and\/or other memory device. The memory  may store instructions and code represented by data signals that may be executed by the processor . A bridge memory controller  is coupled to the CPU bus  and the memory . The bridge memory controller  directs data signals between the processor , the memory , and other components in the computer system  and bridges the data signals between the CPU bus , the memory , and a first IO bus .","The first IO bus  may be a single bus or a combination of multiple buses. The first IO bus  provides communication links between components in the computer system . A network controller  is coupled to the first IO bus . The network controller  may link the computer system  to a network of computers (not shown) and supports communication among the machines. A display device controller  is coupled to the first IO bus . The display device controller  allows coupling of a display device (not shown) to the computer system  and acts as an interface between the display device and the computer system .","A second  bus  may be a single bus or a combination of multiple buses. The second  bus  provides communication links between components in the computer system . A data storage device  is coupled to the second  bus . The data storage device  may be a hard disk drive, a floppy disk drive, a CD-ROM device, a flash memory device or other mass storage device. An input interface  is coupled to the second  bus . The input interface  allows coupling of an input device to the computer system  and transmits data signals from an input device to the computer system . A bus bridge  couples the first IO bus  to the second  bus . The bus bridge  operates to buffer and bridge data signals between the first IO bus  and the second  bus . It should be appreciated that computer systems having a different architecture may also be used to implement the computer system .","A GUI  may reside in memory  and be executed by the processor . The GUI  may operate to provide an integrated discovery and search environment. According to an embodiment of the present invention, the GUI includes a search term entry area operable to allow a user to enter text as a search term. The GUI also includes a hierarchical tree area operable to display data elements in a multi-level hierarchical tree structure, wherein the data elements are representative of searchable data in a database. The GUI also includes a search result area operable to display a result of a search query. The GUI also includes a search criteria tree area operable to allow a user to enter a new search query of the searchable data in response to the user's selection of one or more of the search term from the search term entry area, data elements from the hierarchical tree area, and result from the search result area, wherein the search term entry area, hierarchical tree area, search results area, and search criteria tree area are displayed together in a single window on the GUI.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","300","310","310","310"]},"The GUI  includes a hierarchical tree area . According to an embodiment of the present invention, the hierarchical tree area  displays display data elements in a multi-level hierarchical tree structure. The data elements may be representative of all or a subset of all the searchable data in a data store. The multi-level hierarchical tree structure organizes data into a plurality of levels. Each sub-level provides a more specific description of the data than the level directly above it. It should be appreciated that the multi-level hierarchical tree structure may include any number of levels greater than 1. Portions of the multi-level hierarchical tree structure may be displayed at a time where data elements on the multi-level hierarchical tree structure are selectable to expand what is displayed on the GUI and to show additional sub-levels. As described above, data elements associated with a search term entered in the search term entry area  may be highlighted to a user in response to a selection of a highlight option.","The GUI  includes a search criteria tree area . According to an embodiment of the present invention, the search criteria tree area  provides the user an area to enter search criteria for building a search query. For example, Boolean searches may be constructed in the search criteria tree area  by selecting and moving (such as dragging and dropping) data elements from the hierarchical tree area  and previously returned results from a search results area . The search criteria tree area  may operate to display the search criteria in a graphical form. According to an embodiment of the present invention, the hierarchical tree area  and search criteria tree area  may be hidden until a user selects an option to perform an advanced search.","The GUI  includes a search result area . According to an embodiment of the present invention, the search result area  displays results returned from a search query. It should be appreciated that in an alternate embodiment of the present invention, mapping areas may be used in place of the hierarchical tree area  and\/or the result area  to display data elements and results. Alternatively, other graphical or browsable tools may be used in place of the hierarchical tree area  and\/or the result area .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":"300"},"Starting in the search term entry area , a user may enter a term, a set of terms, a phrase, or a combination of terms and phrases into the search term entry area . When invoked, the criteria will be added to the search criteria tree area . This interaction is illustrated with arrow . According to an embodiment of the present invention, the search criteria tree  may or may not be visible on the GUI. Upon execution of the search query, the search results are displayed in the search results area .","From the search term entry area , a user may enter text they wish to find within the hierarchical tree structure (multi-level hierarchical tree structure) in the hierarchical tree area . When a highlight action is invoked, the hierarchical tree structure itself is searched for labels of data elements matching the text entered in the search term entry area , and the tree structure is expanded as necessary to reveal these labels. This interaction is illustrated with arrow .","The hierarchical tree structure in the hierarchical tree area  provides a browsable data set that a user can explore to find information sought. By selecting a data element on the hierarchical tree structure, a window is generated that provides additional information on the data element. The additional information may include a detailed profile of the data element. This interaction is illustrated with arrow .","Data elements from the hierarchical tree structure may be selected to be entered into the search criteria tree area  to formulate a search query. According to an embodiment of the present invention, this may be achieved by dragging the data element across the GUI from the hierarchical tree area  to the search criteria tree area . This interaction is illustrated with arrow .","The search criteria tree area  is an area on the GUI  where search queries may be formulated. In addition to selecting search terms into the search criteria tree area , search terms can be selected out to remove them as search criteria. According to one aspect of the present invention, selection may be achieved by dragging and dropping. It should be appreciated that other methods of selection may be employed. The search criteria entered into the search criteria tree  may be taken from the hierarchical tree area , search terms entered from the search term entry area , and previous results listed in the search results area . Each criterion may, in turn, be edited to further specify the level of granularity for a subsequent search query. For example, if a search term in the search criteria tree includes \u201cany relationship\u201d with an organization, an edit dialog provided by the search criteria tree area  allows a user to specify a specific \u201crelationship\u201d with the organization.","The search criteria tree area  allows Boolean search queries to be formulated by adding grouping folders which act as Boolean operators. User-friendly label such as \u201cAll of these\u201d (\u201cAND\u201d), \u201cAny of these\u201d (\u201cOR\u201d), and \u201cNot one of these\u201d (\u201cExclusion\u201d), may be used to build the search queries. Other user-friendly labels may be used to represent other Boolean functions. It should be appreciated that the Boolean operators can be nested arbitrarily deeply to enable powerful queries. According to an embodiment of the present invention, the search query constructed may be optimized by the computer system implementing the GUI  prior to executing the search. The user is given the option to view either the user constructed search query or the optimized query. The results of the executed query are displayed in search results area . This interaction is illustrated with arrow .","The GUI  includes a search results area . The search results area  is where executed query results are displayed. The results may be displayed in a grid format, a map format, or other format using a different paradigm. As stated above, results displayed in the search results area  may be selected and entered into the search criteria tree area  to formulate a new search\/refine a query. This interaction is illustrated with arrow . The search results area  may include a filter box to allow the user to enter text that is used to filter the results of the search query displayed in the search results area .","The results displayed in the search results area  may be saved and exported. A user may select a variety of formats to save the results, such as a Comma-Separated Value (CSV) file, tab-delimited (TAB) file, or other file format. This interaction is illustrated with arrow .","By selecting a result in the search results area , a window is generated that provides additional information on the result. The additional information may include, for example, a detailed profile of the result. This interaction is illustrated with arrow .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIGS. 3 and 4"],"b":["500","500","520","320","520","330","520","330","520"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIGS. 3 and 4","FIG. 6","FIGS. 3 and 4"],"b":["600","300","300","600","610","620","630","640","310","320","330","340","600","610","611","620","630","611","620","630","610","620","630","640","630"]},"The GUI  allows a user to find, discover, and browse data using multiple tools and paradigms. For example, one paradigm may include browsing, another may include serendipitous discovery, and another may be targeted free text search. The integration of various tools to support searching on the GUI  on a single window allows the user to have the flexibility to conduct a rich and thorough search.","Traditional information search and retrieval systems provide tools for finding information. These tools often do not account for the fact that the user performing the search may need to use many different styles and approaches to effectively find the information they seek. For example, a free-text search such as those found on traditional search engines may be helpful in some cases, but may not allow for the serendipitous and\/or contextual discovery afforded by browsing through hierarchical tree structures. Finding information may be more closely related to an iterative process in which users refine their notion of what they are looking for even as they refine the actual criteria to enable the acquisition of the information sought. It is likely that elements of information returned as a list of results might become part of the criteria, as well, for example. This may be necessary since the information being sought may have complex relationships to other pieces of information. Relationships may form a hierarchy in which one might want to search at a coarse-grained level of abstraction or a very fine-grained level of detail. Often, it is a combination of the coarse-grained and fine-grained level that provides the most effective results. Embodiments of the GUI of the present invention provide an integrated discovery and search environment in which a user is able to make use of a mix of styles, approaches and strategies to discover and search. This is an improvement over particular implementations of traditional search engines which often require the user to seek information in the manner deemed appropriate by the system developers.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["700","700","710","740"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["711","710","712"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["700","740"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["700","713","720","730","700","730"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 11","b":["700","730","731","731"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 12","b":["700","741"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 13","b":["700","1310"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 14","b":["700","730","732"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 15","b":["700","1510","1520","720","730"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 16","b":["700","1510","730","740"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 17","b":["700","742","740","740"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 18","b":["700","1810","1820","720","730"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 19","b":["700","1810","730","740"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 20","b":["700","1810","730","2010","1810"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 21","b":["700","2010"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 22","b":["700","740"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 23","b":["700","711","710","714","2310","720"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIG. 24","b":["700","720","730"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 25","b":["700","2510","730","2520","2510"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIG. 26","b":["700","2520"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 27","b":["700","740","2510","730"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":"FIG. 28","b":["700","2810","730","2820","2810"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":"FIG. 29","b":["700","2810"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIG. 30","b":["700","730","3010","3010"],"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":["1) An \u201cAll of these\u201d (equivalent to an \u201cAND\u201d) requiring the resulting profile have an \u201cAcademic Professional\u201d relationship to the University of Illinois or any entity below the University of Illinois in the hierarchy and some relationship to the Beckman Institute\n        \n        ","2) Any familiarity with the topic of \u201cConstruction\u201d or subordinate topics\n        \n        ","3) Any familiarity with the topic of \u201cHealth Care and Social Assistance\u201d or topics subordinate to it."]}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0069"},"figref":"FIG. 31","b":["700","730","3110","3110"]},"The criteria read as follows:","A profile matching any of the following three criteria should be returned:\n\n","The set of complex, nested criteria formulated in the search query  illustrates both the flexibility and robustness of the searching function supported by the search criteria tree area .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0088"},"figref":"FIG. 32","b":["700","740","3210","730","3201","3204","730","3201","3204","730"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0089"},"figref":"FIG. 33","b":["740","730"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0090"},"figref":"FIG. 34","b":["700","3201","3204","3410","730","740","3410"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0091"},"figref":"FIG. 35","b":["700","3510","3510"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0092"},"figref":"FIG. 36","b":["3600","3610"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0093"},"figref":"FIG. 37","b":["3600","3610","3610"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0074","num":"0094"},"figref":"FIG. 38","b":["3800","3800","3810","3800","3820"]},"In this example, the user is editing the \u201cRelated Subjects\u201d tab of a person's profile.
