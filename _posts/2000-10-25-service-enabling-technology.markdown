{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present invention relates to control of components of devices and, more particularly, the present invention enables interaction of data network services with the components.","In a network of computing devices, many schemes of presenting applications to users of network connected devices may exist. Two common schemes are called \u201chosted\u201d and \u201cdistributed\u201d. In a hosted computing scheme, a user at a \u201cterminal\u201d computer may run applications and store data on a \u201cmainframe\u201d computer, processor, or processor array, whereas, in distributed computing, the running of various applications and storing of data is spread out among many personal workstations or office computers. In a popular version of distributed computing, the workstation computer provides some processing and storage capabilities while requesting further processing and storage capabilities from other \u201cserver\u201d computers, as required.","The economics of simple database access (e.g. for car parts, airline tickets, hotel bookings, car rentals) have resulted in a continued and substantial presence of mainframe computer infrastructure (hosted computing) in commercial applications.","Distributed computing gained popularity in the 1980's as networking costs associated with hosted computing, in the form of high-density and high-demand Virtual Machine deployments, grew and powerful, low cost, stand-alone computers became available that outpaced mainframe processing capability. Commercial applications, where bandwidth and processor demand at the end user device remained low, retained their mainframe architectures and commensurate lower maintenance complexity. With the advent of the World Wide Web, and ever decreasing costs of networking, many operators have started to question the efficacy of the distributed model of provisioning powerful, but maintenance intensive equipment at the personal workstation.","As existing distributed computing schemes, relating to user applications and commensurate maintenance applications (security, backup, upgrade), become less competitive with hosted computing schemes due to the falling costs of bandwidth and connectivity, a solution resembling the hosted computing scheme may return to prominence. As the hosted computing scheme returns to prominence, a need will exist for the provision of data network services to network connected device components under control of a host computing device.","A network intelligence, executing on one or more host computing devices, provides stateless elemental device control to a plurality of device components, some of which may be network-connected. Selected ones of the device components may be logically associated with one another as an aggregate logical device and the state of each associated component may be maintained at the network intelligence in a logical model of the aggregate logical device. Service adapters in the network intelligence may provide access to network-based services or provide stand-alone services through these logically associated device components by representing the components to the services as a single, aggregated whole. Service adaptation logic is contained in the service adapters and makes use of the unified logical model of the aggregate logical device presented by lower software layers.","Advantageously, a packet network between the components and the network intelligence can allow a flexible logical association of the components to each other wherever the components may be on the network. Thus, the present invention allows physically or functionally unconnected components to be aggregated in the network intelligence into a logical whole. As well, one or more data network service adapters may be executed by the network intelligence to provide access to network-based services, or provide stand-alone services, to the logically associated, network-connected components. Due to the use, by these data network service adapters, of a logical device model maintained in the network intelligence, the service adaptation logic need not be aware of the specific physical components involved. The state of this device model may be projected to components of one or more physical devices. Although different device components may be physically integrated, the components may not necessarily be logically associated except at the network intelligence, or different components of the same physical device my be logically associated with different logical device models at the network intelligence.","In accordance with an aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of providing device control to at least one device component, the device control enabling interaction of a data network service with the at least one device component. The method includes communicating with the at least one device component, logically associating a selection of the at least one device component in an aggregate logical device, maintaining a logical model of the aggregate logical device and providing access to the data network service by representing the selection of the at least one device component to the data network service as the aggregate logical device. In another aspect of the present invention, a network intelligence is provided for carrying out this method. In a further aspect of the present invention, there is provided a software medium that permits a general purpose computer to carry out this method.","In accordance with a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of sending a message from a device component to a server of data network services including receiving an encapsulated message at the device component, de-encapsulating the encapsulated message to result in a message destined for the server and sending the message to the server. Advantageously, a device component that performs this method is not required to be aware of the meaning of the message.","In accordance with a further aspect of the present invention there is provided, at a device component, a method of receiving a message from a server of data network services including receiving the message, encapsulating the message to result in an encapsulated message and sending the encapsulated message to an interpreter of the message. Advantageously, a device component that performs this method is not required to be aware of the meaning of the message.","In accordance with still another aspect of the present invention there is provided a communication system including a plurality of devices connected to a data network and a network intelligence connected to the data network for providing device control to the plurality of devices and, where the data network is also connected to a data network service, for providing access to the data network service by representing selected ones of the plurality of devices to the data network service as an aggregate logical device.","In accordance with yet another aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of providing device control to at least one device component, the device control enabling interaction of a stand-alone service with the at least one device component. The method includes communicating with the at least one device component, logically associating a selection of the at least one device component in an aggregate logical device, maintaining a logical model of the aggregate logical device and providing access to the stand-alone service by representing the selection of the at least one device component to the stand-alone service as the aggregate logical device.","Other aspects and features of the present invention will become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art upon review of the following description of specific embodiments of the invention in conjunction with the accompanying figures.","Illustrated in  is a network system  that may be employed by a user at a stationary workstation  or a mobile workstation  to access various data network services provided over a data network . Such services may include, for example, information from the World Wide Web provided by a Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) server , electronic messages (voice, fax, e-mail, video, etc.) from a messaging server , directory information (telephone directory numbers, e-mail addresses, etc.) from a directory server  and collaborative conferencing from a whiteboard server . A network intelligence , including a processor  and a memory , may control the presentation of these data network services to the stationary workstation  or the mobile workstation . Although the network intelligence  is shown in a centralized form, a distributed form wherein the processor  is, in fact, a plurality of processors is also contemplated. The processor  may be loaded with service enabling software for executing a method exemplary of this invention from a software medium . Software medium  may be a disk, a tape, a chip or a random access memory containing a file downloaded from a remote source. The stationary workstation  includes a range of input and output devices including, for example, a display element , a keyboard , a \u201cstationary\u201d headset  and a mouse . The mobile workstation  also includes a range of input and output devices, in particular, a handheld computing device  and a \u201cmobile\u201d headset . The mobile headset  may include both a microphone and at least one speaker or earphone. Both the stationary workstation  and the mobile workstation  may include functional devices that allocate a subset of their resources to execute simple behavior such that a given functional device appears, to the network intelligence , as a component of an aggregate device. The data network  may include both a private data network and a public data network. The private data network may be in the nature of a local area network (LAN), such as one employing the Ethernet protocol, while the public data network may be a wide area network (WAN) such as the Internet.","In overview, through interaction with components of an \u201caggregate device\u201d (e.g., the stationary workstation , the mobile workstation ), a user causes messages to be sent from the components of the device to the network intelligence . The network intelligence maintains a logical model of the workstation wherein the state of each component of the workstation is maintained. It may be that components that are not associated with each other physically are associated with each other logically in the network intelligence , or it may also be that components that are associated with each other physically are logically associated with different logical models maintained by the network intelligence . Due to this logical aggregation of components at network intelligence , the workstation may generically be referred to as an aggregate device. As well as associating components in a logical model of an aggregate device, the network intelligence  may also associate one or more service adapters with particular data network services that may be presented to the user of the workstation to which a particular logical model corresponds. The messages received by the network intelligence  from the workstation components represent changes in state of one or more of the workstation components and may result in generation of a request to be sent to a server. This request originates at the service adapter associated with the server to which the request is to be sent.","The network intelligence  may represent the aggregate device to a server, that is, a request may be sent to the server from the network intelligence  on behalf of the aggregate device. A response to the request is then sent from the server to the network intelligence  where the response is interpreted by the service adapter associated with that service. Based on this interpretation, the states of the components in the logical model of the workstation may be changed and messages may be forwarded to the aggregate device to correspondingly alter the state of the actual components. In some instances, like real-time communication, the network intelligence  may encapsulate server requests and send the encapsulated request to a component of the workstation for forwarding to the server. In this latter method, the server request appears, to the server, to have originated at the component of the workstation. Yet, the component is not required to have any knowledge of the purpose or the meaning of the server request.","Turning to , elements of the network intelligence  are in evidence. A network interface  allows connection of the network intelligence  to the data network  () and communicates with a medium access controller (MAC) . A protocol processor  may receive packets from the MAC  and pass messages, extracted from the packets, to a message bus . An elemental control message router  may communicate with aggregate device emulators A, B, C, D and an aggregate device emulator manager . The aggregate device emulator manager  also communicates with the aggregate device emulators A, B, C, D. Messages may be passed by any one of the aggregate device emulators A, B, C, D to the message bus  via an elemental control message formatter . A terminal boot server and an associated operations, administration and maintenance (OA&M) manager  may be also included in the network intelligence  and connected for communication with both the aggregate device emulator manager  and, via the message bus , etc., the data network  ().","Illustrated in  are elements of a particular aggregate device emulator A associated with the stationary workstation  (). Included is an elemental control message driver for each of the components of the aggregate device for which the stationary workstation aggregate device emulator A is providing control. In particular, included in the stationary workstation aggregate device emulator A are an elemental control message driver A for the display  (), an elemental control message driver B for the keyboard  (), an elemental control message driver C for the stationary headset  () and an elemental control message driver D for the mouse  (). Each of these elemental control message drivers A, B, C, D provides this control through communication with the elemental control message router  () and the elemental control message formatter  (). A resource context manager  receives input from the aggregate device emulator manager  () and exchanges communication with the elemental control message drivers A, B, C, D and a service adapter . An example service adapter is a HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) client application (i.e., an Internet browser). As well as communicating with the resource context manager , the service adapter  may communicate with the server with which it is associated over the data network  () via the protocol processor  ().",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["102","104","122","122","108","302","106","202","204","206","214","208","108","302","110","302","111","302","112","302","216","122","102","107","304"]},"For operation, a messaging format is required to allow the network intelligence  to monitor the components of the stationary workstation  and, in reverse, to allow the network intelligence  to provide device control to the components of the stationary workstation . One messaging format useful in such an application is called Stimulus messaging. Stimulus messaging, in the context of the present invention, refers, in the Server-to-Device case, to messaging where a stimulus message maps to a control of a component of the device. For a stimulus telephone, example components include an indicator lamp (the state of which may be controlled) and a display (the contents of which may be controlled), where the contents may be textual if the display is alphanumeric or images if the display is graphic. In the Device-to-Server case, stimulus messaging refers to a mapping of actions, such as key presses, to stimulus messages. These stimulus messages are exchanged in accordance with an elemental control protocol. One suitable elemental control protocol is detailed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/307,356 titled \u201cTelephony And Data Network Services At A Telephone\u201d, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. Another suitable elemental control protocol is the Megaco Protocol. From the Scope of Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Request for Comments (RFC) 2885, \u201cMegaco Protocol version 0.8,\u201d hereby incorporated herein by reference:\n\n","A Device-to-Server stimulus message typically includes an indication of an event and one or more arguments, where each argument provides detail related to the event, while a Server-to-Device stimulus message typically includes an instruction and one or more arguments on which the instruction may be performed. A typical stimulus message further includes an indication of the origin and the destination of the message. A response message may or may not be sent in the opposite direction indicating success (or failure) in completing the instruction, or a successful (or failed) receipt of the event.","In view of , an Internet browsing session may be described in accordance with the present invention. Typically, an HTTP client application would run on a processor which would send requests to the HTTP server  in response to input received from input devices (mouse, keyboard) associated with the processor. Further, the response received from the HTTP server  in response to the request would then be interpreted by the service adapter  (i.e., the Internet browser application) and output on output devices (display, printer) associated with the processor. In accordance with the present invention, the processor  () of the network intelligence  acts as the processor associated with input and output devices at a workstation remote from the network intelligence . In particular, a logical model of the stationary workstation  is maintained in the network intelligence . More specifically, the state of each of the display , the keyboard , the stationary headset  and the mouse  is maintained by the stationary workstation aggregate device emulator A. This logical association of devices is maintained at the resource context manager  and used for communicating with the service adapter . In overview, then, the network intelligence  communicates with the components of the stationary workstation  and, using the stationary workstation aggregate device emulator A, represents the stationary workstation  to the HTTP server .","If it is considered that an Internet browsing session is already underway at the stationary workstation , then a HyperText Markup Language (HTML) page is already part of a presentation on the display . Movement of the mouse  causes movement of a pointer on the display . Specifically, movements of the mouse  are sent over data network  to the network intelligence  () as stimulus messages. These stimulus messages are received by the mouse elemental control message driver D and indications of the mouse movement are passed to the resource context manager . At the resource context manager , these changes in state (movements) of the mouse  are monitored and used to update the state of the display , i.e., the location of the pointer, in the logical model. The new state of the display  is then passed to the display elemental control message driver A where stimulus messages representative of the new state are generated and sent to the display . Alternatively, the mouse  and the display  may be physically connected and act as a single device. In this alternative, the display  would update the position of the pointer based on movements of the mouse  directly, i.e., without the intervention of the network intelligence . Such a single device may be triggered to send a stimulus message to the network intelligence representative of a mouse click event. The stimulus message would include the coordinates of the pointer at the time of the mouse click event.","In some cases, a single physical device may be represented to the resource context manager  as multiple logical device elements. For instance, a touch screen (such as those in use in Palm\u2122 devices marketed by Palm Inc., of Santa Clara, Calif., and other personal digital assistants) may be used for presenting output to a user and receiving input from a user. Each of the two functions of this single physical device would be represented to the resource context manager  as a separate logical device element, for example, a display (output device) and a touch screen (input device), where an elemental control message driver would exist in the network intelligence for each device.","Consider that movements of the mouse  have resulted in the pointer being positioned, as shown on the display , over a hyperlink that identifies, say, the HTTP server  and directory information specifying a particular HTML file by location on the HTTP server . Upon an event, such as the clicking of a button on the mouse , stimulus messages representative of the event are sent to the mouse elemental control message driver D. The event is then indicated by the mouse elemental control message driver D to the resource context manager , which passes an indication of the event to the service adapter . The service adapter , as mentioned hereinbefore, is an HTTP client application and is therefore associated with HTTP services such as those provided by the HTTP server . Receipt of the indication of the event by the HTTP service adapter  triggers interpretation of the indication and generation, based on the interpretation, of a request for the particular HTML file. The HTTP service adapter  then sends the request to the HTTP server .","Upon receiving the request, the HTTP server  responds by sending the particular HTML file to the network intelligence  where the file is received, indirectly, by the HTTP service adapter , which interprets the HTML code and sends data objects to the resource context manager . Typical of these data objects would be data objects representative of text or images, although the data objects may be representative of streaming media such as audio or video. In the case of text or images, the data objects would include drawing instructions to be interpreted by an application programming interface (API) of the resource context manager  for updating the state of the display . The resource context manager  then changes the state of the logical model of the aggregate device that includes the display  and communicates this change to the display elemental control message driver A. The display elemental control message driver A translates the change into stimulus messages and these messages are sent to the actual display element . At the display , the stimulus messages are received and the presentation on the display  is updated.","Like a typical browser application, the service adapter  may include interpretation capability beyond that of HTML code. For instance, the service adapter  may have a capability to execute a Java\u2122 virtual machine or interpret Extensible Markup Language (XML), and may have a capability to support plug-ins that enable new functionality to be added, as is known in the context of Netscape Navigator\u2122.","Components of a given aggregate device may have a limited capability for handling media. It is the task of the network intelligence  to orchestrate delivery of media to a compatible device component. An audio input component of a first aggregate device may, for example, be connected to an audio output component of a second aggregate device in response to commands processed by a service adapter and presented to an aggregate device emulator (an example of this is basic peer-to-peer media streaming). To achieve this in a more general context, two conditions should be met. In the first condition, there is a requirement that the command protocol between the service adapter and a server associated with the service adapter allows for direction of the flow of data objects or media to addresses other than those of the server and the service adapter. In the second condition, there is a requirement that the flow of data objects or media is compatible with the device component. SIP and the Megaco Protocol are examples of control protocols that meet the first condition. The existing HTML protocol does not meet the first condition. The second condition can be met by enabling compatibility of an aggregate device component with a specific media format by providing a processing algorithm for the specific media format, for instance, by dynamically downloading the processing algorithm. The second condition can also be met by processing the flow at some intermediate point to transform its format into a different format compatible with the device component in question.","In the case where the first condition is not met, media processing must take place at the network intelligence . For instance, an audio output component may have a capability for handling audio in Adaptive Differential Pulse Code Modulation (ADPCM) format. Digital audio from a data network service arriving at the network intelligence  may be translated from the format in which the audio arrives at the network intelligence  (for example, MPEG-1 Audio Layer-3 or RealAudio\u2122) to the format understood by the audio output component, which, in the example case above, is ADPCM. Similarly, images arriving at the network intelligence  may be translated from the format in which the images arrive (such as JPEG or GIF) to a format understood by a display component (such as BMP).","Where the first condition is met, the translation can take place somewhere other than the network intelligence , under control of the relevant service adapter, in which case the flow of data objects or media can be routed to the device component without passing through the network intelligence . This translation elsewhere than the network intelligence  may also be performed on a combination of media streams, and the retransmission of the combination, as would typically be the case in a conferencing application.","The example illustrated in  may be extended as illustrated in , wherein a second service adapter  is associated with the stationary workstation aggregate device emulator A. There exist many ways in which a new service adapter may be installed and configured in a network intelligence and associated with an aggregate device emulator. The second service adapter  provides additional capabilities to the stationary workstation , for example, messaging services from the messaging server . Multiple instances of service adapting applications may run on the network intelligence  and, as such, the resource context manager  takes on the additional role of logically associating particular instances of these applications (i.e., the service adapters , ) with a logical model of a single aggregate device (i.e., the logical model of the stationary workstation ). In the  example, a user may have two applications visible on the display , such as an Internet browsing application and an e-mail sending\/receiving application. Further, the user may select one of the applications as the active application according to a set of visibility rules. Alternatively, only one of these applications may be visible at one time. A further role of the resource context manager , then, is to maintain the state of each of the components of the stationary workstation  in relation to both applications and enforce the required visibility rules necessary to share the components with both applications. The visibility rules may not be known to the individual service adapters , .","In a further example, presented in conjunction with , the aggregate device emulator B is associated with the mobile workstation . Although, in , the mobile workstation  is shown as comprising two components, namely the handheld computing device  and the mobile headset , from the perspective of the network intelligence , and more particularly the mobile workstation aggregate device emulator B, the logical model of the mobile workstation  comprises three components, namely a handheld display , a handheld input device  and the mobile headset . Where the handheld computing device  is, for example, a Palm\u2122 device, the handheld input device  may be an integral device such as a touch screen or a peripheral device such as a keyboard. The mobile workstation aggregate device emulator B, as shown, includes a resource context manager  in communication with, for example, an HTTP service adapter  that is associated with the HTTP server  and a messaging service adapter  that is associated with the messaging server . The resource context manager  is also in communication with an elemental control message driver A that is associated with the handheld display , an elemental control message driver B that is associated with the handheld input device  and an elemental control message driver C that is associated with the mobile headset . As in the case of a user at the stationary workstation , presentation to a user at the mobile workstation  of data network services from the HTTP server  and the messaging server  may be arbitrated by the resource context manager .","It is notable that, because only the logical model of the mobile workstation  is presented to the service adapters ,  by the aggregate device emulator B, the service adapters ,  may be unaware of the different physical devices actually used to present the service to the user at the mobile workstation . Therefore, the service adaptation logic in this example may be identical to the logic used in the previous or other examples. As well, the components in use at a particular time by a particular user of the services in question may change without affecting the service adaptation logic in use at the corresponding service adapters.","It is also notable that, although the handheld computing device  includes a handheld processor , from the perspective of the mobile workstation aggregate device emulator B the mobile workstation  includes only stimulus devices and thus is incapable of running applications. It may be that a user of the mobile workstation  is interested in utilizing applications that run on the handheld processor  and, as such, an architecture is presented in  that allows the user to utilize these applications. With the addition of a third service adapter , specifically for communicating with handheld processor , the capabilities of a typical handheld computing device may be provided by the network intelligence  to a user of the handheld computing device . For instance, if a user normally maintains an address book on the handheld computing device , the third service adapter  may be an address book client application that allows the user to query the handheld processor  to retrieve addresses and\/or phone numbers of contacts that are stored in a memory (not shown) of the handheld computing device .","Although the user of the handheld computing device  may have, for example, an extensive address book maintained by an application executed on the handheld processor , there may be instances in which a larger directory is required. A protocol such as the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) may be used to query the directory server  for specific entries. If a user is to have access to the directory server , the network intelligence  will need a fourth service adapter  as shown in . Since the actions of the directory query service adapters ,  are related, the two service adapters ,  may be combined in a compound directory service adapter . The compound directory service adapter  may receive an indication of a directory query from the mobile workstation aggregate device emulator B and, either in series or parallel, query each of the handheld processor  and the directory server .","Address information resulting from such queries may be received by the compound directory service adapter  and interpreted by the appropriate one of the two service adapters , . This interpretation may include combining the address information into a single address list and generating presentation instructions. Data objects representative of these presentation instructions are then passed to the resource context manager . Stimulus messages controlling the handheld display  are then sent from the handheld display elemental control message driver A to the handheld display  where the messages are processed and the display updated to present the combined list.","If the mobile headset  has a connection to the data network  () which is separate from the connection maintained between the handheld computing device  and the data network , the user of the mobile headset  could be physically distant from the handheld computing device  and yet still perform a directory query of the address book maintained at the handheld computing device . It is also possible under these conditions for the handheld display  to be updated remotely, for example, as a result of user actions or service interactions, even though the handheld computing device  (that includes the handheld display ) is physically distant from the user. It should be readily apparent from this example that these same principals can be applied to allow any physical device component of the aggregate device model to be geographically distributed arbitrarily across the data network, and that end-user devices containing information or applications utilized by the service adapters may also be distributed arbitrarily across the data network.","Further, it is also possible for the headset message driver C of the mobile workstation aggregate device emulator B to be designed, for example, to accept speech input, implementing speech recognition internally to headset message driver C, and representing the speech input from the user as a different logical input device type, through the resource context manager  to the compound directory service adapter . For example, voice commands may be spoken by the user and interpreted by the headset message driver C as display movement commands (e.g., \u201cup\u201d, \u201cleft\u201d, \u201cselect\u201d). The headset message driver C may thus represent the mobile headset , to the resource context manager , as a logical pointing device. The resource context manager  may then incorporate this logical pointing device into the logical aggregate device model it maintains and present this to the compound directory service adapter  and any other service adapters using the mobile workstation aggregate device emulator B. Thus, service adaptation logic in a given service adapter may be able to make use of a logical device element (\u201cpointing device\u201d) that is different from the physical device component (\u201cmicrophone\u201d). The service adaptation logic may not be aware of these differences between logical and physical representation.","The illustration of  is presented to reiterate that the network intelligence  may run multiple instances of aggregate device emulators, each with elemental control message drivers, resource context managers and associated service adapters. For instance, the network intelligence  may provide, through the stationary workstation aggregate device emulator A, HTTP services from HTTP server  to the stationary workstation  operated by a user X and, through the mobile workstation aggregate device emulator B, directory services from the LDAP server  to the mobile workstation  operated by a user Y. Notably, the messaging service adapter  associated with the stationary workstation aggregate device emulator A and the messaging service adapter  associated with the mobile workstation aggregate device emulator B provide access to the messaging server  to both user X and user Y. Further, due to the logical device model representation by the respective aggregate device emulators A, B, the service adapters ,  may be unaware of the components used by user X and user Y, and therefore the service adaptation logic in use at each of the service adapters ,  may be identical.","The network intelligence  running multiple instances of aggregate device emulators  may be serving multiple users or multiple \u201cviews\u201d of aggregate devices available to a single user.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0063"},"figref":["FIG. 10A","FIG. 10A"],"b":["104","128","128","210","210","1011","1011","128","128","1011","1011","1011","1011"]},"In , an alternative network intelligence architecture is presented for providing collaborative data services from the exemplary whiteboard server . The aggregate device emulator C logically associates all of the components available to user X (at stationary workstation ) and all of the components available to user Y (at mobile workstation ) in a single logical model of a combined user device . The logical model is then presented to a multi-user whiteboard service adapter C. The combined aggregate device emulator C includes an elemental control message driver for each of the devices included in the combined user device  and a resource context manager . Specifically, an elemental control message driver A is associated with the display , an elemental control message driver B is associated with the keyboard , an elemental control message driver C is associated with the stationary headset , an elemental control message driver D is associated with the mouse , an elemental control message driver E is associated with the handheld display , an elemental control message driver F is associated with the handheld input device  and an elemental control message driver G is associated with the mobile headset .","Input, say from the keyboard , may be received by the keyboard elemental control message driver B and passed to the resource context manager  from which the input is passed to the multi-user whiteboard service adapter C. The input is then interpreted by the multi-user whiteboard service adapter C and messages representative of the input are sent to the whiteboard server  where they may be interpreted as an update to the shared whiteboard. These updates are then communicated back from the whiteboard server  to the network intelligence . The multi-user whiteboard service adapter C interprets the updates and sends display update commands to the resource context manager , which alters a logical model of the shared whiteboard and forwards the changes to the display  and the handheld display  via respective elemental control message drivers A, E. Thus, the changes may be observed by user X on the display  and by user Y on the handheld display . Advantageously, the resource context manager  need only maintain the state of a single display in the logical model of the combined user device  while communicating changes in that logical display to both the display  and the handheld display  via the respective elemental control message drivers A, E. The multi-user whiteboard service adapter C may represent input from input devices associated with the different users as originating from different functional devices, even though a common logical model is maintained for the combined user device .","Thus far, description of the present invention has concentrated on the functional interaction between aggregate device components, the network intelligence  and various servers. It has been observed that the workstation components are typically represented as \u201cdumb\u201d devices (the display , the keyboard , the stationary headset , the mouse ) but may be somewhat intelligent, as in the case of the handheld computing device . Further, preferred messaging types, namely the known stimulus messaging scheme and the Megaco Protocol, have been proposed. Although the components of the stationary workstation  are shown as individually connected to the data network , and such \u201cnetwork ready\u201d devices may exist, common device components may require an intermediate device to allow the present invention to operate properly.","Turning to , a frame buffer processor  is provided between the data network  and the display  of the stationary workstation . Such devices as the frame buffer processor  are known. In the exemplary stimulus messaging case, stimulus messaging arrives at the frame buffer processor  from the network intelligence  () and is converted to RGB signals for controlling the state of the display . The keyboard  may be a Universal Serial Bus (USB) device. As such, there is a requirement for an apparatus to allow the connection of a USB device to the data network . Such an apparatus is described by McAlear, et al, in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/386,215, \u201cUSB Networking on a Multiple Access Transmission Medium,\u201d hereby incorporated herein by reference. If the data network  includes an Ethernet LAN, a USB\/Ethernet interface  may be provided in accordance with the McAlear patent application. The USB\/Ethernet interface  would receive stimulus messaging in Ethernet packets and route stimulus messages from the keyboard  to the network intelligence  () over the data network .","It may be that a component of the stationary workstation , such as the mouse , is \u201cEthernet-ready,\u201d which is to say that the component is addressable and can send and receive Ethernet packets. If the mouse  is Ethernet-ready, then an interface such as the USB\/Ethernet interface  may not be necessary and the mouse  may be directly connected to the data network  for exchanging stimulus messages with the network intelligence  ().","As will be appreciated, access to the data network  need not be wireline. The stationary headset  is shown in  as exchanging stimulus messages as wireless packets (an example being IP over IEEE 802.11) with a network RF transceiver . Such devices as the network RF transceiver  are known and may use a technology such as Bluetooth\u2122.  illustrates all of the components of the mobile workstation  accessing the data network  wirelessly using radio frequency (RF) signals. Wireless communication need not imply RF communication as infra red (for example, using the IrDA Protocol) communication is similarly useful. A network access device  for wirelessly transmitting and receiving network traffic and routing stimulus messaging to appropriate devices is described in further detail in conjunction with .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0070"},"figref":["FIG. 13A","FIG. 12","FIG. 12","FIG. 1"],"b":["1204","1204","116","1302","1102","1302","1306","1306","116","118","106"]},"Network traffic destined for the mobile headset  is directed to a series of functions specifically for communication with the mobile headset . Where the communication with the mobile headset  employs the Internet Protocol for transporting both control and media streams, IP packets are processed by an IP stack  as known. Exemplary protocols for such communication include the Real Time Protocol (RTP) for transporting media streams in IP packets and the Megaco Protocol for transporting control information in IP packets.","The IP stack  is in communication with an application processor  which acts to translate the data received from the IP stack  to audio signals and vice versa. The application processor  may be loaded with digital audio communication software from a software medium , which could be a disk, a tape, a chip or a random access memory containing a file downloaded from a remote source. As the data network  may not always be available to the application processor , it is preferable that the application processor  be capable of selectively addressing packets to either the bus interface  or the NAD RF transceiver . Similarly, it is preferable that the MUX  be capable of routing traffic from the application processor  to the handheld computing device  via the bus interface . Audio signals are exchanged between the application processor  and an audio interface . The audio interface  may include, for example, a 1\/32\u2033 jack for a combination earphone and microphone unit (the mobile headset ). Such jacks are commonly found on cordless telephones and cellular telephones.","Network traffic destined for the handheld computing device  is directed by the MUX  to a bus interface  which is in communication with the handheld computing device . Specifically, the bus interface  serves to distinguish between stimulus messaging to or from the stimulus components of the handheld computing device , namely the handheld display  () and the handheld input device  (), and the network traffic to or from the handheld processor  ().","An alternative network access device B is illustrated in  and designed to connect to the data network  () over an Ethernet link. A physical network interface (PHY)  is provided to send and receive over this Ethernet link. PHY  connects to a medium access controller (MAC)  which subsequently connects to the MUX . The remaining function of the alternative network access device B is described above in conjunction with the description of the network access device A.","As described above, stimulus components as part of an aggregate device may have a media handling capability. These stimulus components may also have a capability to communicate directly with other network connected devices, given enough instruction from the network intelligence . A stimulus device or an aggregate device, under control of the network intelligence , may thus present itself to a data network server as a device with inherent intelligence, yet not contain that intelligence itself, rather acting as a proxy for the network intelligence .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0076","num":"0076"},"figref":"FIG. 14","b":["1400","1402","1406","1406","1404","1428","1402","1404","1408","1402","1410","1428","1412"]},"As shown in the exemplary telephone layout of , typical components of the stimulus telephone station apparatus A include a base station  and a handset . More particularly, the handset  includes a speaker  and a microphone . The connection between the base station  and the handset  may be wireline as shown or wireless as known. The base station  provides: a network interface  for connecting to the data network  of ; a stimulus messaging and bearer channel processor  that, in this example, connects to a display , a keypad  and a control wheel ; a codec ; and a handset interface  for connecting the base station  to the handset . The control wheel  is a stimulus component allowing user control of the display .","In , the exemplary network intelligence  maintains a logical model for one or many stimulus telephone station apparatus such as the stimulus telephone station apparatus A. Using this approach, the functional state of the stimulus telephone station apparatus A is controlled by the network intelligence , and stimulus messaging is used to pass information and control between the network intelligence  and the stimulus telephone station apparatus A. From the point of view of the network intelligence , the stimulus telephone station apparatus A is merely an aggregation of stimulus devices. The network intelligence  preferably includes elemental control message drivers (not shown) for each of the stimulus components (namely, in this example, the keypad , the display , the wheel  and the handset ) that make up a user interface for the stimulus telephone station apparatus A.","Additionally, the exemplary network intelligence  allows installable service adapters, for example, the IP telephony service adapter , to provide additional services or capabilities to be projected onto the stimulus telephone station apparatus A. The installable service adapters use information about the state of the user interface, as maintained by network intelligence , and communicate at a functional level with a compatible functional server located somewhere in the data network , for example the IP telephony server . This communication at a functional level may, for example, make use of a protocol specified by ITU-T Recommendation H.323, \u201cPacket-Based Multimedia Communication Systems,\u201d the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference, the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) (discussed in IETF RFC 2543 and incorporated herein by reference), the Megaco Protocol (already discussed herein), or the Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP, Version 1.0 of which is described in IETF RFC 2705 and incorporated herein by reference). Using this approach, the stimulus telephone station apparatus A appears to the IP telephony server  as a functional device. Based on the above, it should be obvious to a person skilled in the art that the network intelligence  could be designed to allow multiple service adapters to be installed and that these service adapters could be designed to communicate with each other, either directly or through the resource context manager of the aggregate device emulator , to provide visibility rules that would allow the stimulus telephone station apparatus A to be shared with all of the associated servers located in data network . By providing these capabilities, the network intelligence  allows the stimulus telephone station apparatus A to appear as a different functional device by simply replacing one service adapter with another service adapter that provides a different functional messaging interface.","Although, as mentioned above, the service adapters may communicate with each other, it should be apparent to a person skilled in the art that, in some cases, service adapters may communicate only indirectly via the resource context manager and thus be unaware of each other. It should also be apparent that although telephony services are used extensively for examples herein, the present invention may provide access to data network services that do not relate to telephony.","Another example of the operation of the present invention may be considered in view of . In this example, an alternate method of communication is employed at the functional messaging level. Instead of having all functional messages sent from the network intelligence  to the server on behalf of the aggregate device, the network intelligence  routes all functional messages through a given component of the aggregate device. This technique, described below in detail, allows the given component to appear as a functional device to the data network server. If a user of the stimulus telephone station apparatus A wishes to call a user of the remote telephone station apparatus B, then a handset of the stimulus telephone station apparatus A is lifted off-hook and an indication of a desired destination number for the remote telephone station apparatus B is input. This indication would typically be accomplished by pressing digit keys of the keypad  () of the stimulus telephone station apparatus A, but may be accomplished through a selection of an entry in an address book (not shown) available via the network intelligence  and accessed through manipulation of user interface components (like the wheel  and the display , see ) of the stimulus telephone station apparatus A. Alternatively, the indication of a desired destination number may be accomplished through network intelligence-controlled functional signaling to retrieve a destination number from a handheld computer, where the destination number is associated with a name.","Notification of the event of the stimulus telephone station apparatus A going off-hook and the indication of the desired destination number are transmitted using the stimulus protocol from the stimulus telephone station apparatus A to the network intelligence  as stimulus messages. These event notifications are received by the aggregate device emulator  resident in the network intelligence  and are captured as state changes in the corresponding logical device model as previously described. The state changes are then sent to the IP telephony service adapter  and, based on call state or other information held in the service adapter service adaptation logic, the IP telephony service adapter  interprets these state changes and generates functional messages appropriate for sending to the IP telephony server . These functional messages are then encapsulated inside of stimulus messages, by the network intelligence , and sent to the stimulus telephone station apparatus A. The stimulus telephone station apparatus A receives the stimulus messages and, after removing the encapsulation at the stimulus messaging and bearer channel processor  (), recognizes the contents as functional messages having an associated network address for a destination.","The stimulus telephone station apparatus A then sends the functional messages over the data network  to the IP telephony server  at the network address specified in the encapsulated functional message contained in the stimulus messaging received at the stimulus telephone station apparatus A. Thus, as far as the IP telephony server  is concerned, the functional messages have originated from an addressable component of the stimulus telephone station apparatus A, not from the network intelligence . Functional signaling that is returned to the stimulus telephone station apparatus A from the IP telephony server  is encapsulated inside of stimulus messages and sent to the network intelligence . The functional signaling, for instance containing an IP address corresponding to the destination number for the remote telephone station apparatus B, is interpreted by the IP telephony service adapter .","The IP telephony service adapter  then may have a requirement to provide instructions to the remote telephone station apparatus B to reserve a virtual (or logical) channel through the data network  over which the call may take place (a bearer channel). The network intelligence  preferably includes a service adapter (client)  capable of bandwidth reservation and\/or other Quality of Service management functions (for example, the Resource Reservation Protocol or \u201cRSVP\u201d). Operations of the network system  with use of RSVP are described here for explanatory purposes. The IP telephony service adapter  may communicate to the RSVP service adapter  a request for a virtual channel through the data network  from the stimulus telephone station apparatus A to the remote telephone station apparatus B with Quality of Service guarantees befitting a voice channel. RSVP signaling appropriate to this request may then be sent by the network intelligence  to the stimulus telephone station apparatus A encapsulated within stimulus messages. The signaling is received by the stimulus telephone station apparatus A, de-encapsulated and sent out on the data network  as previously described. Thus, as far as nodes in the data network  are concerned, the RSVP signaling originates at the stimulus telephone station apparatus A, even though the stimulus telephone station apparatus A is not equipped with an RSVP client.","Return RSVP signaling, confirming setup of a virtual channel to the remote telephone station apparatus B, arrives at the stimulus telephone station apparatus A. The stimulus telephone station apparatus A then encapsulates the return RSVP signaling within stimulus messages and sends the encapsulated return RSVP signaling to the network intelligence . The network intelligence  de-encapsulates return RSVP signaling at the aggregate device emulator  particular to the stimulus telephone station apparatus A. The RSVP service adapter  then interprets the return RSVP signaling and communicates the information to the IP telephony service adapter . Appropriate call setup messages (i.e., call setup messages specified by ITU-T Recommendation H.323, \u201cPacket-Based Multimedia Communication Systems,\u201d the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference) may then be sent, over the data network , to the remote telephone station apparatus B. In particular, the call setup messages are encapsulated in stimulus messages and sent by the IP telephony service adapter  to the stimulus telephone station apparatus A where the call setup messages are de-encapsulated and sent out on the data network  as previously described, to the remote telephone station apparatus B. Once the call setup messages have been processed, a two-way conversation using ITU-T H.323 between users at the stimulus telephone station apparatus A and the remote telephone station apparatus B may proceed.","It is notable that, throughout this process, it appears to the IP telephony server  and the remote telephone station apparatus B that the stimulus telephone station apparatus A contains the necessary logic for functional message generation and handling. However, the stimulus telephone station apparatus A need not be aware of the meaning of the functional messages, need not process their contents and therefore does not require local logic to implement the functional messaging protocols. The stimulus telephone station apparatus A may simply act as a proxy for the logic contained in the network intelligence . It is also notable that this same pattern of interaction can be made to apply to many other protocols, where the associated protocol logic is implemented in the network intelligence and proxied by the end device.","The earlier provided definition of the Megaco Protocol assigns the term \u201cmultimedia gateway\u201d to a connection setup device and media-translator\/media-handler (like a Public Switched Telephone Network trunk interface or an IP telephone). A collection of media-translator\/media-handlers may then be controlled by a \u201cmultimedia gateway controller\u201d using the Megaco Protocol. However, unlike the architecture suggested by the present invention, Megaco Protocol documentation does not currently describe the aggregation of several diverse media-translator\/media-handlers to present a logical model of an aggregate device to an end-user application. Moreover, the Megaco Protocol does not currently contemplate a \u201ccascade\u201d control scheme, which will be described in the context of the present invention as follows.","An example of the above-mentioned cascade control scheme is presented in . In an exemplary cascade network system , a first stimulus telephone station apparatus P and a second stimulus telephone station apparatus Q are under control of a telephony network intelligence . Each of the stimulus telephone station apparatus P, Q appear to the telephony network intelligence  as a single device with all the expected functionality of an IP telephone. As such, a single elemental control message driver is included in each of the aggregate device emulators that correspond to the stimulus telephone station apparatus P, Q. However, the stimulus telephone station apparatus P is, in reality, not an IP telephone, but is the handheld computing device  and the associated mobile headset . Included in the handheld computing device  is a network intelligence with a service adapter that allows the combination of the handheld computing device  and the mobile headset  to appear to the telephony network intelligence  as a device functionally equivalent to the second stimulus telephone station apparatus Q.","The cascading is perhaps more clearly described in conjunction with . The telephony network intelligence  is shown to include an IP telephony service adapter , a first aggregate device emulator P for the first stimulus telephone station apparatus P and a second aggregate device emulator Q for the second stimulus telephone station apparatus Q. As mentioned above, the handheld computing device  includes a network intelligence  with an IP telephone service adapter . The IP telephone service adapter  allows a logical model maintained by a resource context manager  within a handheld aggregate device emulator  to appear to the telephony network intelligence  as an IP telephone. The aggregate device emulator  includes an elemental control message driver A for the handheld display  and an elemental control message driver B for the mobile headset .","Terms used in the description of the Megaco Protocol may be extended in light of the present invention and mapped to the devices of . The telephony network intelligence  may be seen as a extended Media Gateway Controller (eMGC). Just as an MGC controls a Media Gateway (MG), an eMGC controls an extended Media Gateway (eMG). Each of the first stimulus telephone station apparatus P and the second stimulus telephone station apparatus Q may be considered an eMG. However, the first stimulus telephone station apparatus P may also be considered an eMGC because of the control the first stimulus telephone station apparatus P exercises over the handheld display  and the mobile headset , each of which may be considered an eMG. As will be appreciated, such a cascade scheme may extend over several layers and may be useful in maintaining control of devices at increasing degrees of granularity and\/or aggregation.","A further advantage of this cascade scheme relates to failover, i.e., the change in control of an aggregate device when the primary network intelligence fails. Where a primary eMGC in control of a particular eMG fails, the control of the particular eMG may transfer to a secondary eMGC which, before the failure controlled the primary eMGC as an eMG.","The present invention has, thus far, been described starting at a point in mid operation. It may be of use to describe potential ways in which a network intelligence becomes aware of a stimulus component and the manner in which stimulus components are associated with one another. Returning to , a user may be able to conduct a registration session, say using a web-based graphical user interface, during which the user registers each of the workstation components (mouse, keyboard, display) by network address, or more specific identification. The result of a registration session may be one or more table entries which associate the workstation components with each other.","Alternatively, a component of an aggregate device may register itself with a network intelligence automatically. Methods by which media gateways may register themselves automatically with media gateway controllers are many, varied, and known to persons skilled in the art. Returning to , when a component becomes visible to the network intelligence , say, by being turned on by the user or by being connected to the data network  (with or without wires), the component may send to the network intelligence  a stimulus message essentially providing an identity and indicating a change in operational state. Such a stimulus message would be eventually received by the elemental control message router . Having no aggregate device emulator to which to send the stimulus message, the elemental control message router  sends the stimulus message to the aggregate device emulator manager . Responsive to receiving the stimulus message announcing the operational state of the component, the aggregate device emulator manager  initiates a new aggregate device emulator and the new aggregate device emulator initiates an elemental control message driver for the component. Concurrent with the initiation of the new aggregate device emulator, the elemental control message router  and the elemental control message formatter  are informed by the aggregate device emulator manager  of the newly-established correlation between the component and the newly-initiated aggregate device emulator. This informing allows future correspondence between the component and the newly-initiated aggregate device emulator to be appropriately routed.","A detailed exchange of Megaco-like messaging for registration and de-registration (setup and teardown) is illustrated in . Lines are employed to represent various elements of . In particular, a line  is used to represent the handheld display , a line  is used to represent the mobile headset , a line  is used to represent the handheld computing device  and a line  is used to represent the telephony network intelligence . On being powered on, the mobile headset  sends a message  to register with the handheld computing device , or more specifically, with the handheld network intelligence . The handheld computing device , or, more specifically, the IP telephone service adapter , sends a message  to register the first stimulus telephone station apparatus P with the telephony network intelligence . The handheld computing device  then sends a message  back to the mobile headset  to accept registration. The telephony network intelligence  then sends a message  back to the IP telephone service adapter  to accept registration.","Having registered the first stimulus telephone station apparatus P, the telephony network intelligence  may send a message  containing an instruction to activate a microphone component assumed to be associated with the first stimulus telephone station apparatus P. A message  is then sent from the handheld aggregate device emulator  to the mobile headset  to activate the microphone. The mobile headset  then sends a return message  to acknowledge the activation of the microphone and, subsequently, an acknowledgement message  is sent from the IP telephone service adapter  to the telephony network intelligence .","The telephony network intelligence  may then send a message  containing an instruction to display some text on a display assumed to be associated with the first stimulus telephone station apparatus P. A message  is then sent from the IP telephone service adapter  to the telephony network intelligence  to indicate that an error has occurred because a display in unavailable at the first stimulus telephone station apparatus P.","The handheld display  may then send a message  to register with the handheld network intelligence . Having received registration of the handheld display , the handheld network intelligence  may send a capability update message  to indicate to the telephony network intelligence  the newly-registered display capabilities. The handheld aggregate device emulator  then sends a subsequent message  to the handheld display  to accept the registration. A message  is then sent from the telephony network intelligence  to the handheld network intelligence  to accept the update indication of newly-registered display capabilities. The next attempt at sending a message  containing an instruction to display some text on a display assumed to be associated with the first stimulus telephone station apparatus P causes a message  to be generated at the handheld network intelligence  and sent to the handheld display . Once received, the handheld display  sends a message  acknowledging receipt of the display instruction to the handheld network intelligence . The IP telephone service adapter  then sends an acknowledgement message  to the telephony network intelligence .","When powering down, the handheld display  sends a message  to the handheld network intelligence  to remove the display capabilities from the handheld aggregate device logical model maintained by the resource context manager . The handheld network intelligence  sends a capability update message  to indicate to the telephony network intelligence  the removal of display capabilities and a message  to the handheld display  to accept the removal. A message  is then sent from the telephony network intelligence  to the handheld network intelligence  to accept the update indicating removal of display capabilities.","When powering down, the mobile headset  sends a message  to the handheld network intelligence  to remove the audio capabilities from the handheld aggregate device logical model maintained by the resource context manager . The IP telephone service adapter , sends a message  to take the first stimulus telephone station apparatus P completely out of service at the telephony network intelligence . The handheld network intelligence  sends a message  to the mobile headset  to accept the removal. The telephony network intelligence  then sends a message  back to the IP telephone service adapter  to accept the removal.","In summary then, in a first case, a service adapter may present itself directly to a server of data network services as a client (i.e., a communications end point) with address physically associated with a network intelligence (e.g., a port at the IP address of the network intelligence). In this case all data flow between a component of an aggregate device (the real end point) and the server must be processed by the service adapter. Data objects (e.g., image, sound and video files) referenced by any client\/server markup language commands, must be physically transported to and cached by the network intelligence. Data objects are referenced or spontaneously retransmitted in a context determined by a resource context manager at the network intelligence. Drawing or other commands may be translated from the format in which they are received into a format specific to the capabilities of particular components of the aggregate device, as determined by the resource context manager of the network intelligence.","In a second case, the service adapter may send functional commands, intended for the server, to a component of the aggregate device encapsulated in a protocol known to the component. These commands may be de-encapsulated by the component and transmitted in their native form to the server. The aggregate device is, through this process, made to appear as a fully capable client. Server commands received by the component are similarly encapsulated, and sent to the network intelligence, or, more specifically, the service adapter, for interpretation. In response, the network intelligence may send additional encapsulated functional commands to the component, for forwarding to the server, and\/or control commands to the component. Data objects associated with the server commands may be relayed to the network intelligence for caching (or translation), or cached at the component for presentation in accordance with instructions generated by the network intelligence resource context manager and drivers.","Notably, in the most likely application of the present invention, the above two cases may be combined. That is, a network intelligence may execute multiple service adapters, where some service adapters may present themselves directly to a server of data network services as a client while other service adapters send functional commands, intended for particular servers, to individual device components encapsulated in a protocol known to the components.","Where client-server control protocols permit, the network intelligence may instruct the server to send data objects directly to a component of the aggregate device and all other commands to the network intelligence. The component may then present these data objects in accordance with instructions generated by the network intelligence resource context manager and drivers.","As will be appreciated, the complexity of the functions of a particular component within an aggregate device is limited only by the extent to which the behavior of the particular component is predictable by the network intelligence.","As will be apparent to a person skilled in the art, while the service adapters described herein by example are designed in the context of providing access to network-based services, it is equally possible to design service adapters in the context of providing stand-alone services. A given stand-alone service would be based entirely on service adaptation logic local to a given service adapter and, as such, would not require interaction with network-based servers or services.","Furthermore, in the case of providing access to a rudimentary data network service, a network intelligence may handle service adaptation without the use of a specific service adapter but, instead, through the use of the resource context manager.","In an alternative embodiment of the present invention, at least one device component may communicate with a network intelligence without the use of a network. This communication may occur over a direct wired connection or even a wireless connection. In this embodiment a connection to a data network is generally required by the network intelligence for communication with data network services or other device components to which to provide control. However, should the network connection become entirely or partially inoperable, the network intelligence may continue to provide stand-alone services to a subset of device components, where communication with the subset does not depend on the network.","Other modifications will be apparent to those skilled in the art and, therefore, the invention is defined in the claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["In the figures which illustrate example embodiments of this invention:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 10A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 10B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 13A","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 13B","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 15","FIG. 14"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 17","FIG. 16"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 18"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
