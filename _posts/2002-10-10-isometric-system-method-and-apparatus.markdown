title: Isometric system, method and apparatus
abstract: System, method and apparatus for carrying out isometric exercises for either diagnostic purposes or therapeutic purposes. When employed in a diagnostic mode, the instrument is programmed to carry out standardized diagnostic regimens and during such regimens provides both visual and aural cues, carries out mathematical computations of force values and provides recordation of diagnostic data in archival memory. When employed in a therapeutic mode the apparatus may only be programmed within mandated therapeutic parameter limitations. During therapeutic trials, the user is visually and aurally cued throughout the test sequence and the therapeutic data evolved during the regimen is recorded and recoverable from archival memory.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of Provisional Application No. 60\/330,265, filed Oct. 18, 2001.","Not applicable.","The use of isometric as compared to rhythmic exercise in the general field of athletic strength development, as well as a therapy for strength recovery has been the subject of somewhat controversial discourse over the past decades. In general, such exercise has been considered to promote, for example, coronary risk factors. See generally:\n\n","However, as such attitudes persisted, some investigators commenced to observe contradictions to these generally accepted beliefs. See for, example, the following publications:\n\n","With the approach or protocol developed by Wiley, the isometric regimen is closely controlled both in terms of exerted force and in the timing of trials or exertions.","In contrast, earlier subjects or trainees undergoing isometric exercise stressed the involved musculature to their full or maximum capability (publication (11)) or at some submaximal force as long as it could be sustained, in either case only terminating with the onset of unendurable fatigue. Such approaches often have incurred somewhat deleterious results as evidenced by the injuries sustained in consequence of improper weightlifting procedures. Weightlifting procedures or endeavors exhibit a significant isometric factor. See generally:\n\n","The diagnosis of patient hand-arm strength using isometric-based testing has been employed by physiologists, physical therapists and medical personnel for over three decades. These procedures function to evaluate hand-arm trauma or dysfunction and involve the patient use of a handgrip-based dynamometer. The dynamometer is grasped by the patient and squeezed to a maximum capability under the verbal instruction of an attending therapist or diagnostician. The hand dynamometer most widely used for these evaluations incorporates a grip serving to apply force through closed circuit hydraulics to a force readout provided by an analog meter facing outwardly so as to be practitioner readable. Adjustment of the size of the grip of the dynamometer is provided by inward or outward positioning of a forwardly disposed grip component. The dynamometers currently are marketed under the trade designation: \u201cJamar Hydraulic Hand Dynamometer\u201d by Sammons Preston of Bolingbrook, Ill. An extended history of use of these dynamometers has resulted in what may be deemed a \u201cstandardization\u201d of testing protocols. For instance, three of the above-noted grip length adjustments are employed in a standardized approach and verbal instructions on the part of the testing attendant, as well as the treatment of force data read from the analog meter are now matters of accepted protocol. In the latter regard, multiple maximum strength values are recorded, whereupon average strengths, standard deviations and coefficients of variation are computed by the practitioner. In one test, the instrument is alternately passed between the patient's right and left hands to derive a maximum strength output reading each 1.5 seconds or 2.5 seconds. Reading and hand recording strength values for such protocols has remained problematic. The protocols, for example, have been the subject of recommendations by the American Society of Hand Therapist (ASHT) and have been discussed in a variety of publications including the following:\n\n","In about 1998, the above-noted Wiley protocols as described in connection with publication (12) above were incorporated in a compact, lightweight isometric device. Described in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 5,904,639 entitled \u201cApparatus, System, and Method for Carrying Out Protocol-Based Isometric Exercise Regimens\u201d by Smyser, et al., the hand-held dynamometer has a hand grip which incorporates a load cell assembly. Extending from the hand grip is a liquid crystal display and two user actuated control switches or switch buttons. The display is mounted in sloping fashion with respect to the grip such that the user can observe important visual cues or prompts while carrying out a controlled exercise regimen specifically structured in terms of force values and timing in accordance with the Wiley protocols. This device is therapeutic as opposed to diagnostic in nature and is microprocessor driven with archival memory. External communication with the battery powered instrument is made available through a communications port such that the device may be configured by programming and, additional data, such as blood pressure values and the like may be inserted into its memory from an external device. Visual and audible cueing not only guides the user through a multi-step protocol but also aids the user in maintaining pre-computed target level grip compression levels.","Of course, it will be beneficial to incorporate improved diagnostic features for hand-arm evaluation techniques with therapist or practitioner designed therapeutic protocols specifically tailored to the condition of a given patient and which provide a control over such therapies clearly establishing such therapies as beneficial to strength development and recovery.","The present invention is addressed to a system method and apparatus for carrying out a controlled isometric regimen by a user. Being microprocessor driven, the instrument is programmed to carry out established diagnostic as well as newly developed grip-based isometric regimens. When carrying out diagnostic procedures, the attending diagnostician may elect either a maximum grip test or a rapid exchange testing procedure. When employed for carrying out a diagnostic maximum grip test, the diagnostician selects configuration parameters and the instrument provides both visual and audible prompts and cues throughout the procedure. Maximum grip forces for each of the sequence of trials of this procedure are selected typically by the diagnostician and when so selected are recorded in instrument memory along with calendar data, and processor computed values for average grip force, standard deviation of the force values throughout a sequence of tests and corresponding coefficients of variation. At the termination of the diagnostic procedure, memory recorded test data are displayable to the diagnostician and may be downloaded through a communications port to a computer facility.","When utilized in a rapid exchange test mode, the attending diagnostician again programs the instrument with elected but standardized test parameters. At the commencement of and during the ensuing multi-trial test procedure, the patient may be provided with aural cues and, at the election of the diagnostician with visual cues. Grip force values for each trial are recorded in memory. As before, the instrument processor accesses that memory retained data and computes average grip force values, corresponding standard deviation for those force values and coefficient of variation, the values of which also are recorded in memory. At the termination of the multi-trial test regimen, the diagnostician is provided a successive display of the force values and associated computed information recorded in instrument memory.","For each of the diagnostic procedures, the widthwise extent of the instrument grip may be both varied in standard \u00bd inch increments from a minimum width. The grip is further configured such that the visually perceptible readout of the instrument may be viewed only by the diagnostician where deemed appropriate.","An important aspect of the therapeutic method associated with the instrument of the invention resides in the limiting of user performance to carry out the regimen of trials. In this regard, the instrument is programmed to perform only within predetermined and mandated test limits. Two therapeutic methods are described, a fixed therapy and a stepped therapy. Each therapeutic regimen is based upon an initial evaluation of the maximum gripping force capability of the user. Under that limitation, target load factors, hold on target load intervals, intervening rest intervals and trial repetition numbers may be elected only from pre-established and mandated memory retained ranges. The program also nominates rest intervals and hold on target intervals in correspondence with user elected target force factors. Thus, valuable strength recovery and development may be achieved but only within safe limits.","During each of the above therapeutic regimens, an audible warning is elicited whenever the user grip force value exceeds a computed upper limit. During each timed interval wherein the user is prompted to grip at a target force value computed with respect to the pre-tested maximum grip force, a dynamic bar graph and center point display is provided as a visual cue related to desired grip performance. Additionally, a rapid succession of score values are computed and the average thereof recorded at the end of each trial of a given regimen. These scores permit a therapist to access the quality of the performance of the user. In general, trial data is recorded in conjunction with calendar data and, as before, may be downloaded to a computer facility from an instrument contained communications port.","Other objects of the invention will, in part, be obvious and will, in part, appear hereinafter.","The invention, accordingly, comprises the method, system and apparatus possessing the construction, combination of elements, arrangement of parts and steps which are exemplified in the following detailed description.","For a fuller understanding of the nature and objects of the invention, reference should be made to the following detailed description taken in connection with the accompanying drawings.","Isometric exercise apparatus under which the methodology of the invention may be carried out is lightweight, portable, battery powered and sufficiently rugged to withstand the compressive pressures which it necessarily endures during use. The instrument is programmable such that it may be utilized by a therapeutic practitioner for diagnostic purposes employing established grip test modalities. Strength measurements carried out during these modes are compiled in memory and the practitioner is afforded calculated values for average grip force, standard deviation and coefficient of variation with respect to grip force trials. Furthermore, individual strength measurements compiled in these averages, whether taken rapidly or slowly, are stored in memory and may be reviewed by the therapist.","Additionally, the instrument is employable as a therapeutic device. First a protocol is nominated by prescribing nominal parameters of the effort. Each isometric regimen is controlled initially by requiring that a maximum grip strength be established for each individual patient or user. Then, the practitioner may elect parameters of grip force and timing under mandated memory contained parameter limits. Accordingly, the user will be unable to carry out strength enhancement therapies which would otherwise constitute an excessive grip force regimen. For carrying out the noted diagnostic procedures as well as therapy activities, the grip widthwise extent is variable from 1\u215e inches to 2\u215e inches, such variation being adjustable in \u00bd inch increments. This is in keeping with standardized diagnostic practices. Further with respect to diagnostic procedures, the display or readout of the instrument can be adjusted with respect to the grip structuring such that only the practitioner or therapist may observe the data which is being developed during a diagnostic protocol.","Looking to , the instrument or apparatus is represented generally at  as having a housing identified generally at .

It may be observed in  that the positioning of the auxiliary grips is reversed in the sense of the grip configuration shown in .","Turning to , a block diagrammatic representation of the controller components of instrument  is revealed. In general, the instrument  is microprocessor driven, for example, employing a type 8051 microprocessor as represented at block . The controller is powered by a standard 9 volt battery. That voltage then is regulated to 5 volts for use by the circuit components. A power supply to the strain gauge implemented load cells  and  is dropped by a resistor such that the maximum current applied is limited to 50 milliamps. Such power supply is represented in the figure at block  which, in turn, is seen to be associated with microprocessor  via line  and with switch  via lines  and . Note that switches  and  respectively are labeled \u201cmenu\u201d and \u201cselect\u201d. Switch  serves the additional function of an on switch or enablement switch. Power also is seen to be supplied to the communications connector  as represented at line . Communications connector , in turn, is seen coupled to a communications driver  as represented at line . Driver  associated with the microprocessor  as represented at line . The microprocessor  also provides control over an annunciator or buzzer as represented at block  and line . Similarly, control to the liquid crystal display (LCD)  from microprocessor  is represented at line . A real-time clock is provided with the controller circuit as represented at block . Time and date data from that clock are used in conjunction with the monitoring and memory features of the instrument  such that important data, including date and time of a given trial regimen can be retained in memory and downloaded via the communications port  when called for. The association of the real-time clock function  and microprocessor  is represented at line . Archival memory as well as temporary memory are provided with the controller. Archival memory may be provided, for example, as an electrically erasable programmable read only memory (EE PROM), an 8 kilobyte device which requires no power to sustain its memory retention, i.e., it is non-volatile. The archival memory is represented at block  and its association with the microprocessor  is represented at line .","Load cells  and  are represented with that numeration in FIG. . These load cells are each configured as a four resistance balance bridge-type load cell. The outputs of load cells  and  are directed to an amplification function as represented by respective lines  and  extending to amplifier block . The output of amplifier  is represented at line  extending to an analog-to-digital converter function represented at block . Correspondingly, output of the converter function  is directed to the microprocessor  as represented at line . Microprocessor  converts the signal to a force value in pounds or kilograms which is displayed in the LCD . The menu switch  is shown associated with microprocessor  via line , while the select switch  is associated with that processing function as represented at line .","Each of the instruments  is calibrated using nineteen combinations of six standard weights. A best fit is determined and the instrument is called upon to have a root mean square error (RMS) of 0.1 pounds or less to pass calibration requirements. Once the calibration constants have been determined, the system is loaded with two redundant copies of the calibration constants. The zero point of the load cell is monitored at all times during the use of the instrument . If a drift is found, then a warning is shown at the LCD display . If any lead wire to the load cell becomes disconnected, then the built-in monitoring detects this occurrence, shows an error message, and disables further use of instrument  until the power is reset. These features insure that the force reading shown is accurate and true. Absolute values of the outputs of load cells  and  are summed to provide a force output signal. In general, the load measurement accuracy of instrument  is better than 0.1 pound of 0.1% of applied force whichever is greater.","In the discourse to follow, the sequences of the program protocol carried out by instrument  are represented in flow chart fashion. In general, these flow charts commence with a configuration sequence if desired and then look to two diagnostic protocols followed by two therapeutic protocols.","Turning to , the procedure seen to commence as represented at block  with the selection of the grip widthwise extent. In general, that grip width is elected to accommodate variations in user hand sizes. The program then continues as represented at line  and block  wherein, where appropriate, one or two auxiliary grip components as at  and  are installed in an orientation providing for user viewing of display  as illustrated in connection with , or in an arrangement for therapeutic practitioner viewing to the exclusion of the user as described in connection with FIG. . The program then continues as represented at line  and block  providing for the enablement of instrument  by actuation of select switch . Upon such actuation, as represented at line  and block  a start-up message is provided at display assembly  for an interval of two seconds. Then, as represented at line  and block  a prompt is displayed at readout  identifying a default configuration wherein pounds as opposed to kilograms are elected; an audible tone is enabled, and for a diagnostic test referred to as \u201crapid exchange\u201d wherein instrument  is passed from one hand of the user to the other and then back for a number of exchanges, the user providing a grip force trial at each exchange. The rapid exchange default values are ten exchanges with 1.5 seconds available for user griping or squeezing. Following the publication of the screen as represented at block , should the user not actuate either the switches  or , then as represented at line  and block  the instrument  will turn off or power down at the end of a five minute interval. This feature is always active, i.e., turning off five minutes after a last switch actuation.","With the publication of the screen as represented at block , then as represented at line  and block  the practitioner or user is called upon to determine whether to enter a configuration sequence or to progress to a diagnostic grip test. To enter the latter diagnostic grip test sequence, as represented at line  and block  by pressing switch  display  will prompt the user to press the select switch  to commence a diagnostic grip test sequence. Where the select switch  is actuated, then the program enters the diagnostic grip test sequence as represented at line  and node A.","Where a determination on the part of the practitioner or user is made to enter a configuration sequence, then as represented at line  and block  the configuration sequence is entered by actuating switch . As represented at line  and block  the initial configuration looks to units. Recall from block  that the instrument  defaults to a units evaluated in pounds. As represented at line  and block  by actuating select switch  the units parameter can be converted to kilograms instead of pounds. The program then continues upon depressing or actuating menu switch  as represented at either lines  or  leading to block . As represented at block , the user then is given the opportunity to delete the audible tone. In this regard, by actuating select switch , as represented at line  and block , the tone is deleted, display  showing the term \u201ctone\u201d in connection with the letter N.","The configuration sequence then continues as represented at either lines  or  with the actuation of menu switch . This actuation of switch  provides for the establishing of a rapid exchange diagnostic test cycle time change. As set forth at block  the default cycle time is 1.5 seconds. However, by actuation of select switch , as represented at line  and block  the operator may change the cycle time to 2.5 seconds. The program then continues by actuating the menu switch  as represented at either of lines  or . These lines lead to the configuration alteration represented at block . Recall from block  that the default number of exchanges for the rapid exchange diagnostic procedure is 10. However, as represented at line  and block  the operator may change the number of exchanges from 10 to 20 by actuation of select switch . The program then returns to line  by actuation of the menu switch  as represented at lines  and . As described in connection with block , line  and node A, the operator may elect to proceed with a diagnostic grip test.","Referring to , node A reappears in conjunction with line  extending to the query posed at block  wherein a determination is made as to whether or not to enter a diagnostic grip test mode. Where the operator determines that the diagnostic grip test mode should be entered, then as represented at line  and block , the grip test mode is entered by actuating select switch . The operator is then prompted at display  to actuate select switch  to enter a max test mode. Accordingly, with the actuation of switch , as represented at line  and block  the maximum diagnostic grip test mode is entered. On the other hand, as represented at line  and node B by actuating the menu switch , the practitioner may cause instrument  to enter a rapid exchange sequence.","Returning to block , the maximum strength grip test can be carried out with 10 maximum squeezing force trials. At the conclusion of a given number of such trials, the practitioner actuates select switch , whereupon computations are carried out. Accordingly, as represented at line  and block  the user is prompted with the message \u201csqueeze hard!!!\u201d at the readout . The program will elect the highest force applied during such squeezing activity, whereupon the user releases the grip force as represented at line  and block . Then instrument  will publish the maximum force applied by the user as represented at line  and block , a first maximum grip evaluation being shown as an example as 64.4 pounds. Block  also indicates that the user is prompted to either actuate the select switch  to accept the published maximum squeeze evaluation as set forth at block  or to squeeze the grip  again. Such squeezing again will provide a substitute maximum grip force evaluation. Then, as represented at line  and block  the query is posed as to whether the select switch  has been actuated. In the event that it has not, then the program loops as represented at line  extending to line , whereupon a maximum grip effort again is undertaken. Where the operator elects the maximum first trial grip force evaluation, then as represented at line  and block , the program will compute an average of force values, standard deviation and coefficient variation, albeit it for one trial at this juncture in the procedure.","The program then continues as represented at line  and block  to display computed values which, as noted above, for the first trial are irrelevant. However, as the number of trials increases, those computed values gain significance. Next, as represented at line  and block  the program commences to carry out a next maximum grip test by providing a prompt at readout  which advises the user to \u201csqueeze hard!!!\u201d and indicates that this is a second trial as represented by the terms: \u201cMAX 2\u201d. Following a squeezing of the grip region , as represented at line  and block  the user releases the grip force and, as represented at line  and block  the maximum force asserted by the user is published, for example, showing 60 pounds for a \u201cMAX 2\u201d trial. This prompt further advises the user to actuate select switch  to elect the published grip force value or to squeeze again to carry out a next trial. The program then continues as represented at line  and block  to determine whether or not select switch  had been actuated. In the event that it had not been actuated then the program loops as represented at lines  and  whereupon the user again may carry out the second maximum grip trial. Where switch  has been actuated, then as represented at line  and block , the program carries out a computation of the average of the maximum forces asserted and computes standard deviation and coefficient of variation which are submitted to memory. The program then continues as represented at line  and block  whereupon the values computed in connection with block  are published at display . The above maximum grip test trials may be reiterated for  trials. Accordingly, as represented at line  and block  the maximum test trials are reiterated for a total of N tests (10 maximum) and the computed values of average force, standard deviation and coefficient of variation are both submitted to memory and published at display . As represented at line  and block  the user may restart this max test sequence following the Nth trial by actuating select switch , whereupon the program returns as represented at line  to line  (FIG. A). Returning to block , by actuating menu switch , as represented at line  and block , a subsequent actuation of select switch  will return the program to a previous menu. As represented at line  and block  by again actuating menu switch , as represented at line  the program reverts to node B as described in conjunction with FIG. A. By again actuating select switch , as represented at line  the program returns to entry into the maximum grip diagnostic test, line  extending to line  seen in FIG. A. This circular logic is made available at a variety of locations within the program.","Returning to , where the query posed at block  results in a negative determination that the maximum grip test diagnostic mode is not to be entered, then, by actuation of menu switch , as represented at line  and block  a determination is made as to whether to exit a diagnostic mode and enter a therapy based mode. Where a therapy mode is not elected, then as represented at line  and block  a previous menu may be elected by actuating the select switch  as represented at line  and node D. By actuating menu switch , then as represented at line , the program loops to line  and the query posed at block .

With the rapid exchange test, the user may grip instrument  in the manner shown in  such that the therapist or practitioner may observe readout  to the exclusion of the user or patient. With the rapid exchange, a maximum grip force is exerted by the user or patient in exchanging between the right and left hands under a controlled exchange timed cycle which will have been elected, for example, in connection with the configuration mode described in connection with FIG. . It may be recalled that the number of exchanges may also be elected by the diagnostician as 10 or 20 efforts or trials.

Block  indicates that the readout  will publish information that a grip therapy is available by actuation of select switch . It may be recalled that the parameters of time and force are somewhat pre established under the regimen of the instant program. In this regard, it is important that the isometric grip exercise be constrained within predefined force and time interval of holding and resting limits. These parameters are nominated in the program and while some variations are permitted, those variations are retained within physiologically determined limit values. Of importance of the grip therapy at hand, it may be observed that it is predicated upon the patient or users actual and unique maximum gripping force which initially is evaluated and then treated by a preordained but still electable target valuation. In general, the prompts and cues provided at display  are made available to the patient or user by a handle configuration as described in conjunction with FIG. . Looking to , block  provides for a display at readout  indicating that a grip therapy mode is available by actuation of select switch . As represented at line  and block  a determination is made as to whether a fixed mode of therapy or a stepped mode of therapy is to be elected. A fixed therapy is elected by actuation of select switch  as represented at line  extending to block . Block  indicates that the fixed exercise configuration mode has entered. With such entry, as represented at line  and block  readout  prompts that the user will be given opportunities to adjust the target load factor, the number of repetitions of trials of the grip therapy, the duration of the holding of the grip force at a target value and the interval for a intergripping rest. However, as an initial component of the procedure, the maximum grip force value for a given patient is determined. Accordingly, upon actuating switch  as represented at line  and block  the user is prompted to squeeze the grip with maximum force by publishing the terms: \u201csqueeze hard!!!\u201d. Then, as represented at line  and block , the squeeze generated load or force value is outputted to the microprocessor  (FIG. ). The maximum valuation of this initial force evaluation then is displayed at readout  as represented at line  and block . In the latter block, it may be observed that a sample force valuation of 90.3 pounds is published at readout . The user can elect that valuation as the maximum force value to be used in the program by actuating select switch  as represented at line  and block . However, a prompt at readout  also provides that the user may retry this maximum grip force evaluation as represented at loop line  extending to line . Where the user or therapist determines that an appropriate grip force has been derived, then as represented at line  and block  the elected maximum force value is submitted to memory and the program continues as represented at line  and block . employing the elected maximum squeeze force, the program computes a target grip force using a default factor of 50%. Additionally, the program establishes a trial repetition number at a default number of 4; a hold on target force interval of 45 seconds; and a default rest interval of 120 seconds. As represented at line  and block  the computed target level then is displayed at readout  along with the value of the elected maximum grip force and the default target factor of 50%. The terms \u201cTarget \u201d blink as a prompt that the factor can be altered within an established range. The user or practitioner then is given the opportunity to adjust the target factor percentage in 10% increments from 10% to 100% as represented at line  and block  by actuating the menu switch . Next, as represented at line  and block  the program computes at a new target value based upon the elected factor, an arbitrary designation \u201cAA\u201d being shown. A lower enabling grip force threshold also is derived. Should the user elect a target factor other than the 50% value by adjustment in connection with block , the program will automatically nominate hold on target intervals and rest intervals for each available 10% selection from within the range from 10% to 100% which the user may have elected. This, again, is for the purpose of protecting the user from excessive effort intervals and inadequate rest intervals. However, still within the mandated overall ranges, the user or therapist can change those values for the hold on target effort and rest effort. The nominated hold or \u201cEffort\u201d and rest intervals contained in the program are summarized in Table 1 below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0091"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"10"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"9","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"10","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"10","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["10%","20%","30%","40%","50%","60%","70%","80%","90%","100%"]},{"entry":["Max","Max","Max","Max","Max","Max","Max","Max","Max","Max"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"10","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["120","120","90","60","45","15","12","10","5","3"]},{"entry":["sec.","sec.","sec.","sec.","sec.","sec.","sec.","sec.","sec.","sec."]},{"entry":["Effort","Effort","Effort","Effort","Effort","Effort","Effort","Effort","Effort","Effort"]},{"entry":["60","120","120","120","120","120","120","60","60","60"]},{"entry":["sec","sec","sec","sec","sec","sec","sec","sec","sec","sec"]},{"entry":["Rest","Rest","Rest","Rest","Rest","Rest","Rest","Rest","Rest","Rest"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"10","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}},"br":{},"b":["572","573","18","574","576","22","24","578","580","582","584","22","18","24","586","588","18","590","592","22","24","594","596","24","598","600","24","602","604","18","606","608","570","610","604","612","614","584","616","618","620","622","624","626","628","630","632"],"figref":"FIG. 14B"},"Turning momentarily to , a routine is depicted functioning to carry out the computation and display of the noted score values.

Where no unimpaired contralateral muscle group is available to set this goal strength, a medical professional will establish an appropriate goal strength. The method continues as represented at line  of block  providing for the measurement of maximum strength of the specific anatomical feature to be treated. As represented at line  and block , the methodology identifies a protocol matrix of factors. In this regard, a strengthening protocol is derived which is based upon timed efforts which are equal to a percentage of the measured maximum strength as derived in connection with block . The matrix of factors further include hold times at a factor or factors of the measured maximum strength, the repetition of these efforts for a given trial or exercise session and the duration of rest periods where repetitions are involved. Such protocol further will indicate the intervals of repetitions of the exercise sessions themselves during a stated period of time in hours, days, weeks, months and the like. This matrix of factors may be contained, for example, in computer memory. Looking to line  and block , the procedure next nominates values to the factors provided in conjunction with block . In this regard, the strengthening protocol which is developed utilizes nominated factors from the matrix of these exercise factors. In effect, the nominated factors may be identified as \u201ceffort\u201d applied by the specific anatomical feature and the effort time period during which the effort is to be applied such that there is a relationship among the percentage of the measured maximum strength of time wherein the higher the percentage, the shorter the effort time and the number of repetitions of these efforts during an exercise session, the rest period time between cessation of one effort and the beginning of the next succeeding effort such that there is a relationship between the percentage of the measured maximum strength and the rest time wherein the higher the percentage the longer the rest time and the number of exercise sessions in a given time period (hours, days, weeks, months). As represented at line  and block , the procedure initiates and monitors the exercise protocol with nominated factors. In this regard, the procedure monitors and guides the exercise effort to be applied and while being applied, provides visual and\/or audible cues to encourage compliance to the elected protocol using symbols as the visual cues and words which clearly guide the effort to be applied. While that effort is being applied, using audible cues and words which assist to properly perform the effort, rest periods and repetitions for each exercise session. Looking to line  of block , the method provides for annunciating an alarm when an exercise effort level is exceeded. In this regard, an audible alarm is produced if the exercise effort exceeds a predetermined or factor determined level beyond which it is considered that the exercise effort could be damaging to the human physiology or the specific anatomical feature at hand. As represented at line  and block  the method provides compliance scores in real-time and in summation during the course of an exercise effort and subsequent thereto. As described herein, the program calculates a compliance score during each exercise effort in percent of that effort required in the strengthening protocol and provides this compliance score in real-time as the effort is being accomplished on the specific anatomical feature. An averaging of this compliance score over each exercise effort time period is devised to depict the degree to which the exercise effort applied has been accomplished. By accumulating the compliance scores during each rest period and then presenting a final compliance score issued in the form of both a number as a percent accomplished and in an instruction set an indication is derived as to how well the exercise protocol was performed or how to improve future compliance. Next, as represented at line  at block  the exercise data is archived for review and potential transfer to a remote interactive entity. This step in the procedure accumulates real-time and summary data for each effort or trial and the specific protocol being utilized. It may be noted that these protocols are selected each time the exercisable anatomical feature is elected to be strengthened such that the elected protocol, the effort being applied and the compliance being calculated during and at the conclusion of each effort may be reviewed remotely as it is being accomplished using suitable data communication assistance and at the conclusion of each effort. The archive data is time-stamped and uniquely identified for retrieval.","Since certain changes may be made in the above-described apparatus, method and system without departing from the scope of the invention herein involved, it is intended that all matter contained in the description thereof or shown in the accompanying drawings shall be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 1","FIG. 5"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 1","FIG. 6"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0047"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 1","FIG. 7"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0048"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIGS. 12A and 12B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIGS. 14A-14C","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIGS. 16A-16E"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIGS. 17A-17C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 18"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIG. 19"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
