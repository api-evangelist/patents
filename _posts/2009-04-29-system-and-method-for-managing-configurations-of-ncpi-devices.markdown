Field of the Invention","At least one example in accord with the present invention relates generally to systems and methods for data center management, and more specifically, to systems and methods for managing the configuration of Network Critical Physical Infrastructure (NCPI) devices.","2. Discussion of Related Art","In response to the increasing demands of information-based economies, information technology networks continue to proliferate across the globe. One manifestation of this growth is the centralized network data center. A centralized network data center typically consists of various information technology equipment, collocated in a structure that provides network connectivity, electrical power and cooling capacity. Often the equipment is housed of specialized enclosures termed \u201cracks\u201d which integrate these communications, power and cooling elements. In some data center configurations, rows of racks are organized into hot and cold aisles to decrease the cost associated with cooling the information technology equipment. These characteristics make data centers a cost effective way to deliver the computing power required by many software applications.","Various processes and software applications, such as the InfraStruXure\u00ae Central product available from American Power Conversion by Schneider Electric of West Kingston, R.I., (APC) have been developed to aid data center personnel in configuring the operational behavior of NCPI devices located within a data center. Some of these tools allow users to adjust values assigned to one or more locally-stored, predefined settings of the NCPI device, and thereby affect how the NCPI device operates. Typically, these local, predefined settings were limited to a subset of the overall settings available for the NCPI device.","Aspects in accord with the present invention manifest an appreciation that data center personnel would benefit from greater flexibility in configuring NCPI devices than is available using conventional technology. According to one example, a method for configuring an NCPI device using a data center management appliance is provided. The method includes acts of gathering, by the data center management appliance, at least one device configuration from a first NCPI device via a network, modifying the at least one device configuration and providing the modified at least one device configuration to the first NCPI device via the network.","In the method, the act of gathering, by the data center management appliance, the at least one device configuration may include an act of copying at least one configuration file from the first NCPI device. Additionally, the act of gathering, by the data center management appliance, the at least one device configuration from the first NCPI device may include an act of gathering the at least one device configuration from an uninterruptible power supply (UPS). The method may further include an act of storing the modified at least one device configuration in data storage.","Continuing this example, the method may further include an act of providing the modified at least one device configuration to a second NCPI device. In the method, the act of providing the modified at least one device configuration to the first NCPI device may include an act of providing the modified at least one device configuration to a UPS and the act of providing the modified at least one device configuration to a second NCPI device may include providing the modified at least one device configuration to a power distribution unit (PDU). Additionally, in the method, the act of providing the modified at least one device configuration to the UPS may include an act of providing a configuration file including operational parameters common to the UPS and the PDU.","According to another example, a data center management appliance for configuring an NCPI device is provided. The data center management appliance includes a storage medium, a network interface and a controller coupled to the storage medium and the network interface. The controller is configured to gather at least one device configuration from a first NCPI device via the network interface, modify the at least one device configuration and provide the modified at least one device configuration to the first NCPI device via the network interface. The controller may be further configured to copy at least one configuration file from the first NCPI device. Additionally, the controller may be further configured to gather the at least one device configuration from an uninterruptible power supply (UPS). Moreover, the controller may be configured to store the modified at least one device configuration on the storage medium. In addition, the controller may be configured to provide the modified at least one device configuration to a second NCPI device. Furthermore, the controller may be further configured to provide a configuration file including operational parameters common to a UPS and a PDU.","According to another example, a method for automatically configuring an NCPI device using a data center management appliance is provided. The method includes acts of defining a configuration policy, the configuration policy having an associated NCPI device configuration, determining, by the data center management appliance, at least one NCPI device subject to the NCPI device configuration policy and providing the associated NCPI device configuration to the at least one NCPI device subject to the NCPI device configuration policy. In the method, the act of defining the configuration policy may include an act of defining a configuration policy applicable to the at least one NCPI based on the physical location of the at least one NCPI device. Additionally, in the method, the act of providing the associated NCPI device configuration may include an act of copying at least one configuration file to the at least one NCPI device. Moreover, the act of providing the associated NCPI device configuration may include an act of providing the associated NCPI device configuration to an uninterruptible power supply (UPS).","Continuing this example, in the method, the act of defining the configuration policy may include an act of specifying an event an occurrence of which triggers application of the configuration policy and the method may further include determining that the event has occurred prior to performing the act of determining, by the data center management appliance, the at least one NCPI device subject to the NCPI device configuration policy. Additionally, in the method, the act of defining the configuration policy may include an act of defining a configuration policy applicable to at least two NCPI devices being of different functional types. Moreover, in the method, the act of defining the configuration policy applicable to the at least two NCPI devices may include an act of defining a configuration policy that is applicable to a UPS and a computer room air conditioner.","At least some examples in accord with the present invention relate to systems and processes through which a user configures NCPI devices. An NCPI device may include any device used to provide physical resources, such as power and cooling, and monitoring services, such as environmental and security monitoring, to equipment housed within a data center.

While NCPI devices may include enough computing resources to control the operation of the NCPI device, these computing resources are limited and tailored to support the operation of the NCPI devices. In at least one example, these limited computer resources may be disposed upon a Network Management Card (NMC) such as a UPS NMC available from APC.","The aspects disclosed herein, which are in accord with the present invention, are not limited in their application to the details of construction and the arrangement of components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the drawings.

However, such a system may also perform other functions such as presenting a user interface to allow a user to administer configuration policies. Moreover, the systems described herein may be configured to include or exclude any of the functions discussed herein. Thus the invention is not limited to a specific function or set of functions.

Additionally, aspects may be performed on a client-server or multi-tier system that includes components distributed among one or more server systems that perform various functions. Consequently, the invention is not limited to executing on any particular system or group of systems. Further, aspects may be implemented in software, hardware or firmware, or any combination thereof. Thus, aspects in accord with the present invention may be implemented within methods, acts, systems, system elements and components using a variety of hardware and software configurations, and the invention is not limited to any particular distributed architecture, network, or communication protocol.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","100","102","104","106","102","104","106","108","108","108","102","104","106","108","102","104","106","108","100","100"]},"Various aspects and functions in accord with the present invention may be implemented as specialized hardware or software executing in one or more computer systems including computer system  shown in .

Processor  may be a commercially available processor such as an Intel Xeon, Itanium, Core, Celeron, Pentium, AMD Opteron, Sun UltraSPARC, IBM Power5+, or IBM mainframe chip, but may be any type of processor, multiprocessor or controller. Processor  is connected to other system elements, including one or more memory devices , by bus .","Memory  may be used for storing programs and data during operation of computer system . Thus, memory  may be a relatively high performance, volatile, random access memory such as a dynamic random access memory (DRAM) or static memory (SRAM). However, memory  may include any device for storing data, such as a disk drive or other non-volatile storage device. Various examples in accord with the present invention may organize memory  into particularized and, in some cases, unique structures to perform the aspects and functions disclosed herein.","Components of computer system  may be coupled by an interconnection element such as bus . Bus  may include one or more physical busses, for example, busses between components that are integrated within a same machine, but may include any communication coupling between system elements including specialized or standard computing bus technologies such as IDE, SCSI, PCI and InfiniBand.

The system  allows the user , such as a data center technician or other data center personnel, to interact with the configuration interface  to create or modify an NCPI device configuration or a device configuration policy. An NCPI device configuration specifies one or more values for one or more operational parameters that affect the manner in which the NCPI device operates. For example, with reference to , a device configuration for the UPS  may include values for operational parameters that specify the upper and lower transfer points, frequency tolerance and sensitivity to power changes for the UPS . Thus device configurations provide an organized set of operational parameters that may be targeted to the particular operational parameters and characteristics of specific NCPI devices and that can define the behavior of the NCPI device from an overall, operational perspective.","A device configuration policy may associate one or more NCPI devices with one or more NCPI device configurations. Associations between a device configuration and one or more NCPI devices may be based on a variety of NCPI device characteristics including, among others, the physical location of the NCPI device, a logical group to which the NCPI device belongs, the functional type of the NCPI device and a network segment in which the NCPI device is included. As discussed further below, some examples in accord with the present invention automatically apply device configuration policies to detected NCPI devices. For example, with reference to , the data center management appliance  may apply a device configuration policy that sets the target air temperature of RMAC  based on its physical location in the data center.","According to one example, the configuration interface  includes facilities, such as, for example, code, data, data structures or objects, configured to exchange configuration information with the user .

For example, this information may include configuration information, such as one or more device configurations.","According to various examples, the data center management appliance  includes facilities configured to produce a number device configurations targeted for a variety of NCPI devices. In one example, the data center management appliance  includes facilities configured to produce a single device configuration that may be used to setup multiple NCPI devices. For instance, the data center management appliance  may produce a single device configuration covering both the CRAC  and the RMAC . In this example, the single device configuration may indicate values for operational parameters that are a union of the operational parameters supported by the multiple NCPI devices. Alternatively, the single device configuration may indicate values for operational parameters that are an intersection of the operational parameters supported by the multiple NCPI devices. In another example, the data center management appliance  may produce a separate device configuration for each NCPI device accessible via the network . In this example, each device configuration may indicate values for operational parameters that are specific to one NCPI device.","In various examples, each NCPI device may store a device configuration within a configuration file. These configuration files may include name, value tuples that specify the values to be assigned to operational parameters. In some examples, the data center management appliance  includes facilities configured to modify and store configuration files and to exchange (i.e. receive or provide) configuration files with NCPI devices. In one example, the data center management appliance  may exchange configuration files with NCPI devices using FTP or secure FTP, although other file transfer protocols may be employed without departing from the scope of the invention.","According to other examples, the data center management appliance  includes facilities configured to apply one or more NCPI device configuration policies. In some examples, the data center management appliance  stores a list of NCPI devices and their characteristics. In these examples, the data center management appliance  includes facilities configured to determine that particular NCPI devices are subject to one or more configuration policies by matching the NCPI device attributes targeted by the configuration policies to the characteristics of NCPI devices included in the list.","Further, in these examples, the data center management appliance  has facilities configured to provide device configurations associated with device configuration policies to NCPI devices that are subject to the configuration policies. In one example, the data center management appliance  provides device configurations to NCPI devices by copying configuration files to the NCPI devices using FTP. In addition, in some examples, the data center management appliance  includes facilities configured to apply policies in response to events such as, among other events, detection of a new NCPI device on the network , receiving a request from the user  or on a periodic basis.","Information, including NCPI device configuration policies, may be stored on the data center management appliance  in any logical construction capable of storing information on a computer readable medium including, among other structures, flat files, indexed files, hierarchical databases, relational databases or object oriented databases.

The unique and foreign key relationships and indexes may be established between the various fields and tables to ensure both data integrity and data interchange performance.","Configuration Interface Examples","According to various examples, configuration interface  may provide users with a high degree of flexibility regarding how and when they configure NCPI devices. In these examples, the user  may modify, using the configuration interface , device configurations that are locally stored on the data center management appliance . In addition, the user  may cause the data center management appliance  to exchange device configurations with the NCPI devices via the network . Thus, configuration interface  may be used to design new device configurations or may be used to retrieve an existing device configuration from one NCPI device, create a new device configuration based on the retrieved device configuration and copy the new device configuration to one or more NCPI devices. The formulation of useful systems and methods for conducting these configuration activities is impacted by the unique manner in which the configuration interface  may be structured and organized. Conversely, the elements used and acts performed in these configuration activities impact the attributes and facilities of this example of the configuration interface .","The configuration interface  may provide functionality through a variety of user interface screens and elements that guide the user  through a process of configuring NCPI devices.  illustrate a set of example user interface screens that may be included within the configuration interface .

As shown, the NCPI devices may be indicated in a variety of ways including by displaying the name or the IP address associated with the NCPI device. According to one example, the facilities that gather the list of NCPI devices query NCPI device information stored locally within the data center management appliance . In this example, the data center management appliance  also includes facilities configured to maintain the currency of the NCPI device information, such as event driven components that detect changes to the set of NCPI devices that are accessible via the network  and that modify the locally stored NCPI device information appropriately. In another example, the list gathering facilities of the user interface  search the network  for accessible NCPI devices when the user  opens the user interface screen .","Continuing the illustrated example, the user interface screen  also includes facilities configured to accept indications of one or more members of the NCPI device list  that will be subject to further configuration processing. As shown, both the individual selection elements  and the select all element  are configured to toggle between selected and not selected states when actuated by the user . According to this example, the configuration interface  is configured to further process any member of the NCPI device list  adjacent to a selected individual selection element. In addition, as shown, the configuration interface  is configured to further process all of the members of the NCPI device list  when the select all element  is selected.","In this example of the configuration interface , the navigation elements , ,  and  are common to the user interface screens illustrated in .

Conversely, the next element  is configured to display the subsequent user interface screen when actuated by the user . Also as shown, the cancel element  is configured to discontinue processing by the configuration interface  when actuated by the user .","In this example, the finish element  is configured to provide a new or modified device configuration to the NCPI devices selected for configuration. In some examples, this provision may take the form of a configuration file transfer using a variety of protocols, such as FTP or secure FTP. In other examples, the modified device configuration may be provided using message based protocol, such as HTTP, and examples are not limited to any particular technique of providing device configurations.","In various examples, each of the user interface screens include facilities configured to enable or disable particular navigation elements to suit the needs of the interface screen. In one example, the user interface  disables both the back element  and the finish element . In addition, each of the navigation elements may include additional facilities configured to allow for processing that is specific to the user interface screen in which the navigation element is actuated. For instance, in one example where the back element  is enabled by the user interface , the back element  is configured to cause the user interface screen  to reinitialize, rather than to navigate to a previous user interface screen. In some examples, this reinitialization may cause the user interface screen to repopulate the NCPI device list .","In the example shown in , the next element , when actuated by the user  on the interface screen , is additionally configured to gather a device configuration of each member of the NCPI device list  that is currently selected for further processing. According to this example, the next element  is configured to request or retrieve a current device configuration from some or all of the selected members of the NCPI device list  via the network . In one example, the user interface  may display a progress bar (not shown) to provide the user  feedback regarding the retrieval process. According to another example, the facilities included in the next element  may verify that a device configuration locally stored on the data center management appliance  is current prior to requesting a current device configuration via the network .

The NCPI configuration selector  is configured to display, when actuated by the user , a list of NCPI device configurations that are locally stored on the data center management appliance . In this example, the NCPI configuration selector  is also configured to display, as currently selected, an NCPI device configuration when the user  selects that NCPI device configuration from the list. In addition, in this example, the user interface screen  is configured to deactivate the NCPI configuration selector  when the member of the selection group  proximal the NCPI configuration selector  is not in a selected state.","Within the context of the user interface screen , the next element  includes additional facilities to provide the currently indicated device configuration to the subsequent user interface screen .
