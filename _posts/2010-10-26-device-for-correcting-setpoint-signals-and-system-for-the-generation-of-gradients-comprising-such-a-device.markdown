These coils are controlled by current amplifiers, where their set point usually is given in voltage and generally consists of a train of pulses.","This set point is generated by a digital device whose input is a sequence switch, constituting a programmable pulse generator, and the output is a digital-to-analog conversion stage that provides set-point voltage.","The pulse generator is programmed based on the type of analysis that is to be performed by the spectrometer or the imager.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"A common configuration of such a system makes it possible to generate field gradients along the three axes (X, Y and Z, the latter being collinear with the primary field), as shown in , attached.","Other configurations of systems are also known and employed.","It is also known that, during the variation of the magnetic field in a gradient coil, Foucault currents appear on conductive elements that are outside of the coil and are subject to this field. These currents produce a magnetic field that opposes the field of the gradients.","By taking into consideration, for example, a gradient coil through which a current pulse passes, the build-up time of the magnetic field created by this coil will be influenced by the field that is produced by the Foucault currents. This phenomenon is illustrated in , attached (illustration of the effect of Foucault currents on the magnetic field that is generated by a gradient coil).","The degradation of the gradient field by the one produced by the Foucault currents has a detrimental influence on the performances of the spectrometer or the imager. It is consequently necessary to reduce to the maximum the effect of the Foucault currents on the gradient field.","For this purpose, a correction (of the pre-accentuation type, for example) can be applied to the voltage set point so as to compensate for the effect of the opposite field (, attached, illustrates such a correction of the effects of the Foucault currents).","The digital solutions that are proposed as of this time for making such a correction are primarily of two types: namely the entirely hardware solutions (based on stateful machines, for example), and software solutions (employed on a DSP [digital signal processing] signal-processing microprocessor, for example).","The first type of solution results in a rigid and fixed implementation, and the second type of solution experiences limited performance.","The document U.S. Pat. No. 5,349,296 discloses an NMR imager that integrates in particular a system for supplying gradient coils, able to provide set-point signals specific to each channel and formed from series of codes describing the wave profiles to be applied.","According to this document, the supply system can also integrate, without their nature being specified in advance, means for pre-emphasis correction acting on the analog signals that are delivered to different channels and using predefined parameters.","Thus, these correction means do not act on digital data, and they do not make it possible to make a correction by recursive operation.","The result is a limited, totally fixed correction method whose performance cannot be easily estimated in advance and is in any case limited.","This invention has the object in particular of proposing an improved solution that makes it possible to overcome at least some, and preferably all, of the limitations of the solutions mentioned above.","In addition, the solution that is proposed by the invention should exhibit a flexibility of use on two levels: namely, on the one hand, for the same type of corrective processing to allow the use of parameters for easily modifiable correction, manually or automatically, and, on the other hand, the implementation of corrective processing of different natures, without requiring modification of the hardware structure of the device.","In addition, the solution that is proposed by the invention should also make possible, on the one hand, a good predictability of the performance, and, on the other hand, good management of the use of hardware resources that are implemented because of a simple structure and a simple composition.","For this purpose, the invention has as its object a device for real-time correction of variable set-point or control signals of gradient coils of a spectrometry or imagery device by nuclear magnetic resonance based on factors or coefficients for correction or compensation that are provided, whereby said device is designed to receive at the input original digital set-point signals and to deliver at its output set-point signals that have been modified to compensate for defects, limitations, disruptions, interference, negative effects or the like subsequently encountered during the processing, the transmission, the transformation and\/or the application of said set-point signals,","device characterized","in that it consists of at least one circuit that is based on a microprogrammed structure and composed of several subassemblies that work with digital components essentially comprising a micro-sequencer forming a counter, a memory for storing micro-instructions, and a processing unit combined with at least one working memory and integrating arithmetic calculation modules, and","in that said processing unit is capable of and designed to modify the data of original digital set-point signals by taking into account the factors or coefficients for correction or compensation that are provided and in accordance with the micro-instructions that are addressed by the micro-sequencer in the storage memory and that form a correction algorithm that controls the operation of different operational subassemblies that constitute the correction device and are programmed based on the correction to be implemented. Although numerous applications of this correction device can be envisioned, it is more particularly experienced at present in its implementation in the NMR\/MRI context.","Thus, the invention also relates to a system for the generation of magnetic field gradients essentially comprising means for the generation of a digital set-point signal, for example in the form of a train of pulses, means for conversion and amplification of the set-point signal, if necessary, suitable for one method, and one or more coil(s) for the generation of gradients supplied by the amplified signal(s) provided by the combined conversion and amplification means, if necessary respectively corresponding, whereby said system also comprises a device for correction of the set-point signal before its analog conversion and its amplification, and if necessary, its demultiplication, a system that is characterized in that the correction device is a device as described above.","The correction process that results from the implementation of these different hardware and software arrangements consists in generating, within the context of the production of magnetic field gradients, a real-time correction by a digital device that is inserted between the pulse generator and the digital-to-analog conversion stage in a generation system of the above-mentioned type.","The correction device can, for example, but in a nonlimiting manner, implement a high-pass digital filter so as to apply a pre-accentuation or a pre-distorsion to the set-point signal (see , attached). The digital correction device according to the invention will also be called \u201ccorrector\u201d below.","Since the correction that is provided advantageously can be parameterized (in connection with the characteristics of the gradient coil or the amplifier, for example), the calculations that are performed by the corrector take into consideration coefficients that come from an external device. These coefficients can be calculated based on parameters that are entered manually by the operator or by an automated device.","The above-mentioned parameters, whose use makes it possible to determine the correction coefficients implemented by the correction device, can, for example, be determined or result from measurements that are made in advance and that make it possible to deal with the effects of Foucault currents (see, for example, WO 89\/08852).","Once set, these coefficients no longer vary as long as the components of the system do not change; their calculation therefore does not deal with the real-time aspect contrary to operations performed by the corrector.","However, their values can be easily modified either by the user (programming) or automatically, based on hardware and\/or environmental modifications.","In addition, taking into account its embodiment (microprogrammed structure), the performance expressed in terms of rapidity of processing of the corrector depends essentially on the clock frequency that is applied, and processing cycles of several hundred nanoseconds can be easily achieved. In addition, the performance level of the corrector can be determined in advance.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIGS. 7 to 9"],"b":["1","2"]},"Such a device  is intended to receive at the input original digital set-point signals and to deliver at its output set-point signals that have been modified or corrected to compensate for defects, limitations, disruptions, interference, negative effects or the like encountered subsequently during the processing, the transmission, the transformation and\/or the application of said set-point signals.","According to the invention, said correction device  consists of at least one circuit \u2032 that is based on a micro-programmed structure and consists of several subassemblies , , , , \u2032 that work with digital components that comprise essentially one micro-sequencer  that forms a counter, a micro-instructions storage memory , and a processing unit  combined with at least one working memory (, \u2032) and integrating arithmetic calculation modules , \u2032, and said processing unit  is capable of and intended to modify the data of the original digital set-point signals by taking into account the factors or coefficients for correction or compensation that are provided and in accordance with the micro-instructions that are addressed by the micro-sequencer  in the storage memory  and that form a correction algorithm that controls the operation of different operational subassemblies , , , \u2032 that constitute the correction device  and are programmed based on the correction to be implemented.","According to a first characteristic of the invention, the sequencing of the data at the input register  and the output register \u2032 of said device  as well as the resetting to zero of the micro-sequencer  are controlled by a synchronization signal SYNC whose period is a multiple of the clock signal CLK that concatenates the operation of the different constituent subassemblies.","In addition, the arithmetic calculation modules preferably consist of pipelines (transmission lines arranged in stages).","According to another characteristic of the invention, the working memory(ies) , \u2032 comprise(s) at least a first memory zone  that is intended to store the correction coefficients that are to be applied and at least a second memory zone \u2032 that is intended to store the input datum to be corrected, the intermediate result(s) of the arithmetic operations implemented by the arithmetic calculation modules, and the final result corresponding to the corrected output datum, as well as, if necessary, one or more preceding input datum\/data.","There can be provided either a single working memory comprising at least two separate storage zones  and \u2032 or two separate working memories  and \u2032.","According to an additional characteristic of the invention, said at least one second memory zone \u2032 is also capable of and intended to store the output datum\/data of at least one corrected set-point signal that is produced during at least one prior correction cycle, for example the corrected set-point signal of the preceding cycle, and in that the current corrected set-point signal results from a convolution operation that is implemented by means of the calculation modules , \u2032.","The arrangement and the interconnection of the different subassemblies, in particular memories , \u2032 and calculation modules , \u2032, thus allow a recursive operating mode of the device .","The prediction of storage memories  and working memories , \u2032 as explained above imparts great flexibility to the device . Actually, they make it possible to perform:\n\n","Consistent with an advantageous practical implementation of the invention, and as  of the accompanying drawings illustrates it, the processing unit  also comprises, on the one hand, buses , \u2032 for transmission of operands, optionally combined with at least one multiplexer  that supplies the arithmetic calculation modules , \u2032, based on elementary control signals of the micro-instructions to be executed, with data and coefficients extracted from the working memory(ies) , \u2032 by means of read ports , and, on the other hand, at least one data supply bus  connected to a write port  of the second memory or memory zone \u2032 and optionally to one sign inversion module \u2032, and combined upstream with a multiplexer  that is connected to the outputs of the arithmetic calculation modules , \u2032, to the input register  of the datum to be corrected, if necessary to at least one of the buses , \u2032 for transmission of operands, and optionally to a zeroing register, the state of said multiplexer  also being determined by the elementary control signals of the micro-instructions to be executed.","When the format of the digital data manipulated by the processing unit  and stored in the working memories , \u2032 is different from that or those of the format(s) of digital data at the input (DATA-IN) or at the output (DATA-OUT), it can be provided that the device  also comprises mutually inverse conversion modules , \u2032, at the input and at the output, whereby input data and output data are, for example, coded integers in two's complement ().","Consistent with a very preferred embodiment of the invention, the two conversion modules  and \u2032 respectively consist of a module for conversion of integers into double-precision floating-comma 64-bit numbers, preferably according to the standard IEEE 754, and a similar inverse conversion module. The correction device or corrector  can consequently be easily inserted or fit into a gradient generation system, without modifying the nature of the delivered signals (the modified set-point signal as well as the original set-point signal remain in digital form) and without disrupting the flow of said signals (real-time correction, the correction system introducing a minimal delay that is compatible with the application), this while transposing the data from the digital set-point signals into a format that facilitates the precision of their corrective processing.","Although the invention is described and shown more particularly within the framework of a linear structure, one skilled in the art easily understands that in the case of multiple paths or large quantities of data to be processed, the correction device  can have a vectorial structure and can comprise several circuits \u2032 that are arranged in parallel, each circuit integrating a functional group [micro-sequencer \/storage memory \/processing unit , and working memory(ies) , \u2032].","According to a possible application of the invention, brought out by , the device  can be programmed for implementing three filtering cells  that are arranged in parallel, each cell preferably corresponding to a high-pass digital filter of the first order.","The correction device  has a great flexibility of use and can be used to perform various types of operations on the signal that is to be corrected, for example an amplifier set-point signal. Consequently, it is possible, for example, also to be used to correct the linearity defects of the amplifier of gradients \u2032 in an application in connection with a system  for the generation of magnetic field gradients.","The invention also relates to a system  of the above-mentioned type, which essentially comprises, as  of the accompanying drawings shows it, means , \u2032 for generation of a digital set-point signal, for example in the form of a train of pulses, means for conversion  and amplification \u2032 of the set-point signal and one or more coil(s)  for generation of gradients that are supplied by the amplified signal(s) provided by the associated conversion and amplification means, if necessary respectively corresponding, whereby said system also comprises a device for correction of the set-point signal before its analog conversion and its amplification, and, if necessary, its demultiplication.","This system  is characterized in that the correction device is a device  as described above.","This system  can advantageously consist of a system for the generation of gradients along several axes, whereby a correction device  is associated with each axis.","Finally, the invention also relates to a process for real-time correction of variable set-point or control signals of gradient coils of a spectrometry or imagery device by nuclear magnetic resonance based on factors or coefficients for correction or compensation that are provided, whereby this process uses at least one correction device as described above.","This process is characterized in that it essentially consists, at the level of each correction device , in converting the successive digital data that together form an original set-point signal for gradient coil(s) into data that are suitable for processing by the unit , in processing said converted data into successive operating loops, by means of the arithmetic calculation modules , \u2032 based on micro-instructions that are present in the storage memory  and that form a correction algorithm, by taking into account correction coefficients that are present in the working memory(ies) , \u2032 and by storing the intermediate results, as well as the data that result from the corrective processing also in the working memory(ies), and in converting the data that result from the corrective processing into data with a format that is identical to that of the data of the original set-point signal and forming a part of a corrected set-point signal.","Preferably, the processing of data by the unit  comprises at least one convolution operation, whereby at least the data of the corrected set-point signal that are calculated during the prior cycle are taken into account. The invention will be described below, by way of example, in a more detailed manner and in connection with the accompanying drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0071"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":"1","ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004","list-style":"none"},"li":["The micro-sequencer  that is a counter that makes possible the incrementation of the pointer, or ordinal counter, of the micro-code that is executed,","The processing unit  that consists of basic calculating units or modules , \u2032 as well as multiplexers ,  that make data transfer possible,","The memory  of correction coefficients determined for the current application,","The memory \u2032 of data that contains the intermediate or final results of calculations made by the processing unit ,","The micro-code memory  that contains the microcode that constitutes the micro-program.

The stream of data at the input and output of device  (CORRECTOR_IN and CORRECTOR_OUT) is also synchronized with this clock.","The data registers  and \u2032, as shown in , are refreshed based on a synchronization signal (SYNC) whose period corresponds to an integer that is constant in clock periods CLK. The activation time of the synchronization signal is equal to a clock period. The delay between the data at the input and the corrected data at the output corresponds to the period of the synchronization signal. The start-up of the micro-sequencer  is also conditional on this synchronization signal.","The micro-sequencer  consists of a counter that is controlled by signals of the device (see ). The output (OUT) of the micro-sequencer  corresponds to the current value of the counter.","The control signals of said micro-sequencer  are as follows:\n\n","The output of the micro-sequencer  addresses the memory  that contains the micro-code. The current value of the counter consequently corresponds to the ordinal counter. The clock input (CLK) of the micro-sequencer  is connected to the overall clock of the correction device . The validation input (IN) is controlled by the micro-code, via the signal SEQ_IN, while the restart input is connected to the synchronization signal of the device (SYNC in ). The ordinal counter can therefore be stopped by the micro-code when the calculations have been performed, and then it is restarted (let us recall that the RESTART input has priority over IN) by the synchronization signal so as to perform the calculations on the following data.","The processing unit  was designed so as to use minimal hardware resources while ensuring optimal performances. The performance criteria relate not only to the time of calculation but also to the precision of the latter. The idea of precision of calculations is essential if the corrector  is to implement digital filters with infinite pulse response (RII) of an order that is greater than or equal to 2 (the rounding errors can then bring about instability of the filter).","So as to ensure good precision, the processing unit  advantageously performs calculations with floating-comma numbers that comply with the standard IEEE 754 (or CEI 60559). Lower precision can suffice depending on the use case; fixed-comma numbers can then be used to save resources. The principle of operation would nevertheless remain identical.","The data at the input and at the output (DATA_IN and DATA_OUT) are coded integers in two's complement. At the input, these data are converted into floating-comma numbers (converter =\u201cInt2Float\u201d block), and at the output, the data are converted into integers (converter \u2032=\u201cFloat2Int\u201d block).","The data memory \u2032, which is volatile (of the RAM type), preferably allows three simultaneous accesses to the stored data: two read accesses and one write access, this with three different addresses.","The memory of the coefficients , which is also volatile, is characterized by separate read and write ports , whereby the write port is connected to a bus coming from a device that is outside of the corrector  (see ).","The width of a memory line (data or coefficients) corresponds, in practice, to the size of the floating-comma numbers (for example, 64 bits if it is a \u201cdouble-precision\u201d coding format, according to the standard IEEE 754, or 32 bits in the case of \u201csimple-precision\u201d coding.) The depths of data memory \u2032 and coefficient memory  depend on the type of correction algorithm used.","One of the read ports  of the data memory \u2032 and the read port  of the coefficient memory  are connected to an operand bus  (A-BUS). The source of the operand, located on the A-BUS, is selected via a multiplexer . In other words, the operand that is located on A-BUS can be a stored result (source: data memory \u2032) or a coefficient (source: coefficient memory ) according to the state of the multiplexer . The second operand bus \u2032 (B-BUS) is directly connected to the other read port  of the data memory \u2032.","The operand buses  (A-BUS) and \u2032 (B-BUS) supply arithmetic units or modules , \u2032 for floating-comma numbers: an adder  and a multiplier \u2032. B-BUS also makes it possible to send the data to the converter \u2032 [floating-comma number\/integer].","A bus , referred to as D-BUS, is connected to the write port  of the data memory. A multiplexer  that makes it possible to select the source of the datum to be stored is placed on this bus. This source can be:\n\n","The operand that is located on the bus  (A-BUS) makes it possible to move the data into the data memory \u2032.","Before being placed in the data memory, the sign of a value can optionally be changed (at the inversion module \u2032) so as to store its opposite.","It will be noted that the width of all of the buses , \u2032,  that are mentioned corresponds to the size of the floating-comma numbers.","Without modifying the principle of operation of device , buffer registers can be placed on the access ports of memories , \u2032 so as to increase the frequency of operation of the processing unit . This is equivalent to adding pipeline stages. The operation of the units or modules  and \u2032 that perform the arithmetic operations (adder and multiplier) can also rest on transmission lines. The number of necessary stages is dependent upon the frequency of operation and the technology used.","In addition, so as to accelerate the calculations, the processing can be easily vectored. For this purpose, several subassemblies [processing units \/data and coefficient memories , \u2032] can be placed in parallel while being controlled by the same micro-code.","The cooperative and coordinated operation of the components of the processing unit  and data and coefficient memories , \u2032 is conditioned by control signals that correspond to fields that are contained in the micro-instructions.","The control signals are as follows for the example shown in :\n\n","The micro-code memory  (storage memory of the micro-instructions) is not volatile and has a single access door. Each line of this memory  contains a micro-instruction. Its address bus is connected to the ordinal counter, which corresponds to the output of the micro-sequencer , while its data bus conveys the micro-instructions. The size of the memory  depends on the type of correction algorithm implemented: the number of lines is based on the quantity of micro-instructions to be executed, and the size of a line is related to the quantity of locations of data and coefficient memories to be addressed.","This micro-code memory can be volatile if it proves necessary to improve the flexibility of the correction device  by changing the type of algorithm. This has no influence on the principle of operation of said corrector .","In the example shown in , each micro-instruction is coded in the form of fixed fields, each field containing a control signal. The control signals are those enumerated in the preceding section to which is added the validation signal of the micro-sequencer  (SEQ_IN). The signals A_SEL, A_ADDR, and COEFF_ADDR are combined in a single field. The size of this field corresponds to the size of the largest address bus between A_ADDR and COEFF_ADDR, plus one bit for A_SEL. Actually, through the operand bus, A-BUS (bus ) passes only one datum at a time, which comes either from the data memory \u2032 or the coefficient memory .","Below, a nonlimiting example of implementation of a function by the correction device or corrector  will be described in more detail.","The example that is described below exhibits the use of the corrector  in a system  for the generation of gradients equipped with a single axis, and therefore a single gradient coil  and a single current amplifier \u2032 (as shown in ).","More specifically, the corrector  implements three filtering cells  in parallel in the example that is described (see ).","Each cell  corresponds to a high-pass digital filter of the first order.
