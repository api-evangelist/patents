U.S.C. \u00a7371 of International Application PCT\/JP2009\/068468, filed Oct. 28, 2009, which claims priority to Japanese Patent Application No. 2008-278743, filed Oct. 29, 2008. The International Application was published under PCT Article 21(2) in a language other than English.","The present invention relates to a semi-conductive rubber composition and a vulcanizate thereof, and they are used as a material constituting a developing roll, a charging roll and a transfer roll of an electrophotographic process in a copying machine, a printer and the like.","Since developing, charging and transfer rolls used in a laser printer or the like are in contact with a photoreceptor because of its mechanism, in addition to its semi-conductivity, low hardness, satisfactory compression set and shape retentivity to the ambient environment are required. Commonly, an ethylene-propylene rubber, a urethane rubber, an epichlorohydrin rubber, an acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber and the like have been used in the form of a blend or used alone in response to volume resistivity required to each of conductive, developing and transfer rolls.","There has hitherto been employed, as a method of realizing low hardness of a rubber material, a method of adding a low-viscosity substance such as a process oil or a plasticizer. However, the addition of these plasticizers to a conductive rubber composition is not preferred since there is a fear of contamination on a photoreceptor. Therefore, the addition of a liquid acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber with a low molecular weight has been studied so as to obtain a low-hardness rubber material without causing contamination of the photoreceptor (see Patent Document 1). The addition of the liquid acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber causes adhesion onto the photoreceptor and exerts an adverse influence on compression set. This reason is considered that a low-viscosity liquid rubber is not involved in crosslinking.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":"Patent Document 1: JP-A-2006-91118"}},"Under these circumstances, the present invention has been made and an object thereof is to provide a rubber composition, which realizes low hardness and low compression set while maintaining semi-conductivity, and a vulcanizate thereof. The quinoxaline-based compound used in the present invention is an excellent vulcanizing agent which imparts excellent low compression set to a vulcanizate obtained by vulcanization. However, even in the case of using the quinoxaline-based compound as a vulcanizing agent, the addition of the acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber in the amount enough to lower hardness of the vulcanizate, particularly the addition of the liquid acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber causes severe deterioration of compression set of the vulcanizate obtained by vulcanization, as described above. On the other hand, the addition of the acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber, particularly the addition of a small amount of the liquid acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber scarcely exerts an influence on compression set of a rubber material. However, it is impossible to sufficiently lower hardness of the vulcanizate. An object of the present invention is to solve the above problem in the case of using the quinoxaline-based compound as a vulcanizing agent.","The present inventors have found that the above object can be achieved by blending an epichlorohydrin-based rubber having satisfactory semi-conductivity and an acrylonitrile-butadiene-based rubber as a reactive plasticizer, and also blending zinc oxide, a thiuram-based compound and a quinoxaline-based compound.","That is, the present invention is characterized in that a rubber composition for a semi-conductive vulcanization comprises, based on 100 parts by weight of a blend rubber comprising (a) 50 to 90% by weight of an epichlorohydrin-based rubber and (b) 10 to 50% by weight of an acrylonitrile-butadiene-based rubber, (c) 0.1 to 5 parts by weight of a thiuram-based compound, (d) 1 to 10 parts by weight of zinc oxide and (e) 0.1 to 5 parts by weight of a quinoxaline-based compound.","Preferably, in the rubber composition for a semi-conductive vulcanization of the present invention, the epichlorohydrin-based rubber (a) is an epichlorohydrin-ethylene oxide-allyl glycidyl ether ternary copolymer.","Preferably, in the rubber composition for a semi-conductive vulcanization of the present invention, a number average molecular weight of the acrylonitrile-butadiene-based rubber (b) is from 1,000 to 20,000.","It is preferred that the rubber composition for a semi-conductive vulcanization of the present invention, the thiuram-based compound (c) is a thiuram sulfide-based compound, it is more preferred that the thiuram-based compound (c) is dipentamethylenethiuram tetrasulfide.","It is preferred that the rubber composition for a semi-conductive vulcanization of the present invention, the quinoxaline-based compound (e) is a 2,3-dimercaptoquinoxaline derivative, it is more preferred that the quinoxaline-based compound (e) is 6-methylquinoxaline-2,3-dithiocarbonate.","A semi-conductive vulcanized rubber material of the present invention is preferably obtained by vulcanizing the rubber composition for a semi-conductive vulcanization.","According to the present invention, it is possible to obtain a rubber composition which has semi-conductivity and low hardness, and also exhibits low compression set. A vulcanizate thereof can be widely applied as developing, charging and transfer rolls in a laser printer and a copying machine.","The features of the invention are described in detail below.","Semi-Conductive Rubber Composition","The semi-conductive rubber composition of the present invention refers to a rubber composition before vulcanization, and contains at least an epichlorohydrin-based rubber, an acrylonitrile-butadiene-based rubber, a thiuram-based compound, zinc oxide and a quinoxaline-based compound.","Epichlorohydrin-Based Rubber","In the composition of the present invention, the epichlorohydrin-based rubber refers an epichlorohydrin homopolymer or a copolymer with the other epoxide copolymerizable with epichlorohydrin, for example, ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, allyl glycidyl ether or the like, and examples thereof include an epichlorohydrin homopolymer, an epichlorohydrin-ethylene oxide copolymer, an epichlorohydrin-propylene oxide copolymer, an epichlorohydrin-ethylene oxide-allyl glycidyl ether ternary copolymer, an epichlorohydrin-propylene oxide-allyl glycidyl ether ternary copolymer, an epichlorohydrin-ethylene oxide-propylene oxide-allyl glycidyl ether quaternary copolymer and the like. In the present invention, epichlorohydrin-based rubber is preferably an epichlorohydrin homopolymer, an epichlorohydrin-ethylene oxide copolymer or an epichlorohydrin-ethylene oxide-allyl glycidyl ether ternary copolymer, and particularly preferably an epichlorohydrin-ethylene oxide-allyl glycidyl ether ternary copolymer.","The molecular weight of these homopolymers or copolymers is not particularly limited, and is usually from about 30 to 150 in terms of Mooney viscosity ML(100\u00b0 C.).","In the epichlorohydrin-ethylene oxide-allyl glycidyl ether ternary copolymer, the copolymerization ratio of an epichlorohydrin component is preferably from 5 mol % to 40 mol %, and more preferably from 15 mol % to 40 mol %; the copolymerization ratio of an ethylene oxide component is preferably from 50 mol % to 94 mol %, and more preferably from 55 mol % to 80 mol %; and the copolymerization ratio of an allyl glycidyl ether component is preferably from 1 mol % to 10 mol %, and more preferably from 1 mol % to 5 mol %.","Acrylonitrile-Butadiene-Based Rubber","The acrylonitrile-butadiene-based rubber means a binary copolymer of acrylonitrile and butadiene, or a ternary copolymer of acrylonitrile, butadiene and unsaturated carboxylic acid, and is popularly referred to as a so-called high nitrile (commonly refers to an acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber in which the content of acrylonitrile is from 36 to 42% by weight), medium high nitrile (commonly refers to an acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber in which the content of acrylonitrile is from 31 to 35% by weight), medium nitrile (commonly refers to an acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber in which the content of acrylonitrile is from 25 to 30% by weight), low nitrile (commonly refers to an acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber in which the content of acrylonitrile is 24% by weight or less), carboxynitrile or the like. In the present invention, it is particularly preferred to use a liquid acrylonitrile-butadiene-based rubber having a polystyrene-equivalent number average molecular weight, in the measurement of a molecular weight by a conventional method using gel permeation chromatography (GPO), within a range from 1,000 to 20,000, and more preferably a liquid acrylonitrile-butadiene-based rubber having a number average molecular weight within a range from 3,000 to 10,000. The number average molecular weight is preferably within the above range since hardness of a vulcanizate becomes lower and also it becomes easy to process the composition.","The content of acrylonitrile of the acrylonitrile-butadiene-based rubber used is preferably within a range from 15% by weight to 40% by weight, and more preferably from 20% by weight to 40% by weight. It is not preferred that the content deviates from the above range since a rubber composition is not unified during kneading or a vulcanizate becomes rigid. Also, in the case of the liquid acrylonitrile-butadiene-based rubber, the content of acrylonitrile is preferably within a range from 20% by weight to 40% by weight, and more preferably from 30% by weight to 40% by weight. The content is preferably within the above range since hardness of a vulcanizate becomes lower and also it becomes easy to process the composition.","Regarding the composition of the rubber component in the semi-conductive rubber composition of the present invention, the proportion of the epichlorohydrin-based rubber is preferably from 50 to 90% by weight and the proportion of the acrylonitrile-butadiene-based rubber is preferably from 10 to 50% by weight; and the proportion of the epichlorohydrin-based rubber is more preferably from 60 to 80% by weight and the proportion of the acrylonitrile-butadiene-based rubber is more preferably from 20 to 40% by weight. When the proportion of the epichlorohydrin-based rubber is more than 90% by weight, characteristics of the nitrile rubber are not exhibited, and thus low hardness is not achieved. On the other hand, the proportion of the liquid nitrile rubber is more than 50% by weight, viscosity of the composition becomes very lower and it becomes difficult to process.","Thiuram-Based Compound","Examples of the thiuram-based compound of the present invention include thiuram sulfide-based compounds represented by the following general formula [I]:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"21.84mm","wi":"69.85mm","file":"US08871118-20141028-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sup":["3","4","5 ","6 ","3","4 ","5 ","6 "]},"Specific examples of the thiuram sulfide-based compound having the above structure include tetramethylthiuram disulfide, tetramethylthiuram monosulfide, tetraethylthiuram disulfide, tetrabutylthiuram disulfide, dipentamethylenethiuram tetrasulfide and the like, and dipentamethylenethiuram tetrasulfide is particularly preferred.","The amount of the thiuram-based compound blended is preferably from 0.1 to 5 parts by weight, and more preferably from 0.2 to 5 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of a blend rubber component of the epichlorohydrin-based rubber and the acrylonitrile-butadiene-based rubber. When the amount is more than 5 parts by weight, the vulcanizate becomes too hard. On the other hand, when the amount is less than 0.1 part by weight, vulcanization does not proceed and thus compression set tends to become worse.","Zinc Oxide","In the semi-conductive rubber composition of the present invention, the amount of zinc oxide blended is preferably from 1 to 10 parts by weight, and more preferably from 3 to 8 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of a blend rubber component of the epichlorohydrin-based rubber and the acrylonitrile-butadiene-based rubber. When the amount of zinc oxide is less than 1 part by weight, it is impossible to obtain the sufficient effect of reducing compression set. On the other hand, when the amount is more than 10 parts by weight, hardness of the vulcanizate becomes too high. Also, a transfer roll or the like formed using the rubber composition for a semi-conductive vulcanization of the present invention may have a problem of compression set. However, when the amount is within the above range, the obtained transfer roll or the like can be used without the problem of compression set, favorably. In the present invention, zinc oxide not only reduces the compression set, but also serves as a vulcanization accelerator activator and an acid acceptor.","Acid Acceptor","In the semi-conductive rubber composition of the present invention, only zinc oxide may be used as an acid acceptor. As long as various properties required as the semi-conductive vulcanized rubber material are not impaired, known acid acceptors can be blended according to the vulcanizing agent, and examples thereof include a metal compound and\/or an inorganic microporous crystal. Examples of such a metal compound include an oxide, a hydroxide, a carbonate salt, a carboxylate salt, a silicate salt, a borate salt and a phosphate salt of Group II metals of the Periodic Table; an oxide, a basic carbonate salt, a basic carboxylate salt, a basic phosphate salt, a basic sulfite salt and a tribasic sulfate salt of Group IVA metals of the Periodic Table; and the like.","Specific examples of the metal compound used as the acid acceptor include magnesia, magnesium hydroxide, barium hydroxide, magnesium carbonate, barium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lime, slaked lime, calcium carbonate, calcium silicate, calcium stearate, zinc stearate, calcium phthalate, calcium phosphite, zinc white, tin oxide, litharge, red lead, white lead, bibasic lead phthalate, bibasic lead carbonate, basic lead silicate, tin stearate, basic lead phosphite, basic tin phosphite, basic lead sulfite and tribasic lead sulfate.

Examples of the inorganic microporous crystal include zeolites, an aluminophosphate type molecular sieve, a layered silicate, a synthetic hydrotalcite and an alkaline metal titanate salt. The acid acceptor is particularly preferably a synthetic hydrotalcite.","Examples of the zeolites include natural zeolites, A-, X-, or Y-type synthetic zeolites, sodalites, natural or synthetic mordenites, ZSM-5, and metal-substituted derivatives thereof, and they may be used alone, or two or more kinds thereof may be used in combination. The metal of the metal-substituted derivative is generally sodium. The zeolites preferably have a large acid acceptability, and are preferably an A-type zeolite.","The synthetic hydrotalcite is represented by the following general formula (I):\n\nMgZnAl(OH)COHO\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nwherein x and y are real numbers satisfying the relation of x+y=1 to 10, z is a real number of 1 to 5, and w is a real number of 0 to 10.\n","Examples of the hydrotalcites represented by the general formula (I) include MGAl(OH)CO.3.5HO, MgAl(OH)CO, MgAl(OH)CO.3.5HO, MgAl(OH)CO.4HO, MgAl(OH)CO.4HO, MgAl(OH)CO.7HO, MgZnAl(OH)CO.3.5HO and MgZnAl(OH)CO.","Quinoxaline-Based Compound","Examples of the quinoxaline-based compound include a 2,3-dimercaptoquinoxaline derivative. Specific examples thereof include quinoxaline-2,3-dithiocarbonate, 6-methylquinoxaline-2,3-dithiocarbonate, 6-isopropylquinoxaline-2,3-dithiocarbonate, 5,8-dimethylquinoxaline-2,3-dithiocarbonate and the like, and 6-methylquinoxaline-2,3-dithiocarbonate is preferred.","The amount of the quinoxaline-based compound blended is preferably from 0.1 to 5 parts by weight, more preferably from 0.5 to 5 parts by weight, and still preferably from 1 to 3 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of a blend rubber component of the epichlorohydrin-based rubber and the acrylonitrile-butadiene-based rubber. When the amount is less than 0.1 part by weight, the effect as the vulcanizing agent cannot be expected and the compression set tends to become worse. On the other hand, when the amount is more than 5 parts by weigh, hardness of the vulcanizate becomes too high.","Also, known accelerators (i.e. vulcanization accelerator) used together with the vulcanizing agent, retarders and the like can be used as they are in the semi-conductive rubber composition of the present invention.","Examples of the above vulcanization accelerator include sulfur, thiuram sulfides, morpholine sulfides, amines, weak acid salts of amine, basic silica, quaternary ammonium salts, quaternary phosphonium salts, polyfunctional vinyl compounds, mercaptobenzothiazoles, sulfenamides, dimethiocarbamates and the like.

The volume resistance value within the above range is effective from the view point that stable image quality can be obtained even in the case of printing at a high speed.","The test results of Examples and Comparative Examples obtained by each test method are shown in Table 2.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"119pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"70pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"210pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 2"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},"Example","Comparative Example"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"9"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"119pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"9","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Evaluation results","1","2","1","2","3","4","5","6"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"9","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Hardness","32","33","35","Immold-","Immold-","Immold-","41","Immold-"]},{"entry":["SHORE A",{},{},{},"able","able","able",{},"able"]},{"entry":["Compression set (%)","10","\u20029","20",{},{},{},"10",{}]},{"entry":["JIS K6262 (at 0\u00b0 C. for 22 hours)",{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["Volume (specific) resistance","1.8 \u00d7 10","2.0 \u00d7 10","9.0 \u00d7 10",{},{},{},"2.5 \u00d7 10",{}]},{"entry":"value (\u03a9 \u00b7 cm) at 23\u00b0 C. and 50% RH"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"9","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"The evaluation results shown in Table 2 could reveal that, in Examples, the obtained rubber vulcanizates have low hardness and extremely excellent compression set while maintaining semi-conductivity. On the other hand, in Comparative Example 1, a vulcanizate could be obtained by using a thiuram-based compound and a quinoxaline-based compound. However, since zinc oxide was not blended, deterioration of the compression set due to the addition of a liquid acrylonitrile-butadiene-based rubber (liquid nitrile rubber) was confirmed in comparison with Example 1. In Comparative Example 2, since a thiuram-based compound was not blended, vulcanization could not be accelerated even after press and a rubber material (molded article) could not be obtained. In Comparative Example 3, since zinc oxide and a thiuram-based compound were not blended, vulcanization could not be accelerated even after press. In Comparative Example 4, since zinc oxide and a quinoxaline-based compound were not blended, vulcanization could not be accelerated even after press and a rubber material (molded article) could not be obtained, similar to Comparative Examples 2 and 3. In Comparative Example 5, since the proportion of an epichlorohydrin rubber is high, semi-conductivity could be ensured. However, since the proportion of a liquid nitrile rubber is low, the hardness becomes higher and it was confirmed that a rubber material (molded article) suited for uses such as a semi-conductive roll cannot be obtained. In Comparative Example 6, it was confirmed that since the proportion of a liquid nitrile rubber is high, even when a vulcanizing agent such as a quinoxaline-based compound or a thiuram-based compound is blended, sufficient vulcanization does not proceed and it is in a state where press itself cannot be conducted.","The semi-conductive rubber material obtained by vulcanizing the rubber composition for vulcanization as a subject matter of the present invention is a material which realizes low hardness and low volume specific resistance value and is also excellent in compression set, and can be widely applied as a developing roll, a charging roll and a transfer roll in a laser printer and a copying machine."],"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
