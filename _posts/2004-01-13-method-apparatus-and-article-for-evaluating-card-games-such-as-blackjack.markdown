title: Method, apparatus and article for evaluating card games, such as blackjack
abstract: A system reads an identifier from a hand of cards to identify the cards. For example, the system can read an identifier from a pair of cards forming the initial hand in blackjack, where the one card is face up and the other card is face down. The system determines the value of a hand of cards form the read identifiers. For example, the system can determine a value of an initial hand of two cards in blackjack, while only one card is face up. The system can inform a dealer of the value, or status based on value, of the hand. The system can determine whether cards forming a hand of cards are authenticate by validating the cards based on the read identifier. The system can determine if the cards forming the hand of cards are in an expected sequence based on a knowledge of the initial sequence of cards in a deck.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION","EXAMPLE","SUMMARY"],"p":["This application is a Divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/790,480, filed Feb. 21, 2001, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,685,568, which application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","This invention is generally related to gaming, and particularly to card games, such as blackjack.","Card games are a well-known form of recreation and entertainment. Games are typically played with one or more decks of cards, where each deck typically includes 52 cards. Each deck of cards will typically include four suits of cards, including: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades, each suit including fourteen cards having rank: 2-10, Jack, Queen, King and Ace. Card games may, or may not, include wagering based on the game's outcome.","One popular card game is known as blackjack. In blackjack, one or more players each compete against a dealer. The players attempt to collect a hand having a total value equal to, or as close to twenty-one, without going over. The value of the hand is determined by the rank of the card. Thus, cards having rank 2-10 have the value 2-10, respectively. Face cards (i.e., Jack, Queen, King) have the value 10, while Aces can have the value 1 or 10 at the player's discretion. An initial hand of two cards having the value of twenty-one (i.e., an Ace plus a ten or a face card) is referred to as a natural \u201c21\u201d, or blackjack, and beats other hands with the value of twenty-one. Suits have no bearing on the game of blackjack.","In blackjack, the dealer will initially deal two cards to each of the players and the dealer. The dealer deals in two passes around the table, starting with players at the dealer's far left (i.e., first base) and extending through players at the dealer's far right (i.e., third base) and finally to them self. The players' cards are dealt face up in games where the cards are dealt from a shoe, and face down in hand-held games (i.e., games dealt by hand). The rules of play for the dealer are strictly dictated, leaving no decisions up to the dealer. Therefore, there is not a problem with the dealer, or any of the other players at the table, seeing the cards in a player's hand.","The dealer turns over or is dealt one of the dealer's first two cards face up, such that the value of the card is visible to the players at the table. This card is commonly referred to as the \u201ctop\u201d card. The dealer leaves or is dealt the second card face down, such that the value of the card is not visible to the players at the table. The face down card is commonly referred to as the \u201chole\u201d card. In some variations of blackjack, the dealer will immediately determine the value of the hole card, while in other variations of the game the dealer waits until all players have played their hands before checking the value of the hole card.","The dealer then offers each player in succession, from the dealer's left to right the opportunity to accept additional cards from the deck. Each player's hand is completed before the dealer offers the next player the opportunity to receive additional cards. Accepting cards is commonly referred to as \u201chitting\u201d or taking a \u201chit.\u201d At each player's turn, the player may accept cards, one at a time, trying to build a hand with a value as close to twenty-one as possible, without going over twenty-one. The player may decline further cards at anytime, which is commonly referred to as \u201cstanding.\u201d The player must terminate play if the value of the player's hand exceeds twenty-one. A hand with a value exceeding twenty-one is commonly referred to as a \u201cbust\u201d or \u201cbusted.\u201d If the player busts, or has a natural twenty-one (i.e., blackjack), the dealer must complete the player's hand and place that player's cards into a discard holder. Before receiving a third card after the initial hands are dealt, a player can split the player's initial hand. This is commonly referred to as splitting. The player uses one of the initial cards to form a new hand, placing a wager for the new hand, and retains the other of the initial cards as a part of the original hand.","After each player in turn has declined to accept further cards, the dealer may accept further cards from the deck, with goal of obtaining a hand having a value as close to twenty-one as possible, without exceeding twenty-one. Casinos have rules based on the value of the dealer's hand that dictate when the dealer must take an additional card from the deck (i.e., hit) and when the player must decline further additional cards (i.e., stand). For example, many casinos require the dealer to stand if the dealer's hand has a value of seventeen or more. Some, casinos permit the dealer to take an additional card if the value of the dealer's hand is a soft seventeen, that is, if the value of the dealer's hand is seventeen by counting an Ace held by the dealer as eleven.","If the dealer busts, players who have not also busted win. If the dealer does not bust, all remaining players and the dealer must display their hands to allow the dealer to compare each of the player's hands to the dealer's hand. Those players having a hand with a higher value than the dealer's hand, and who have not exceed twenty-one win. The winning players are paid based on the size of their wager and the odds. Blackjack includes additional rules such as \u201cdoubling down\u201d and \u201cinsurance\u201d bets, and other variations that are commonly known by those who play blackjack, and will not be further described in the interest of brevity.","Blackjack is particularly popular in casinos and other gaming establishments. Players wager large sums of money while playing blackjack. Thus, it is important to ensure that those playing the game are not cheating. It is also important to monitor the game in a relatively unobtrusive manner to allow casino customers to feel comfortable in their surroundings.","In one aspect, a system reads an identifier from a hand of cards to identify the cards. For example, the system can read an identifier from a pair of cards forming the initial hand in blackjack, where one card of the pair is face up and the other card is face down.","In another aspect, a system determines the value of a hand of cards. For example, the system can determine a value of an initial hand of two cards in blackjack, while only one card is face up. In another aspect, the system can inform a dealer of the value, or status based on value of the hand.","In a further aspect, a system can determine whether cards forming a hand of cards are authentic by validating the cards based on an identifier read from each of the cards forming the hand. In yet a further aspect, a system can determine if the cards forming a hand of cards are in an expected sequence based on a knowledge of the initial sequence of cards in a deck.","In the following description, certain specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of various embodiments of the invention. However, one skilled in the art will understand that the invention may be practiced without these details. In other instances, well-known structures associated with cameras, optics, computers, computer networks, data structures, databases and networks such as the Internet, have not been described in detail to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the descriptions of the embodiments of the invention.","Unless the context requires otherwise, throughout the specification and claims which follow, the word \u201ccomprise\u201d and variations thereof, such as \u201ccomprises\u201d and \u201ccomprising\u201d are to be construed in an open, inclusive sense, that is as \u201cincluding but not limited to.\u201d","System Environment",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","12","14","15","16","16","17","17","18","10"]},"The client computing systems  each include a display , screen , cabinet , keyboard  and mouse . The mouse  can have one or more user selectable buttons for interacting with a graphical user interface (\u201cGUI\u201d) displayed on the screen . The cabinet  includes a slot  for receiving computer-readable media, such as a CD-ROM disk . Although the computer-readable media is represented as a CD-ROM disk , the card game evaluation system  can employ other computer-readable media, including but not limited to, floppy disks, tape, flash memory, system memory, and hard drives. The CD-ROM disk  can hold software applications discussed in detail below.","The server computing system  includes a cabinet  having a slot  for receiving computer-readable media, such as a CD-ROM disk similar to the CD-ROM disk . The server computing system  can optionally include a display, screen, keyboard, and\/or mouse as described above. The server computing system  also includes a server database . The server database  is shown as being external to the cabinet  for ease of representation in the drawings, although in many embodiments the server database  can be located within the cabinet .","The card hand reader  has a slot  sized and dimensioned for receiving a hand of cards, such as the dealer's initial hand  which consists of the face up top card  and the face down hole card . An indicator light  is placed on the card hand reader  such that it is visible to the dealer. As described in detail in commonly assigned U.S. patent application 60\/259,658, filed Jan. 4, 2001, and entitled \u201cMethod, Apparatus And Article for Verifying Card Games, Such As Blackjack,\u201d the card hand reader  is capable of reading an identifier associated with each of the cards , . The identifier can be encoded, for example, in a machine-readable symbol such as a bar code, or in a magnetic strip, carried by the card , . The identifier may take the form of a unique identifier, such as a serial number that uniquely identifies each card in the deck of cards, and\/or the rank and\/or suit of the cards , . As illustrated, the card hand reader  can be directly connected to one of the client computing systems , or can be coupled to a client computing system  via the network .","The card deck reader can take a hand-held form A for games dealt by hand, or can take a card shoe form B for games dealt from a card shoe. The hand-held card deck reader A includes a slot  sized and dimensioned to receive one or more decks of playing cards . The dealer can insert the deck  into the slot  prior to beginning a game. The shoe card deck reader B contains one or more decks of playing cards , and includes a slot  sized and dimensioned to allow the dealer to remove one card at a time. The card deck reader A, B is capable of reading a unique identifier such as a serial number, identifying each card in the deck of cards , and\/or the rank and suit of the cards in the deck of cards . A similar reader is described in commonly assigned patent applications: Ser. No. 60\/130,368 filed Apr. 21, 1999 and Ser. No. 09\/474,858 filed Dec. 30, 1999 and entitled \u201cMethod and Apparatus For Monitoring Casino Gaming.\u201d Thus, the sequence of the cards in the deck  is known to the card game evaluation system  at the start of the game. As illustrated, the card deck reader A, B can be directly connected to one of the client computing systems , or can be coupled to a client computing system  via the network .","The discard shoe A, B includes a slot  for receiving cards collected by the dealer after the hands are completed. The discard shoe includes suitable electronics and\/or optics for identifying the cards placed in the slot , for example by reading a unique identifier such as a serial number or the rank and suit of each card, as described in detail below.","The network  can take the form of any conventional network, such as one or more local area networks (\u201cLANs\u201d), wide area networks (\u201cWANs\u201d), and\/or extranets, intranets, or the Internet.","Low-Level System",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["12","12","20","26","28","12","36","38","40","42","44","46","48","50","52","12"]},"The client computing systems  can take any of a variety of forms, such as a micro- or personal computer, a mini-computer, a workstation, or a palm-top or hand-held computing appliance. The processor  can take the form of any suitable microprocessor, for example, a PENTIUM II, PENTIUM III, PENTIUM IV, POWER PC 603 or POWER PC 604 processor. The system memory  can take the form of random access memory (\u201cRAM\u201d) or other dynamic storage that temporarily stores instructions and data for execution by the processor . The fixed persistent memory  can take the form of a hard drive or other nonvolatile computer-readable media. The media drive  can take the form of a CD-ROM reader, a DVD reader, an optical disk reader, floppy disk reader, or other similar device that reads instructions and\/or data from computer-readable media.","While not shown in detail, the server computing system  can have a similar structure to the client computing systems , as shown in FIG. . In practice, the server computing system  will typically take the form of a network server, the details of which are commonly understood by those skilled in the art.","The computing systems ,  are illustrative of the numerous computing systems suitable for use with the present invention. Other suitable configurations of computing systems will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art. Other configurations can include additional subsystems, or fewer subsystems, as is suitable for the particular application. For example, a suitable computing system ,  can include more than one processor  (i.e., a multiprocessor system) and\/or a cache memory. The arrows  are illustrative of any interconnection scheme serving to link the subsystems. Other suitable interconnection schemes will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art. For example, a local bus could be utilized to connect the processor  to the system memory  and the display adapter .","Discard Card Reader",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIGS. 3 and 4","b":["60","16","60","61"]},"The machine-readable symbol can be printed on an end  of a face  of the cards  (shown in FIG. ). The machine-readable symbol is preferably printed such that it is not visually perceptible to humans. For example, the machine-readable symbol can be printed in an ink that is visible only under a particular wavelength of light, such as ultraviolet. Alternatively, the machine-readable symbol can be incorporated into the design on the face  of the card, such that the symbol blends in with the design. In a further alternative, the machine-readable symbol can be printed in a magnetic ink. The identifier is preferably printed on a front face (i.e., face with rank and suit indicia) of the cards .","A card guide  holds the cards  and ensures that the cards  are properly positioned with respect to a set of reading components, such as electronics and optical components, described below. The card guide  includes a card support surface . The card support surface  is sloped with respect to a base of the discard shoe  (FIG. ), to hold the cards  in the discard shoe  such that the cards  are slightly shifted or staggered with respect to adjacent cards (as shown in ) when the discard shoe  is on the horizontal playing surface  of the gaming table (not shown). A bottom end wall  supports the cards  on the sloped card support surface , and forms an acute angle  therewith. An angle  of approximately 45 degrees is suitable. A top end wall  is transparent, or has a window formed therein, to expose the ends  of the faces  of the cards  in the card guide . Side walls  help ensure the cards  are properly aligned to form a stack within the card guide .","The reading electronics and optics can include an optical lens assembly , a reflector , and an imager  aligned along an optical path illustrated by broken line arrow . The optical lens assembly  can include one or more optical lenses and filters. For example, a 9.9 FL lens assembly available from Sunex Inc., Carlsbad, Calif., part number DSL900, can serve as a suitable optical lens. Also for example, the optical lens assembly  can include a narrow band pass filter that passes light having a wavelength of approximately 450 nanometers, while stopping other light, such as light coming directly from an illumination source . A suitable filter is available from Edmond Scientific, of Barrington, N.J., as part number 00151-11859.","The imager  includes photo-sensitive elements, such as charged-coupled devices (\u201cCCDs\u201d) and suitable electronics for producing a digital representation of a captured image. A CMOS color sensor, such as the CMOS color sensor available from Photobit Corporation, Pasadena, Calif., part number PB300, can serve as a suitable imager .","The reflector  can be positioned at an angle, such as a 45 degree angle, to the top end wall  and the imager  to pass an image of the ends  of the cards  to the imager . The discard card reader  can include additional optical components, such as reflectors, defractors, splitters, polarizers, filters and lenses, where such would be suitable to the particular application. For example, the discard card reader  can include an aperture  between the reflector  and the top end wall , which can improve the field of depth of the imager . The optical path  is defined by the optical properties and position of the optical components, and thus does not necessarily have to be a straight line. Many of the components can be housed in an arm , formed from a pair of molded plastic halves.","The discard card reader  includes an illumination system  having one or more illumination sources  that provide low intensity illumination for the cards . The illumination sources  can take the form of one or more lamps. The illumination sources  produce light suitable to the particular embodiment. For example, the discard card reader  can employ illumination sources  that produce predominately UV light where the machine-readable symbols are only visible under UV illumination. Suitable lamps can include ultraviolet (\u201cUV\u201d) lamps available from JKL Components Corporation of Pacoima, Calif., as part number BF350-UV1, having a diameter of 3 millimeters and a length of 50 millimeters. The illumination sources  are located proximate the top end wall  of the card guide . The illumination sources  receive power from a high voltage power inverter  via a printed circuit board  that receives power from a 5V power source . A suitable high voltage power inverter is available from JKL Components Corporation as part number BXA 501A.","The discard card reader  is coupled to the network  or host computer  by way of a connector , such as a FIREWIRE connector or Universal Serial Bus (\u201cUSB\u201d) connector. For example, a FIREWIRE connector available from Molex Electronics, Ltd. of Canada, part number 52462-0611, can serve as a suitable connector . The connector  can deliver the digital representation of the captured image to the appropriate client computing system  for image processing and card validation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":"60"},"The embodiment shown in  is particularly suited for reading up to two decks of cards, the imager  typically having a field of view encompassing up to two decks. The embodiment of  has a similar field of view and moves field of view relative to the cards to incrementally read all of the cards in the discard shoe .","The discard card reader  employs an actuator, such as a jack screw or a hydraulic actuator , to incrementally move the cards past the field of view of the imager . The actuator  moves the card support surface  to incrementally pass the cards  by the aperture . The card support surface  is slidably mounted with respect to the bottom end wall , top end wall  and side walls . The card support surface  can include a number of tabs  which fit in grooves  formed in the side walls  to guide the card support surface  as it advances upward and downward in the card guide . The tops and bottoms of the grooves can serve as stops to limit the travel of the card support surface . The discard card reader  can, of course, employ other guide mechanisms, or may function without such a mechanism. While the illustrated embodiment shows the actuator  moving the cards , other embodiments can move the reflector , imager , and\/or one or more of these components to sweep the field of view of the imager  across all of the cards  in the card guide .","The hydraulic actuator  includes a cylinder  and piston , which is moved relative to the cylinder  by controlling the pressure within the cylinder  via a reservoir , valve  and conduit . The discard card reader  can of course employ other types of actuators  The valve  is operated by a solenoid  that is controlled via a processor, such as a microprocessor  mounted on the circuit board .","The discard card reader  includes one or more position sensors  that detect the position of the card support surface , the piston , or the cards  to determine the height of cards in the card guide . This allows the microprocessor  to activate the solenoid to adjust the level of the card support surface  so that the cards are properly positioned with respect to the aperture  to be imaged. The position sensors  can take the form of optical switches, mechanical switches, or magnetic switches. For example, an optical switch can take the form of a light source, such as a light emitting diode (\u201cLED\u201d), and a light sensor opposed to the light source across the card guide . The insertion of the cards  between the light source and light sensor interrupts the reception of light by the light sensor, that acts as the switch. Also for example, a conductor mounted on, or forming a part of, the card support surface  can contact one of a number of conductors on the side walls  to close a circuit, providing an indication of the position of the card support surface , and hence the position of the cards . Similarly, a magnet mounted on the card support surface  or piston  can pass one of a number of magnetic sensors such as a reed switch to provide position information to the microprocessor .","The discard card reader  incrementally reads groups of cards. The microprocessor  can be programmed to advanced the cards in set increments, for example \u00bc inch increments, past the aperture . The microprocessor employs the position of the cards  as a trigger for advancing the cards. For example, a signal from a single position sensor  positioned above the aperture  can indicate that there are cards  in the card guide  that have not been read. The microprocessor  advances the cards by activating the solenoid  to open and close the value  to the reservoir , thereby controlling the flow of a fluid, such as air, into the cylinder . The discard card reader  can employ other methods of positioning the cards, for example turning a jack screw coupled to the card support surface .","Magnetic Discard Card Reader",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["60","90","90","91","73","54","61","91","92","76"]},"Software","As shown in , the system memory  of the client computing system  and server computing system  contain instructions and data for execution by the respective processors  for implementing the illustrated embodiments. For example, the system memory  includes an operating system (\u201cOS\u201d) ,  to provide instructions and data for operating the respective computing systems , . In the case of the client computing systems  the OS  can take the form of conventional operating systems, such as WINDOWS 95, WINDOWS 98, WINDOWS NT 4.0 and\/or WINDOWS 2000, available from Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash. In the case of the server computing system , the OS  can take the form of conventional server operating systems, such as WINDOWS NT 4.0 Server, and\/or WINDOWS 2000 Server, also available from Microsoft Corporation. The OS ,  can include application programming interfaces (\u201cAPIs\u201d) (not shown) for interfacing with the various subsystems and peripheral components of the computing systems , , as is conventional in the art. For example, the OS ,  can include APIs for interfacing with a display subsystem , , keyboard , sound subsystem ,  and communications or network subsystem .","The system memory  of the client and server computing systems ,  can also include additional communications or networking software (not shown) for wired and\/or wireless communications on networks, such as local area networks (\u201cLANs\u201d), wide area networks (\u201cWANs\u201d), or the Internet. For example, the client computing system  can include a Web client or browser for communicating across the World Wide Web portion of the Internet using standard protocol (e.g., Transportation Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol (\u201cTCP\/IP\u201d), User Datagram Protocol (\u201cUDP\u201d)). A number of Web browsers are commercially available, such as NETSCAPE NAVIGATOR from America Online, and INTERNET EXPLORER available from Microsoft of Redmond, Wash. The server computing system  can include a Web server, such as any of the many commercially available Web server applications.","The system memory  of the a client computing system  includes instructions and\/or data in the form of a decoding application  for resolving the digital image into machine-readable symbols and converting the machine-readable symbols into their respective identifiers and\/or ranks and suits. Software for resolving digital images into machine-readable symbols and converting the machine-readable symbols into identifiers is commonly known in the automatic data collection (\u201cADC\u201d) arts. The system can additional, or alternatively, include other software for reading and converting other types of identifiers, such a magnetic strips.","The system memory  of the client computing system  also includes instructions and\/or data in the form of an evaluation application  for determining the value and\/or status of the hand (e.g., blackjack or not). The evaluation application  also can authenticate the cards in the hand (i.e., determine that the cards belong to the deck being played), and validate the sequence of the cards comprising the hand with respect to a known sequence of cards for the deck (i.e., no cards missing or inserted).","Overall Method",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIGS. 9-12"],"b":["100","10","10","10"]},"The method  starts at step , for example in response to the insertion of a deck of cards into the deck reader.

For example, the rule may require the dealer to stand if the value of the dealer's is 17 or more. Under some rules, the dealer may take another card if the value of the dealer's hand is a soft 17 (i.e., Ace counted as eleven). If the dealer does not stand, the dealer takes an additional card in step , and returns to step , repeating the process - until the dealer's hand is complete or the dealer stands. If the dealer stands, control passes to step .","In step , the dealer compares the dealer's hand to the players' hands, starting with the player on the dealer's far right (i.e., third base).
