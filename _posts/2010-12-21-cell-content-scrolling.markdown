{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The field generally relates to computer user interfaces for displaying tabular data. More particularly, the field relates to cell alignments and cell content scrolling for displaying tabular data.","Data reports typically include data which is displayed in the form of a table. There may be instances where the table size is greater than the window size available to display the table on a computer user interface. In some instances, the table may include merged cells in one column or row which may be common in its correspondence to a plurality of cells in other columns or rows. Currently available techniques align the text in merged cells at the top of the merged cells or in the middle of the merged cells irrespective of the scroll bar position. When a user scrolls through the window to view the table, the text in the merged cells may not always be visible next to the corresponding data in cells of the other columns or rows. However, it would be desirable to display the text of the merged cells along with corresponding data in cells from other columns or rows.","Various embodiments of systems and methods for cell content scrolling are described herein. The methods and systems involve retrieving one or more table parameters, the one or more table parameters including size of currently invisible cells in a display window, size of merged cells, the display window size and text size in the merged cells, calculating a position of a text in a visible portion of merged cells based on the table parameters and displaying the text in the merged cells based on the calculated position of the text.","These and other benefits and features of embodiments of the invention will be apparent upon consideration of the following detailed description of preferred embodiments thereof, presented in connection with the following drawings.","Embodiments of techniques for cell content scrolling are described herein. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of various embodiments. One skilled in the relevant art will recognize, however, that the invention can be practiced without one or more of the specific details, or with other methods, components, materials, etc. In other instances, well-known structures, materials, or operations are not shown or described in detail to avoid obscuring aspects of the invention.","Reference throughout this specification to \u201cone embodiment\u201d, \u201cthis embodiment\u201d and similar phrases, means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the present invention. Thus, the appearances of these phrases in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment. Furthermore, the particular features, structures, or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments.","Business Intelligence (BI) reports store data in the form of tables. The BI reports are generally large report documents including many fields or cells. In some instances, cells in the report are merged, the text in the merged cells may be common to other cells in the table. On scrolling the report, the text in the merged cells may have to be displayed according to the scrolled report. In order to achieve the function of the text being displayed throughout the report, a position of the text needs to be calculated. According to one embodiment, the position of the text is calculated based on table parameters. The table parameters may be size of invisible cells in a display window, size of cells, size of the text in the cells, size of display window, and the like. The text may be displayed in the merged cells according to a calculated position of the text. According to one embodiment, the text may be displayed in merged cells columns based on a scroll bar position. According to another embodiment, the text may be displayed in merged cells rows based on a scroll bar position.","According to yet another embodiment, the report may be scrolled by scrolling the text in the merged cells. As the text is moved in the merged cells, the calculated position of the text varies accordingly, to allow display of data in corresponding cells.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIGS. 1A to 1D","FIG. 1A"],"b":["100","105","110","115","110","120","125","130","135","120","125","130","135","115","120"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["205","210","215"]},"According to an embodiment, the text position may be calculated for displaying text in merged cells column. When the text position is calculated for merged cells column, table parameters may be height of currently invisible cells, height of the merged cells column, height of the display window, height of the text in the column.","According to an embodiment, the text position may be calculated for displaying text in merged cells row. When the text position is calculated for merged cells row, table parameters may be width of currently invisible cells, width of the merged rows, width of the display window, width of the text in the row.","In one embodiment, the text in the merged cells itself may be used as a scroll bar. Scrolling the tabular report according to the position of the text in the merged cells includes scrolling according to a logical behavior of the text in the merged cells. The logical behavior of the text includes moving the tabular report up on scrolling the text down and vice versa in vertically merged cells column. The logical behavior of the text includes moving the tabular report from left to right on scrolling the text from right to left and vice versa in horizontally merged cells row.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","305","310","325","315","300","320"]},"The position of the text \u201cY\u201d is calculated by using table parameters as follows:\n\n()*()\/(2)\u2003\u2003(1),\n\nwhere\n","Y=position of text in the merged cells column","V=position of the tabular report above the display window","P=position of the merged cells column in the tabular report","C=height of merged cells column","T=height of text","W=height of window displaying the visible portion of the tabular report","Wm=margin of the scrolling area inside the display window","According to one embodiment, the position of the text \u201cY\u201d is proportional to the difference between position of the tabular report above the display window and the position of the merged cells column in the tabular report, as modified by the margin of the scrolling area. According to another embodiment, the position of the text \u201cY\u201d is proportional to the difference between height of merged cells and height of text.","According to yet another embodiment, the position of the text \u201cY\u201d is inversely proportional to the difference between height of merged cells and height of windows. This difference is modified by the margin of the scrolling area.","Consider an example of . In the scenario,","the display window height W is 19*20=380 pixels","the scrollable margin Wm=20 pixels","height of each cell in the table=20 pixels.","the position of the tabular report above the display window V is 100*20=2000 pixels","the position of the merged cell in the tabular report P=is 2020 pixels.","height of merged cells column in the report C=53*20=1060 pixels.","In , the position of the tabular report above the display window \u2018V\u2019 is 2000 pixels. Substituting the values in the equation (1),\n\n=(2000\u22122020+20)(1060\u221220)\/(1060\u2212380+2*20)=0\n\nSince the calculated position of the text is 0, the text is positioned at a top portion of the merged cells column.\n","In , the user scrolls the report by scrolling the scroll bar . The user scrolls down by 2 cells. The position of the tabular report above the window \u2018V\u2019 accordingly changes from 2000 to 2040. The position of the visible portion of the merged cells column changes accordingly to 2040 pixels. As a result, the top of 3row of the table is displayed at the top of the window.","Substituting the values in the equation (1),\n\n=(2040\u22122020+20)(1060\u221220)\/(1060\u2212380+2*20)=57.77\n\nThe obtained result may be rounded to 58 for display. As shown in , the merged cell text \u201c2001\u201d is displayed alongside the cell containing \u201cweek\u201d 4, which is displayed at 60 pixels from the top of the merged cell as shown in .\n","In , the user continues to scroll down to view half of \u201cweek\u201d 19. So, there is 18 and a half weeks hidden. So, V\u2212P=18.5*20=370 pixels\n\n2020+370=2390 pixels\n","Substituting the values in the equation (1),\n\n=(2390\u22122020+20)(1060\u221220)\/(1060\u2212380+2*20)=563.33 pixels.\n\nIn , the text is displayed at 563.33\/20=28.16 cells from the top, so the text is displayed below \u201cweek\u201d 29.\n","In , the user scrolls down to \u201cweek\u201d 36.\n\n35*20=700 pixels\n\n2020+700=2720 pixels\n\nSubstituting the values in the equation (1) results in Y=1040.\n","In , the height of the merged cell is 1060 and the text height is 20 pixels.

Substituting the values in equation (1) results in 541.66. The position of the text associated with the week 27 (i.e. row ) is 27*20=540. Here, the text is positioned at week 28 since the value of the calculated position of the text is closer to the position of week 28, than week 29.","In one embodiment, the text itself, positioned at week 31, may be used to scroll the report. Scrolling the report using the text accordingly scrolls the scroll bar . When the text positioned at week 31 is used to scroll the report, the table parameters are varied accordingly. Whenever the table parameters vary, the position of the text also varies.","According to another embodiment, the process described above may be used to calculate the position of the text in merged rows.
