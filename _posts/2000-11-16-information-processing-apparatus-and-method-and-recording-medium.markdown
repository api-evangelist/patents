With the IEEE 1394 serial bus, a controlling electronic apparatus issues an AV\/C (Audio Video\/Control) command to a controlled electronic apparatus for controlling it.","For the middleware for hiding AV\/C commands for from various application software programs, HAVi (Home Audio\/Video interoperability) architecture (trademark) is known. According to this HAVi, electronic apparatuses are controlled by a device control module (DCM).","Conventionally, in order to avoid control conflict, only one apparatus control is available for one electronic apparatus (under control) although two or more control apparatuses have two or more DCMs of different versions on a single network.","Consequently, some control apparatuses do now allow users to selectively use desired capabilities of these control apparatuses; namely, there is no other way for users to accept what is given as it is by these control apparatuses.","It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an information processing apparatus, an information processing method, and a recording medium which allow users to select a desired device control module from among plural device control modules to control electronic apparatuses under control.","In carrying out the invention and according to one aspect thereof, there is provided an information processing apparatus for controlling another electronic apparatus through a network, comprising: retrieving means for retrieving information associated with control over another electronic apparatus; storage means for storing a plurality of pieces of the information retrieved by the retrieving means; selecting means for selecting a desired piece of information from among the plurality of pieces of information; registration means for registering the desired piece of information as only information that can control another electronic apparatus on the network; and control means for controlling another electronic apparatus on the basis of the desired piece of information registered by the registration means.","The above-mentioned information processing apparatus further comprises display control means for controlling display of the plurality of pieces of information stored in the storage means.","The storage means of the above-mentioned information processing apparatus comprises information distinguishing means for distinguishing the desired piece of information selected by the selecting means from other information not selected by the selecting means.","The above-mentioned information processing apparatus further comprises deletion determining means for determining whether to delete the desired piece of information and deleting means for deleting the desired piece of information if the same is determined for deletion by the deletion determining means.","The retrieving means of the above-mentioned information processing apparatus retrieves the information associated with control of another electronic apparatus from a predetermined recording medium in accordance with a predetermined procedure.","The network of the above-mentioned information processing apparatus is constituted by an IEEE. 1394 serial bus.","The retrieving means of the above-mentioned information processing apparatus retrieves the information associated with control of another electronic apparatus from another electronic apparatus in accordance with a predetermined procedure.","The predetermined procedure of the above-mentioned information processing apparatus is executed when one of events takes place, the events being connection of another electronic apparatus to the network and occurrence of a bus reset.","The selecting means of the above-mentioned information processing apparatus makes the selecting operation when one of events takes place, the events being connection of another electronic apparatus to the network and occurrence of a bus reset.","The selecting means of the above-mentioned information processing apparatus selects information having a most recent version as the desired piece of information from among the plurality of pieces of information stored in the storage means.","The retrieving means of the above-mentioned information processing apparatus comprises determination means for determining an identification code of the desired piece of information, wherein, if the identification code is found a new identification code, the retrieving means retrieves the information.","The identification code of the above-mentioned information processing apparatus is an application programming interface code.","The identification code of the above-mentioned information processing apparatus is a version name.","An information processing method for an information processing apparatus for controlling another electronic apparatus through a network, the method comprising the steps of: retrieving information associated with control over another electronic apparatus; storing a plurality of pieces of the information retrieved in the retrieving step; selecting a desired piece of information from among the plurality of pieces of information; registering the desired piece of information as only information that can control another electronic apparatus on the network; and controlling another electronic apparatus on the basis of the desired piece of information registered in the registration step.","A recording medium recording a computer-readable program for information processing for controlling another electronic apparatus through a network, the program comprising the steps of: retrieving information associated with control over another electronic apparatus; storing a plurality of pieces of the information retrieved in the retrieving step; selecting a desired piece of information from among the plurality of pieces of information; registering the desired piece of information as only information that can control another electronic apparatus on the network; and controlling another electronic apparatus on the basis of the desired piece of information registered in the registration step.","The information processing apparatus, information processing method, and the programs recorded on a recording medium retrieve plural pieces of information associated with controlling other electronic apparatuses, store the retrieved plural pieces of information, select a desired piece of information from these plural pieces of information, register the selected information as only the information that can control other electronic apparatuses on a network, and control other electronic apparatuses on the basis of the registered information. This novel constitution allows the user to control electronic apparatuses by use of desired device control modules and specifically manage the versions of these device control modules.","This invention will be described in further detail by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings.","Now, referring to , there is shown a configuration of a home network system. This system comprises an IRD  and a DVCR  which are connected to an IEEE 1394 serial bus . When connected to the IEEE 1394 serial bus , the DVCR  sends a DCM (Device Control Module) and an FCM (Functional Component Module) to be described later to the IRD  through the IEEE 1394 serial bus . From the received information (DCM and FCM), the IRD  detects a connection state of apparatuses connected to the IEEE 1394 serial bus and displays a GUI (Graphical User Interface) for controlling the connected apparatuses onto a built-in LCD (Liquid Crystal Display)  (refer to ).","Based on the information displayed on the LCD , the user operates a touch pad  (refer to ) attached to the IRD  to specify processing to be executed by the DVCR  connected to the IEEE 1394 serial bus . Based on the command given by the user, the IRD  generates a control signal and supplies it to the DVCR  through the IEEE 1394 serial bus . Based on the received control signal, the DVCR  executes the processing such as recording or reproduction of video or audio data for example.","The IRD  is configured as shown in  for example. A signal sent from the DVCR  is inputted in a CPU (Central Processing Unit)  via the IEEE 1394 serial bus , an IEEE 1394 interface , and an internal bus . When the touch pad  is operated by the user, a signal indicative of the operation is inputted in the CPU  via an input\/output interface  and the internal bus . The touch pad  can be operated according to messages shown on the LCD . It should be noted that the IRD  may be operated by not only the touch pad  but also a remote control, not shown.","According to the received signal, the CPU  reads a program from a ROM  or a hard disk (HD)  and executes it and outputs a result of the execution to the LCD  through the input\/output interface  for display thereon. Besides, the CPU  generates character image data representing a message for assisting user operation for example and outputs the generated data to the LCD  through the internal bus  and the input\/output interface  for display and generates a control signal for controlling the DVCR  and sends the generated control signal to the DVCR  through the internal bus , the IEEE 1394 interface , and the IEEE 1394 serial bus . A RAM  temporarily stores the programs to be executed by the CPU , the data generated by the execution of these programs, and data necessary for DVCR  to execute particular processing.","An antenna  supplies a received satellite broadcast signal to a tuner  of the IRD . The tuner  receives a signal of a channel specified by the CPU . The hard disk  stores various application and middleware programs to be executed by the CPU . Besides, the hard disk  stores a version management table associated with the apparatus under control (namely, the DVCR ) (to be specifically described later). A drive  can accommodate a magnetic disc , an optical disc , a magneto-optical disc , and\/or a semiconductor memory .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["3","2","53","1","51","52","59","53","58","52"]},"On the basis of the inputted signal, the CPU  reads a specified program from a ROM  to execute it, sends a control signal to a recording\/reproducing block  through the internal bus , and sends own DCM and FCM stored in the ROM  to the IRD  through the internal bus , the IEEE 1394 interface , and the IEEE 1394 serial bus . A RAM  temporarily stores the programs to be executed by the CPU , the data generated by the execution of these programs, and other data necessary for the DVCR  to execute particular processing.","On the basis of the control signal supplied from the CPU , the recording\/reproducing block  reads data from a loaded recording medium (in this case, a video cassette tape), not shown, and sends the data to the IRD  through the internal bus , the IEEE 1394 interface , and the IEEE 1394 serial bus  or to an LCD  for display thereon through the internal bus  and an input\/output interface . In addition, the recording\/reproducing block  records the data supplied from the IRD  through the IEEE 1394 serial bus , the IEEE 1394 interface , and the internal bus  onto the video cassette tape, not shown.","A MIC (Memory In Cassette) communication block  communicates with a MIC constituted by a semiconductor memory or a Memory Stick (trademark) for example mounted on the video cassette tape loaded in the DVCR  and detects information recorded in the MIC. The MIC records an ID (identification number) unique to this video cassette tape. Reading this ID from the MIC through the internal bus , the CPU  can detect the change of video cassette tapes loaded in the DVCR . Further, the ID recorded on the MIC is supplied to the IRD  through the internal bus , the IEEE 1394 interface , and the IEEE 1394 serial bus. Consequently, the IRD  can confirm the video cassette tape loaded in the DVCR .","It should be noted that, for the apparatuses such as arranged on a network shown in  to operate in a cooperative manner, middleware (the software located between the lower software such as the OS, network control program, or database system and the upper software such as application programs to provide various services to the application software) for controlling and managing the network is required. In addition, for the network connected with apparatuses of different makes to operate normally for the cooperation of these apparatuses, the common specifications on which the middleware depends are indispensable. For the middleware for network control and management, a network system based on HAVi (trademark) will be described below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 2"],"b":["30","2"]},"The 1394 driver is a module describing a portion dependent on the IEEE 1394 serial bus , providing a common procedure for device access to the upper software modules. The CMM (Communication Media Manager)  acts as interface between the IEEE 1394 serial bus , each HAVi software module, and the application software. The CMM  provides a transfer facility for transmitting\/receiving signals between the apparatuses connected to the IEEE 1394 serial bus , keeps track of the operations of the IEEE 1394 serial bus , and supplies the information thereof to other software modules.","A messaging system operates as API (Application Programming Interface) for the communication between the software modules of the apparatuses connected to the network, transferring messages between the software modules. Consequently, with a HAVi-based network, message transmitting and receiving sides can transfer messages without knowing the location in network of the other side.","A DCM manager uploads a DCM and an FCM to be described later to each apparatus connected to the network. When a HAVi-based network is newly connected with an apparatus, the DCM manager uploads a corresponding uploadable DCM and a corresponding uploadable FCM to the newly connected apparatus.","An event manager generates an event when an apparatus is newly connected to the network or an apparatus is disconnected therefrom to cause a network status change, transmitting the event to the other software modules. This allows the HAVi-based network to realize plug-and-play functionality.","A registry holds or updates apparatus-associated information about what kinds of apparatuses are connected to the network and what functions these apparatuses have for example, thereby allowing the interaction between different apparatuses. Each application program retrieves necessary information from this registry. Referencing the registry, each apparatus on the network can check the locations of the basic software modules of the other apparatuses on the network.","A stream manager monitors and manages the flow of stream data (namely, continuous data) such as video and audio data on the network to allow the realtime transfer of stream data. In addition, the stream manager manages the connections inside and between apparatuses to allocate and free network resources and provides the connection information of the entire network. Further, the stream manager can support the reconnection to be executed after a bus reset operation of the network.","A resource manager handles the conflict in apparatus use right, manages scheduled events such as processing reserved for connected apparatuses, and monitors the network to check if there is the disconnection of an apparatus after its registration. A version manager according to the invention manages the versions of plural registered DCMs.","The application reads a DCM for controlling a particular apparatus connected to the network, selects a desired DCM from among plural DCMs having different versions, and updates the version management table for managing DCM versions (the version management table will be detailed later).","DCMs are unique modules for controlling apparatuses. An embedded DCM is a module which has been uploaded from the DVCR  and embedded in the IRD  or embedded from the beginning. An Uploadable DCM is a module uploaded from the DVCR  and having a different version. The uploadable DCM may later become an embedded DCM. The application program does not directly control each apparatus connected to the network but controls each apparatus by means of a corresponding DCM. An embedded FCM is a module which has been uploaded from the DVCR  and embedded in the IRD  or embedded from the beginning. An uploadable FCM is a module uploaded from the DVCR . These FCMs represent the contents (or functions) of control to be executed by the application program on each apparatus, an AV\/C command being sent to the apparatus specified by the DCM. Namely, only an FCM can control an apparatus specified by a DCM.","Both DCM and FCM function as the API, so that the application program itself need not take the difference between apparatuses into account. Therefore, with a HAVi-based network, each apparatus on the network can recognize the functions of the other apparatuses, thereby allowing each apparatus to operate other apparatuses from a remote location. It should be noted that, in order to clarify whether the DCMs and FCMs have already been uploaded to the IRD , these DCMs and FCMs are expressed as an embedded DCM, an uploadable DCM, embedded FCM, and uploadable FCM. Each of these modules has been uploaded from the same apparatus (DVCR ) and has a different version.","The above-mentioned software modules are owned by each apparatus connected to the network in accordance with an apparatus class specified in HAVi. In HAVi, the above-mentioned four types of apparatus classes are specified.","A FAV (Full AV Device) is compatible with apparatuses having a network managing function and has all the above-mentioned HAVi software modules (the FAV may have neither DCM nor FCM; if so, they may be installed by a BAV to be described later) The FAV can execute applications using Java (trademark) employed as HAVi byte code. Therefore, the FAV can own the DCM and FCM of other apparatuses. By doing so, the FAV can control these apparatuses.","An IAV (Intermediate AV Device), like the FAV, is compatible with apparatuses having a network managing function. Unlike the FAV, however, the IAV is an environment in which applications based on Java employed as HAVi byte code cannot be executed, so that the DCMs and FCMs of other apparatuses are already embedded.","A BAV (Base AV Device) is compatible with apparatuses under control which can be connected directly to HAVi-based networks and has the DCMs and FCMs of its own. A LAV (Legacy AV Device) has only a function as an apparatus that can be connected to the IEEE 1394 serial bus . Because it is compatible with AV\/C commands, the LAV can operate not only as a standalone apparatus but also as an apparatus under control.","Herein, the IRD  is described as corresponding to the FAV (the IEEE 1394 interface  corresponds to the 1394 driver and the CMM 1394) and the DVCR  as corresponding to the BAV.","As shown in , The IRD  is installed at factory with the embedded DCM and FCM for the DVCR  which are listed in the version management table. Moreover, if a bus reset occurs when the DVCR  is connected to the same network or the DVCR  connected to the network is powered on, the IRD  uploads uploadable DCMs and uploadable FCMs having different versions from the DVCR  and stores the uploaded DCMs and FCMs in the version management table.","The following describes DCM upload processing to be executed by the IRD  with reference to the flowcharts shown in . It should be noted that each software module in the software stack shown in  is read from the hard disk  into the RAM  to be executed by the CPU .","In step S, the application outputs a Get DCM command to the DCM manager requesting the sending of a code unit (when the code unit is developed, a DCM is generated) of an apparatus when it is connected to the IEEE 1394 serial bus  (namely, the network) and registers this command.","In step S, the resource manager determines whether an apparatus (for example, the DVCR ) has been connected to the network. If the apparatus is found connected, the resource manager notifies the event manager of this connection in step S.","In step S, receiving the notification from the resource manager, the event manager notifies a local HAVi software element of the connection of the new apparatus.","In step S, receiving the notification of the apparatus connection, the DCM manager requests the DVCR  through the IEEE 1394 serial bus  for sending a code unit. The code unit contains a source code program for generating DCMs and user interface information (data driven interaction) for example.","In step S, the DVCR  (or the CPU ) receives the request from the DCM manager and sends the code unit of its own to the DCM manager. In step S, receiving the response (namely the code unit) from the DVCR , the DCM manager supplies its code unit to the DCM version manager.","In step S, receiving the code unit from the DCM manager, the DCM version manager reads an API code and its DCM name and version from the version management table stored in the hard disk .","The version management table stores the DCM information constituted by API code, DCM name, version, and status as shown in . If there are identical API codes, it indicates that there are plural DCMs uploaded from a same apparatus and of different versions. These same API codes can be distinguished by their DCM names and versions. Status in the table indicates whether that DCM is currently set to the registry or not. If the status is active, it means that the DCM is currently set to the registry; if the status is NonActive, it means that the DCM is not set the registry. Consequently, in the example shown in , the DCM of which API code is 0x000e, DCM name is SONY (trademark) ZZZ, and version is 1.12 is currently set to the registry.","Referring to , in step S, the version manager checks the version management table for the DCM information of the DVCR , or determines whether the API code is the same. If the DCM information of the DVCR  is found in the table, the process goes to step S.","In step S, the version manager compares the DCM information in the code unit returned from the DVCR  with the DCM information stored in the version management table for duplication, namely, determines whether a DCM having the same version.","If the DCM information corresponding to the DCM information in the code unit is not found in the version management table in step S or if, in step S, the DCM information of the DVCR  has not yet been stored in the version management table, the process goes to step S.","In step S, the version manager outputs a request command to the DCM manager to develop the acquired code unit to generate a DCM of the connected apparatus (in this example, the DVCR ).","In step S, on the basis of the request from the version manager, the DCM manager develops the source code contained in the code unit supplied from the DVCR  to generate a new DCM (by executing normal DCM installation processing), upon which the process goes to step S.","If, in step S, the DCM information corresponding to the DCM information in the code unit is found stored in the version management table, then the process goes to step S, in which the version manager notifies the application that the DCM information of the DVCR  has already stored in the version management table. In step S, notified by the version manager, the application displays the contents of the version management table on the LCD . Consequently, a GUI as shown in  for example is displayed.","A display box  in  shows the apparatus name of the apparatus (namely the DVCR ) connected this time. A display box  shows the DCM name currently set to the registry. A list box  displays all DCM names listed in the version management table. The user also can select a desired DCM by touching the corresponding position (in the display section) of the DCM names listed in the list box . Buttons  through , when touched (or pressed) by the user, change DCMs set the registry, delete (or uninstall) particular DCMs stored in the RAM , end the GUI displayed on the LCD , and confirm the change or deletion done.","It should be noted that the display box  is linked with a display box  or  to be displayed in a GUI shown in  to be described later (in this example, the display box  is linked with the display box ) and the display box  and the list box  are linked with the DCM information in the version management table.","Referring to , in step S, the application determines whether the DCM to be used has been selected by the user. Namely, the application determines whether the position of the DCM to be used has been touched by the user to select it from among the DCM names shown in the list box  and the button  has also been touched. If the DCM to be used is found unselected, the application waits until the DCM to be used is selected by the user. When the DCM to be used is found selected, the application requests in step S the version manager to delete the currently set DCM from the registry and enter the DCM selected in step S into the registry.","In step S, on the basis of the request from the application, the version manager deletes the currently set DCM (the DCM set before step S) from the registry. Then, the version manager enters (or registers) the DCM selected in step S into the registry. At this moment, the deleted DCM still remains in the RAM .","In step S shown in , the version manager determines whether the user has specified to uninstall a DCM in the list box , namely whether the user has selected a DCM name in the list box  and touched the button . If the uninstallation is found specified, the version manager requests the DCM manager to uninstall the specified DCM from the RAM , upon which the process goes to step S.","In step S, on the basis of the request from the version manager, the DCM manager uninstalls the specified DCM from the RAM , upon which the process goes to step S.","It should be noted that, whether the change has been confirmed in step S or the uninstallation has been confirmed in step S can be determined by the pressing of the OK button . To cancel the change or uninstallation, the user presses the CANCEL button  after the CHANGE button  or the DELETE button  has been pressed.","If the uninstallation of the DCM deleted from the registry in step S is found unspecified in step S, the process goes to step S.","If the process comes to step S through step S, the version manager enters the DCM information of the newly generated DCM into the version management table and updates the status of this DCM information to Active. Further, the version manager stores the newly generated DCM into the RAM  and sets this DCM to the registry. Consequently, every time a new DCM is generated, it is automatically selected and set to the registry.","In addition, in step S, the version manager updates the status of the newly generated DCM from NonActive to Active in the version management table and updates the status of the DCM deleted from the registry in step S from Active to NonActive.","Further, in step S, the version manager deletes, from the version management table, the DCM information of the DCM uninstalled in step S.","After step S, the version manager notifies the application of the update of the version management table.","In step S, receiving the notification from the version manager, the application updates the GUI shown on the LCD  to a GUI that corresponds to the version management table updated in step S, upon which the process comes to an end.","It should be noted that, if the changed display screen is to be ended, the OK button  may be pressed to return to the previous screen.","In the above mentioned configuration, the selection by the user of a DCM to be used is determined. Alternatively, the version manager may detect a DCM of the newest version from the DCM information stored in the version management table and automatically select the detected DCM, by way of example.","In the above-mentioned configuration, the DCM information is retrieved from the network. Alternatively, the DCM information may be retrieved from any predetermined recording medium on which this DCM information is recorded.","So far, the DCM change processing to be executed when an apparatus under control is connected has been described. The following describes DCM change processing to be manually executed by the user will be described with reference to the flowchart shown in . It should be noted that an apparatus connection state in which the IRD , the DVCR , and the DVCR  are connected to the IEEE 1394 serial bus  is assumed as shown in . The RAM  of the IRD  stores one or more DCMs of the DVCR  and the DVCR . The version management table is assumed to list their DCM information. This processing is started when the user inputs a DCM change command.","When the user specifies a DCM change, the application accordingly reads the menu screen of the version management table from the hard disk  in step S and displays a GUI as shown in  for example.","A display box  shown in  shows an apparatus name indicative of the DVCR  and a display box  shows an apparatus name indicative of the DVCR  (). When the user touches (namely selects) the display box  or  and then a setting button , the version management table of the apparatus corresponding to the selected display box  or  is read.","It should be noted that the apparatus name shown in the display box  or  is set on the basis of the specifications information which is supplied to the controlling apparatus (the IRD ) when the controlled apparatus (the DVCR  for example) is connected to the IEEE 1394 serial bus . The user can change the setting of the apparatus name as desired.","In step S, the application determines whether the user has selected the apparatus of which DCM is to be changed. If the apparatus is found not selected, the application waits until the apparatus is selected, with the GUI shown in  kept displayed without change. When the apparatus is selected by the user, the process goes to step S. It is assumed here that the apparatus selected by the user be the DVCR . Namely, it is assumed that the display box  is touched by the user and then the setting button .","In step S, the application requests the version manager for reading the version management table. In step S, on the basis of the request from the application, the version manager reads the version management table of the DVCR  stored in the hard disk  and sends it to the application.","In step S, the application displays the version management table on the LCD  (). In step S, the application determines whether the touch pad  has been operated by the user and the DCM to be used has been selected by the user. If the DCM to be selected is found unselected, the application waits until the DCM to be used is selected. When the DCM to be used is selected by the user, the process goes to step S, in which the application requests the version manager to delete the currently set DCM from the registry and enters the DCM selected in step S into the registry. Assume that DCM name SONY ZZZ Driver Ver. 1.15 has been selected by the user.","In step S, on the basis of the request from the application, the version manager deletes the currently set DCM (the DCM of SONY ZZZ Driver Ver. 1.12 set before step S) from the registry. Further, the version manager sets the selected DCM (in this example, SONY ZZZ Driver Ver. 1.15) to the registry.","In step S, the version manager determines whether the touch pad  has been operated by the user to specify the uninstallation of the DCM from the list box . If the uninstallation is found specified, the version manager requests the DCM manager to uninstall the DCM specified for deletion from the RAM  and the process goes to step S. On the basis of the request from the version manager, the DCM manager uninstalls the DCM specified for deletion (in this example, SONY ZZZ Driver Ver. 1.12) from the RAM  and the process goes to step S.","If, in step S, the uninstallation of the DCM (in this example, SONY ZZZ Driver Ver. 1.12) in the list box  is found not specified, the process goes to step S.","In step S, if the process comes here by skipping step S, the version manager updates the status in the version management table of the newly selected DCM (in this example, SONY ZZZ Driver Ver. 1.15) from NonActive to Active and updates the status of the DCM (in this example, SONY ZZZ Driver Ver. 1.12) deleted from the registry in step S from Active to NonActive ().","If the processes comes to step S through step S, the version manager updates the status in the version management table of the newly selected DCM (in this example, SONY ZZZ Driver Ver. 1.15) from NonActive to Active and deletes the DCM information of the DCM (in this example, SONY ZZZ Driver Ver. 1.12) uninstalled from the RAM  in step S ().","After step S, the version manager notifies the application of the update of the version management table.","In step S, receiving the notification from the version manager, the application updates the GUI displayed on the LCD  to a GUI corresponding to the version management table updated in step S (), upon which the process comes to an end.","Thus, storing the information such as the updated DCM and DCM version from the DVCR  of the controlled apparatus (BAV) into the version management table of the IRD  of the controlling apparatus (FAV) allows the user to specifically manage the version of the DCM for controlling that apparatus. Namely, the present invention provides the following advantages:","(1) The user can perform apparatus control while viewing an accustomed, familiar screen if the OS of a controlled apparatus has been upgraded.","(2) The user can manage plural control functions having different versions for a single apparatus.","The above description has been made by use of the management of the version of the DCM of the DVCR  for example. The present invention is also applicable to any other electronic apparatuses that can be controlled.","The software for executing the above-mentioned sequence of processing operations is provided by a computer in which the programs constituting this software are installed in a dedicated hardware apparatus or the software is installed from a recording medium into a general-purpose personal computer for example capable of executing various functions by the installed programs.","This recording medium includes not only the hard disk  storing the programs provided as already built in the IRD , but also such package media recording the programs as the magnetic disc  (including a floppy disc), the optical disc  (including CD-ROM (Compact Disc Ready Only Memory) or DVD (Digital Versatile Disc), a magneto-optical disc  (including MD), and the semiconductor memory  which are distributed to users.","The steps describing each program recorded in the recording medium herein include not only the processes which are executed in a time-series manner by following a written procedure, but also the processes which are executed in parallel or discretely.","A system herein denotes an entire apparatus composed of two or more apparatuses.","As described and according to the invention, the information processing apparatus, the information processing method, and the programs recorded on a recording medium retrieve plural pieces of information associated with controlling other electronic apparatuses, store the retrieved plural pieces of information, select a desired piece of information from these plural pieces of information, register the selected information as only the information that can control other electronic apparatuses on a network, and control other electronic apparatuses on the basis of the registered information. This novel constitution allows the user to control electronic apparatuses by use of desired apparatus control modules and specifically manage the versions of these apparatus control modules.","While the preferred embodiments of the present invention have been described using specific terms, such description is for illustrative purposes only, and it is to be understood that changes and variations may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the appended claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["These and other objects of the invention will be seen by reference to the description, taken in connection with the accompanying drawing, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 6"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIGS. 6 and 7"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 16"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
