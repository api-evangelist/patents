title: Determining lyapunov exponents of a chaotic system
abstract: Systems and methods for calculating the Lyapunov exponent of a chaotic system are described. In one particular embodiment, a Lyapunov exponent calculating method includes obtaining a value indicative of a condition of a chaotic system and assigning the value to first and second precision levels, the second precision level having a higher level of precision than the first precision level. The method also includes iterating the chaotic system over time and comparing the value at the first precision level with the value at the second precision level. From the comparison of values at the first and second precision levels, the method calculates the Lyapunov exponent for the chaotic system.

No. 13\/082,824 titled \u201cPREDICTING THE OUTCOME OF A CHAOTIC SYSTEM USING LYAPONOV EXPONENTS\u201d and filed on Apr. 8, 2011, now U.S. Pat. No. 8,768,874.","1. Technical Field of the Invention","The invention relates to determining the maximal Lyapunov exponent in a chaotic system. More particularly, the invention relates to determining the maximal Lyapunov exponent by comparing values calculated at different precision levels.","2. Description of the Related Art","Chaotic, non-linear systems are known. Examples of chaotic systems include, but are not limited to, the weather, the stock market and fluid flow. By its nature it is difficult to calculate the outcome of a chaotic system. A slight change in initial conditions or an intervening event can result in a completely different system trajectory and a completely different outcome. In a weather system, a slight change in the initial conditions of temperatures and pressures at several locations produces a different weather trajectory. As a result, a long range forecast may be difficult or impossible to make. One method of predicting an outcome of a chaotic system is by calculating a Lyapunov exponent. The Lyapunov exponent is a measure of the exponential rate of divergence of a system trajectory with respect to time.","It is well known that the significant digits of variables defining a chaotic system are rapidly lost during calculation and the initially valid digits in the chaotic system become meaningless in a small number of iterations. The number of valid digits n(t) decreases linearly with time. The maximal Lyapunov exponent L is equal to \u2212dn\/dt and can be calculated to determine the number of digits lost per unit time. Traditional Lyapunov exponent algorithms, such as those calculated by the Benettin technique, can be applied only to a system of differential equations. A different algorithm is used for discrete maps and no algorithm existed here-to-fore for any other mathematical methods.","The present invention provides a method of calculating the Lyapunov exponent of a series of time-dependent differential equations describing a chaotic system. A variable is selected from the equations that are indicative of a condition in the chaotic system. A value for the variable is selected at an initial time. A first precision level and a second precision level are assigned for the calculation. The second precision level is a higher level of precision than the first precision level. Starting at the initial value for the variable and at the initial time, two calculations are carried out. In the first calculation the series of differential equations is iterated with respect to time at the first precision level to produce a value for the variable. In the second calculation, the differential equations are iterated with respect to time at the second, higher precision level to produce another value for the variable. The two values of the variable are compared and the Lyapunov exponent calculated therefrom.","The method may be used to make predictions in chaotic physical systems described by time-dependent differential equations. The method is particularly useful in weather forecasting.","The invention provides a method for determining the maximal Lyapunov exponent of a chaotic system. The chaotic system is described by a system of time-dependent differential equations. Suggested differential equations a include, but are not limited to, weather systems, fluid flow systems, traffic patterns, stock market patterns and other systems that are sensitive to one or more conditions. The inventive method may be applied to any chaotic system described by a system of time-dependent differential equations. The method is distinguished in an accurate determination of the maximal Lyapunov exponent of a chaotic system with less computational complexity than previously known methods. With regard to weather systems, also referred to as weather maps, the method can be used to accurately and quickly determine the maximal Lyapunov exponent of weather patterns in a location. With regard to fluid flow systems, the method can be used to determine the maximal Lyapunov exponent for water flow through a conduit or around a structure, such as a dam, spillway or watercraft. Fluid flow systems may also include air flow systems such as those which may be used to design an airplane or other aircraft. With regard to traffic systems, the method can be used to determine the maximal Lyapunov exponent for patterns of vehicle traffic in a road network.","The method is used to accurately determine the maximal Lyapunov exponent of a chaotic system, described by a system of time-dependent differential equations. The method compares single-precision calculations with double-precision calculations to determine the maximal Lyapunov exponent. The resulting maximal Lyapunov exponent is found in less than one-tenth of the computational time required by traditional methods. The algorithm of the method can be applied to maps, such as weather forecast maps, and systems of differential equations. This algorithm is easily coded because it is free of Jacobians, tangent vectors, Gramm-Schmidt procedures, overflow errors, and trial-and-error parameters. Furthermore, this algorithm is applicable to any numerical time-evolution procedure and can be applied where no existing routine is available, such as in recursion relations or to the successive terms of a series, as often exist in quantum mechanical calculations. It has been found that the maximum Lyapunov exponent can be experimentally measured by comparing two data runs of the chaotic system at different levels of precision.","A new technique involving the products of the ratios of successive differentials is used to find maximal Lyapunov exponents in systems of differential equations. Lyapunov exponent plots and local Lyapunov exponent distributions are given for the logistic map and the Lorenz equations. Restricted error regions are discussed where the Lyapunov exponent is greater than zero, but the error magnitude is restricted to a fraction of the size of the available phase space. An empirical formula is also provided which can quickly calculate the r\u221e point of a period p window.","The time rate of loss of the number of valid digits, dn\/dt, can be determined by comparing single-precision and double-precision calculations of the system trajectory and used to determine to produce maximal Lyapunov exponents. The method described herein can be applied, without alteration, to maps, such as weather maps, and systems of differential equations. It can be applied to any time evolution system, such as recursion relations and the Gramm-Schmidt re-orthogonalization procedure. It has been used to determine Lyapunov exponents in the chaotic behavior found in a first number of partial sums, such as the first 50 partial sums, of a series describing the electromagnetic scattering from a pair of overlapping spheres. This lost digits technique, which is the invention described herein, can be used to test for divergence between two calculations of differing precision, which describe the time evolution in quantum mechanical systems.","The invention is also a computer method that uses the source code of the nonlinear system as a subroutine to perform calculations. The input to the computer method includes initial conditions and the relative uncertainties of these conditions. In a weather forecasting program, the input includes the temperature and pressure at various geographic locations and uncertainties associated with these input values. The main program calculates trajectories and Lyapunov exponents of these trajectories. It then determines the smallest exponent and assigns this as the most likely outcome.","The method of the invention for calculating Lyapunov exponents using single precision and double precision values for determining the maximal Lyapunov exponent of chaotic systems can be implemented in software, hardware, or a combination thereof. In the currently contemplated Best Mode for carrying out the invention, the system is implemented in software as an executable computer program and is executed by a general purpose digital computer or other suitable digital processing device.","The software may be stored in memory in any suitable format and may include one or more separate programs. The software includes an ordered listing of executable instructions for implementing logical functions. The software may be a computer program, source program, executable program, object code, script, or any other entity including a set of instructions to be performed.","When the method of the invention for calculating Lyapunov exponents is implemented in software, the steps can be stored on any computer readable medium for use by or in connection with any computer related system or method. In the context of this document, a computer readable medium is any electronic, magnetic, electromagnetic, optical, infrared or semiconductor system, apparatus, device or propagation medium, or other suitable physical device or means that can contain or store a computer program for use by or in connection with a computer related system or method.","In the alternative, the method for calculating Lyapunov exponents may be configured using physical or electrical components, modules, and\/or processing means for performing various functions. For example, these functional components, modules, and processing means are capable of varying the initial conditions of a chaotic system model and then calculating trajectories for the chaotic system. Among other things, they are further capable of calculating a Lyapunov exponent for each trajectory.","Lyapunov Exponent","The jth iteration of a map \u0192(X) is written as\n\n(),\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nwhere Xis the initial value. When a small error \u03b5is found to grow exponentially, the system is said to be chaotic.

it should be noted that this technique is computationally advantageous to techniques using Runge-Kutta algorithms such as the Bennetin and Wolf algorithms. Although the present technique requires calculating two distinct trajectories (using single and double precision), the previous techniques require one trajectory in double precision plus an associated system of qdimensions stemming from the Jacobian of the system. The Runge-Kutta and Gramm-Schmidt procedures require a great deal of additional calculations. In addition, the error in these other techniques is not 10, but set to unit magnitude.","Results","Equation 17 or 20 provides a procedure for the direct measurement of Lyapunov exponents. The system is run twice from identical initial conditions for an elapsed time and then the difference between the two runs is calculated throughout the elapsed time. A more expensive approach is to build two exact copies of the system, run them simultaneously, and compare them with respect to time. For instance, X(t) and X(t) are replaced by X(t) and X(t), where X(t) and X(t) are either the two runs of the system or the two copies of the system. At t=0 the two runs agree to several significant digits. If the system is chaotic then the number of digits that agree in X(t) and X(t) decreases linearly in time.","Implementation Details","In applying the lost digits technique, the following considerations should be taken into account. First, more choices than merely single and double precision may be available, and in this case the two most precise precision levels should be used. For example, 16 and 20 digit variables have been compared to obtain the described results. Second, because the maximum magnitude of an error depends on its position within the trajectory, it is better to set the stopping criteria to a floating fractional error rather than to a constant error magnitude. Third, it is best to iterate or integrate until most of the digits of Xand Xhave come to disagree, e.g. a fractional error of 0.01 is used in the calculations herein. Fourth, in a modulus map the difference might be determined before performing the modulus. Sometimes one precision falls below the cutoff while the other falls above it. Fifth, a large elapsed time or number of iterations is necessary to determine a small positive L. For this reason, a maximum elapsed time should normally be set in the program. Sixth, negative exponents can be calculated by starting two solutions with a small difference, such as 1%, and then watching an increase in the number of agreeing digits. And seventh, it is well known that the computed trajectories must be found to be independent of the numerical integration step size.","The lost digits Lyapunov exponent is not due to a single iteration or integration time step, or an infinite number of them. It is due to a small number of time steps. For the lost digits approach for W=16, about 50 to 100 iterations are needed to determine a good approximation to the global exponent in the logistic map, compared to about 10,000 iterations which are used in the conventional infinite-sum formula for the global exponent of a map (Equation 4). The Lyapunov exponent can be calculated from the product of the 50 or so error magnifications that the trajectory encounters. For the Lorenz equations (with W=16) the lost digits technique as described herein determines an exponent after every ten-second trajectory segment. For this reason, the lost digit approach can be said to produce only regional exponents. The lost-digits technique produces a global exponent only for the case W\u2192\u221e.","Logistic Map","An example of a period-3 window of a logistic map is shown in . The power of this lost digits technique is demonstrated by calculating a few iterations of the logistic map, X=rX(1\u2212X). We consider r=3.853, W=16, and initially set X(t=0)=X(t=0)=X=0.65. The system is iterated until the stopping point is reached. The next experiment is reinitialized by setting X(t)=X(t) and the process is repeated. In this region of the map (r=3.853), the iterations typically move from band A to band B to band C and then back to band A, Table 1.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0069"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"70pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Band","X","Width","f (X)","Slope"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["A","X \u2208 0.132 to 0.165","0.033","f (X) \u2208 0.451 to 0.528",">1"]},{"entry":["B","X \u2208 0.451 to 0.528","0.077","f (X) \u2208 0.957 to 0.968","<1"]},{"entry":["C","X \u2208 0.957 to 0.968","0.011","f (X) \u2208 0.132 to 0.165",">1"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}},"br":{},"sub":"o ","figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0070"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"sub":["s","d"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0071"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},"1) averaging iterations over precisions;","2) averaging over k initial conditions, i.e. setting X=X=Xand iterating until m digits disagree, calculating L, then resetting X=X=X, where i=1 . . . k, for a set of k initial values (taking the k initial values randomly or by distributing the Xuniformly throughout the available space); and","3) averaging through time, that is, starting X=X=X, and then after m digits disagree resetting X=X(in this case the new Xis already in the attractor region) and repeating the process k times.

Local Lyapunov exponents reveal the variation of the local error exponential growth rate throughout the system's trajectory. A plot of the distributions of local exponents for the parameters of  is shown in . The parameter values in  were chosen near the end of a periodic window where oscillations appear in the distribution (solid line). These oscillations are an artifact, a result of the stopping point criterion never being satisfied on bands B or C. The oscillations can be removed by iterating a randomly selected number of times (i=1, 2, or 3) after the stopping point is reached or by terminating the experiment after a set amount of time or number of iterations, but not so few that the asymptotic value has not been reached, nor so many that the fractional error exceeds unity.  also shows the distribution (dashed line) when the method of terminating the experiment is chosen. In this case, the map is in a restricted error region as defined below. Note that most Lyapunov distributions are smooth and do not contain these oscillations. Although the artifact is easily removed from the distribution, it is of interest because it indicates that the map has an interesting or unusual region.","Restricted-Error Regions","Consider a one-dimensional map X=\u0192(X,r), with parameter r. The range of the iteration is X(r, t)\u2266X(r, t)\u2266X(r, t). At a particular chaotic parameter value rthe range of X is restricted to a smaller segment composed of a set of separate, disjoint regions numbered i=1 to k. These k regions, or bands, restrict the iterations to the values, X\u2266X(r,t)\u2266X. If the iteration moves through time in a permanent pattern from the first region to the second region and so on to the kth region then back to the first region, for all time, then the iterations Xare always known to within a maximum error equal to the width of the largest region. When the Lyapunov exponent is positive for a particular range of r values, but at least one valid digit is retained in the computed trajectory. We refer to that parameter region as a restricted error region. When at least one digit is always known. The trajectory is not 100% uncertain. A physical system is always limited to a finite phase space. These restricted error regions always occur near the ends of periodic windows where the system is returning to chaos. These regions are readily apparent in the bifurcation diagrams and Lyapunov exponent plots of published systems. They become smaller in higher period windows, which increases the number of digits that remain valid. These bands have been investigated in the past by Lorenz. The edges of the regions have been extensively studied as crisis points. The scaling properties of the windows are known. Gade and Amritkar developed time-dependent generalized exponents that measure the loss of memory with time in a chaotic time series. These references report an example for the logistic map, at the chaotic parameter value r=3.59687 (L>0 at this point) where the memory is not completely lost. This is a two band region of the logistic map. It was noted in these references that the iterations hop between the two bands in a permanently set pattern. The restricted error regions are most easily found when maximum errors, rather than local errors, are monitored and can be located by setting the stopping point to be a small constant as discussed above.","We consider a period p window which begins at r=r, where\n\n\u0192()=\u2003\u2003(30)\n\nThe window contains its own transition back to chaos. That is, there is a sequence of period doublings followed by the emergence of a set of k restricted coordinate sections at r=r. The periodic window is then seen to end abruptly at r=r. The restricted error region covers the segment r\u2266r\u2266r. This can be seen in the logistic map of . It is known that roccurs at the r value where pairs of super cycles match in value.

This is illustrated in , which shows super cycles  and  for the logistic map. It can be seen that the two super cycles have equal slope and value, then have equal slope but unequal values (r), and then later have equal values but unequal slopes (r).\n","For example, the period-3 window of the logistic map (with X=0.5) begins at the point \u0192(X)=X, or r=1+\u221a{square root over (8)}\u22483.828427125 (see ) and ends at the point where the super cycles have the same value, that is \u0192(X, r),=\u0192(X, r), where p=3, and N=1 . . . p.

The r co value for the period-3 window is r\u02dc3.84950. It can be found in this and numerous other calculations that r\u02dcr.

The lost digits Lyapunov exponents are computed by comparing 16 and 20, for example, significant digit solutions with a stopping point given by Equation 18. The lost digits exponent is averaged over 9 initial conditions using a constant Runge-Kutta step size of 0.02 and integrated for a maximum of 100,000 time steps, so that a tiny positive exponent could be found if it occurred. The results, shown in , are virtually identical to the traditional Lyapunov exponent method results shown in the plots given in Schuster (cited reference page 116), and Froyland. The largest exponents found in this plot are L=2.5 natural digits per second. This is about 1 decimal digit per second. This means that 12 decimal digits are lost in about 12 seconds (600 Runge-Kutta time steps). The system completes about two orbits per second when c=190. If a variable time step procedure is used then normally the higher precision calculation should change the step size. The single-precision calculation typically uses the time step that has been determined by the double-precision procedure so that the two precisions stay together in time.\n","For the continuous Lorenz equations at c=190 the distribution is shown in . The distributions can show multiple peaks for chaotic parameter values near the ends of the periodic windows. For example, at c=182.57, with dt=0.02, the distribution contains 3 peaks. This indicates that the trajectory alternates between three exponents, seen in a real time plot, or that the computed trajectory is alternating between three actual trajectories. However, the 3 peaks become a single peak for dt=0.002. This illustrates another effect of a Runge-Kutta time step that is too large.  shows the distribution, with dt=0.02, for c=133.278. In this case, however, the 2 peaks remain when the time step is reduced to dt=0.00002. This case is located near the end of a periodic window. It indicates that liquid flow systems may also display interesting behavior similar to that of the restricted error regions of the one-dimensional maps.","The number of valid digits is a direct measure of the information that is known about a system. This fact can be used to provide several methods of determining Lyapunov exponents. Maximal Lyapunov exponents are determined by the time rate of change of the number of valid digits in the system's trajectory and can be computed by combining the stopping point given by Equation 18 with either of Equations 5, 17, 19, or 20. For a system of differential equations, the stopping point can also be combined with Equation 23, 25, or 26. The Lyapunov exponent can be experimentally measured by comparing two separate runs of a system, and applying Equations 17 and 18. This method allows Lyapunov exponents to be calculated in less than one-tenth of the computational time required by traditional methods. Furthermore, the same algorithm is applied to maps, systems of differential equations, or any numerical time evolution procedure. A new technique involving the products of the ratios of successive differential is also used to find maximal exponents in systems of differential equations. The power of this algorithm is demonstrated by providing Lyapunov exponent plots and local Lyapunov exponent distributions for the logistic map, a two-dimensional map, and the Lorenz equations. Restricted error regions are discussed where L>0, but the error's magnitude is restricted to a fraction of the size of the available phase space.","The distribution of local Lyapunov exponents explains the noise seen in maximal Lyapunov exponent plots. A distribution of local exponents occurs because the error growth rate of any segment of a trajectory is due to the product of local slopes which are encountered by that segment. That is, the variation in local exponents is simply a factor of the variation in local slopes. An oscillation in the distribution indicates that some interesting feature of the trajectory is causing certain integer counts to be absent from the lost digits stopping time. Finally, the magnitude of the system error is found to be specially restricted near the end of periodic windows, even though L>0 in these regions.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0087","num":"0086"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 11","FIG. 11","FIG. 11"],"b":["200","202","200","202","204","204","202","204","200","202","205","206"]},"The following references are hereby incorporated by reference herein.\n\n","The foregoing discussion discloses and describes embodiments of the invention by way of example.
