Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a molecular electric wire comprising an ecological material and enabling a microscopic wiring, a molecular electric wire circuit using the molecular electric wire and an effective process for producing the molecular electric wire circuit.","2. Description of the Related Art","Recently, nanotechnology is attracting increasing attention as a key to solving problems in various fields including information technology, biotechnology, medical technology, energy technology, environmental technology and so forth. An electric circuit designed by taking advantage of nanotechnology will enable a paper thin display and so forth since such electric circuit does not require space unlike conventional electric circuits. Such display requires a molecular electric wire that enables a microscopic wiring; however, practical examples have not yet been provided of a molecular electric wire that is formed of an environmentally benign ecological material and enables microscopic wiring and of an electric circuit using the molecular electric wire.","In order to meet with the above demands and so forth in the art, an object of the present invention is to provide a molecular electric wire that is formed of an environmentally benign ecological material and enables a microscopic wiring, a molecular electric wire circuit using the molecular electric wire and an effective process for producing the molecular electric wire circuit.","{Molecular Electric Wire}","The following first to fourth embodiments are preferable as embodiments of the molecular electric wire of the present invention.","The first embodiment of the present invention is a molecular electric wire comprising a rod-shaped organic molecule and an electroconductive material, the electroconductive material being carried by the rod-shaped organic molecules.","The second embodiment is a molecular electric wire comprising two rod-shaped organic molecule arrays each of which is formed of a plurality of amphiphilic rod-shaped organic molecules each having a hydrophilic end and a lipophilic end and being aligned in a substantially orthogonal direction with respect to a longitudinal direction thereof, the amphiphilic rod-shaped organic molecules being arranged so that the lipophilic ends of the rod-shaped organic molecules are directed towards an identical orientation, and the rod-shaped organic molecule arrays being arranged so that either the lipophilic ends of one of the arrays contact with the lipophilic ends of the other array or the hydrophilic ends of one of the arrays contact with the hydrophilic ends of another array with an electroconductive material being intervened between each pair of the contacting ends.","The third embodiment is a molecular electric wire obtainable by contacting an end of a rod-shaped organic molecule carrying an electroconductive material with an end of another rod-shaped organic molecule carrying an electro conductive material. In other words, the molecular electric wire is obtainable by contacting an end of a molecular electric wire with an end of another molecular electric wire according to the first embodiment. A branched wiring is realized by providing a branch at the contact portion.","The fourth embodiment is a molecular electric wire comprising a plurality of unit electroconductive molecules each having a rod-shaped organic molecule carrying an electroconductive material, a target of capture bonded to an end of the rod-shaped organic molecule and a capturing structural element bonded to another end of the rod-shaped organic molecule for specifically capturing the target of capture, the target of capture in one of the unit electroconductive molecules being captured by the capturing structural element of another one of the unit electroconductive molecules.","{Rod-shaped Organic Molecule}","Examples of the rod-shaped organic molecule may be a biopolymer, polysaccharides, etc.","Preferred examples of the biopolymer may be an electroconductive fibrous protein, \u03b1-helix polypeptide, a nucleic acid (DNA, RNA), etc. Examples of the electroconductive fibrous protein are those having an \u03b1-helix structure such as \u03b1-keratin, myosin, epidermin, fibrinogen, tropomyosin, silk fibroin, etc.","Preferred examples of the polysaccharides may be amylose, etc.","Among the rod-shaped organic molecules, a helical organic molecule having a helix structure is preferred since it can stably maintain linearity of the rod-shape, and also, other materials can be intercalated (\u201cintercalate\u201d means \u201ccarry internally\u201d, and the same applies to the following descriptions) inside thereof when so required. Preferred examples of the helical organic molecule among the above mentioned rod-shaped organic molecules may be the \u03b1-helix polypeptide, DNA, amylose, etc.","{\u03b1-Helix Polypeptides}","\u03b1-helix polypeptides are referred to as one of the secondary structures of polypeptides. The polypeptide rotates one time (forms one spiral) for each amino acid 3.6 residue, and a hydrogen bond, which is substantially parallel to the axis of the helix, is formed between a carbonyl group (\u2014CO\u2014) and an imide group (\u2014NH\u2014) of each fourth amino acid, and this structure is repeated in units of seven amino acids. In this way, the \u03b1-helix polypeptide has a structure which is stable energy-wise.","The direction of the spiral of the \u03b1-helix polypeptide is not particularly limited, and may be either wound right or wound left. Note that, in nature, only structures whose direction of spiral is wound right exist from the standpoint of stability.","The amino acids which form the \u03b1-helix polypeptide are not particularly limited provided that an \u03b1-helix structure can be formed, and can be appropriately selected in accordance with the object. However, amino acids which facilitate formation of the \u03b1-helix structure are preferable. Suitable examples of such amino acids are aspartic acid (Asp), glutamic acid (Glu), arginine (Arg), lysine (Lys), histidine (His), asparagine (Asn), glutamine (Gln), serine (Ser), threonine (Thr), alanine (Ala), valine (Val), leucine (Leu), isoleucine (Ile), cysteine (Cys), methionine (Met), tyrosine (Tyr), phenylalanine (Phe), tryptophan (Trp), and the like. A single one of these amino acids may be used alone, or two or more may be used in combination.","By appropriately selecting the amino acid, the property of the \u03b1-helix polypeptide can be changed to any of hydrophilic, hydrophobic, and amphiphilic. In the case in which the \u03b1-helix polypeptide is to be made to be hydrophilic, suitable examples of the amino acid are serine (Ser), threonine (Thr), aspartic acid (Asp), glutamic acid (Glu), arginine (Arg), lysine (Lys), asparagine (Asn), glutamine (Gln), and the like. In the case in which the \u03b1-helix polypeptide is to be made to be hydrophobic, suitable examples of the amino acid are phenylalanine (Phe), tryptophan (Trp), isoleucine (Ile), tyrosine (Tyr), methionine (Met), leucine (Leu), valine (Val), and the like.","In the \u03b1-helix polypeptide, the carboxyl group, which does not form a peptide bond and which is in the amino acid which forms the \u03b1-helix, can be made to be hydrophobic by esterification. On the other hand, an esterified carboxyl group can be made to be hydrophilic by hydrolysis.","The amino acid may be any of a L-amino acid, a D-amino acid, a derivative in which the side chain portion of a L-amino acid or a D-amino acid is modified, and the like.","The number of bonds (the degree of polymerization) in the \u03b1-helix polypeptide is not limited and can be suitably selected according to the object; however, the number of bonds may preferably be from 10 to 5,000.","If the number of bonds (the degree of polymerization) is less than 10, it may be impossible for the polyamino acid to form a stable \u03b1-helix in some cases, while it may be difficult in some cases to establish a vertical orientation if the number of bonds exceeds 5,000.","Suitable specific examples of the \u03b1-helix polypeptide are polyglutamic acid derivatives such as poly(\u03b3-methyl L-glutamate), poly(\u03b3-ethyl L-glutamate), poly(\u03b3-benzyl L-glutamate), poly(n-hexyl L-glutamate), and the like; polyaspartic acid derivatives such as poly(\u03b2-benzyl L-aspartate) and the like; polypeptides such as poly(L-leucine), poly(L-alanine), poly(L-methionine), poly(L-phenylalanine), poly(L-lysine)-poly(\u03b3-methyl L-glutamate), and the like.","The \u03b1-helix polypeptide may be a commercially available \u03b1-helix polypeptide, or may be appropriately synthesized or prepared in accordance with methods disclosed in known publications and the like.","As one example of synthesizing the \u03b1-helix polypeptide, the synthesis of block copolypeptide [poly(L-lysine)-poly(\u03b3-methyl L-glutamate)]PLLZ-PMLGis as follows. As is shown by the following formula, block copolypeptide [poly(L-lysine)-poly(\u03b3-methyl L-glutamate)]PLLZ-PMLGcan be synthesized by polymerizing N-carbobenzoxy L-lysine N-carboxy acid anhydride (LLZ-NCA) by using n-hexylamine as an initiator, and then polymerizing \u03b3-methyl L-glutamate N-carboxy acid anhydride (MLG-NCA).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"231.90mm","wi":"76.20mm","file":"US07077982-20060718-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"Synthesis of the \u03b1-helix polypeptide is not limited to the above-described method, and the \u03b1-helix polypeptide can be synthesized by a genetic engineering method.

However, the DNA is preferably a double-stranded DNA from the standpoints that the rod-shape can be stably maintained, other substances can be intercalated into the interior, and the like.","A double-stranded DNA has a double helix structure in which two polynucleotide chains, which are in the form of right-wound spirals, are formed so as to be positioned around a single central axis in a state in which they extend in respectively opposite directions.","The polynucleotide chains are formed by four types of nucleic acid bases which are adenine (A), thiamine (T), guanine (G), and cytosine (C). The nucleic acid bases in the polynucleotide chain exist in the form of projecting inwardly within a plane which is orthogonal to the central axis, and form so-called Watson-Crick base pairs. Thiamine specifically hydrogen bonds with adenine, and cytosine specifically hydrogen bonds with guanine. As a result, in a double-stranded DNA, the two polypeptide chains are bonded complementarily.","The DNA can be prepared by known method such as PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction), LCR (Ligase Chain Reaction), 3SR (Self-Sustained Sequence Replication), SDA (Strand Displacement Amplification), and the like. Among these, the PCR method is preferable.","Further, the DNA can be prepared by being directly removed enzymatically from a natural gene by a restriction enzyme. Or, the DNA can be prepared by a genetic cloning method, or by a chemical synthesis method.","In the case of a genetic cloning method, a large amount of the DNA can be prepared by, for example, integrating a structure, in which a normal nucleic acid has been amplified, into a vector which is selected from plasmid vectors, phage vectors, plasmid and phage chimeric vectors, and the like, and then introducing the vector into an arbitrary host in which propagation is possible and which is selected from prokaryotic microorganisms such as and the like; eukaryotic microorganisms such as yeast and the like; zooblasts, and the like.","Examples of chemical synthesis methods include liquid phase methods or solid phase synthesis methods using an insoluble carrier, such as a tolyester method, a phosphorous acid method, and the like. In the case of a chemical synthesis method, the double-stranded DNA can be prepared by using a known automatic synthesizing device and the like to prepare a large amount of single-stranded DNA, and thereafter, carrying out annealing.","Amylose","Amylose is a polysaccharide having a spiral structure in which D-glucose, which forms starch which is a homopolysaccharide of higher plants for storage, is joined in a straight chain by \u03b1-1,4 bonds.","The molecular weight of the amylose is preferably around several thousand to 150,000 in number average molecular weight.","The amylose may be a commercially available amylose, or may be appropriately prepared in accordance with known methods.","Amylopectin may be contained in a portion of the amylose.","The length of the rod-shaped body is not particularly limited, and may be appropriately selected in accordance with the object.","The diameter of the rod-shaped body is not particularly limited, and is about 0.8 to 2.0 nm in the case of the \u03b1-helix polypeptide.","The entire rod-shaped body may be hydrophobic or hydrophilic. Or, the rod-shaped body may be amphiphilic such that a portion thereof is hydrophobic or hydrophilic, and the other portion thereof exhibits the opposite property of the one portion.","If the rod-shaped body is amphiphilic, an emulsion could be obtained when the rod-shaped bodies are being dispersed in an oil phase or in an aqueous phase, thus it is preferable from the viewpoint of simple membrane generation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["10","10","10"],"i":["a ","b "]},"{Electroconductive Material}","The rod-shaped organic molecule carries the electroconductive material.

Using n-hexylamine as an initiator, a polymerization of N-carbobenzoxy L-lysine N-carboxylic acid anhydride (LLZ-NCA) is conducted, and then a polymerization of \u03b3-methyl L-glutamate N-carboxylic acid anhydride (MLG-NCA) to obtain a block copolypeptide PLLZ-PMLGwherein a polymerization degree of a PLLZ portion is 25 and a polymerization degree of PMLG portion is 60. After that, a part of the PMLG segments is hydrolyzed to obtain L-glutamic acid (LGA), thereby obtaining the PLLZ-P(MLG\/LGA).","Next, the PLLZ-P(MLG\/LGA) is soaked in a solution containing a cyanine dye so that the cyanine dye is carried by the PLLZ-P(MLG\/LGA) at a periphery thereof.","Thus, a molecular electric wire comprising the amphiphilic PLLZ-P(MLG\/LGA) that carries the cyanine dye on its periphery is obtained.","A plurality of molecular electric wires are aligned as shown in . Specifically, the molecular electric wires are aligned in such a manner that two rod-shaped organic molecule arrays each of which is formed of a plurality of amphiphilic rod-shaped organic molecules  each aligned in a substantially orthogonal direction with respect to a longitudinal direction thereof, the rod-shaped organic molecules  are arranged so that the ends of lipophilic portions of the rod-shaped organic molecules are directed towards an identical orientation, and the arrays are arranged so that either ends of the lipophilic (hydrophobic) portions of one of the arrays contact with the ends of the lipophilic (hydrophobic) portions of the other array or ends of the hydrophilic portions of one of the arrays contacts with the ends of the hydrophilic portions of the other array with an electroconductive material  intervened between each pair of the ends. An electric circuit is formed by contacting an electrode that is connected to an electric power source for energization to each of the ends of a line formed by the electroconductive materials . An ammeter is connected to a part of the electric circuit, and then the electric power source is switched on to energize a current of 100 mV to confirm that a current of 40 \u03bcA is flowing through the molecular electric wire circuit.","Molecular electric wires are prepared by causing the rod-shaped organic molecules prepared in Example 1 to carry the cyanine dye at its periphery in the same manner as Example 1, and then the molecular electric wires are connected and fixed as a line as shown in  on a substrate. Specifically, an end of a lipophilic (hydrophobic) portion of one of the amphiphilic rod-shaped organic molecules  is contacted with an end of a lipophilic (hydrophobic) portion of another one of the amphiphilic rod-shaped organic molecules  and an end of a hydrophilic portion of one of the amphiphilic rod-shaped organic molecules  is contacted with an end of a lipophilic portion of still another one of the amphiphilic rod-shaped organic molecules , thereby extending the length of the molecular electric wires. Then, an electric circuit is formed by contacting an electrode that is connected to an electric power source for energization to each of the ends of the extended molecular electric wires. An ammeter is connected to a part of the electric circuit, and then the electric power source is switched on to energize a current of 100 mV to confirm that a current of 20 \u03bcA is flowing through the molecular electric wire circuit.","After causing the rod-shaped organic molecules prepared in Example 1 to carry the cyanine dye at its periphery in the same manner as Example 1, iodine is bonded to an end of the rod-shaped organic molecules as the target of capture and cyclodextrin is bonded to the other end as the capturing structural element to obtain a molecular electric wire.","A plurality of molecular electric wires are connected and fixed in a line on a substrate as shown in . Particularly, the iodine of the rod-shaped organic molecules  with iodine as the target capture  bonded an end thereof and cyclodextrin as the capturing structural element  connected to another end thereof is captured by the cyclodextrin of another rod-shaped organic molecules  with iodine as the target capture  bonded to an end thereof and cyclodextrin as the capturing structural element  connected to another end thereof, and with both ends of the molecular electric wires thus extended, an electrode that is connected to an electric power source for energization is brought into contact, thus an electric circuit is formed. An ammeter is connected to a part of the electric circuit, and then the electric power source is switched on to energize a current of 100 mV, thereby to confirm that a current of 20 \u03bcA is flowing through the molecular electric wire circuit.","After causing the rod-shaped organic molecules prepared in Example 1 to carry the cyanine dye at its periphery in the same manner as Example 1, a thymine pentamer TTTTT is bonded to an end of the rod-shaped organic molecule as the target of capture and a guanine pentamer GGGGG is bonded to the other end as the capturing structural element to obtain a molecular electric wire. Further, another molecular electric wire is obtained by causing the rod-shaped organic molecules prepared in Example 1 to carry the cyanine dye at its periphery in the same manner as Example 1 and then bonding an adenine pentamer AAAAA to an end of the rod-shaped organic molecules as the target of capture and bonding a cytosine pentamer CCCCC to the other end as the capturing structural element.","The two types of molecular electric wires are aligned and fixed in a line on a substrate as shown in . Specifically, the guanine pentamer GGGGG in the rod-shaped organic molecules , to which the thymine pentamer TTTTT is bonded to an end of the rod-shaped organic molecules  as the target of capture  and the guanine pentamer GGGGG is bonded to the other end as the capturing structural element , is complementarily bonded to the cytosine pentamer CCCCC in the rod-shaped organic molecules , to which the adenine pentamer AAAAA is bonded to an end of the rod-shaped organic molecules  as the target of capture  and the cytosine pentamer CCCCC is bonded to the other end as the capturing structural element , while the thymine pentamer TTTTT of one of the rod-shaped organic molecules  is complementarily bonded to the adenine pentamer AAAAA, which is the capturing structural element , in still another rod-shaped organic molecule  to make an extension. And then an electric circuit is formed by contacting an electrode that is connected to an electric power source for energization to each of the ends of the molecular electric wires thus extended. An ammeter is connected to a part of the electric circuit, and then the electric power source is switched on to energize a current of 100 mV to confirm that a current of 20 \u03bcA is flowing through the molecular electric wire circuit.","After forming a molecular electric wire by causing the rod-shaped organic molecule prepared in Example 1 to carry the cyanine dye at its periphery in the same manner as Example 1, the obtained \u03b1-helix copolypeptide PLLZ-P(MLG\/LGA) is reacted directly with halogenated alkylthiol under a weak basicity to introduce a thiol group into an end of poly L-lysine portion (PLLZ), which is a hydrophilic portion.","A plurality of amphiphilic \u03b1-helix copolypeptides PLLZ-P(MLG\/LGA) are applied on a substrate on which a pattern of a metal atom was formed by using an ion beam gun and both sides thereof are subjected to a surface treatment to become hydrophobic. Then, the metal atom forming the pattern and the thiol groups in the amphiphilic \u03b1-helix copolypeptides PLLZ-P(MLG\/LGA) are bonded. The substrate is then washed with water, so that the amphiphilic \u03b1-helix copolypeptides PLLZ-P(MLG\/LGA) that are not bonded to the metal atom are removed from the substrate. The amphiphilic \u03b1-helix copolypeptide PLLZ-P(MLG\/LGA) are positioned on the substrate with the hydrophobic portions being adjacent to the pattern and with the hydrophilic portions being away from the pattern and aligned with the longitudinal direction being directed to a substantially orthogonal direction with respect to the pattern.","In a molecular electric wire circuit thus formed, both ends of the pattern are connected to an ammeter and an electric power source. When the electric power source is switched on to provide a current of 100 mV, it is confirmed that the line of the electroconductive material  functioned as a molecular electric wire and a current of 40 \u03bcA is flowing along the line of the electroconductive materials  (along the pattern).","A molecular electric wire circuit is formed in the same manner as Example 5, except for introducing a plurality of thiol groups into the amphiphilic \u03b1-helix copolypeptides PLLZ-P(MLG\/LGA) on the periphery along the longitudinal direction thereof.","Since the amphiphilic \u03b1-helix copolypeptide PLLZ-P(MLG\/LGA) each have a hydrophobic portion and a hydrophilic portion, the portions of the same affinity (hydrophobic portions or hydrophilic portions) of the adjacent rod-shaped organic molecules among those aligned along the pattern are opposed to each other. When the electric power source is switched on to provide a current of 100 mV to the thus formed molecular electric wire circuit, it is confirmed that the line of the electroconductive material  functioned as a molecular electric wire and a current of 20 \u03bcA is flowing along the line of the electroconductive materials  (along the pattern).","A molecular electric wire circuit is formed in the same manner as Example 5, except for forming a pattern using an iodine atom, which is a target of capture, in place of the metal atom and using cyclodextrin, which is a capturing structural element, in place of the thiol group.","In the molecular electric wire circuit, the amphiphilic \u03b1-helix copolypeptides PLLZ-P(MLG\/LGA) are aligned and fixed on a substrate along the pattern by way of the cyclodextrin capturing the iodine atom, not by way of the bond between the metal atom and the thiol group. When the electric power source is switched on to provide a current of 100 mV to the thus formed molecular electric wire circuit, it is confirmed that the line of the electroconductive material  functioned as a molecular electric wire and a current of 20 \u03bcA is flowing along the line of the electroconductive materials  (along the pattern).","A molecular electric wire circuit is formed in the same manner as in Example 5 except for forming a pattern using a thymine pentamer TTTTT, which is a target of capture, in place of the metal atom and using an adenine pentamer AAAAA, which is a capturing structural element, in place of the thiol group.","In the molecular electric wire circuit, the amphiphilic \u03b1-helix copolypeptides PLLZ-P(MLG\/LGA) are aligned and fixed on a substrate along the pattern by way of the adenine pentamer AAAAA capturing the thymine pentamer TTTTT, not by way of the bond between the metal atom and the thiol group.
