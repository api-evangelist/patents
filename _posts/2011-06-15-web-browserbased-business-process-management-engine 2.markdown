{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","RELATED ART","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This disclosure relates generally to browser technology in a data processing system and more specifically to a business process management engine implementation in a Web browser in the data processing system.","Business process management (BPM) enables companies to model and improve critical business processes as well as automate steps in the processes. The modified processes are deployed in an environment, a process server\/workflow engine\/BPM engine, to execute the processes. The processes are monitored and managed.","Web Oriented Architecture (WOA), also referred to, as Enterprise Web 2.0 is an architecture for distributed systems including the World-Wide Web. Seen as an evolution, or a subset, of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), services in a WOA environment are provided and invoked using Representational State Transfer (REST) and similar programming models. REST is a particular style of software architecture for distributed hypermedia systems consisting of clients and servers. Clients initiate requests to servers while servers process requests and return responses to the requesting clients. The requests and responses are created and managed in a context of transfers of representations of resources.","BPM (and SOA) activities are classified in a lifecycle with a series of phases referred to as Model-Assemble-Deploy-Manage. Model is a phase of modeling and simulating business processes. Assemble is a phase of building code for individual services and the process being modeled. Deploy is a phase in which transfer of process flows to and execution on a BPM runtime occurs. Manage is a phase in which occurs managing and monitoring of business process executions.","A problem with existing BPM frameworks is complexity and the use on N-tier architectures. For example, a process flow runs in a heavyweight process server such as commercial\/open source BPM Servers, implemented on Java\u00ae EE architecture (Java is a registered trademark of Oracle Corporation and\/or its affiliates).","The current framework requirements impose a high barrier for businesses wanting to enter the BPM space. Existing workflow solutions are server-based, highly centralized and based on heavyweight systems. Moreover, these workflows only communicate with other server-based workflows exposing and consuming server-hosted services.","With reference to , a sequence diagram of an example approval process is presented.  depicts an example of using a traditional process flow implementation, in which the business process is an approval process.","Process  executes on business process management server , and comprises activities including address verification , manager review  and account verification  with input  and output . Address verification , and account verification  are traditional Web services.","Address verification  is an implementation of a Web service, for example, as in a .NET implementation operating on a business process management server or web server (Microsoft\u00ae.NET is available from Microsoft Corporation, Microsoft is a registered trademark of Microsoft Corporation in the United States and\/or other countries). Manager review  is a human task where a manager uses a Web browser to perform the task. Account verification  is another Web service, for example in a Java EE implementation operating on a business process management server or Web server. Process  runs in business process management server . Address verification  and account verification  may operate on the same business process management server  or different business process management servers or web servers.","Solutions exist today to simplify the problem of hosting individual services. For example, Opera\u2122 Unite is a Web browser that can be used as a Web server as well (Opera is a trademarks of Opera Software ASA. However, Opera Unite manages and runs individual services only. Opera Unite does not support choreography, including composition and workflow of these services, required by BPM. Moreover with Opera Unite the Web browsers do not communicate directly among each other; rather communication is performed through a web proxy server of Opera Unite. Using the Web proxy server, a user provides the Opera Unite URL of the user computer to enable other computers to access the computer of the user. The URL comprises a name of the user computer, the Opera user name, the name of the Unite service used (for example, file sharing) and user password. Thus, there is no dynamic discovery of Web browsers and individual services running on the Web browsers.","In another example, Paper Airplane and The Two Way Web (https:\/\/paperairplane.dev.java.net\/) is also a Web browser that can be used as a Web server. A difference from the previous example is an implementation using peer-to-peer JXTA (P2P\/JXTA\u2122) technology. JXTA is a Java\u00ae and extensible markup language based framework comprising a set of standards supporting peer-to-peer applications (Java is a registered trademark and JXTA is a trademark of Oracle and\/or its affiliates). P2P\/JXTA is fully decentralized using a concept referred to as P2P Mesh. Mesh networks comprise distributed networks, which use a routing technology to enable dynamic determination of which route a data packet takes. Creating a peer-to-peer network of all other executing Paper Airplane browsers to enable dynamic discovery uses a specialized domain name system called DisDNS for storing self defined domain name server (DNS) names and resolving the names from within the Web browser. However Paper Airplane does not run any individual services or support choreography including composition and workflow of services, required by BPM. REST provides an architectural style and programming model optimized for the World-Wide Web, and is lighter-weight than traditional N-tier architectures. Similarly, REST does not support service choreography, only individual service invocation.","Web browsers can be used as Web services servers, in which the Web services hosted by the browser can be invoked as part of a business process. The business process (process flow), however, runs on a server-based business process management engine and not in the Web browser.","Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) provides a language for modeling business processes. Some vendors provide Web-based modeling tools but vendors then require the modeled business processes to be deployed on a server-side engine (BPMN or BPEL).","Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) defines how to choreograph service invocations. BPEL implementations are server-based. Vendors do not provide a Web browser-based BPEL engine. For example, a vendor product claims to be a browser-based BPM solution but the implementation is on Java EE and is therefore server-based.","Business processes (process flows) can be managed and operated from client-side Web browsers but the role of the browser is limited to a client-side graphic user interface (GUI) within the BPM architecture. Full potential of the Web browser is not being utilized. Current solutions typically provide a capability to model and design BPM solutions in a browser, but then require deployment of the solution to a server based BPM\/Workflow engine. In addition, services that are choreographed by the BPM engine also run on servers using N-tier architecture.","According to an embodiment, a computer-implemented process for a Web browser-based business process management engine receives a Web browser, embeds a lightweight business process management engine in the received Web browser to form a Web browser-based business process management engine, and choreograph service invocations using the Web browser-based business process management engine.","According to another embodiment, a computer program product for a Web browser-based business process management engine comprises a computer recordable-type media containing computer executable program code stored thereon. The computer executable program code comprises computer executable program code for receiving a Web browser, computer executable program code for embedding a lightweight business process management engine in the received Web browser to form a Web browser-based business process management engine, and computer executable program code for executing services using the Web browser-based business process management engine.","According to another embodiment, an apparatus for a Web browser-based business process management engine, comprises a communications fabric, a memory connected to the communications fabric, wherein the memory contains computer executable program code, a communications unit connected to the communications fabric, an input\/output unit connected to the communications fabric, a display connected to the communications fabric, and a processor unit connected to the communications fabric. The processor unit executes the computer executable program code to direct the apparatus to receive a Web browser, embed a lightweight business process manager in the received Web browser to form a Web browser-based business process management engine, and choreograph service invocations using the Web browser-based business process management engine.","Although an illustrative implementation of one or more embodiments is provided below, the disclosed systems and\/or methods may be implemented using any number of techniques.

Browser  is an example of a Web browser including a Web browser-based business process management engine system.","Browser  is a Web browser comprising a number of components including support of an underlying data processing system such as data processing system  of  implementation of client  communicating with other systems using network  of data processing system  of . Browser  comprises components including user interface , communications , storage  and business process management engine .","User interface  comprises features enabling presentation of data to a user and prompting for responses from the user when required typically using display  of data processing system .

Process  is an example of an enhanced approval process implementation within a context of Web browser .","Process  comprises address verification , manager review , and account verification , with input  and output , which are similar in nature to corresponding elements of process  of . Process , however, differs from the previously described process  of  in that the approval process of process  runs in (is choreographed with) Web browser  as opposed to the business process management server based BPM\/workflow engine of process . In process , address verification  and account verification  services are Web browser based REST services, as opposed to business process management server  server based Java EE or .NET implementations of process  of .","While running an address verification service in a Web browser may be known, the example illustrates removal of a dependency on servers to implement a business process management solution, including workflow, and to show process implementation and individual services invoked by the example process all run in a Web browser. Manager review , a human task, remains as part of process . While using the example, a capability is further provided to enable any of the services, for example, account verification , to still run on a .NET or Java EE implementation. The capability therefore provides compatibility with traditional service implementations.","In the example of process  all services run in the browser. Parts of a business process lifecycle are supported in a browser, specifically the model portion, and elements of assemble and manage portions, for example, currently available tools to model business processes in a browser, or browser-based monitoring dashboards. However, typical BPM frameworks, systems or engines require a server-based implementation for the deploy phase (for executing the process flow). An implementation of an embodiment of process  provides a capability for full BPM lifecycle support in the browser. Using an implementation of an embodiment of process  enables the workflow engine to run in a Web browser.","Embodiments of process  provide a capability for a lightweight, lower barrier of entry to business process management. Embodiments of process  are decentralized, completely removing a dependency on central servers. An end user is provided a capability to execute workflows from a browser of the user, providing the user with a certain level of independence from an information technology department. An implementation of an embodiment of process  is scalable and highly available because through addition of multiple Web browsers with redundant processes to a system.","Further, implementations of an embodiment of process  are compatible with traditional BPM and service oriented architecture (SOA) approaches which complements existing server-based workflow systems, where parts of the workflow can run on existing BPM and SOA implementations. Implementations of an embodiment of process  do not replace existing server-based workflow systems.","However, implementation can be considered a complement to existing server-based workflow systems with a motive of providing an additional decentralized workflow capability granting end users a capability to create, implement and manage associated workflows in respective browsers typically adding greater flexibility to manage day to day operations.","With reference to , a block diagram of a Web browser-based business process management engine system, in accordance with an embodiment of the disclosure is presented.

For example, two blocks shown in succession may, in fact, be executed substantially concurrently, or the blocks may sometimes be executed in the reverse order, depending upon the functionality involved. It will also be noted that each block of the block diagrams and\/or flowchart illustration, and combinations of blocks in the block diagrams and\/or flowchart illustration, can be implemented by special purpose hardware-based systems that perform the specified functions or acts, or combinations of special purpose hardware and computer instructions.","The corresponding structures, materials, acts, and equivalents of all means or step plus function elements in the claims below are intended to include any structure, material, or act for performing the function in combination with other claimed elements as specifically claimed. The description of the present invention has been presented for purposes of illustration and description, but is not intended to be exhaustive or limited to the invention in the form disclosed. Many modifications and variations will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention. The embodiment was chosen and described in order to best explain the principles of the invention and the practical application, and to enable others of ordinary skill in the art to understand the invention for various embodiments with various modifications as are suited to the particular use contemplated.","The invention can take the form of an entirely hardware embodiment, an entirely software embodiment or an embodiment containing both hardware and software elements. In a preferred embodiment, the invention is implemented in software, which includes but is not limited to firmware, resident software, microcode, and other software media that may be recognized by one skilled in the art.","It is important to note that while the present invention has been described in the context of a fully functioning data processing system, those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the processes of the present invention are capable of being distributed in the form of a computer readable medium of instructions and a variety of forms and that the present invention applies equally regardless of the particular type of signal bearing media actually used to carry out the distribution. Examples of computer readable media include recordable-type media, such as a floppy disk, a hard disk drive, a RAM, CD-ROMs, DVD-ROMs, and transmission-type media, such as digital and analog communications links, wired or wireless communications links using transmission forms, such as, for example, radio frequency and light wave transmissions. The computer readable media may take the form of coded formats that are decoded for actual use in a particular data processing system.","A data processing system suitable for storing and\/or executing program code will include at least one processor coupled directly or indirectly to memory elements through a system bus. The memory elements can include local memory employed during actual execution of the program code, bulk storage, and cache memories which provide temporary storage of at least some program code in order to reduce the number of times code must be retrieved from bulk storage during execution. Input\/output or I\/O devices (including but not limited to keyboards, displays, pointing devices, etc.) can be coupled to the system either directly or through intervening I\/O controllers.","Network adapters may also be coupled to the system to enable the data processing system to become coupled to other data processing systems or remote printers or storage devices through intervening private or public networks. Modems, cable modems, and Ethernet cards are just a few of the currently available types of network adapters.","The description of the present invention has been presented for purposes of illustration and description, and is not intended to be exhaustive or limited to the invention in the form disclosed.
