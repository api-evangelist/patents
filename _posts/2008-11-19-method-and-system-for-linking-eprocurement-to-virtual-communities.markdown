No. 11\/968,384, filed Jan. 2, 2008, and claims priority to Provisional Application Ser. No. 60\/989,430, filed Nov. 20, 2007 and Provisional Application Ser. No. 61\/043,897, filed Apr. 10, 2008; the disclosure of each of which is incorporated herein in its entirety, at least by reference.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention is in the field of e-commerce, and particularly as it pertains to virtual communities such as social networks, online gaming communities and \u201cvirtual worlds\u201d, and to business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce and supply chain (also commonly known as eProcurement) technologies. Yet more particularly, the present invention pertains to linking of B2B eProcurement networks to virtual communities in order to allow businesses to receive all traditional e-procurement services while gaining unique sales channels and advertising opportunities by participating in Virtual Communities (VC's), and allowing VC's to receive highly targeted products (and advertising) for their members to promote, buy and sell.","2. Discussion of the State of the Art","In the field of entertainment media, several trends have emerged in recent years, quite separately, that when combined offer surprising new possibilities for individuals and enterprises alike. One of these trends is emergence of product placements as a new kind of advertisement. This now familiar technique involves advertisers (a vendor of products such as personal computers, cars, liquors and toys, just to name a few) paying content creators (movie studios, TV studios and others) to display or refer to their products in prominent ways within the content itself. This is in stark contrast to previous practices in advertising, where boundaries between advertising and entertainment content were clearly defined; with product placements, commercial messages can be included within content for which consumers pay to view, and with which consumers are strongly emotionally engaged.","A second trend is democratization of content creation. In the age of the great movie studios, control of content creation (at least in new media of radio and movies) was entirely within the hands of a few very powerful businessmen. Later, as costs of high quality production came down, and as more and more channels to market became available, first through UHF television stations and later through cable and satellite systems, content creation became more diffuse, taking place across thousands of companies acting in various capacities. But only recently has serious content routinely been created by individuals, by consumers. The emergence of \u201cuser-generated content\u201d (UGC) has been a large part of the post-2000 boom in user-centric web services, which commonly is labeled broadly as Web 2.0. Today, with blogs, personal web pages, and sites for uploading of user-generated music and video clips, more and more of what people read, hear and watch is created outside of the corporate world, in the world of UGC.","Another important trend has been emergence of highly targeted advertising. Advertising once was a mass media affair, and segmentation tended to go no further than choosing during which radio or television show to advertise. Today, Internet portal companies, search engines, marketing database companies with access to credit card and other financial data all compete to precisely target advertisements to ever more finely sliced segments of consumer populations. The rapid rise of Google has also shown how much the advertising equation has changed; while charging only a tiny fraction of what traditional media charged for advertising, and while permitting only the most rudimentary text-based advertisements, Google has grabbed a significant share and built a highly profitable business because its ad placements are highly targeted and because advertisers only pay when ads are clicked.","Finally, the last few years have seen emergence of a variety of virtual communities, self-organizing groups of individuals, usually assembled online, that engage in new forms of social interaction. Among these is a new category of web-based entity, social networks. Already there are thousands of these, ranging from very large operators such as MySpace or Facebook to very small, highly verticalized players. There is even a company selling a platform for launching new social networks. And social networking has quickly become a major outlet for user-generated content (in fact, one can view each subscriber's profile page as a form of UGC).","As is typical in web trends, original social networking pioneers offered \u201csomething for nothing\u201d, and most social networking sites continue to offer a wide range of free services. But soon after, people began seeking ways to develop profitable business models to monetize large numbers of loyal users that had been created in a very short time. Much as Google did in search, these pioneers are looking to advertising to satisfy the need to generate revenue from highly visited social networking sites, and they are typically adopting methods used by Google\u2014allowing users to provide access to advertisers on their profile pages in return for a small slice of advertising revenue. This is by now a classical business model\u2014site operators, user whose profile pages are used, media buyers and others all take pieces of the total advertising spend committed by advertisers (these by and large are the same kinds of companies as in all of the previous ages, plus new web-based companies).","One limitation of currently emerging models of allowing advertisers to place ads on profile pages is that it is a largely passive affair. A user can, for instance, subscribe to one of many affiliate advertising services and make a space available for ads to be displayed, but the user has no control over what ads are displayed. Advertisers will display ads that seem to correlate well with content of the page (for instance, a user's blog on \u201cthe new physics\u201d will likely show ads from a science magazine, whereas one that focuses on a particular sports team would likely show ads promoting sports apparel or memorabilia. But the user cannot choose, and certainly the user cannot block undesirable advertisers from her page.","This limitation, besides providing for possibility of incongruous and occasionally counterproductive ad placements, also leads to an inability of mainstream advertisers to take advantage of a most powerful aspect of social networks\u2014which is precisely that social networks are self-organized market segments. People who network together, whether in a broad \u201cnetwork of friends\u201d sense or in a narrow \u201cnetwork of first edition enthusiasts\u201d sense, automatically define segments of great interest to advertisers, as these social networks generally will share much in common, including buying habits. But since the essence of social networks is their self-organization and, accordingly, their dynamic nature, traditional advertising models fall short.","All problems cited above in social networks also occur in other forms of virtual communities, such as online gaming communities, \u201cvirtual worlds\u201d in which whole economic systems are operated online and members engage in \u201calternate lives\u201d.","What is clearly needed is a way to bring together the worlds of advertising and virtual communities in a way that serves the best interests of both key constituents\u2014those who wish to advertise and those to whom advertisers are directed. Users and managers of virtual communities, should they be able to influence what, when and how is advertised to them, would be able to achieve the reasonable goal of having ads that addressed actual needs and preferences, and of to share in benefits thus created. And, in a continuation of the trend away from mass advertising that search-based ads illustrate, advertisers would be able to precisely target content at those social networks that are most predisposed to favorably react to the message, and to do so at a remarkably low cost, thus driving revenue per ad dollar up dramatically.","Furthermore, a parallel set of trends has developed in the area of business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce, including supply chain or eProcurement technologies. More and more businesses routinely procure the raw, processed and finished goods needed to satisfy the needs of their customers from business partners via electronic networks. Early progress in this direction took place through use of electronic data interchange (EDI), which allowed a limited number of typically very large enterprises to coordinate ordering and logistics of commodities and financial instruments. For example, manufacturers would use then-new technology of enterprise resource management software to coordinate purchase of raw materials in order to achieve dramatic productivity improvement through use of \u201cjust in time\u201d and related management methodologies. With emergence of the Internet and the World Wide Web globally, the breadth and depth of activities performed using EDI expanded, and moved to the new massively interconnected world of the Web.","At the time of the invention, many B2B marketplaces have emerged in which communities of enterprises coordinate and compete with much greater speed and flexibility than was ever possible before. These changes have greatly improved resilience of the global market system, enabling it to withstand multiple shocks with surprisingly little disruption, since inventory levels are lower and more fluid and since disruptions are known and can be accommodated far more rapidly than before.","Unfortunately, these gains in B2B e-commerce have proceeded in relatively complete isolation from equally profound changes in how consumers communicate, and in particular from phenomena of virtual communities such as social networks. This is unfortunate, since virtual communities perform a natural and important function of filtering the vast complexity of human social interactions. In the past businesses have invested untold billions in a quest to understand natural groupings, or segmentations, of consumer populations, and to understand what consumers want. Most such activities are still performed using tools developed early in the age of mass media and advertising, which is to say during the period between 1920 and 1950. These tools include surveys, focus groups, data mining of consumer purchases, and the like. Social networks and similar virtual communities make it possible to engage consumers actively in answering timeless questions (\u201cwho are they?\u201d and \u201cwhat do they want?\u201d). Today relatively little e-commerce leverages the extraordinary growth of the virtual community phenomenon described above, and partly this is because of its novelty. But also, businesses struggle because, while they can easily procure what they need from global networks of competing suppliers, they enjoy no such easy access to the highly fragmented\u2014but also highly segmented\u2014world of virtual communities of consumers.","Accordingly, it is an aim of the present invention to provide a system and a method for linking B2B eProcurement markets with processes for selling through virtual communities, for example by monetizing user-generated content that dominates these communities, and to provide vendors and advertisers a method to promote and sell products into and through virtual communities using marketing events and promotions, community-generated and user-generated content, and targeted advertisements.","In an effort to solve the problems described above of linking business-to-business (B2B) eProcurement systems to virtual communities, the inventors conceived of the instant invention. Specifically, they conceived of the notion of augmenting user interfaces used by merchants in procuring goods for further sale by tightly linking them to virtual communities, thus providing merchants the ability to use the same interface to manage product promotions and sales into virtual communities.","More particularly, in a preferred embodiment of the invention an e-commerce system, comprising a master console software application executing on a first network-connected server and accessible to a plurality of external systems used by merchants, a shopping cart software application executing on a second network-connected server and coupled to the first server, and interface software executing on the second server for interacting with content associated with a first user is disclosed, wherein a merchant interacts with the master console software application to load information about a product available for promotion and sale by the first user, the master console software application makes that information available to the shopping cart software application, and the interface software provides information and code related to the specific product to the content, the code compatible with the content, and upon the code being activated in the content by a second user, the second user is connected to the shopping cart software application, and is thereby enabled to buy the product.","In another preferred embodiment the master console software application and the shopping cart software application are executed on a single server.","In yet another preferred embodiment, a merchant further interacts with the master console software application to provide specific information pertaining to promotion of the product, and the product promotion information is made available to users via the shopping cart software application, thereby enabling users to embed approved advertisements in content.","In a further preferred embodiment a merchant further interacts with the master console software application to provide specific information pertaining to surveys, and the survey information is thereupon made available to the shopping cart software application; further characterized in that the shopping cart software application executes among its user base surveys based at least in part on the survey information provided by the merchant, and the survey results are provided at least in part back to the merchant via the master console software application.","The inventors provide a system and a method for combination of eProcurement and virtual communities in order to allow each to take advantage of capabilities of the other. In particular, it is desirable for merchants to be able to augment well-understood and widely adopted capabilities of modern eProcurement networks with ability to directly sell their products and services into virtual communities. And it is desirable for virtual community operators and members to facilitate targeted marketing of products and services appropriate for the members of the virtual community, as a means to monetize ability of the virtual community to aggregate large numbers of users and to enable those users to self-select into subnetworks based on common relationships, interests, geographical locations or other factors. It being one of the clear advantages of virtual communities that this self-assembly takes place naturally, it is attractive to marketers to leverage these ready-made market segments, many of which would never be identified by traditional market segmentation strategies.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","150","120","101","102","102","102","103","151","150","101","100","152","152","151","102","150","153","153","151","110","151","101","111"],"i":["a ","n","a ","n"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["101","151","102","101","202","203","204","205","206","207","208","209","210","101","151","230","110","111","224","225","226","227"]},"Merchant users of the e2VC system are able to manage all of their activities both for traditional B2B transactional purposes and for marketing to targeted virtual communities in one unitary user interface, providing a capability that has not existed before. In the art today, business users must conduct their eProcurement transactions using a dedicated eProcurement site (there are many) and then use a totally different site and set of processes to perform their business-to-consumer transactions. E2VC allows business a unique ability of using one master console for all of their eProcurement needs while simultaneously allowing them to sell products to and through virtual communities, which represent extremely valuable new markets insofar as the participants in virtual communities tend to self-organize into identifiable market segments with common needs and desires. One challenge which the instant invention addresses is that there is currently no way to effectively and proactively market to those dynamic, self-organizing market segments other than using tag-driven ad campaigns. Because of the variety of services which can be provided via the Master B2B Console, businesses are able to manage automated advertising campaigns, promotions, and member surveys with virtual communities that are e2VC-enabled. It should also be noted that the pairings shown in  between Master B2B Console  and universal shopping cart  are not necessarily or even primarily exclusive; a merchant may choose to participate in more than one B2B eProcurement network, and he may choose to market to more than one social network from any given B2B eProcurement network.","Users  of the virtual community also interact with several distinct modules within the universal shopping cart of the invention, including receiving served ads while viewing content from within the virtual community from ad serving module , responding to surveys provided by survey content module , viewing product information and options provided via the product offers module , and checking out to complete purchases made using the universal shopping cart using checkout module . It should be understood that these are exemplary functions, and there may be more or less functions provided by the universal shopping cart, or by equivalent virtual community-hosted software applications, in embodiments of the invention. Some important elements are the existence of integration via links  to the Master B2B Console and of at least the checkout module  for executing transactions within the virtual community. Furthermore, merchants may promote products through virtual communities from the Master B2B Console using applications other than the universal shopping cart, for example by placing context-sensitive ads within content hosted by the virtual community using promotion module  and a software application other than a universal shopping cart that provides ad management module .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["301","302","111","151","303","150","151","111","304","151","305","111","151"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["150","401","402","303","227","404","405","406","407"]},"e2VC networks can operate with virtual communities other than the familiar online examples such as online social networks. For example, using internet protocol television (IPTV), virtual communities can be formed in a manner analogous to, but different than, what happens on the Internet. Viewers of highly targeted programming can establish \u201cvirtual channels\u201d that may consist of, for example, a mix of user-generated and professionally-generated content, and may include a high degree of interactivity. Mobile phone users may form \u201cfriends and family\u201d and similar types of social networks. Members of an organization may agree to establish an \u201calways on\u201d conference bridge using conventional telephony, and members may join and leave the conference at will. Multilevel marketing companies, or network marketing companies, often use networks of associates who conduct home parties centered on particular products or services. In each of these non-traditional cases, a virtual community is established whose membership is self-organized and dynamic, and in each case the virtual community constitutes a highly desirable, if sometimes ephemeral, target market segment for appropriate product and service vendors. The e2VC concept is applicable in all of these cases. What is needed is a data communications channel from the universal shopping cart to at least one of the members of the virtual community (for example, the person leading a home party) for the passing of product and promotion data from the shopping cart to the group and for executing orders in the shopping cart.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["151","101","152","152","152","152","152","152","501","501","151","153","153","501","151","502","151","153","151","151"],"i":["a ","b","a","b","c ","d ","a ","b","a ","b"]},"It will be appreciated that the examples provided in this specification are exemplary in nature and should not limit the invention beyond what is claimed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["600","610","660","601","611","612","600","600","620","640","640","660","600","620","640","610","600","600","660","600","660","612","612","613","600"],"i":["a","b","a","c","a","c ","a","c","b ","a","c ","a","c ","a","c ","a","c"]},"It is an important attribute of the instant invention that one or a plurality of external ecommerce facilities  can separately or jointly upload product information, promotional material, commercial information such as pricing, quantities, contractual requirements, lists of banned consumer endorsers, lists of products or web sites with which a given product is not to be associated, and the like, to the Master B2B Console. Endorsing users can access this information in order to make informed selections of products they wish to endorse (from the set of products which they are allowed by the Master B2B Console to see), from within a virtual community such as MySpace , or another social network , or a content aggregator such as YouTube, or a gaming community such as a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game , or indeed any virtual community Master or indeed any website 2B Console  via the Internet .","User endorsements or promotions of products can be viewed by other users via Mugzy components  and  that are provided by virtual communities -or other online services -, or they can embedded within a user's own homepage , a user's personal blog , or any personal web page or other online content controlled by the user , or indeed via Mugzy Mobile  interfaces on a mobile phone or via IP TV. In an embodiment of the invention, an IP TV provider  interacts with a Master B2B Console  to obtain information about products and promotions available for endorsement in user content, and makes this information available in its own Brand Bazaar , which is in effect a separate Master B2B Console  hosted by the IP TV service provider . In this example, the IP TV service provider  may choose to operate a shopping channel that directly sells products made available through an external Master B2B Console  (this gaining access to a large variety of products made available by sources such as manufacturers with whom the IP TV service provider  may have no formal business relationship), or that allows consumers to sell products by providing content and associated product endorsements (for example, a funny home videos show with consumer-generated product endorsements could be hosted by the IP TV service provider  in which viewers would be able to interactively view detailed information and purchase endorsed products using the IP TV Brand Bazaar  without leaving the show or having to use their computer to go online).","It can be seen that a wide variety of arrangements of product suppliers, content providers, and content hosters are possible under the invention, with a key element being the ability of end users to select content of their own or another's creation for use as a vehicle within which, or associated with which, to endorse products they believe in, such that other users may view the selected content and the associated endorsements and optionally view more information or purchase endorsed products without leaving the endorsing user's content.","All of the embodiments described in this disclosure are exemplary in nature and should not be construed as limitations of the invention.
