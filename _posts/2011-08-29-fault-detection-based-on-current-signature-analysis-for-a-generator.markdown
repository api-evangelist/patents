{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","BRIEF DESCRIPTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Embodiments of the invention relate generally to the monitoring of a condition of an electromechanical machine. Specifically, embodiments of the invention relate to a method and system for monitoring the condition of a drive-train system and bearing of an electromechanical machine based on current signal analysis (CSA).","Conventionally, the monitoring of mechanical abnormalities in electromechanical systems has been mainly performed using vibration signals. It has been observed that mechanical faults in the drive-train produce vibrations in radial rotor movement which in turn produce torque oscillations at the rotor mechanical rotating frequency. The monitoring and study of the rotor mechanical rotating frequency may lead to detecting mechanical faults associated with the drive-train system. However, condition monitoring using vibration signals has numerous disadvantages such as signal background noise due to external excitation motion, sensitivity to the installation position, and their invasive measurement nature.","Other condition monitoring techniques are based on the observation that the load torque oscillations cause the stator current to be phase modulated, whereby the stator current signature is analyzed for detecting mechanical perturbations due to fault. Such current monitoring techniques are receiving more and more attention in the detection of mechanical faults in electric machines since it offers significant economic savings and easy implementation. For example, in the case of bearing fault detection in electromechanical machines, bearing failures may be categorized into single-point defects or generalized roughness faults. The single-point defects have been detected by using motor current signal analysis (MCSA) with bearing mechanical characteristic frequencies and by considering these types of anomalies as eccentricity fault. However, for generalized roughness faults the characteristic bearing fault frequencies are not observable or may not exist, particularly at an early stage. In addition, irrespective of the type of fault, the bearing fault signatures are usually subtle compared to the dominant components in the sampled stator current such as the supply fundamental harmonics, eccentricity harmonics, and slot harmonics. Unlike bearing vibration monitoring, for which industry standards have been developed from long-time field experience, the field experience in stator current monitoring is limited, and significant difficulties exist. For example, the magnitude of bearing fault signatures may vary at different applications given that the bearing fault signatures in the stator current are already subtle. Further, gearbox monitoring using stator current signal analysis has been rarely proposed although gearboxes are widely used in industrial applications.","Therefore, there exists a need for an improved method and system for monitoring the condition of a drive-train system, specifically a gearbox and bearing, using current signature analysis.","In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, a method for detecting mechanical faults in a generator is provided. The method includes acquiring electrical signals representative of an operating condition of the generator. The method also includes normalizing the electrical signals to extract spectral information. The method further includes detecting a fault based on analyzing the spectral information.","In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, a system for detecting and bearing fault of a generator is provided. The system includes one or more sensors for acquiring electrical signals representative of an operating condition of the generator. The system also includes a controller for normalizing the electrical signals to extract spectral information. The system further includes a fault detection unit module for detecting one or more faults in the gearbox based on analyzing the extracted spectral information.","An electrical multi-phase imbalance separation technique for high sensitivity detection of faults in an electromechanical machine (EMM) including drive-train abnormalities and bearing faults is described herein. The technique provides for differentiating a deteriorated EMM component's condition from normal or admissible conditions based on possibly subtle changes in the magnitude of fault signatures. The dominant components in the stator current of a typical electromechanical machine are the supply fundamental and harmonics, the eccentricity harmonics, the slot harmonics, the saturation harmonics, and other components from unknown sources including environmental noise. Since such dominant components exist before and after the presence of a bearing fault, a large body of the information they carry is not related to the bearing fault. In this sense, they are basically \u201cnoise\u201d to the EMM fault detection problem. Comparatively, the components injected by a drive-train fault in the stator current have a much lower magnitude than those dominant components. Thus the sensitivity of detection suffers even with the best of instruments and analysis methods that are fundamentally based on individual phase analysis.","The frequency of the dominant components can be typically determined from the supply frequency, rotor speed, and machine structure. If drive-train fault signatures are considered as signal and those dominant components are considered as noise, then the drive-train fault detection problem is essentially a low signal-to-noise ratio problem. Further, since the frequency of the signal may not be predictable, the signal and noise may have identical frequencies. Thus, it is appropriate to remove the noise components to discover the fault signature. Thus, the dominant components that are not related to drive-train faults in the stator current are estimated and then cancelled by their estimates in a real-time fashion. By doing so, the remaining components (i.e. noise cancelled stator current) are more related to drive-train faults.","One embodiment of the invention provides for systematically and dynamically eliminating the contributions of the symmetrical or useful components of an electrical signal of a multi-phase system such as current, voltage, or power. Such elimination allows the \u201cdistortions\u201d of the electrical signals caused by machine asymmetry and\/or fault to get highlighted in the AC spectrum and thus make their detection much easier. More specifically, the method involves squaring the instantaneous values of an electrical signal (current, voltage, power, etc.) of each of the multiple phases and summing them. The squaring of the instantaneous values of an electrical signal \u2018folds\u2019 or adds all the symmetrical or balanced (and normally useful) component contributions into an equivalent DC signal. As a result, only unbalanced components in the signal, if any, indicating asymmetry or fault will show up as AC quantities at twice frequency. Thus, by such elimination of all symmetrical terms, the effects of abnormalities, be it inherent machine asymmetry, stator-winding fault, or drivetrain fault, or main bearing fault, stand out in the AC spectrum, as they do not have to compete with the useful or symmetrical components. Thus, the resulting AC spectrum that can be ascribed only to an abnormal condition is analyzed with a much higher level of sensitivity.","Referring to , an electromechanical machine (EMM), such as a 3-phase generator, is configured to generate power. The EMM assembly  includes a rotor assembly , a main bearing , a main shaft , a gearbox , electrical sensors (not shown), and a multi-phase generator . The EMM assembly  also includes a controller for monitoring and controlling the operation of the multi-phase generator  in response to generator fault conditions. The controller includes a processor for detecting the presence of a faulty condition of various components, including a drive-train system and bearing, within the EMM assembly . The controller will be discussed in greater detail with respect to . The electrical signal sensors may be current and voltage sensors for acquiring current and voltage data pertaining to the multi-phase generator . For example, the current sensor senses current data from one or more of the multiple phases of a multi-phase generator. More specifically, in the case of a 3-phase induction generator, the current and voltage sensors sense the current and voltage data from the three phases of the 3-phase induction generator. While certain embodiments of the present invention will be described with respect to a multi-phase generator, other embodiments of the present invention can be applied to other multi-phase electromechanical machines.","In one embodiment of the invention, the current and voltage sensors respectively detect stator current data from the multi-phase generator . The stator current data and voltage data acquired from the sensors is communicated to the controller, for further processing and analysis. The analysis includes performing current signature analysis (CSA) to detect faults within the EMM including drive-train and bearing faults. According to an embodiment of the invention, the controller is configured to eliminate the contributions of the symmetrical or useful components of an electrical signal so that, only unbalanced components in the signal relating to fault will show up as AC quantities in the AC spectrum. Particularly, the controller is programmed to remove such non-fault related symmetrical or useful components by squaring the instantaneous values of the current data for each of the multiple phases and summing the squared values. As a result, the non-fault related symmetrical components are transformed to DC quantities while the fault related asymmetrical components of the current signal show up in the AC spectrum at twice the frequency.","Referring now to , a detailed block diagram of the controller is shown. As stated with respect to , controller  includes a processor  and an Electrical Multi-phase Imbalance Separation technique (eMIST) unit . The eMIST unit  is connected to the sensor bank  and receives stator current and voltage data for each phase of the multi-phase generator  and prepares the current and voltage data for processing by the processor . The functions of the eMIST unit  will be described in greater detail with reference to , , and . While the eMIST unit  is shown as a standalone component, it is also realized that the functions of the eMIST unit  could be performed by the processor .","The processor  functions as an imbalance separation system that systematically and dynamically eliminates the contributions of the symmetrical or useful components of an electrical signal of a multi-phase system such as current or voltage or power. Such elimination allows the \u201cdistortions\u201d of the electrical signals caused by machine  asymmetry and\/or fault to get highlighted in the AC spectrum. In other words, the processor  is configured to treat the fundamental frequency components as noise and the remaining frequency components as fault related components. Dynamically eliminating the noise components from continuously acquired stator current components yields purely fault related components which are injected into the stator current by the electromechanical faults. For example, the processor  may be programmed to eliminate the fundamental frequency (e.g., 60 Hz) and low frequency harmonics (especially the base frequency component) from the measured stator current data. The removal of the fundamental frequency from the measured stator current data can greatly improve the analog-to-digital conversion resolution and SNR, as the 60 Hz fundamental frequency has a large magnitude in the frequency spectrum of the current signal.","The processor  may be programmed to further analyze the noise cancelled stator current. Specifically, a threshold can be computed such that a measurement frequency falling outside the threshold indicates a deteriorated\/abnormal EMM component condition. One approach to compute the threshold may be to find the highest level of fault signatures during normal conditions and set this value fixed as the threshold.","Referring to , in an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the eMIST unit  provides for noise cancellation in the stator current and isolation of fault signal therein. To provide accurate noise cancellation in the stator current, the eMIST unit  is configured to dynamically eliminate the non-fault related, balanced components i.e., the noise components in the stator current. In order to dynamically eliminate noise components in the stator current spectrum, the eMIST unit  is configured to square the instantaneous values of an electrical signal (current, voltage, power, etc.) of each of the multiple phases and sum the squared instantaneous values, according to equations (1) and (2), so that the symmetrical or balanced (and normally useful) components get transformed into an equivalent DC quantity and any unbalanced, fault-related components appear at twice the frequency in the AC spectrum.\n\n\u2003\u2003(1)\n\n\u2003\u2003(2)\n","As a result, only terms with any asymmetry show up as AC quantities in the AC spectrum for I and V. Thus, by this effective elimination of all symmetrical terms, the effects of abnormalities, be it inherent machine asymmetry or a drive-train component, or bearing fault, stand out in the AC spectrum as AC quantities. Thus, the resulting AC spectrum that can be ascribed only to an abnormal condition is analyzed for a faulty drivetrain or bearing condition with a much higher level of sensitivity. The processor  performs fault analysis on the results of equations (1) and (2) and detects a fault in the presence of any fault-related AC quantity in the AC spectrum.","It should be noted that the mechanical faults related to the EMM assembly  may also include faults in the rotor assembly . In the case of faults occurring in the rotor assembly , a measurement of stator current will not help detect a fault associated with the rotor since any fault occurring in the rotor will create equal modulation in all the n-phases of the multi-phase generator, with \u2018n\u2019 being the number of phases. In order to detect faults in the rotor assembly, the eMIST unit  is configured to compute baseline measurements as illustrated in , and then calculate a \u201chybrid\u201d stator current data, as illustrated in . The baseline measurements of stator current and voltage data are the current and voltage data associated with healthy drive-train and bearing components and acquired during non-faulty operating conditions of the EMM assembly . The baseline stator current data associated with healthy drive-train and bearing conditions may include a set of stator current data for each of the multiple phases that are acquired, shortly after the installation of the EMM assembly  including the bearing and drive-train components. In an example, the baseline stator electrical signals are acquired during the initial operation of the EMM assembly , i.e., the first time the EMM assembly  is run after the EMM assembly  is installed. The stator current data thus acquired ensures that no drive-train or bearing fault related component is included in the stator current. Referring to , in an example, the eMIST unit  receives the current and voltage data from the bank of sensors  and computes the baseline measurements for current and voltage according to equations (3) and (4) below,\n\nbaseline=-baseline-baseline-baseline\u2003\u2003(3)\n\nbaseline=-baseline-baseline-baseline\u2003\u2003(4)\n\nWhere,\n\nIbaseline, is the baseline stator current data measured during healthy machine conditions\n\nIa-baseline is the baseline stator current data for the first phase\n\nIb-baseline is the baseline stator current data for the second phase\n\nIn-baseline is the baseline stator current data for the nth phase\n\nVbaseline is the baseline stator voltage data measured during healthy machine conditions\n\nVa-baseline is the baseline stator voltage data for the first phase\n\nVb-baseline is the baseline stator voltage data for the second phase\n\nVn-baseline is the baseline stator voltage data for the nth phase.\n","Thus, the baseline current (I) and voltage (V) data is a sum of the squares of the instantaneous values of current and voltage signal of each of the multiple phases. The eMIST unit  is further configured to perform a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on the baseline stator current and voltage values, according to equations (5) and (6) in order to decompose the non-fault related components in the current signal (I) into an equivalent DC quantity while rendering the fault related components in the AC spectrum at twice the frequency in the frequency domain. Since all the components in the stator current at a healthy bearing condition are noise, no fault information is embedded in the AC spectrum during baseline measurements. Therefore, when the fault develops, only the noise components show up in the AC spectrum at twice frequency.\n\nFFT()=2*baseline\u2003\u2003(5)\n\nFFT()=2*baseline\u2003\u2003(6)\n","In an ideal situation, assuming that the EMM assembly  is operating normally with no mechanical faults, the resulting stator current and voltage data will have the non-fault related components, i.e., the balanced components eliminated and with no fault-related components in the AC spectrum. The resulting stator current and voltage data will form the baseline data during fault detection. The processor  may store the baseline measurements in a memory  for use during rotor  fault analysis and detection.","Further, referring to , the eMIST unit  receives the current and voltage data from the bank of sensors  and computes the hybrid stator current data for current and voltage according to equations (7) and (8) as shown below. The hybrid stator current and voltage data are computed by replacing the current and voltage component of at least one phase of the multi-phase current and voltage data with a corresponding baseline current and voltage data for that particular phase, where the baseline data is measured during normal\/healthy machine conditions.\n\nhybrid=-old-new-new\u2003\u2003(7)\n\nhybrid=-old-new-new\u2003\u2003(8)\n\nWhere,\n\nIhybrid, is the stator current data acquired during fault detection\n\nIa-old, is the current data of the first phase acquired during baseline measurement\n\nIb-new, is the current data of the second phase acquired during fault detection\n\nIn-new, is the current data of the nth phase acquired during fault detection\n\nVhybrid, is the stator voltage data acquired during fault detection\n\nVa-old, is the voltage data of the first phase acquired during baseline measurement\n\nVb-new, is the voltage data of the second phase acquired during fault detection\n\nVn-new, is the voltage data of the nth phase acquired during fault detection.\n","The eMIST unit  is further configured to perform a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on the hybrid stator current and voltage values, according to equations (9) and (10) in order to decompose the non-fault related components in the current signal (I) into an equivalent DC quantity while rendering the fault related components in the AC spectrum at twice the frequency in the frequency domain.\n\nFFT(hybrid)=2*hybrid\u2003\u2003(9)\n\nFFT(hybrid)=2*hybrid\u2003\u2003(10)\n","The processor  may then compare the magnitudes and phases of the hybrid AC quantities for the voltage and current with the baseline measurements for voltage and current. Based on the comparison, any deviation of the hybrid quantities from the baseline measurements may indicate a fault in at least one of the components in the EMM assembly , such as a drive-train component or a bearing. The results of the comparison may be stored in memory  for further analysis such as the frequency of faults, the time of occurrence of faults, frequency of failure of particular components, etc.","In addition, to improve the detection accuracy it is desired to obtain a set of thresholds for each component under monitoring, including gearbox  and bearing  of the EMM assembly . In order to differentiate between various faults occurring in the various components within the EMM assembly , multiple samples of the current and voltage signals under baseline condition and fault detection condition are collected for each component and corresponding thresholds are set. For example, to differentiate a deteriorated gearbox condition from other faulty components, it is desired to have a warning threshold for the RMS of the noise-cancelled stator current for the gearbox . A possible gearbox fault can be detected by observing uncontrolled variation in the noise-cancelled stator current from the determined warning threshold. To avoid misjudgment due to insufficient data, the processor  starts after receiving enough samples of the noise-cancelled stator current, for example, after receiving over 30-50 samples. The variation may be measured by the percentage of out-of-control samples, e.g., over 10%, outside the control limits, a warning message about the gearbox condition will be sent.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","610","620","630","610","620","640","630","600","630","630","600"],"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":"fbearing:"}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0039"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":["Outer","raceway"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mtext":":"},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}],"msub":{"mi":"f","mn":"0"}},{"mfrac":{"msub":{"mi":["N","b"]},"mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["f","r"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":"-","mrow":{"mfrac":{"msub":[{"mi":["D","b"]},{"mi":["D","c"]}]},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mi":["cos","\u03b2"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}}}}}}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"11"}}]},{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":["Inner","raceway"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mtext":":"},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}],"msub":{"mi":["f","i"]}},{"mfrac":{"msub":{"mi":["N","b"]},"mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["f","r"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":"+","mrow":{"mfrac":{"msub":[{"mi":["D","b"]},{"mi":["D","c"]}]},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mi":["cos","\u03b2"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}}}}}}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"12"}}]},{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"Ball","mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mtext":":"},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}],"msub":{"mi":["f","b"]}},{"mfrac":{"msub":[{"mi":["D","c"]},{"mi":["D","b"]}]},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["f","r"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":"-","mrow":{"mfrac":{"msubsup":[{"mi":["D","b"],"mn":"2"},{"mi":["D","c"],"mn":"2"}]},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"msup":{"mi":"cos","mn":"2"},"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mi":"\u03b2"}}}},"mo":"."}}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"13"}}]}]}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":["Where,","f0 is the vibration frequency of the outer raceway ","fi is the vibration frequency of the inner raceway ","fb is the vibration frequency of the bearing ball ","Nb is the no. of balls ","fr is the mechanical rotor speed in Hz","Db is the ball diameter","Dc is the bearing pitch diameter","\u03b2 is the contact angle of the balls on the races"]}},"Such bearing vibrations also show up in the electrical current spectrum of the generator  due to the air-gap modulation resulting from the vibrations.
