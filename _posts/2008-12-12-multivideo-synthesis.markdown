In the Viterbi algorithm process, a stability property may be considered by limiting the search paths' extension of spatial position.","Generally speaking, the Viterbi algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm that discovers the most likely explanation of a hidden states sequence for an observation. The Viterbi algorithm is an efficient, recursive algorithm that performs an optimal exhaustive search along a time line. In the Viterbi algorithm, the computing of the most likely sequence up to a certain time point t depends only on the observation at point t, and the most likely sequence at point (t\u22121). Thus, the Viterbi method may search every possible path to yield global best results. However, since the number of possible paths increases exponentially as the length increases, the Viterbi method may cause heavy computation and storage loads for long sequential data.","Accordingly, in some embodiments, the detection module  may apply a beam search method, or a particular type of the Vertibi algorithm, that reduces the size of the search space during an optimal insertion path search. In at least one embodiment, the beam search method may define a pruning beam width \u0394 relative to the most probable path likelihood P(t) at frame t. Thus, the beam search method may prune hypotheses that are outside of the pruning beam, i.e., with likelihoods less than P(t)\u2212\u0394, from the search.","Returning to the description of , the modeling module  may be employed by the detection module  to model one or more supplementary videos. In various embodiments, the modeling module  may model a supplementary video  using a discrete left to right Hidden Markov Model (HMM), which is illustrated in . Subsequently, the detection module  may apply a Viterbi algorithm to the HMM model of the supplementary video . In this way, the detection module  may use the Viterbi algorithm to find an optimal insertion path in the main video  for the insertion of the supplementary video .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"],"b":["108","402","108","404","406","408"]},"Additionally, each state may also correspond to three insertion positions with the same spatial coordinates in three continuous main frames, such as frames , , and , of the main video  (). Because of the temporal continuous property of the main video , assigning a plurality of supplementary frames to one state has almost no influence on the fitness of various inserting paths. However, such an assignment may improve the efficiency of the video stability. It will be appreciated that in other embodiments, the number of supplementary frames assigned to each state, as well as the number of main frames that correspond to each state, may vary in the same manner (e.g., two assigned supplementary frames and two corresponding main frames), as long as the fitness of the inserting paths are not adversely affected.","In at least one HMM structure, if a current state is {right arrow over (S)}the next candidate states to be inserted may be represented as {right arrow over (S)}and {right arrow over (S)}. Accordingly, the transition probability may be represented as:\n\n()=1.0;()=0.9\u2003\u2003(4)\n\nThus, some states may be jumped over. In this way, some parts of the supplementary video  that are inserted into the main video  may be accelerated, and better visual effects may be achieved without the loss of information from the supplementary video .\n","Accordingly, to find the insertion positions for the HMM states sequence, the detection module  may extend possible paths along a time line of the main video . Each path X may contain a historic list of the insertion positions {I} and a historic list of states {{right arrow over (S)}}. The probability of the path Xup to state t whose state {right arrow over (S)}may be assigned to a position Iis:\n\n(=())=max(\u2192())()()+()}\u2003\u2003(10)\n\nwhere Xis the path at state (t\u22121) whose likelihood is P(X) and P(X\u2192(I,{right arrow over (S)})) is the transition probability of extending to the next state to (I,{right arrow over (S)}and where Sdenotes the current corresponding frames of the supplementary video .\n","At each possible insertion position, the detection module  may initialize the paths from the beginning state of the supplementary video . Paths that reach the end of the supplementary video  may be saved to the output and deleted from the current path list. Finally, the path with the highest likelihood in the output list may be obtained as the optimal solution.","In order to implement the spatial stability property of the synthesized video , the detection module  may limit the HMM state extension of {I} in a spatial neighboring area of a current position. Lower transition probabilities may be set to farther positions in the neighborhood and vice versa while probability for the same position may be maximized.","In various embodiments, the detection module  may keep only a path list of the current frame in a memory (e.g., data storage module ). For example, for a T\u2032-frame supplementary video, which has Nstates, and a T-frame main video that has L possible insertion positions in each frame, the maximal paths number that the detection module  may need to keep is (N\u00b7L). If the number of extension candidates for a state is limited to E, the size of paths searching space may be at most (N\u00b7L\u00b7E). Thus, computation in accordance with these embodiments is generally efficient and practical for long videos and online video processing.","Returning to the description of , the insertion module  may be employed to insert supplementary frames of a supplementary video, such as the supplementary video , into one or more main frames of the main video . Accordingly, once the optimal insertion positions in the optimal frames are determined by the detection module , the detection module  may activate an insertion module  to integrate the supplementary video  into the main video .","The informativeness measurement module  may be employed by the detection module  to minimize the loss of information from the main video  when one or more supplementary videos  are inserted in the main video . In at least one embodiment, the informativeness is a probability factor for insertion positions Idefined in terms of the saliency measurement P(I) and the smoothness measurement P(I), as shown below:\n\n()=()\u00b7()\u2003\u2003(5)\n\nTo minimize the informational loss of the main video  and the intrusiveness of the supplemental video insertion, highly smooth areas may be provided more insertion while areas containing salient parts may be provided with less insertion.\n","To measure the saliency and smoothness of the insertion area defined by a particular position in a frame, the informativeness measurement module  may first calculate a saliency map for each main frame  () using a visual attention model that combines static and temporal saliency maps. In various embodiments, the static contrast-based saliency map may be configured to investigate the effects of contrast in human perception, while the temporal saliency map may integrate the motion inductors.","The saliency measurement of Imay be calculated over the insertion area centering at a particular position in a frame. Since high saliency of even a small part of this area causes information loss, the informativeness measurement module  may measure this informativeness using the highest J saliency value in the area.","In at least one embodiment, J may be defined as \u215b of the area size according to viewing experience, and {l}may be defined as the highest J saliency values, where Iranges over (0 255), as shown below:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00003","num":"00003"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"msup":{"mi":["P","smo"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"msub":{"mi":["l","i"]}}},{"mn":"1","mo":"-","mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"j","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"J"},"mo":"\u2062","mfrac":{"msub":{"mi":["I","j"]},"mrow":{"mn":"255","mo":"\u00d7","mi":"J"}}}}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"6"}}]}}}},"br":{},"sub":["i ","i","j=1, . . . 8J"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00004","num":"00004"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"msup":{"mi":["P","smo"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"msub":{"mi":["l","i"]}}},{"mi":"exp","mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mo":["{","}"],"mrow":{"mo":"-","mfrac":{"msqrt":{"mrow":{"mi":"var","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"I"}}},"mn":"255"}}}}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"7"}}]}}}},"br":{},"sup":"smo ","sub":"i "},"The consistency measurement module  may be employed by the detection module  to compute the consistency between a main video  and one or more supplemental videos .

The output value of this pixel may be obtained by:\n\n()*()+()=1\u2003\u2003(12)\n\nwhereby eand erepresent the corresponding pixel value in the original main frame and supplementary frame respectively. It will be appreciated that in each blending step, only a main frame and a supplementary frame are processed. Accordingly, frames from different supplementary videos can be inserted one by one by using the previous integrated frame as the main frame. The blend module  may take an iterative process to distribute each pixel's probabilities equally to its four-connected neighboring pixels, so that the neighboring pixels are driven have a similar probability vector. The resulted probabilities may be used as alpha values for alpha matting between the inserted supplementary frame and the extended inserting area of the main frame.\n","In at least one embodiment, the probability that a pixel belongs to the supplementary frame P(S), may be associated according to its information, i.e., saliency value in the supplementary video. In such an embodiment, the probability P(S) is set to 1 if its saliency value Iis above a threshold Th, or",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00007","num":"00007"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mfrac":{"msub":{"mi":["I","e"]},"mi":"Th"}}},"br":{}},"Returning to the description of , the user interface module  may interact with a user via a user interface (not shown). The user interface may include a data output device such as a display, and one or more data input devices. The data input devices may include, but are not limited to, combinations of one or more of keypads, keyboards, mouse devices, touch screens, microphones, speech recognition packages, and any other suitable devices or other electronic\/software selection methods.","The user interface module  may be configured to enable a user to provide input to select one or more supplementary videos  for integration with a main video  to create a synthesized video . Additionally, the user interface module  may be further configured to cause the display to output synthesized videos, such as the synthesized video , to the user.","The data storage module  may be configured to store data in a portion of memory  (e.g., a database). In various embodiments, the data storage module  may be configured to store one or more main videos  and one or more supplementary videos . The data storage module  may also be configured to store the synthesized videos derived from the main videos  and supplementary videos , such as any intermediary products produced by the various modules of the video synthesis engine .","Exemplary Process",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6","FIG. 1"],"b":["600","110"]},"At block , the video synthesis engine  may break a main video, such as a main video , into a plurality of main frames. At block , the video synthesis engine  may also break a supplementary video, such as a supplementary video , into a plurality of supplementary frames.","At block , the video synthesis engine  may assign supplementary frames of the supplementary video  to states in a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). In at least one embodiment, each state in the HMM may be assigned to three continuous supplementary frames. The states in the HMM may be assigned in this manner until all supplementary frames in the supplementary video are paired with a particular state.","In other embodiments, each state in the HMM may be assigned to any number of supplementary frames as long as the number of supplementary frames does not affect the fitness of inserting paths, e.g., a series of insertion position in the main 3-dimensional space (i.e., x, y, and t) of the main video .","Each state of the HMM may also correspond to insertion positions in the main video , where each of the corresponding insertion positions being in a main frame of the video . The corresponding insertion positions may share the same spatial coordinates (i.e., x and y coordinates) in the main frames. In various embodiments, the main frames that include the insertion positions for each state are continuous and the number of insertion positions is equal to the number of supplementary frames assigned to the state. For example, in the embodiment where each state of the HMM is assigned three continuous supplementary frames, each state of the HMM may also correspond to three continuous main frames in the main video , where each main frame includes an insertion position.","At block , the video synthesis engine  may determine the optimal insertion positions in the optimal frames, in the main video  for the insertion of the supplementary frames of the supplementary video . In various embodiments, the video synthesis engine  may apply a Vertibi algorithm (e.g., beam search algorithm) to the HMM states of the supplementary video  and corresponding insertion positions in the main video . In various embodiments, the Viterbi algorithm may be applied by the video synthesis engine  to find an optimal insertion path in the main video  that enable the insertion of the supplementary video  into the main video  to achieve the least intrusive viewing experience. The optimal insertion path in the main video  including optimal insertion positions for the frames of the supplementary video .","Accordingly, the video synthesis engine  may achieve this least intrusive viewing experience by accounting for visual properties that includes informativeness, consistency, visual naturalness, and stability through the application of the Viterbi algorithm. In at least one embodiment, the Vertibi algorithm may be a Vertibi beam search method.","At block , following the determination of the optimal insertion path by the video synthesis engine , the engine  may insert the frames of the supplementary video  into the main video  at the optimal insertion positions, that is, optimal frames. The optimal insertion positions being designated by the optimal insertion path.","At block , the video synthesis engine  may blend the supplementary frames that are inserted into corresponding main frames of the main video . In various embodiments, the blending algorithm may use a probabilistic matting approach. Thus, the video synthesis engine  may produce a synthesis video, such as synthesized video , from the main video  and supplementary video .","At decision block , the video synthesis engine  may determine whether there is an additional supplementary video  to be inserted into the main video . If the video synthesis engine  determines that there is an additional supplementary video  for insertion, (\u201cyes\u201d at decision block ), the process  may loop back to block , where the video synthesis engine  may repeat the integration. However, if the video synthesis engine  determines that there is no additional supplementary video  to be inserted (\u201cno\u201d at decision block ), the process  may terminate at block .","Nevertheless, it will be appreciated that in some embodiments, the integration of multiple supplementary videos  into the main video  may be carried out simultaneously rather than sequentially. In such embodiments, the video synthesis engine  may keep an individual path for each supplementary video  when searching along the time lines. Accordingly, the video synthesis engine  may compute an optimal solution with no overlap between the inserting paths of different supplementary videos and compute the relative highest overall likelihood.","Exemplary Computing Environment",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0077"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 1","FIG. 7"],"b":["700","110","700","700","700"]},"In a very basic configuration, computing device  typically includes at least one processing unit  and system memory .
