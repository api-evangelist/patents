One key aspect of these interactions is the ability to accurately convey an individual's emotions during such online interactions.","Currently such emotions are being conveyed by individuals in a deliberate manner by text or other visual cues. There even exist methods for automatically detecting individual emotions based on a variety of sensory, auditory and visual inputs.","However, the currently known technologies do not provide a solution that addresses a uniform method of conveying an individual's emotions in a connected environment that can be scaled across a number of online social interactions.","Furthermore, there doesn't exist a system or method that could capture, normalize and share an instant reaction of an individual (\u201cEmotional State\u201d) as a result of viewing or consuming content that is shared among a large number of users.","In light of above, a method and a system is presented that can detect instant and time averaged \u201cEmotional Scores\u201d or \u201cEmotional Profiles\u201d of individuals who are viewing or watching content that is shared in a connected environment. Furthermore, the method and the system can be used to create a personalized emotional profile of an individual, using a subset of this personalized emotional profile to represent the individual's behavior during a specific application, and to derive prediction and analytics by combining this with the individual's instantaneous behavior in the given application.","It is a primary object of the invention to provide a system for rating shared media or content in a social group or among a set of shared users.","It is a further object of the invention to provide methods for rating shared media or content in a social group or among a set of shared users.","It is still a further object of the invention to provide a method for detecting instant and time averaged \u201cEmotional Scores\u201d or \u201cEmotional Profiles\u201d of individuals who are viewing or watching a particular content that is shared in a connected environment.","A further and related object of the invention is to provide a system to share the Emotional score within a connected group of users as selected by the individual.","It is still a further object of the invention to provide a system to create a personalized emotional profile of an individual.","A further and related object of the invention is to provide a method for using a subset of the personalized emotional profile to represent the individual's behavior during a specific application, and deriving prediction and analytics by combining this with the individual's instantaneous behavior in the given application.","In view of the foregoing limitations, associated with the use of traditional technology, a method and a system is presented deriving inference from analytics of personalized emotional profiles.","Accordingly, in an aspect of the present invention, a system for generating an emotional profile of the user and deriving inference from the analytics of profile is provided. The system provides a client device having a detector to capture user's input; an interface allowing user to interact with online events or content; a module to collect the emotional footprint of the user to generate an emotional score corresponding to the events or content; a central repository to store the emotional score of associated content or event; and a server configured with a plurality of client devices in the network to communicate the emotional score in the network.","In another aspect of present invention, a method for rating and sharing user's emotional reaction for content and media in a connected environment is provided. The method provides sharing or distributing online content or media pieces over a connected network of client devices; capturing user input in the form of the user's reaction to the content or events and changes in the user's reaction to the content or events; processing the input to generate an emotional score associated with the user as well as the content or media; communicating the emotional score to a database in a network (for example a cloud computing network); providing meta-data to the content or the media piece mapped to this emotional score; and sharing the emotional score related to the content or media within the user's network.","The method comprises of an interface that enables users to interact with each other in a connected on-line infrastructure; capturing data on user behavior during the interaction; creating a baseline profile representing average emotional behavior of the user in reaction to all possible events; capturing an instantaneous reaction of the user in a response to an online event; comparing the instantaneous reaction of a user with the baseline profile; and predicting the deviation of the user's reaction with the normalized reaction of the user.","In the following detailed description of embodiments of the invention, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments of invention. However, it will be obvious to a person skilled in art that the embodiments of invention may be practiced with or without these specific details. In other instances methods, procedures and components known to persons of ordinary skill in the art have not been described in detail so as not to unnecessarily obscure aspects of the embodiments of the invention.","Furthermore, it will be clear that the invention is not limited to these embodiments only. Numerous modifications, changes, variations, substitutions and equivalents will be apparent to those skilled in the art, without parting from the spirit and scope of the invention.","The present invention provides a system and methods used thereof for detecting instant and time averaged \u201cEmotional Scores\u201d or \u201cEmotional Profiles\u201d of individuals who are viewing or watching content or are taking part in an event that is shared in a connected environment (e.g. media content over internet, or shared media repositories, or a web conference). The system consists both of a client sub-system as well as a server sub-system that enable detection of \u201cEmotional Scores\u201d of individual as a reaction of shared content viewing, normalization of score, and an ability to share the emotional score within a connected group of users who are selected by the individual. The Emotional Profile or Score is a combination of the emotion, behavior, response, attention span, gestures, hand and head movement, or other reactions or stimuli of the user collected through the sensors available in the client devices and then processed. In an aspect of the invention the shared Emotional Profiles may be used to create a personalized emotional profile to represent the individual's behavior during a specific application, and deriving prediction and analytics by combining this with the individual's instantaneous behavior in the given application.","The present invention extends the concept of \u201cEmotional Profiles\u201d or \u201cEmotional Scores\u201d for a specific application: rating and sharing emotional reaction or behavior of individuals or groups in response to watching or viewing content or media that has been stored to be viewed in a connected environment. The invention provides a generic system and a method of rating shared media or content in a social group or among a set of shared users. The method may be used in any kind of content sharing environment. The basic premise of the method is to use any and all available sensors to track and detect user or viewer's emotional behavior, emotional state, or emotional change, upon viewing the particular content.","In an embodiment of the present invention, the sensors or detectors include, but are not limited to, facial expression detections, smile detector, voice intonations, tactile sensors, breath analysis, pulse detections, voice analysis, etc. After detecting the emotional state of the user, the emotional state is categorized or given a score, and this information is then shared to the set of allowed individuals as selected by the user. The granularity of detection and scoring would be varied based on categorization of the content, or by the user's privacy choices. Furthermore, the number of segments or scores given to the same content may also change depending on the kind of content, the user preference, or depending on the application. After the generation of \u201cEmotional Score\u201d for a particular content, the score is then shared to everyone, or a select number of allowed individuals, applications, or networks related to the user.","In an embodiment of the present invention the \u201cEmotional Score\u201d has high correlation to the actual Emotional Reaction of the user and is normalized by the individual extremes of emotions displayed by the individual, thereby creating a metric that has meaning for a large number of users.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["1","2","1","102","2","114","116","102","114","116","118","112","118","102","114","116","102","114","116","118","116","116","1","104","106","208","118","102","114","116","118","1","2","1","2","212"]},"In an embodiment of the present invention the client device  comprises of a single module or a plurality of modules to capture the input data from the individual, to process the input data for feature extraction and a decision phase for generating the profile of the user. Some examples of these input modules may be webcams, voice recorders, tactile sensors, haptic sensors, and any other kind of sensory modules.","In another embodiment of the present invention, the client device  includes but is not limited to being a mobile phone, a smartphone, a laptop, a camera with WiFi connectivity, a desktop, tablets (iPAD or iPAD like devices), connected desktops or other sensory devices with connectivity.","In another embodiment of the present invention, the profile corresponds to the emotion, behavior, response, reaction or other stimuli of the user.","In another embodiment of the present invention, the instantaneous emotional profile (EP(n)) detection could be modulated by the Emotional Profile (EP(n)\u2032) in the cloud  as well.","In another embodiment of the present invention, the Emotional Profile EP (n)  is also simultaneously communicated to a central repository in the cloud  that may be residing in a geographically different place and is connected to a plurality of other client devices.","In another embodiment of the present invention, the Emotional Profile of the user is stored in a different format EP(n)\u2032 and is updated continuously as time evolves. EP(n)\u2032 is the Emotional Profile of the individual \u201cN\u201d that is stored in the cloud . This profile EP(n)\u2032 is used as a base profile in the connected network to communicate the Emotional state of the individual.","The client device  stores a different instantaneous version of its own individual emotional profile EP(n)\u2033 . Since each client device may have different hardware and software configuration and capacity, therefore each client may store a different version (or format) of emotional profile.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["210","202","1","204","2","206","3","208","210","210","202","210","210"]},"In an embodiment of the present invention, the \u201cEmotional Scores\u201d are stored in the central database that connects different users; the Emotional scores are then shared to the allowed set of connected individuals in the user's network.

The granularity of \u201cEmotional Scores\u201d (the ratings or the parameters covered) may also vary depending on the use of these \u201cEmotional Scores\u201d based on specific application being targeted, or the choice of the user (Privacy Settings) to expose the extent of his\/her \u201cEmotional State\u201d. A given content may have a set of \u201cEmotional Scores\u201d (for example, a 2 min. video clip may end up having 4 or 5 \u201cEmotional Scores\u201d that are uniformly tagged temporally) if the application so desires.","In an embodiment of the present invention, the application may be used in a media repository rating system. The user gets registered with the hosted service and selects their friends in the network to whom they want to interact with. The users also select the range of their Emotional Profiles that connotes the emotional states that could be allowed for depiction in the user's profile. For example, one Emotional Profile could be: {Happy, Normal, Sad}; another, more granular or detailed Emotional Profile could be: {Happy, Normal, Sad, Angry, Surprised, Disgusted, Fearful} etc.","In another embodiment of the present invention, the emotional categories have an intensity range associated with it. The emotional intensity may be a decimal number between 0-5. For instance, Happy 3.4 denotes a person's emotional state of \u201cHappy\u201d with an intensity of 3.4. The user is then allowed to \u201crate\u201d content from the media repository and as the user rates the content, the content is then tagged with the user's reaction or Emotional Score, or Emotional Profile. In another embodiment of the present invention, this rating happens automatically by the available Emotional Detectors in the user's client device. As more and more user's rate a particular content, different users reactions would be continuously tagged to the content. In this manner the media repository would have an enriched and tagged metadata associated with all content in the library. This tagged data may then be used to derive useful predictions and recommendations for the users of the service.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","402","402","404","406","408","410","414","400","412","402","412"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","502","502","504","506","508","510","512","514","504","506","508","510","512","502","514"]},"In an embodiment of the present invention the recommendations depend on a number of metrics and scores that include, but are not limited to: (i) individual's reactions, or Emotional Scores to a particular category of content, (ii) individual's network or friend's reactions or Emotional Scores to a particular category of content, (iii) an aggregate reaction or Emotional Score of a particular demography among the user's of the service, (iv) reaction or Emotional Score of all user's of the service, (v) the instantaneous or most dominant recent Emotional Profile of the user, or (vi) a combination of some or all of the above analytics.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["602","602","604"]},"In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the analysis of personalized emotional profile may be used to predict self behavior, improve his\/her conversation skills, improve his\/her meeting behavior skills etc. For instance if the user uses the web conferencing services repeatedly over a course of time and the user opts in for the cloud service related to tracking emotional profiles, than during each instantiation (or conversation) the service collects inputs of voice, video, haptic, tactile, or other sensory data from the user and uses this to build or evolve the user's emotional profile (EP). Over the course of time there is a baseline profile (BP) of user generated that represents the nominal or average behavior of the user during the course of using this application. Once the Emotional Profile (EP) and\/or the Baseline Profile (BP) are built, then for every new conversation, the Cloud Service is able to record and tag any deviations from the baseline profile.","At the end of each user web conferencing conversation the service prompts the user to see the places where his\/her EP varied from BP. This would be an indication of places where the user behaved in a manner that was deviated from his\/her nominal behavior (angry, excited, agitated, sad etc.). The user may see the places of deviation from his BP, by opting the cloud service to bring in the EP scores, deviations from the BP, and the corresponding tagged video\/audio segments of specified durations (say, 5-10 seconds videos, where the overall conversation could have been an hour).","In an embodiment of the present invention, the presentation of this information to the user take any of the popular methods that include but are not limited to a pop-up window with visuals, a pop-up window with graphical depiction of the user profile and a method to represent the user Emotional Score (rating), or any other method known to present such analytics in visual, graphical or numerical form.

Step : the time averaged Emotional score and the instantaneous \u201cEmotional Score\u201d associated with viewing a particular content is then communicated to the Server in the Cloud network where it is stored. Step : the generated Emotional Score is stored as a meta data that links it to the user, the content watched and the time stamp of the content being watched. Step : the \u201cEmotional Score\u201d available in the central repository is then shared to the allowed set of connected individuals in the user's network. The \u201cEmotional Score\u201d could also take into account the variations in individual's emotional reaction and would have an option to normalize each score with respect to a time-averaged emotional profile of an individual.","In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the method of present invention may be used to rate the media content in connected media repository such as You Tube video or other online content. When the user watches the You Tube video or other online content or some connected media repository, the client device records the \u201cEmotional Score\u201d of the individual during the time that particular content is being watched. In the most generic implementation the client device uses the available sensors (visual\/facial expressions\/smile\/eye tracking etc.), auditory (voice intonation changes, voice recognition etc.), sensory, tactile etc.) to detect the time averaged or segmented \u201cEmotional Score\u201d associated with watching the particular content. The generated \u201cEmotional Score\u201d is transferred and updated at the server to the user's profile in the hosted service for others to see. The \u201cEmotional Score\u201d has an associated \u2018meta-data\u2019 that has information about the content, the user, the time it was watched, any category of content, if easily available, etc. The \u201cEmotional Score\u201d may then be listed in the user's profile and may be demonstrated in various ways. There could be ways that this information could be available as APIs to other applications and could be linked to other places where the user finds relevant and allows it to be used.","In the simplest\/first implementation, the \u201cEmotional Score\u201d may be manually entered by the user upon watching the content. This \u201cEmotional Score\u201d may be represented as a \u2018meta-data\u2019 that contains the \u201ctiny URL\u201d of the content\/You Tube video, the user identification tag, any associated thumb-nail, the time of viewing, or any other description that may help represent the \u201cEmotional Score\u201d in the user's profile, or that may help tag this \u201cEmotional Score\u201d to the content that was watched. There could also be possible options to add comments besides recording the Emotional Score. The service could later have optional ability to semantically decode these comments based on Natural Language Processing to update the \u201cEmotional Score\u201d.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["802","804","806","808","810","812"]},"In an embodiment of the present invention, the method to measure the deviation of EP score from the BP may be in different forms. These methods include but are not limited to a metric that measure loudness of voice during a conversation as measured by the client device; or a metric that measures the variation of user voice intonations during a conversation as measured by the client device; or a metric that measures the variation of user gestures during a conversation as measured by the client device; or variations of any other sensory input that may be captured and analyzed at the client device.","In another embodiment of the invention the Cloud Service collects all instances of the user's abnormal or deviant behavior and stores in a repository that could be accessed by the user. The Cloud Service may also be used to calculate informative analytics of these deviant behavior and use that to present it to the user, develop and modify the EP or BP of the user, or to derive other useful analytics that may be used by the user, or people in his network, or for other applications of the Cloud Service.","The personalized Emotional profile, Base Profile and the deviant behavior instances, and the related analytics developed in an interacting application may be used in various applications. For instance when a user views the content at a video repository such as Netflix, the cloud service's Netflix plug-in asks user to register users instantaneous profile manually, or by sample recording or a combination of both. The cloud service then compares the user instantaneous or time averaged profile over the period of time to the Emotional score or rating of the content available in video repository as rated by the other's user of the cloud service. The cloud service then recommends the best possible content (movie\/TV show\/game highlights) depending on the instantaneous or time averaged profile of the user.","The personalized Emotional profile, Base Profile and the deviant behavior instances, and the related analytics developed in an interacting application may also be used in various other applications like online gaming, online poker and other similar one-to-one or one-to-many interactive scenarios. In such applications the deviations from Base Profile of the user could be cues to certain actions that the user or other participants in the online game or poker could take advantage of, or could prompt the user or other users of the application to do certain actions in the application."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The invention will hereinafter be described in conjunction with the figures provided herein to further illustrate various non-limiting embodiments of the invention, wherein like designations denote like elements, and in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 8"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
