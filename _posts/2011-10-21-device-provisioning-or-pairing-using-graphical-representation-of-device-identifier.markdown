{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present disclosure relates generally to managing communication between devices, and more specifically to pairing devices or provisioning one or more devices with an account.","Increasingly, users share data between various computing devices or use various computing devices to access an account and\/or data associated with the account. A computing device is provisioned with an account to allow the computing device to access the account. In conventional provisioning methods, a device identifier associated with a computing device is associated with an account to indicate the computing device is permitted to access the account. However, conventional provisioning methods frequently require a user to manually enter device identifiers associated with different computing devices, increasing the likelihood of an error in a device identifier. Manual entry of device identifiers for multiple devices is also time consuming, making it cumbersome for a user to provision multiple computing devices with an account.","Similarly, computing devices may also be paired to exchange data with each other. Typically, paring identifies an accessory device to a main device to facilitate exchange of data between the accessory device and the main device. For example, the main device stores an accessory device identifier to pair the accessory device with the main device. However, conventional device pairing methods frequently require manual entry of the accessory device identifier to the main device. This increases the likelihood of an error in the accessory device identifier and also becomes time consuming when pairing several accessory devices with a main device.","Skilled artisans will appreciate that elements in the Figures are illustrated for simplicity and clarity and have not necessarily been drawn to scale. For example, the dimensions of some of the elements in the Figures may be exaggerated relative to other elements to help to improve understanding of embodiments of the present invention.","The apparatus and method components have been represented where appropriate by conventional symbols in the drawings, showing the specific details that are pertinent to understanding the embodiments of the present invention so as not to obscure the disclosure with details that will be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of the description herein.","The following disclosure describes a system and method for provisioning a local device with an account or for pairing an accessory device with a local device.

The terms \u201ccomprises,\u201d \u201ccomprising,\u201d \u201chas,\u201d \u201chaving,\u201d \u201cincludes,\u201d \u201cincluding,\u201d \u201ccontains,\u201d \u201ccontaining\u201d or any other variation thereof, are intended to cover a non-exclusive inclusion, such that a process, method, article, or apparatus that comprises, has, includes, contains a list of elements does not include only those elements but may include other elements not expressly listed or inherent to such process, method, article, or apparatus. An element proceeded by \u201ccomprises . . . a,\u201d \u201chas . . . a,\u201d \u201cincludes . . . a,\u201d or \u201ccontains . . . a\u201d does not, without more constraints, preclude the existence of additional identical elements in the process, method, article, or apparatus that comprises, has, includes, contains the element. The terms \u201ca\u201d and \u201can\u201d are defined as one or more unless explicitly stated otherwise herein. The terms \u201csubstantially,\u201d \u201cessentially,\u201d \u201capproximately,\u201d \u201cabout\u201d or any other version thereof, are defined as being close to as understood by one of ordinary skill in the art, and in one non-limiting embodiment the term is defined to be within 10%, in another embodiment within 5%, in another embodiment within 1% and in another embodiment within 0.5%. The term \u201ccoupled\u201d as used herein is defined as connected, although not necessarily directly and not necessarily mechanically. A device or structure that is \u201cconfigured\u201d in a certain way is configured in at least that way, but may also be configured in ways that are not listed.","It will be appreciated that some embodiments may be comprised of one or more generic or specialized processors (or \u201cprocessing devices\u201d) such as microprocessors, digital signal processors, customized processors and field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and unique stored program instructions (including both software and firmware) that control the one or more processors to implement, in conjunction with certain non-processor circuits, some, most, or all of the functions of the method and\/or apparatus described herein. Alternatively, some or all functions could be implemented by a state machine that has no stored program instructions, or in one or more application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), in which each function or some combinations of certain of the functions are implemented as custom logic. Of course, a combination of the two approaches could be used.","Moreover, an embodiment may be implemented as a computer-readable storage medium having computer readable code stored thereon for programming a computer (e.g., comprising a processor) to perform a method as described and claimed herein. Examples of such computer-readable storage mediums include, but are not limited to, a hard disk, a CD-ROM, an optical storage device, a magnetic storage device, a ROM (Read Only Memory), a PROM (Programmable Read Only Memory), an EPROM (Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory), an EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory) and a Flash memory. Further, it is expected that one of ordinary skill, notwithstanding possibly significant effort and many design choices motivated by, for example, available time, current technology, and economic considerations, when guided by the concepts and principles disclosed herein will be readily capable of generating such software instructions and programs and ICs with minimal experimentation.","The Abstract of the Disclosure is provided to allow the reader to quickly ascertain the nature of the technical disclosure. It is submitted with the understanding that it will not be used to interpret or limit the scope or meaning of the claims. In addition, in the foregoing Detailed Description, it can be seen that various features are grouped together in various embodiments for the purpose of streamlining the disclosure. This method of disclosure is not to be interpreted as reflecting an intention that the claimed embodiments require more features than are expressly recited in each claim. Rather, as the following claims reflect, inventive subject matter lies in less than all features of a single disclosed embodiment. Thus the following claims are hereby incorporated into the Detailed Description, with each claim standing on its own as a separately claimed subject matter."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The accompanying Figures, where like reference numerals refer to identical or functionally similar elements throughout the separate views, together with the detailed description below, are incorporated in and form part of the specification, and serve to further illustrate embodiments of concepts that include the claimed invention, and explain various principles and advantages of those embodiments.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 2A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 2B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 6"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
