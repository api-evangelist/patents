Accordingly, the Government of the United Sates has certain rights to and in the invention claimed herein.","The present application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/124,297 filed on Mar. 12, 1999; the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.","The present invention features compounds and methods for modulating protein expression and, more particularly, to the use of one or more of such compounds to treat a subject suffering from or susceptible to a condition facilitated by undesired protein expression. Particular compounds of interest include carbocyclic aryl alkenoic acid derivatives. In other aspect, the invention relates to methods for detecting and analyzing such derivatives for therapeutic capacity to treat such conditions.","There is almost universal recognition that proteins help define biological systems particularly by influencing cell shape, structure and function. Proteins are generally made by steps that include transcription, translation, trafficking, and for some proteins, secretion or membrane targeting. The ability of the proteins to exist is impacted by degradative processes. See generally, Alberts, Be. et al. (1989) in (2nd ed.) Garland Publishing, Inc. New York and London; and Stryer, L. (1988) in W.H. Freeman and Co. New York.","Accordingly, nearly all biological systems have evolved several steps (pathways) that collectectively make proteins and then degrade them as needed. The combination of these steps, when focussed on a particular protein or group of proteins, is thought to govern the expression of that protein.","There have been many efforts to modulate protein expression particularly with respect to proteins known or suspected of being involved in mammalian disorders.","For example, one approach has been to identify compounds that can modulate the expression of a particular protein. Following this strategy, a compound can be administered to a primate and especially a human subject to alter at least one synthetic or degradative step to treat a medical condition. This strategy has been used to implement many successful therapies. See generally (8th ed.) Gilman, A. et al. (eds.) McGraw-Hill Professionals Division, pp. 1264-1276, (1993).","For certain medical conditions, there have been reports that compounds with capacity to modulate protein expression can be used to treat the conditions even if those proteins are damaged.","There have been efforts to treat cystic fibrosis (CF) along these lines.","Briefly, there is understanding that mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) protein can lead to life-threatening illness. One CFTR mutation termed \u201c\u0394F508\u201d is a common CFTR mutation. When functioning normally, CFTR is thought to be a necessary cAMP-activated chloride channel. In CF, this channel is thought to be misprocessed and retained in the endoplasmic reticulum of epithelial cells. See e.g., Lukacs et al., 109:282-284 (1995); Li et al., 3:311-316 (1993); and Cheng et al., 268:L615-L624 (1995).","There have been reports that growth of certain cells carrying the CF defect can grow better at reduced temperature or with compounds that alleviate trafficking defects in vitro. See e.g., Egan et al., 271:635-638 (1996); Brown et al., 99:1432-1444 (1997) and Sato et al., 271:635-638 (1996).","More generally, steps associated with protein trafficking and especially protein degradation have been disclosed. Some of these steps appear to implement various heat shock protein and\/or ubiquitin-associated pathways. See e.g., Gething et al., 355:33-45 (1992) and Chiang et al., 246:382-385 (1989)","It has been reported that 4-phenylbutyric acid (sometimes referred to as 4-PBA or Buphenyl), can be used to treat various medical conditions including CF. This compound has been approved for the treatment of certain urea cycle disorders. There has been some discussion that this compound may also find use in the treatment of certain hemoglobinopathies, including sickle cell disease, thalassemias; as well as cancer.","With respect to CF, there have been reports that 4-BPA can restore CFTR-mediated chloride transport. Clinical trials using this compound have provided encouraging results. See Rubenstein, R. C. et al. (1997) 100: 2457-2465; Rubenstein, R. C. (1998) 157: 484-490.","Other strategies have been implemented to modulate protein expression. One approach has been to identify compounds that alter the transcription of nucleic acids encoding a protein of interest.","For example, it has been disclosed that 4-PBA can enhance fetal hemoglobin levels by transcriptional \u201cup\u201d regulation. The effective has been reported to involve histone deacetylase. See e.g., Stamatoyannopoulos et al., 84:3198-3204 (1994); Lea et al., 15:879-883 (1995).","Accordingly, it would be desirable to have additional compounds and methods for modulating protein expression. It would be especially desirable to have carbocyclic aryl alkenoic acid derivatives and methods for using same that can be used to treat or prevent conditions or diseases impacted by undesired protein expression.","We have now discovered compounds and therapies to treat or prevent various conditions or diseases modulated by undesired protein expression. More particularly, we have identified therapies that can increase or decrease the expression of particularly proteins, as needed, to treat or prevent such conditions or diseases.","In one aspect, the invention provides important carbocyclic aryl alkenoic acid derivatives that are sometimes referred to herein as \u201cgene\u201d or \u201cprotein\u201d drugs. This designation is meant to emphasize that the derivatives represent a new class of compounds that can modulate protein expression at one or more levels. More particular compounds of the invention desirably modulate at least one of transcription, translation, or trafficking of a subject protein or group of such proteins. By the word \u201ctrafficking\u201d is meant at least one cell pathway that has been reported to help manipulate protein (or proteins), generally in folded form, to achieve a biological objective. Examples include post-translational modification, protein degradation, secretion, and\/or membrane targeting.","Examples of disorders treatable or preventable by the present compounds include those impacted or suspected of being impacted by incorrect (aberrant) protein folding. Such inappropriate folding (misfolding) can encompass all or part of the subject protein. More specific examples of such disorders include those afflicting or thought to inflect one or more of the nervous, hepatic, or respiratory systems.","Additional examples of such disorders include, but are not limited to, lung diseases e.g., those associated with misfolding of surfactant proteins; lung diseases impacted by improper expression of transmembrane proteins including the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR); liver diseases associated with improper protein trafficking; and brain diseases such as those associated with tangle bodies, e.g., neurofibrillary tangles. More specific brain disorders of interest include those manifested by genetic, infectious (e.g., a viral, bacterial or prion agent) or environmental factors. Other illustrations of such disorders or conditions are provided below.","Therapies of the invention are particularly effective for the treatment and\/or prevention of undesired protein expression including those embodiments in which modulated protein expression is desired. By the term \u201cmodulate\u201d or related phrase as it is used to reference protein expression is meant an increase or decrease in that expression relative to control (or baseline) expression. Preferred therapies treat, prevent, delay the onset of, or reduce the severity of a targeted mammalian disease or condition.","Particular compounds of the present invention are derivatives of carbocyclic aryl alkenoic acid. Such compounds provide a number of important advantages with respect to prior drugs, particularly derivatives of carbocyclic aryl butyric acid and especially phenyl derivatives of butyric acid, specifically 4-PBA.","For example, we have discovered that certain carbocyclic aryl alkenoic acid derivatives are much more effective especially at low doses (i.e. less than about 10 \u03bcM). This advantage can positively impact patient care by providing for lower dose administration while still providing good therapeutic effect. Practice of the invention can thus help to improve patient tolerance while minimizing overall treatment costs. In contrast, the higher dosages often associated with prior drugs may increase chances for patient intolerance and side effects. Importantly, costs associated with the higher dosages may be prohibitive in settings where repeated or prolonged administration is indicated.","In particularly, recognized therapies using 4-PBA often require daily administration of many large tablets, sometimes as much as about 20 to 80 tablets. Such therapies have contributed to substantial patient discomfort and side effects e.g., nausea, muscle cramps and confusion. In contrast, preferred practice of this invention can provide for lower daily dosages, thereby helping to reduce patient discomfort and side effects while still giving good therapeutic effect.","Moreover, we believe that many of the carbocyclic aryl alkenoic acid derivatives of this invention will exhibit greater stability than prior drugs in vitro and in vivo. Without wishing to be bound to any theory, it is believed that the unsaturation of the present derivatives i.e., a double bond in the carbon backbone, can significantly reduce potential for biological transformation into inactive or less active metabolites. In contrast, the prior drugs do not usually have this unsaturation, thereby increasing changes for undesired metabolic conversion of those drugs especially in vivo. This benefit of the invention is very significant as it can improve bioavailability and especially provide for enhanced serum levels of the present derivatives. Importantly, this feature can help reduce the need for repetitive or prolonged administration of the present compounds in many therapeutic settings.","Further, it believed that the unsaturation associated with the present compounds can often assist solubility especially with those aqueous or semi-aqueous solvents typical of many pharmaceutical formulations. In contrast, many of the prior drugs do not have this unsaturation which may, with some solvents, help make those drugs more difficult to use or administer properly.","The therapeutic methods of the invention generally include administering to a subject, particularly a mammal such as a primate and especially a human, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound that can modulate protein expression. More particular compounds that suitably increase or decrease at least one of transcription or trafficking of the subject protein or group of proteins including degradation thereof with respect to control or baseline expression of that protein.","Preferably, an administered compound modulates the expression of a subject protein by at least about 10%, preferably at least about 25%, in at least one of the standard in vitro assays disclosed herein. Exemplary assays detect and preferably measure the protein or nucleic acid encoding same with respect to a suitable control.","In embodiments in which particular carbocyclic aryl alkenoic acid derivatives of this invention are selected for capacity to modulate protein trafficking and especially to inhibit protein degradation, it is preferred that the administered compound exhibit an ICof at least about 0.001 to about 10 mM in a standard in vitro assay for measuring heat shock protein 70 (hsc70).","For example, in a preferred embodiment of such an hsc70 assay, more preferred compounds features an ICof about 50 \u03bcM or less, still more preferably an ICof about 1 to about 10 \u03bcM or less in the standard in vitro hsp70 assay. Such compounds that inhibit hsc70 protein expression, as determined by the assay, will sometimes be referred to herein as \u201ctrafficking inhibitor compounds\u201d or other similar term.","In one embodiment of the foregoing hsp70 assay, the carbocyclic aryl alkenoic acid derivatives can be selected for capacity to boost CFTR protein expression. In this example, preferred compounds increase CFTR expression by at least about 10%, preferably at least about 25%, when compared to control or baseline expression of that protein. Preferably, the compounds will increase CFTR expression by about 50%, and more preferably about 70% to about 100% or more as determined by the assay. In this embodiment, which is sometimes preferred to as a standard in vitro CFTR assay, the assay detects and preferably quantifies presence of degradative complexes that usually include the hsc70 protein. Without wishing to be bound to theory, selected compounds generally assist trafficking by helping CFTR avoid the complexes, thereby reducing or even eliminating significant CFTR degradation. Thus, CFTR expression is assisted in this assay by the trafficking inhibitor compounds. As will be explained in more detail below, such compounds are particularly useful for treating a variety of disorders and conditions including, but not limited to, lung disorders such as CF.","In other invention embodiments in which the carbocyclic aryl alkenoic acid derivatives are selected for capacity to boost protein expression, particularly by increasing transcription of a subject protein (or group thereof), it is generally preferred that the administered compound exhibit at least about a 10%, preferably at least about a 25% increase in transcription when compared to a suitable control or baseline experiment. Preferably, the increase in transcription provided by the compounds will be between from about 20% to about 50%, more preferably between from about 60% to 70% as measured in a standard in vitro assay for transcription. An example includes a conventional nuclease protection assay. Such compounds are sometimes referred to herein as \u201ctranscription enhancing\u201d compounds or like term. In many instances, expression of the subject protein(s) will be increased by such transcription enhancing compounds.","Compounds useful in the invention include carbocyclic aryl compounds substituted with a carboxy acid (\u2014COOH); protected carboxy acid such as an ester, particularly an alkyl ester such as e.g. \u2014COOR where R is alkyl, preferably Calkyl; sulfonic acid (\u2014SOH); nitro; cyano; haloalkyl particularly perhaloalkyl such as trifluoromethyl and pentafluoroethyl, where such a polar functional group is spaced from the carbocyclic aryl ring, e.g. by a linker group containing 1 to about 16 carbons, more typically 1 to about 8 or 12 carbons, still more typically a linker of about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 carbons. The polar functional group (i.e. carboxy acid, ester, sulfonic acid, nitro, cyano, haloalkyl) is preferably on the terminal carbon of the linker. The linker may contain one or more unsaturated carbons, preferably a carbon-carbon double bond, although alkynylene linkages also may be present. If a carboxy group is present, the linker group preferably contains a carbon-carbon multiple bond, particularly an alkenylene linkage. The linker also may contain a hetero atom (N, O or S) in the linker chain. Typical carbocyclic aryl groups substituted with a polar functional group include e.g. phenyl, naphthyl, acenaphtyl, anthracenyl, and the like, with phenyl being preferred. The carbocyclic aryl group also may have ring substituents such as halo (particularly F, Cl, and Br); alkyl particularly Calkyl), cyano, nitro.","More preferred compounds of this invention are provided in the discussion and Examples that follow.","Suitable compounds of this invention can be readily identified or confirmed by simple testing, e.g., by in vitro testing of a candidate compound relative to a control for the ability to modulate protein expression, e.g. by at least 10% relative to the control. In some invention embodiments, it may be useful to include, as a separate working control, an assay that includes 4-phenyl butyric acid (4-PBA) as the control. In this embodiment, preferred compounds of the invention will show better activity than 4-PBA especially at low dosages. That is, such compounds will show at least about a 10 fold increase in activity with respect to the same amount of 4-PBA in the assay, preferably about a 50 to 100 fold increase and more preferably about a 100 to about a 1000 fold increase in activity.","The invention further relates to methods of detecting and analyzing compounds that modulate protein expression and exhibit therapeutic capacity to treat or prevent the above-described conditions. Preferred detection and analysis methods include both in vitro and in vivo assays to determine the therapeutic capacity of agents to modulate the expression of one or a group of subject proteins.","Preferred in vitro detection assays according to the present invention detect and usually quantify modulated protein expression by analyzing specific steps or pathways known or through to impact expression.","For example, in one embodiment, such an assay will include the following steps 1) through 4):\n\n","In the foregoing general assay, particular steps of interest include transcription, translation, and protein trafficking including, but not limited to, steps or pathways associated with particular molecular complexes such as those impacting protein degradation. A preferred candidate compound is a carbocyclic aryl alkenoic acid derivative. As discussed, the method can be adapted to detect and preferably quantify hsc70 expression, CFTR expression, or both. In this examples of the invention, the hsc70 and\/or the CFTR can be provided to the cells as a heterologous or homologous proteins as needed. In embodiments in which heterologous expression is desired, the protein may be suitably provided by standard recombinant strategies involving expression or co-expression of vectors that encode the protein.","The foregoing general assay can effectively measure the capacity of a desired compound to modulate protein expression by detecting and preferably quantifying increases or decreases in transcription or protein trafficking. References herein to a \u201cstandard in vitro assay\u201d or other similar phase refers to the above protocol of steps 1) through 4).","In particular, when step 3) of the standard in vitro assay is implemented to measure hsc70 protein expression, the assay will be more specifically referred to as the standard in vitro hsc70 assay. When the assay is adapted to measure CFTR expression, the assay will be referred as an in vitro CFTR assay. In the latter assay, the CFTR expression is suitably measured according to standard methods such as those discussed below. Preferred assays of this type involve immunological detection strategies such as immunoprecipitation or related approaches.","Alternatively, in embodiments when step 3) of the standard in vitro assay measures transcription of a subject protein (or group or proteins), the assay will often be referenced as a standard in vitro assay for measuring transcription of nucleic acid encoding the protein or similar term. As described below and in the Examples following, a preferred in vitro transcription assay is a nuclease protection assay.","As will be apparent, the in vitro assays of the present invention can be conducted with nearly any population of cells that can express at least one heat shock protein and particularly hsc70 including a lysate of such cells or tissue, or a substantially purified fraction of the lysate. Suitably expressing cells that may be employed in the assay include, but are not limited to, primary cells such as nasal epithelia, and certain immortalized cells having demonstrated capacity to express, as a heterologous to homologous protein, mammalian and especially human proteins e.g., hsc70 and CFTR. Preferred examples of such cells are provided below.","The in vitro detection assays of the invention can be adapted in accordance with intended use. For example, as noted above, it has been found that protein expression is substantially impacted by transcription and trafficking of the subject protein(s). As discussed, the standard in vitro assay generally outlined above can be modified, e.g., at step 3) above to include measurements of desired steps such as transcription or protein trafficking including measurement of hsp70 expression as degradative complexes. The known or candidate compound can be employed in the assays as a sole active agent or in combination with other agents including other recognized modulators of protein expression, e.g., transcriptional inhibitors, protein trafficking inhibitors and the like. Examples of such agents include, but are not limited to, 4-PBA and hydroxyurea.","In most instances, the in vitro assays are performed with a suitable control assay usually including or consisting of the same test conditions as in the steps above, but without adding the compound or compounds to be tested. In such cases, a candidate compound can be identified as exhibiting desired activity by exhibiting at least about 10% change in the specified activity relative to the control; more preferably at least about 20% change relative to the control assay; and still more preferably at least about a 30% to about a 100%, change relative to the control. By the word \u201cchange\u201d is meant an increase or decrease relative to that control.","The invention is compatible with recognized in vivo assays to determine the therapeutic capacity of a known or candidate compound to modulate protein expression and particularly to treat a disease or conditions impacted by such expression. The monitored disease or condition suitably may be pre-exist in the test animal, or the cell function may be induced, e.g., genetically, chemically, or by surgical intervention. Animal functions that can be suitably assayed in these methods include, but are not limited to, transcription, translation, post-translational modification, trafficking including the degradation of subject proteins, cell proliferation including metastases, cell division, apoptosis, respiratory function, cognition, membrane potential, intracellular or extracellular ion concentration, intracellular kinase activity, phosphatase activity, intracellular protein transport, endogenous or heterologous gene expression, chloride channel function and protein secretion.","Suitable in vivo assays can be modified in a number of ways as needed. For example, in certain embodiments of the present invention, a specific carbocyclic aryl alkenoic acid derivative is administered to the animal either as a sole active agent or in combination with other active compounds (e.g., 4-PGA), including other compounds of this invention to be tested. In most embodiments, activity of the compound in a given in vivo assay is compared to a suitable control (e.g., a control animal not receiving the compound). Typically, the control assay is conducted the same as the test assay but without administering the compound to the test subject. A variety of test subjects can be employed, particularly mammals such as rabbits, primates, various rodents and the like including mice. Preferred test subjects are recognized models for a particular human disease or disorder.","If desired, the in vitro efficacy of a particularly carbocyclic aryl alkenoic acid derivative can be tested in recognized human CF model i.e., nasal potential differences between normal and CF patients. Generally, the derivative is administered to the human subject in a therapeutically effective amount for several days. Nasal tissue is removed and chloride transport detected and preferably measured in control (normal patient) and CF patients. Additionally preferred compounds of this invention will help restore normal CFTR function in the nasal epithelial cell surface to level that is comparable to that achieved with 4-PBA. A preferred assay of this type is provided below in Example 13.","As noted above, the detection assays (either in vitro or in vivo) can be conducted in a wide variety of cells. If desired, the assays can also be conducted with tissues and organs that include such cells. Further, the assays can detect useful compounds by measuring the activity of target molecules such as nucleic acids and proteins in pathways that modulate protein expression. Thus, the present assays are readily adapted to measure activity in a variety of cell, tissue and organ settings.","Significantly, use of multiple detection assays (e.g., a combination of the in vitro and\/or in vivo assays) with a single compound such as a particular carbocyclic aryl alkenoic acid derivative as provided herein can extend the selectivity and sensitivity of detection as desired.","Such broad spectrum testing provides advantages. Thus, for example, in vitro assays of the invention can efficiently perform multiple analysis, thereby enhancing efficiency and probability of identifying compounds with therapeutic capacity. This is especially useful when large numbers of compounds need to be tested. For instance, libraries of candidate compounds and particularly libraries or carbocyclic aryl alkenoic acid derivatives can be made by standard synthetic methods including combinatorial-type chemistry manipulations and then tested in accord with the invention.","Additionally provided by the invention are useful kits for performing the methods of those invention. Preferred kits include at least one container means that includes at least one of the carbocyclic aryl compounds disclosed herein.","Other aspects of the invention are discussed below.","As discussed above, the present invention features therapeutic methods for treatment and prevention of conditions modulated by unacceptable protein expression. the treatment methods of the invention generally include administering a therapeutically effective amount of at least one carbocyclic aryl alkenoic acid derivative to a subject, preferably a mammal such as a primate and often a human patient in need of such treatment.","The therapeutic methods of the invention generally comprise administration of a therapeutically effective amount of at least one and preferably one compound to the subject. Treatment methods of the invention also comprise administration of an effective amount of a compound of Formula I as defined herein to the subject, particularly a mammal such as a human in need of such treatment for an indication disclosed herein.","Typical mammalian subjects are human patients suffering from, recovering from, or susceptible to those conditions discussed above, e.g., lung diseases afflicting normal alveolar function and including those associated with misfolding of surfactant protein protein C; lung diseases impact by improper expression of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) including CF; liver diseases including \u03b11 anti-trypsin disease; and brain diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and related dementia.","Other specific diseases of interest include Marfan syndrome, familial hypercholesterolemia and Tay-Sachs disease; as well as related disorders.

(2000) in 1: 1 for a information relating to current CF therapeutic approaches.","A variety of compounds in accord with this invention can be employed in the present treatment methods.

Also see Harlow, et al. for examples of strategies for detectably labeling the antibodies. Suitable antibodies can be polyclonal or monoclonal as needed.","A more specific hsc70 immunoprecipitation assay is provided in the discussion and Examples following. Typically, the amount of hsc70 protein detected in the presence of the compound is compared to a suitable control, which control is treated under the same conditions as the assay culture but does not include the compound that is tested.","Particular reference herein to a \u201cstandard hsc70 protein\u201d assay or related phrase refers to the steps a) through e) above. Such as assay can be readily modified, if desired, to include monitoring of other proteins such as other heat shock proteins, CFTR and\/or control proteins such as those mentioned below.

In this example, the assay is suitably adapted so that CFTR is detected in the lysates. In one approach, step e) is modified so that presence of the CFTR in the immune complexes is detected and preferably quantified. In one embodiment, the lysate is contacted with a first antibody capable of binding CFTR. Binding of the first antibody can be readily detected by binding of a second detachably labeled antibody according to conventional immunological methods. This embodiment of the hsc70 assay will be referred to herein as a \u201cstandard in vitro CFTR assay\u201d or related term to denote supplemental or exclusive detection of the CFTR.","More specific guidance relating to performing the standard in vitro CFTR assay can be found in the discussion and Examples following. See also Rubenstein, R. C. and P. L. Zeitlan (2000) 278: C259-C267.","As will become more apparent from the following examples, a decrease in the amount of CFTR detected in the standard in vitro CFTR assay is taken to be indicative of an increase in the level of functional or potentially functional CFTR. That is, less CFTR in the immune complex and especially those complexes that include or consist of hsc70 is taken to be indicative of less transmembrane protein available for degradation. Accordingly, CFTR expression levels increase in the assay in line with a decrease in the amount of degradative complexes. See also Rubenstein, R. C., (2000), supra and the Examples below.","Additionally preferred carbocyclic aryl alkenoic acid derivatives are capable of inhibiting specific enzymes such as histone deacetylase. Additionally preferred derivatives serve as good amino acid acylating agents. Methods for detecting inhibition of histone deacytlase are known in the field. See e.g., Candido, E. P. et al. (1978) 14: 105-113; and Lea, M A and N. Tulsyan (1995) 15: 879-883. Methods for detecting amino acid acylation are also known and include use of conventional chromatographic approaches, e.g., HPLC.","See also the U.S. Pat. No. 5,976,499 (U.S. Ser. No. 09\/148,122) for additional methods for screening compounds capable of treating CF; the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.","As noted above, the present invention includes methods of detecting and analyzing compounds such as carbocyclic aryl alkenoic acid derivatives with therapeutic capacity to treat or prevent any of the above-mentioned diseases or disorders. A disease or condition is impacted or modulated by protein expression if afflicted cells, tissue and\/or organs exhibit an increase or decrease in subject protein (or proteins) of at least about 2 fold, preferably about 2 to 1000-fold, more preferably about 2- to 100-fold, and more typically about 2- to 10-fold relative to a suitable control. That control is typically the same cells, tissues and\/or organs taken from a normal or unafflicted subject. The change in protein expression can be measured by methods referenced herein including those in vitro and in vivo assays in which subject proteins are measured. Without being bound by theory, it appears that preferred carbocyclic aryl alkenoic acid derivatives modulate protein expression particularly by increasing transcription and\/or reducing unwanted protein degradation. Accordingly, the compositions and methods of this invention are particularly useful in the treatment of conditions or disorders modulated by such protein expression.","Preferred cells for use in the methods of this invention include those expressing heat shock proteins and particularly hsc70. As mentioned previously, suitable cells can be an immortalized cell line or primary culture of cells (e.g., obtained form a tissue or organ such as the nose). More preferred cells manifest a change in protein expression following contact with a suitable molecule such as 4-PBA, i.e., at least about a 10% increase or decrease relative to a suitable control. More suitable cells include those amenable to standard recombinant DNA techniques such as transformation (e.g., mediated by calcium, biolistic transfer, electroporation and the like) by a vector that encodes the subject protein. Examples include CFTR and especially human CFTR. The human CFTR sequence has been disclosed. For example, see the Genbank website referenced above.","If needed, one or a combination of strategies can identify such cells. For example, in one approach, about 1\u00d710cells are seeded in petri dishes in suitable growth medium. For primary cultures of cells, a desired tissue or organ is obtained from an animal and dispersed according to standard methods (e.g., by sonication, mechanical agitation, and\/or exposure to dispersing agents known in the field, e.g., detergents and proteases). After one or a few days, the growth medium is removed from the petri dish and the cells washed with phosphate-buffered saline. The cells are then contacted with about 0.01 mM to about 5 mM 4-PBA or 4-phenyl-\u03943 -butenoic acid in the culture. After exposing the cells to the 4-BPA for about a few hours up to about 24 hours, the medium is removed and the cells lysed in an appropriate lysis buffer such as those described herein. The cells are then assayed according to any of the method described herein for response to the added 4-PBA or 4-phenyl-\u03943-butenoic acid. Examples of such cells include immortalized cystic fibrosis bronchiolar epthelial cells such as those referenced below, e.g., IB3-1 cells. Other examples of such primary cells include nasal epithelia.","A control experiment is generally tailored for use in a particular assay. For example, most control experiments involve subjecting a test sample (e.g., a population of suitable cells or lysate thereof) to medium, saline, buffer or water instead of a compound to be tested in parallel to the cells receiving an amount of test compound. A desired assay is then conducted in accordance with the present methods. Specific examples of suitable control experiments are described below.","Specific techniques for use with the methods described herein may involve one or more standard laboratory manipulations such as chemiluminescence tests, thin layer chromatography (TLC) separations, nucleic acid isolation and purification, SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis, autoradiography, scintillation counting, densitometery, Northern and Western Blot hybridization, and immunoassays (e.g., RIA and ELISA tests). See generally Sambrook et al. (1989), supra; and Ausubel et al. (1989), supra. Alternatively, or in addition, recognized gas or high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) may also be used as needed.","As discussed, preferred compounds of this invention are derivatives of carbocyclic aryl alkenoic acid. Exemplary of such derivatives are phenylcarbocyclic aryl alkenoic acid derivatives including 4-phenyl-\u03943-transbutenoic acid. That acid can, under certain conditions, be \u03b2 oxidized to phenylacetic acid which serves as an amino acid acylating agent.","One aspect of this invention is the discovery that phenylcarbocyclic aryl alkenoic acid, and particularly 4-Phenyl-\u03943-transbutenoic acid compound can be used to modulate protein expression. For example, the particular compound has been shown to restore normal biosynthetic trafficking to the CFTR mutation \u0394F508. Without wishing to be bound to theory, it is believed that the mechanism centers on butyrate-mediated down-regulation of the chaperone protein Hsc70.","It has been found that 4-Phenyl-\u03943 -transbutenoic acid and 4-PBA both have a second potent ability to regulate gene and\/or protein expression in a number of physiologic processes. For example, it has been reported that 4-PBA administration increases fetal hemoglobin levels, perhaps by transcriptional up-regulation. See Dover et al. supra and Stamatoyannopoulos et al., 84:3198-3204 (1994). Fetal hemoglobin levels and percent F cells increase, and it is thought that transcriptional upregulation of \u03b4globin may be explained by the observation that butyrate promotes regulation of gene expression via inhibition of histone deacetylase. Inhibition of histone deacetylation by the butyrates is reported to be associated with tumor cell differentiation and is the rationale for the use of phenylbutyrate as a adjunct chemotherapeutic agent.","As discussed previously, the butyrate class of chemical agents including many of the compounds of this invention may be thought of as a new kind of \u201cgene drug\u201d that acts by transcriptional regulation. Transcriptional regulators can be harnesses to up or down-regulate redundant gene pathways that normally are relatively quiescent.","More particularly, a new class of chemical compound is disclosed herein which in particular embodiments can treat the \u0394F508 trafficking defect through a pharmacologic strategy. One goal is the restoration of normal chloride conductance using a transcriptional regulator to correct the biosynthetic trafficking defect associated with \u0394F508 expression and enhance the mutant protein chloride transport.","A preferred compound of this invention, 4-Phenyl-\u03943-transbutenoic acid (or trans styrylacetic acid), may be employed as a sole or adjunctive therapeutic agent for the treatment or prevention of the inherited urea cycle disorders as well as other maladies, e.g., inherited hemoglobinopathies, thalassemias and cancer. Buphenyl has been approved for use in some of these conditions. See Dover et al., 84:339-343 (1994); Dover et al., 327:569-570 (1992); Collins et al., 85:43-49 (1995); K. Smigel, 84: 1398-1398 (1992); and Wood et al., 35: A2404 (1994). Ninety percent of administered 4-PBA is excreted as PAG in the urine. There is little toxicity beyond a slightly bitter taste, mild stomach discomfort or mild peripheral edema if severely anemic.","There have been substantial efforts to analyze protein degradation pathways. for example, the 70 kD heat shock protein family consists of Hsp70 (sometimes called Hsp72) which is inducible by heat shock and\/or the presence of denatured intracellular proteins and Hsc70 (sometimes called Hsp73), the 70 kD heat shock cognate protein which is constitutively expressed and is involved in the uncoating of clathrin-coated endosomes. Hsc70 also has a role in the lysosomal degradation of intracellular proteins, and was recently shown to be required for the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of a number of cellular proteins. (Gething et al., 355:33-45 (1992) and Chiang et al., 246:382-385 (1989) Since the rapid intracellular degradation of \u0394F508 can be disrupted by the addition of ATP. (Strickland et al., 272:25421-25424 (1997), which is known to regulate the association of proteins with Hsc70, we asked whether Hsc70 was affected by the butrates.","4-PBA has been reported to promote functional correction of cAMP-medicated chloride transport in CF airway epithelial cells (Rubenstein et al., 100:2457-2465 (1997) and to increase chloride transport in nasal potential difference measurements of homozygous \u0394F508 patients taking the drug for 1 week. (Rubenstein et al., 157:484-490 (1998). Without wishing to be bound to theory, it is believed that two potential mechanisms of action are at play. The first involves the endoplasmic reticulum quality control pathway for removal of misfolded or mutant proteins. This model is exemplified by the following Examples 1-3.","The following General Comments and Examples 1-3 refer to use of 4-PBA. See also Rubenstein, R. C. and R. L. Zeitlan, (2000), supra; the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Each of the methods described in Examples 1-3 can be modified to accomadate one or more carbocyclic aryl alkenoic acid derivatives including stereoisomers of phenylcarbocyclic aryl alkenoic acid derivatives and specifically cis and trans isomers of 4-phenyl-3\u0394-butenoic acid.","Use of 4-phenyl-3\u0394-transbutenoic acid is shown below in Examples 4-13.","General Comments","The following materials and methods (numbered 1-7) were used as needed in the following Examples.","1.

Standard growth medium was LHC-8 (Biofluids, Rockville, Md.) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, Mo., or Biofluids). 100 U\/ml penicillin-streptomycin (GIBCO BRL, Gaithersburg, Md.), 0.2 mg\/ml Primaxim (Imipenim, Merck, West Point, Pa.), 80 \u03bcg\/ml tobramycin (Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, Ind.), and 2.5 \u03bcg\/ml Fungizone (Biofluids). Cells for control experiments were cultured under these routine conditions. Growth medium for the treated cells was composed of the indicated agent at indicated concentration added to the routine growth medium and incubated at 37\u00b0 C. in a 5% CO2 incubator. We previously determined that 4-PBA maintains a constant concentration under these culture conditions for at least 2 days (30).","2. Antibodies. Rabbit anti-CFTR antiserum 181 (directed against CFTR amino acids 415-427 prior to the first nucleotide binding fold) was described previously (25). A rabbit polyclonal antiserum specific for Hsc70 (5) was a generous gifts of Drs. C. R. Brown and W. J. Welch (University of California at Sand Francisco). A rat monoclonal antibody specific for Hsc70, clone 1B5, was a generous gift of Dr. A. Laszlo (Washington University, St. Louis, Mo.). This antibody is also commercially available (Stressgen Biotechnologies, Victoria, BC, Canada). A mouse monoclonal antibody directed against Hsp90 (clone AC88) and a rabbit polyclonal antisera specific for Hsp40 and Hsp70 were purchased from Stressgen Biotechnologies. A mouse monoclonal antibody directed against calnexin (clone AF8) (18) was a generous gift of Dr. Michael Brenner (Harvard University). A mouse monoclonal antibody to Hdj2 (clone KA2A5.6) was from NeoMarkers (Union City, Calif.). Donkey anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate and sheep anti-mouse IGG-horseradish peroxi-dase conjugates were purchased from Amersham (Arlington Heights, Ill.). Goat anti-rat IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate was purchased from Boehringer-Mannheim (Indianapolis, Ind.) or Amersham.","3. Immunoblot analysis. Whole cell lysates were prepared by solubilization with 2% SDS at 95\u00b0 C. Protein concentration in the lysates was determined using the Bio-Rad DC assay reagents with bovine plasma g-globulin as a standard (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, Calif.). Equal amounts of protein was resolved on 5, 7, 8, or 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunodetection was performed as previously described (25). Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubation of the nitrocellulose with 2% gelatin or 10% nonfat day milk. Primary antisera and secondary antibodies were applied in buffer containing 0.4% BSA overnight at 4\u00b0 C. and for 1 h at room temperature, respectively. Detection of immunoreactivity was performed with the enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (ECL, Amer-sham) and fluorography. Recombinant bovine Hsc70 (0.95% purity) was purchased from Stressgen Biotechnologies for use in constructing a standard curve of Hsc70 immunoreactivity. Immunoblots containing the bovine Hsc70 were probed with the Hsc70-specific polyclonal antiserum.","4. RNase protection. An Hsc70-specific probe for RNase protec-tion was constructed by isolation a 500-bp EcoR I fragment from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) plasmid 77659 (ATCC, Manassas, Va.) and ligating this fragment into the EcoR I site of pSK(2) (Bluescript, Stratagene, La Jolla, Calif.). The resulting plasmid was sequenced in the Genetics Core Facility at the Johns Hopkins Hospital and found to be identical to sequences in exons 8 and 9 of the human Hsc70 sequence, with sequencing using the T3 primer and T7 primer leading to sense and antisense sequence, respectively. Hybridization probes were synthesized using a Maxiscript T7 kit (Ambion, Austin, Tex.) and [\u03b1P]UTP (Amersham or DuPont NEN, Boston, Mass.) according to the Maxiscript protocol. Templates for internal control hybridizations, pTRI-18S and pTRI-cyclophilin A, were purchased from Ambion, and probes were similarly synthesized using the Maxiscript T7 kit. Probes were isolated by acid phenol-chloroform (Ambion) extraction, separated from unincorporated nucleotide by gel filtration (Sephadex G25 RNAspin column, Boehringer-Mannheim), and ethanol-acetate precipitated before resuspension in hybridization buffer. The concentration of radioactivity in the synthesized probes was determined by liquid scintillation.","RNase protection experiments were performed using the Direct Protect RNase protection assay kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's protocol. IB3-1 cell lysates were pre-pared in Direct Protect lysis buffer according to the manufacturer's protocol after incubation under the appropriate conditions for 48 h. Probe (50-70 and 5-10 thousands of counts\/min for Hsc70 and control, respectively) and cellular RNA were hybridized overnight at 37\u00b0 C. and digested with RNase cocktail. Protected fragments were resolved by electrophoresis on 5% acrylamide-8 M urea gels and detected by fluorography. Hsc70 mRNA concentration is expressed relative to control (18S or cyclophilin A) hybridization by densitometry (see ). Results for hybridization of Hsc70 mRNA relative to the two control species were similar and were therefore grouped for data analysis.","5. Immunoprecipitation. Cultured cells were solubilized by incubation for 1 h at 4\u00b0 C. in RIPA[50 mM Tris-Cl (pH8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 (Bio-Rad or Fisher Scientific), 1% sodium deoxycholate (Sigma), and protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma; used at 1:1,000 final dilution)]. Solubilized cells were then homogenized by passage 10 times through a 20-gauge needle and cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 g for 20 min at 4\u00b0 C. Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad DC reagents as above. Polyclonal Hsc70 antiserum was added to the cell lysates (2 \u03bcl\/250 \u03bcg total protein, with equal amounts of protein at equal final concentrations for each condition within an experiment) and incubated at 4\u00b0 C. over-night with gentle agitation. Immune complexes were captured with protein A-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia Biotechnologies, Piscataway, N.J.) that had been preabsorbed with BSA for 45 min at 4\u00b0 C. Precipitated complexes were collected by centrifugation and washed twice with cold RIPA and twice with cold TBS (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, and 150 mM NaCl). Immunoprecipitated protein was related from the beads by incubation in SDS-PAGE sample buffer for 1 h at 70\u00b0 C. and resolved on 5 or 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Immunodetection of immunoprecipitated Hsc70 or CFTR was performed as described above.","6. Densitometric analysis. Fluorographic images were digitized using an AlphaImager 2000 digital analysis system (AlphaInnotech, San Leandro, Calif.). Densitometric analysis of these images were performed using AlphaImager image analysis software (version 4.0. AlphaInnotech) with two-dimensional integration of the selected band. Density of the lane surrounding the band was similarly determined by two-dimensional integration and used as a baseline density for background subtraction. for comparisons within an experiment, the density of the control lane, the 100-ng lane for bovine Hsc70 standard curve experiments and the 10-\u03bcg lane for CFTR standard curve experiments, was arbitrarily set to 1.0. A one-way ANVOA was used to determine statistical significance of changes in density of fluorographic bands (SPSS software, version 7.0).","7. Reagents. Pharmaceutical grade 4-PBA, manufactured by Triple Crown America (Perkasie, Pa.), was a gift of Dr. Saul Brusilow (Johns Hopkins School of Medicine). The sources for other reagents were as follows: reagent grade butyric acid and phenylacetic acid, Sigma; ACS reagent grade glycerol, J. T. Baker (Phillipsburg, N.J.) or Fisher; Geneticin (G418), GIBCO BRL; nitrocellulose, Schleicher & Schuell (Keene, N.H.) or Amersham. Electrophoresis grade chemicals were obtained from Fisher, Bio-Rad, or GIBCO BRL. All other reagents were of reagent grade or better.","All documents mentioned herein are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.","The present invention is further illustrate by the following non-limiting examples.","In this example the immortalized cystic fibrosis bronchiolar epithelial cell line IB3-1 (38). IB3-1 has the CFTR genotype \u0394F508\/W1282X and is a model system for study of the intracellular trafficking of \u0394F508-CFTR because the W1282X allele gives rise to an unstable and therefore untranslated mRNA. This results in IB3-1 cells containing only \u0394F508-CFTR (17). It has been shown that treatment of IB3-1 cells with 4-PBA results in restoration of appropriate intracellular trafficking of \u0394F508-CFTR (30).","IB3-1 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of 4-PBA in culture for 2 days. As shown in , total Hsc70 immunoreactivity in whole cell lysates declined in a dose-dependent fashion with increasing concentrations of 4-PBA as detected by a Hsc70-specific rabbit polyclonal antiserum (, representative immunoblot; , compiled densitometric analysis of  and 7 other immunoblots). Similar data were obtained when a rat monoclonal antibody to Hsc70 was used to probe the immunoblots. These data are consistent with 4-PBA inducing a dose-dependent reduction of cellular Hsc70 protein. To estimate the decrease in Hsc70 protein represented by this, 50% decrease in immunoreactivity, a densitometric standard curve of immunoreactivity was constructed for recombinant bovine Hsc70 (, representative immunoblot; , standard curve derived from  and two other experiments).","Log and linear regressions for the data of  were performed, and both were acceptable fits (r 2 for log and linear were 0.973 and 0.930, respectively). The superiority of the log fit may be due to saturation of the X-ray film used for fluorography at high amounts of Hsc70, although the densitometer was still able to distinguish density variation. These data suggest that IB3-3 cells contain 35 ng Hsc70\/5 \u03bcg total cellular protein. Furthermore, these data demonstrate a good correlation of Hsc70 immunoreactivity and measured densitometry; a 50% decrease in measured density corresponds to an, 50-60% decrease in total Hsc70 protein immunoreactivity.","Whether 4-PBA would regulate expression of a number of other molecular chaperones in IB3-1 cells () was assessed next. Calnexin is a molecular chapter one present in the ER membrane that binds to glycoproteins in the ER via high-mannose core residues and has previously been shown to have a prolonged interaction with \u0394F508-CFTR in heterologous cells expressing \u0394F508-CFTR (28). Hsp90 is required for correct folding and function of a number of cellular proteins (16). Inhibition of Hsp90 function with geldanamycin leads to more rapid degradation of \u0394F508-CFTR (24), suggesting that Hsp90 may be required for CFTR trafficking. Hsp70 (Hsp72) expression is induced by heat shock and the presence of denatured proteins within the eukaryotic cell (16). In the Hsp70 homologue DnaK and the Hsp40 homologue DnaJ act to promote protein folding (16). Hdj2 is the member of the Hsp40 family that specifically interacts with and regulates the ATPase activity of Hsc70. Hdj2 also interacts with CFTR during CFTR translation (26). Increasing concentrations of 4-PBA did not affect the expression of calnexin, Hsp90, Hsp70, Hsp40, or Hdj-2 in IB3-1 cells.","To substantiate these observations, densitometric analysis of the representative immunoblots of  and similar separate experiments (n 53 independent experiments for each chaperone including intermediate concentrations of 4-PBA) was performed. These data and the data of  are consistent with selective regulation of only Hsc70, the constitutively expressed member of the 70-kDa heat shock protein family by 4-PBA, and none of the other five molecular chaperones assessed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0168","num":"0181"},"figref":["FIGS. 1A-C","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0169","num":"0182"},"figref":["FIGS. 2A-2E","FIG. 1"]},"Because 4-PBA is known to regulate transcription, whether the concentration-dependent decrease in Hsc70 protein expression was reflective of a decrease in Hsc70 mRNA expression was examined next. Hsc70 mRNA was measured in lysates of IB3-1 cells by RNase protection. It was found that, in comparison to levels of 18S rRNA as an internal standard for total RNA assayed and recovered, a concentration-dependent decrease in steady-state Hsc70 mRNA levels after 4-PBA treatment () that correlated with the decrease in Hsc70 immunoreactivity observed in . There was a maximum decrease of, 50% of control expression with continuous exposure to 5 mM 4-PBA.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0171","num":"0184"},"figref":["FIGS. 3A-B","FIGS. 1 and 2"]},"Immunoprecipitation with an antiserum that recognizes both Hsp70 and Hsc70 results in the coimmunoprecipitation of \u0394F508-CFTR (37). A direct interaction between CFTR and Hsc70 was confirmed by testing whether specific immunoprecipitation of Hsc70 would result in coimmunoprecipitation of CFTR immunoreactivity (). The relative mobility of CFTR in this experiment was \u02dc170 kDa, which is consistent with the ER glycosylated \u201cband B\u201d form. Recovery of Hsc70 by immunoprecipitation was \u02dc10% of input, which is typical in this kind of experiment when recovery has been measured (26). It is assumed that this is representative of the total cellular pool of Hsc70.","As expected from the immunoblot data of , IB3-1 cells treated with increasing concentrations of 4-PBA had decreased amounts of immunoprecipitable Hsc70 (). With increasing concentrations of 4-PBA, less immunoreactive CFTR was recovered in complex with Hsc70. At >1 mM 4-PBA, CFTR was undetectable in the immunoprecipitates. Similarly, CFTR was not associated with Hsc70 when IB3-1 cells were incubated at 25\u00b0 C. We previously showed that treatment with >0.1 mM 4-PBA or incubation at 25\u00b0 C. leads to increased overall expression and the appearance of mature CFTR in IB3-1 cells (30). To better quantify this change, densitometric analysis was performed of this and similar experiments () and constructed a densitrometric standard curve of CFTR immunoreactivity using IB3-1 lysate protein (). The standard curve suggests that CFTR immunoreactivity as detected by densitometry decreases linearly as a function of decreasing protein but that the decrease in densitometric signal exceeds the decrease in CFTR protein, i.e., a decrease in IB3-1 protein from 5 to 2.5 \u03bcg leads to an approximately two-thirds decrease in densitometric signal. CFTR immunoreactivity was not consistently detected in samples containing 2 \u03bcg of IB3-1 protein and was not detected in samples containing 1 \u03bcg of IB3-1 protein. Thus the slightly greater change in CFTR vs. Hsc70 densitometric signal in  actually reflects a similar decrease in immunoreactive protein of the two species.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0174","num":"0187"},"figref":["FIGS. 4A-C","FIG. 1"]},"The decrease in CFTR recovered by immunoprecipitation in proportion to the decrease in Hsc70 is consistent with 4-PBA not directly influencing the binding affinity of CFTR and Hsc70. This was further assessed by immunoprecipitating Hsc70-CFTR complexes from untreated IB3-1 cells either with or without 1 mM 4-PBA added to the RIPA lysis and wash buffers. The recovery of Hsc70 and associated CFTR was unaltered in the presence of 4-PBA which is consistent with 4-PBA not altering the in vitro affinity of Hsc70 for CFTR.","Collectively, these data suggest that 4-PBA treatment leads to an increased proportion of \u0394F508-CFTR escaping association with Hsc70 due to a decrease in Hsc70 expression. If association with Hsc70 is necessary for CFTR ubiquitination, as it is for a number of other cellular proteins (3), then escape from this association may decrease the proportion of \u0394F508-CFTR that is prematurely degraded.","Next, effects of two compounds that promote trafficking of \u0394F508-CFTR to the plasma membrane, the transcriptional regulator butyrate (9) and the chemical chaperone glycerol (4, 30, 33). Also tested was the major in vivo metabolite of 4-PBA, phenylacetate, and the aminoglycoside antibiotic geneticin (G418). G418 promotes read through and stabilization of the otherwise unstable mRNA derived from the W1282X missense allele present in IB3-1 cells and results in the appearance of CFTR channel activity at the IB3-1 plasma membrane (2). Representative data for these immunoblot experiments are shown in . The results again demonstrate a reduction in Hsc70 immunoreactivity with 1 mM butyrate and 1M glycerol but not change in Hsp90, Hsp70, or Hsp40 immunoreactivity.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0178","num":"0191"},"figref":["FIGS. 5A-C","FIG. 1"]},"These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that conditions that promote \u0394F508-CFTR trafficking to the cell surface are associated with a reduction in Hsc70 expression, al-though we have yet to establish a causal relationship. Phenylacetate at 1 mM had little effect on Hsc70 or Hsp90 expression. In vivo, 4-PBA is rapidly and completely converted by \u03b2-oxidation to phenylacetate and then conjugated with glutamine to form phenacetylglutamine, which is excreted in the urine (6). Phenylacetate has a different potency profile from butyrate or 4-PBA with respect to specific gene induction (8). These results suggest that 4-BPA alone may regulate Hsc70 expression. G418, which acts on the W1282X allele and not \u0394F508-CFTR, had little effect on Hsc70 or Hsp90 but increased Hsp40 and Hsp70 immunoreactivity. Although it seems logical that increased Hsc70 might lead to reduced trafficking of CFTR derived from the W1282X allele, the W1282X-derived CFTR would have wild-type structure in the region of F508, and the F508 region may be a critical determinant of CFTR affinity for Hsc70 .","These changes in Hsc70 protein expression again correlated with changes in steady-state Hsc70 mRNA expression, as determined by RNase protection (). In this experiment, 1 mM butyrate and 1 M glycerol were associated with, 50% reduction in steady-state Hsc70 mRNA levels. The glycerol effect was unexpected and may occur by a mechanism different from that of the butyrates. Results as shown in  predict that conditions that do not affect Hsc70 expression would allow CFTR to associate with Hsc70. We tested this prediction by coimmunoprecipitation.  demonstrates the treatment of IB3-1 cells with glycerol or butyrate decreases the amount of immunoreactive CFTR copre-cipitated with Hsc70. Again, the densitometric analysis of this and similar experiments () suggests that the decrease in CFTR associated with Hsc70 resulted from decreased expression of Hsc70.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0181","num":"0194"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0182","num":"0195"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 1"]},"These data are consistent with a model in which a gents that improve \u0394F508-CFTR intracellular trafficking decrease the total amount of \u0394F508-CFTR\/Hsc70 complex. There was little effect of phenylacetate or G418 treatment. The latter observation is consistent with G418 acting by a mechanism different from that of 4-PBA, glycerol, or butyrate. This is also consistent with G418 acting on the W1282X-CFTR allele present in IB3-1 and not on the \u0394F508 allele that is the target of 4-PBA glycerol, or butyrate.","Specific Comments","The foregoing Examples show that 4-PBA, which was previously shown to facilitate trafficking of \u0394F508-CFTR to the plasma membrane (30), downregulates Hsc70 at the protein and mRNA levels. Consistent with these findings was the reduction in \u0394F508-CFTR\/Hsc70 complexes. Similar effects on Hsc70 protein and mRNA expression and \u0394F508-CFTR\/Hsc70 complex formation were observed for butyrate and glycerol, both of which restore \u0394F508-CFTR trafficking. Interaction with Hsc70 is thought to be a key step in targeting a number of cellular proteins for ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome (3). The usual intracellular fate of \u0394F508-CFTR is degradation, at least in part by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (20, 36). Therefore, 4-PBA may promote \u0394F508-CFTR trafficking by inhibiting its recognition by the intracellular degradation pathway.","The decrease in Hsc70 protein expression induced by 4-PBA, butyrate, and glycerol is, 40-60%. These data are consistent with observations that small perturbations in Hsc70 expression can result in alterations in cellular function. Butyrate is typically thought to act as a transcriptional activator, which contrast with these examples. However, decreased expression of surfactant proteins A and B mRNA in fetal rat lung has been reported in response to butyrate treatment (27). This is consistent with the examples suggesting a decrease in Hsc70 expression at the protein and mRNA levels after treatment with butyrate and 4-PBA.","\u0394508-CFTR is typically degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (20, 36). However, inhibition of the proteolytic component of this system with lactacystin or N-acetyl-L-leucinyl-L-leucinyl-L-leucinyl-L-leucinal does not promote \u0394F508-CFTR trafficking to the cell surface (20, 36). These observations suggest that the committed step for intracellular degradation occurs earlier in the pathway than the actual proteolysis.","Hsc70 associates with CFTR during CFTR translation, and the association with \u0394F508-CFTR is greater and longer lived than with wild-type CFTR (26). CFTR also undergoes cotranslational ubiquitination (32), and the possibility of enhanced ubiquitin-dependent degradation of the \u0394F508 peptide in the presence of Hsc70 is absent in the in vitro folding system (34). Collectively, these data are consistent with a model in which Hsc70 remains associated with species that are \u201cpartially structured\u201d and likely to aggregate, thereby preventing aggregation. The foregoing Examples are consistent with, at most, a 40-60% reduction in Hsc70 expression at clinically relevant 4-PBA concentrations.","A working model is suggested by these Examples. Under physiological conditions, <1% of \u0394F508-CFTR is trafficked via the normal pathway; >99% is targeted for and subsequently degraded (35). In contrast, only, \u02dc75% of wild-type CFTR is targeted for and subsequently degraded, whereas 25% of wild-type CFTR is trafficked to the cell surface (35). Based on these proportions, the \u201ctrafficking\u201d pathway for \u0394F508-CFTR is disfavored by at least 2-3 kcal\/mol compared with that of wild-type CFTR (7). This results from either an intrinsic instability of the \u0394F508-CFTR protein, as is suggested by the higher proportion of \u0394F508-CFTR that would enter the degradative pathway compared with wild-type CFTR.","In this working model, decreasing the association of \u0394F508-CFTR with the recognition protein would promote its trafficking to the cell surface. The observed decrease in Hsc70 recovered by immunoprecipitation in  could also contribute to this effect. Decreasing the intracellular concentration of the recognition protein, such as Hsc70, by, \u02dc50% would similarly decrease its rate of association with \u0394F508-CFTR and lead to a reduction in premature degradation of \u0394F508-CFTR. More newly synthesized \u0394F508-CFTR would thereby enter the trafficking pathway.","The foregoing Examples have shown that 4-PBA and butyrate decrease both the expression of Hsc70 mRNA and protein and also its association with \u0394F508-CFTR. These date are consistent with a hypothetical model in which the association of \u0394F508-CFTR with Hsc70 leads to ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of \u0394F508-CFTR. 4-PBA- and butyrate-mediated reduction in Hsc70 may promote \u0394F508-CFTR trafficking to the cell surface.","The following references 1-38 are referred to by number under the General Comments, Examples 1-3 and Specific Comments sections provided above. The disclosures of each reference are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.\n\n","The following Examples demonstrate that a specific phenyl alkenoic acid, i.e., 4-Phenyl-\u03943-transbutenoic acid, restores the normal biosynthetic trafficking of the \u0394F508 protein in CF, and therefore, may be useful as a treatment for disorders or conditions impacted by undesired protein expression such as CF. Without wishing to be bound to any theory, it is believed 4-Phenyl-\u03943-transbutenoic acid words by down regulating Hsc70 which is involved in the degradation of the \u0394F508 protein. In addition, it is further believed that the \u0394F508 protein acts by inhibiting histone descetylation leading to increased expression of other chloride channels.","4-PBA has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of certain urea cycle disorders. However, the data provided by Examples 4-12 show, among other things, that 4-Phenyl-\u03943-transbutenoic acid is much more effective at lower concentrations.","As shown in , IB3-1 (\u0394F508\/W1282X) cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of the test compounds from 1 \u03bcM to 100 \u03bcM for 48 hr. CFTR was immunoprecipitated and phosphorylated as described in the Methods. Lane 1 shows control, untreated cells at standard cell culture conditions. Band B CFTR is barely visible consistent with low level \u0394F508 expression. The positive control condition, untreated cells grown at 28\u00b0 C., is in lane 7. Band C has been induced and Band B is relatively depleted consistent with an effect of low temperature on protein trafficking. Lanes 2-6 show a dose-dependent induction of Band C as well as an induction of Band B and total CFTR. This is consistent with an effect on protein production and on protein trafficking.","Shown in  are independent experiments performed as described above. Now the control cells are analyzed in lane 5. Lanes 1-4 show decreasing concentrations of the test compound. Again these results show a dose-dependent induction of bands B and C consistent with an increase in CFTR production and protein folding.","Shown in  are results of CF bronchial epithelial cells were harvested from the discarded lungs of a CF patient who underwent therapeutic lung transplant. The genotype is homozygous \u0394F508. The methods are as described above. Control cells grown in standard conditions for 0 or 48 hrs are in lanes 6 and 7. Bands B and C are barely detectable. The positive control condition, 28\u00b0 C. is in lane 1 and shows up-regulations of both bands B and C. The test compound in doses from 1 \u03bcM to 1 mM for 48 hr is shown in decreasing order in lanes 2-5. The primary patient-derived cells are much more sensitive to the effects and show dramatic induction of bands B and C by 1 \u03bcM with maximum induction by 1 mM. These results confirm activity of this compound in primary and immortalized CF airway epithelial cells.","Shown in  is an experiment in which cells were exposed to control or test conditions or study drug for 48 hrs and then analyzed by immunoblotting for Hsc70, a 70 kD heat shock chaperone protein. This semi-quantitative blot demonstrates at least a 50% reduction in Hsc70 at 100 \u03bcM and 1 mM concentrations (lanes 4 and 5). Hsc70 is not as dramatically down regulated by growth at 27\u00b0 C.","Shown in  is an experiment performed along lines as shown in  in the same primary cell line. Hsc70 under control conditions is strongly visible in lane 6. Study drug at 1 \u03bcM or higher, and low temperature, are associated with more than 50% reduction in Hsc70.","As shown in , IB3-1 cells were exposed to the test conditions and 1 mM study drug for the indicated periods of time. CFTR was detected by immunoprecipitation and phosphorylation. Control cells at 0 and 32 hrs have barely visible CFTR bands B and C. Exposure to low temperature induces band C. 1 mM 4-phenyl-\u03943-transbutenoic acid begins to induce band C and 4 hr and appears maximal by 16 hrs.","As shown in , IB3-1 cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of 4-phenylbutyrate and then immunoblotted for CFTR with anti-CFTR antibody 181 (upper panel) or for Hsp70 (lower panel). Control cells at 37\u00b0 C. show band B CFTR, but virtually undetectable band C CFTR. These cells as expected show very little Hsp70, the heat shock inducible chaperone. At 27\u00b0 C., a lower temperature, there is very little Hsp70 as expected, but as expected, there has been induction of band C CFTR. 4-Phenylbutyrate induces Hsp70 in a dose-dependent manner and also promotes appearance of band C CFTR.","As shown in , IB3-1 cells were transfected with Hsp70 or a control plasmid using lipofectamine by standard methodologies. After 48 hrs, the cells were collected and immunoblotted with anti-CFTR antibody 181. The arrows indicate the CFTR, however the mobility is somewhere from 160-180 kD. The induction of Hsp70 is associated with a dramatic overproduction of CFTR as compared to control plasmid transfection at 37\u00b0 C. or growth at 27\u00b0 C.","Standard methods for detecting and quantifying electrical potentials from nasal epithelia have been reported. See e.g., Zeitlin, P. L. (2000) in 1: 1; Noone, P. G. et al. (2000) in 1: 105-114; Caplen, J. J. et al. (1995) 1: 39-46; Middleton, P. G. (1994) in 7: 2050-2056; the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference.","Using these and related approaches, nasal potential difference patterns from normal and CF patients were analyzed. See .","Briefly,  shows a nasal potential difference pattern from an individual with cystic fibrosis. The methodology employed involves superfusion of the inferior turbinate with Ringer's solution and measurement of the electrical potential with reference to a subcutaneous electrode. This CF pattern shows a typical hyperpolarization, large amiloride inhibition, and minimal repolarization to low chloride or isoproterenol maneuvers.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0206","num":"0256"},"figref":"FIG. 16B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0207","num":"0257"},"figref":"FIG. 16C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0208","num":"0258"},"figref":["FIG. 16D","FIG. 16D"]},"The foregoing experiments using human nasal epithelia can be readily repeated using any one or more of the carbocyclic aryl compounds of this invention, preferably a phenyl alkenoic acid, and more preferably 4-phenyl-\u03943-transbutenoic acid; or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.
