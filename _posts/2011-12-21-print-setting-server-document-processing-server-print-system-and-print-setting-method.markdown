{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND ART","SUMMARY OF INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS","First Embodiment","Configuration of Network System","Other Embodiments"],"p":["The present invention relates to a print setting server, a document processing server, a print system, and a print setting method for networked printing.","Connecting computers with printers over a network allows each computer to use each printer via the network. In this regard, a technique is known such that a user of a client computer uses a Web browser to enter print settings through a Web-page user interface (hereinafter abbreviated as a Web UI) provided by a server computer.","In a case that a document created with an application running on a client computer is printed, an outputting printer is selected, print settings are entered with a Web browser and the document is sent to a server computer via the Web browser. In the server computer, a print application reads the document and uses the print settings information to issue a rendering instruction for printing. A printer driver executed on the server computer converts the rendering instruction into a print instruction interpretable by the outputting printer and sends the print instruction to the outputting printer. The outputting printer performs print operations according to the received print instruction. In this manner, conventionally a desired printed document can be obtained (for example, see Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2007-328639).","In cloud computing such as SaaS (Software as a Service), applications run on a server computer and a user of a client computer uses the applications through a Web browser. Here, description will be given using a block diagram shown in  for a case called cloud printing, in which a document created with an application running on a server computer is printed. First, through a Web browser on a client computer, printing is instructed to the application, an outputting printer is selected, and print settings are entered. The server computer converts the application document into a general electronic document format such as PDF (Portable Document Format) and sends the converted document along with the print settings information to a print proxy computer. A print proxy application 621 running on the print proxy computer issues a rendering instruction based on the received print setting information and electronic document. A printer driver executed on the print proxy computer converts the rendering instruction into a print instruction interpretable by the outputting printer and sends the print instruction to the outputting printer. The outputting printer performs print operations according to the received print instruction. In this manner, conventionally a desired printed document can be obtained (for example, see Google code, \u201cGoogle Cloud Print (Labs)\u201d, retrieved on Oct. 13, 2010, URL: http:\/\/code.google.com\/apis\/cloudprint\/).","Unfortunately, such conventional approaches involve a first inconvenience: print setting items related to characteristic functions of each printer cannot be provided in a user-friendly form on a Web UI for entering print settings. This is because, with a common Web UI applicable to various printers, it is difficult to display functions characteristic of a specific printer model together as a group, or to preferentially display frequently used print setting items. For example, a function called borderless printing is to perform printing with no borders along the edges of a print sheet. Another function is to print two pages of a document on one sheet with a layout called 2-in-1. Borderless printing is often set when an image is printed, while 2-in-1 is often set when a document of many pages is printed. Since these setting items are frequently set, displaying these setting items together with high priority on a Web UI would improve the operability in print setting.","In the cloud computing described above, the server computer obtains print setting capability information from the print proxy computer. The print setting capability information is a set of setting items that should be included in the print setting information and setting values settable for each setting item. The print setting capability information does not include display priority and information for displaying certain print setting items together. Consequently, for example, a common Web UI may take a form that simply lists setting items. It is difficult to provide a Web UI that displays certain setting items together depending on a factor such as printer model, or that preferentially displays particular setting items.","Given a detailed knowledge of functions of printers to be used, certain print setting items could be displayed together in the Web UI. However, a software vendor that provides cloud computing is different from hardware vendors that manufacture printers and therefore does not have a detailed knowledge of the printers. Further, printers of various models manufactured by various vendors are on the market, and there is a wide choice of printers. In the light of these facts, changing the print setting screen depending on the outputting printer is unrealistic and the Web UI can only provide a printer-independent common print setting screen.","In the above-described case in which the printer driver running on the serer computer is used for printing, characteristic print setting items corresponding to the outputting printer cannot be provided in a user-friendly form unless a Web application for generating the Web UI is changed depending on the outputting printer. However, considering that various printers are on the market, changing the Web application for generating the Web page UI depending on the outputting printer is unrealistic and the Web UI actually cannot provide characteristic print setting items of the printer in a user-friendly form.","In addition to the first inconvenience, the conventional approaches also involve a second inconvenience: the Web UI of a print setting screen does not allow entering print settings while maintaining consistency of the print settings, leading to a print result that does not conform to the enter print settings. This occurs because contradictory setting values can be entered for two or more print setting items. Take an example of the setting item \u201cthe type of printing paper\u201d and the setting item \u201cdouble-sided printing.\u201d It would be preferable to control the display on the print setting screen so that the user can enable double-sided printing only when the user selects printing paper capable of double-sided printing on the print setting screen. However, in conventional art, since only the printer driver has priority among setting items and adjusts consistency, the Web UI cannot maintain the consistency of print settings with respect to the user's entry. As a result, the printer driver adjusts the consistency of print settings when the print proxy application performs printing, and this causes the second inconvenience, i.e., printing is performed according to print settings different from user-entry print settings.","Accordingly, the present invention enables providing a user with a Web UI that displays certain print setting items related to characteristic functions of a printer together as a group and that also allows print settings to be entered while maintaining the consistency of the print settings.","To solve the above object, a print system according to the present invention has the following configuration.","According to one aspect of the present invention, a print setting server capable of communicating with a client device and with a document processing server that manages document data, comprises: receiving means for receiving, from the document processing server, print environment information about an outputting print device specified according to a print instruction for the document data from the client device;

The following embodiments are not intended to limit the present invention set forth in claims, and not all combinations of features described in the embodiments are necessarily required for solutions of the present invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","110","120","140","150","100","110","120","150","130","140","120","120"]},"The client  executes a Web browser . Various sorts of screen data supplied to the client  are displayed by the Web browser  on the client device. A user of the client  can operate various screens through the Web browser .","The server  executes an application , a print service , and a maintenance and search program for an outputting printer database . The application  is what is called a Web application that supplies application screen (UI screen) data  to the client  to thereby provide functions of creating, editing, saving, and printing an application document , i.e., document data. The server  stores and manages document data to be processed by the application  in storage means (not shown) internal or external to the server . The outputting printer database  is managed by the server  in this embodiment. The outputting printer database  is a database of information on outputting printers available to each user, and print environment information  supplied from each printer and from the print proxy computer  to which the printer is connected. The information on outputting printers includes information indicating a name (identifier), model, serial number, and manufacturer for identifying the printer. For example, if an identifier of a user is entered to search for printer names, then printer names available to the user are returned. The print environment information  includes printer information, for example, information such as identifiers for identifying the printer (such as information indicating a model, serial number, and manufacturer) and the location of the printer. The print environment information  includes information for identifying functions provided by the printer. In addition, the print environment information  includes, for example, the address of a print setting server that manages a print setting capability information database of the printer.","The print service  is software that provides a print service to the application . The print service  supplies outputting printer selection screen data  to the client  to thereby provide a capability of selecting an outputting printer. The print service  also supplies common print setting screen data  to the client  to thereby provide a capability of entering print settings through a common print setting screen. On the common print setting screen, common print settings (such as specifying the number of copies) commonly supportable by any printer can be made. The print service  uses the print setting server  corresponding to the printer  to obtain print setting information  through an advanced print setting screen. On the advanced print setting screen, print settings (such as color, double-sided, and binding) dependent on the outputting printer can be made. The print service  supplies, to the print proxy computer , a general electronic document  in a general document format resulting from converting the application document , and the print setting information . The general document format here refers to a format that can be processed by general software and printer drivers, such as PDF (Portable Document Format) or EMF (Enhanced Metafile).","The print setting server  executes a print setting service  and a maintenance and search program for a print setting capability information database . Advanced print setting screen data  is provided by the print setting service . The print setting service  has a function of providing the advanced print setting screen data  to the client . The print setting capability information database  stores print setting capability information on the printer , the priority and group information on setting items required for displaying the advanced print setting screen, and rule information for maintaining the consistency of print settings. The rule information is, for example, information to be used for evaluation for maintaining the consistency among setting values of print setting items used as print setting information. The print setting capability information is information indicating setting items settable for the printer or printer driver and setting values settable for each setting item. If the user changes a setting value of a print setting item, the print setting service  can use information stored in the print setting capability information database  to update the advanced print setting screen data .","The print proxy computer  executes a print proxy application  and a printer driver . The print proxy application  has a function of supplying the print environment information  to the server . The print environment information  includes information on the type of operating system (OS) of the print proxy computer , manufacturer information and the model of the printer , the print setting capability information on the printer  or the printer driver , and information on the printer driver . The print proxy application  uses the print setting information  supplied from the server  to supply a rendering instruction for printing the content of the general electronic document  to the printer driver . The printer driver  converts the supplied rendering information into a print instruction interpretable by the printer  and supplies the print instruction to the printer .","The printer  performs print operations according to the received print instruction and forms an image on printing paper.","The print setting service  and the print setting capability information database  operating on the print setting server  are preferably provided by a hardware vendor that manufactured the printer  and the printer driver . Being conversant with functions of the printer , the hardware vendor can provide the above-described rule information, and the advanced print setting screen data  suitable for the printer . Accordingly, besides the system shown in , the present invention also contemplates application to a system that includes a number of print setting servers provided by hardware vendors that manufactured various printers and printer drivers. In that case, there may be a number of printer drivers  and printers , although they are each shown as a single entity in . Also in that case, in response to a print instruction from the client, the server  communicates with a print setting server provided by a hardware vendor identified from information such as information indicating the manufacturer of an outputting printer contained in the print environment information.","In addition, several users may share one printer. Accordingly, although  shows only one client , there may be a number of clients . Also, a user may use several applications. Accordingly, although  shows only one server , there may be a number of servers .","The application screen data , the outputting printer selection screen data , the common print setting screen data , and the advanced print setting screen data  are data, such as HTML data, that represents respective enter screens in a form easily viewable by the user.","The server  and the print setting server  execute Web server software (not shown). The Web server software receives a URL from Web client software and, in response to a request described in the URL, sends data in HTML or in other forms as a processing result to the Web client software according to HTTP. HTML is an abbreviation of Hyper Text Markup Language, URL is an abbreviation of Uniform Resource Locator, and HTTP is an abbreviation of Hyper Text Transfer Protocol. The Web browser  running on the client  is a kind of Web client software. In this manner, various sorts of screen data are sent to the client .","[Overview of Network System Operation]","The print setting server  provides a Web API for supplying the advanced print setting screen data, and the print service  uses the Web API. API is an abbreviation of Application Programming Interface. The print service  supplies the print environment information to the Web API of the print setting server  and obtains a URL for the advanced print setting screen in response. The print service  uses this URL (for example, passes the URL to the client) to cause the advanced print setting screen data  to be sent to the client  and causes the user to enter advanced print settings.","The server  provides a Web API for receiving the print setting information , and the print setting service  uses the Web API. Once the user of the client  finishes entering the advanced print settings, the print setting service  supplies the print setting information  to the Web API of the server . In this manner, the print service  can obtain the consistent print setting information  and use it for printing.","The print setting information  may be data in any format that can be reflected as print settings in a print result. For example, the print setting information  may be a PrintTicket document, interpretable by the printer driver , compliant with Print Schema specifications. Of course, the print setting information  may be in a data format that can be directly interpreted by the printer . As another example, the print setting information  may be in a format interpretable by the printer proxy application , in which case the printer driver  may be informed of the settings.","The print setting capability information included in the print environment information  is a set of print setting items in print settings corresponding to the functions of the printer  and setting values settable for each print setting item. The print setting capability information may be data in any format that can be reflected in the print setting information . For example, the print setting capability information may be a PrintCapabilities document compliant with the Print Schema specifications.","The print proxy application  may actively operate when the server  supplies the print setting information  and the general electronic document  to the print proxy application . For example, the print proxy application  polls the server  to detect the presence of a document to be printed.","[Print Setting and Print Processing Procedure]","Next, the flow of print processing, including entry of print settings, will be described using , B, and C.  are flowcharts showing print processing in the first embodiment. Here, to clarify the flow of the print processing, the description will be given with respect to the entire system.","The server  provides the screen data  of the application  to the client  through the Web service, and the user of the client  can operate the application  through the Web browser . First, in S, the user of the client  provides a print instruction to the application  for printing the created and edited application document . In S, the application  notifies the print service  of the instruction to print the application document  along with user information.","In S, the print service  queries the outputting printer database  to obtain a list of outputting printers available to the user. The print service further generates the outputting printer selection screen data  from the list and provides it to the client . In S, the user of the client  operates the outputting printer selection screen through the Web browser  and selects the outputting printer . The print service is notified of the selected printer .","In S, the print service  determines the print setting server  that is to provide the advanced print setting screen for the printer . Specifically, this determination is made with reference to information (e.g., vendor information and model information, or address information) for identifying the print setting server corresponding to the selected outputting printer, included in the print environment information . As described above, hardware vendors that manufactured various printers could provide their respective print setting servers .","In S, it is checked whether the determined print setting server  is available. If available, the process moves to S. Otherwise, the process moves to S. For example, the determination of the availability may be based on the presence or absence and the content of a response to a message sent to the determined print setting server for confirming whether the print setting server is alive.","S to S are a sub-flow in which the print service  obtains the print setting information from the print setting server . First, in S, the print service  requests the print setting server  to provide the advanced print setting screen data. At this point, the print service  supplies part or all of the information included in the print environment information  to the print setting server . The supplied print environment information includes information necessary for identifying print settings unique to the printer to be used, for example at least the model number of the printer to be used. Although not directly related to the printer, information related to the environment in which the printer is used may also be included, such as information identifying frequently set items. The print setting service  of the print setting server  returns, to the server , the URL for supplying data on the advanced print setting screen for the outputting printer . The print service  supplies the URL returned from the print setting server  to the client . In S, the client  accesses this URL. The print setting service  in turn uses information included in the print environment information  and information stored in the print setting capability information database  to generate the advanced print setting screen data  and supply it to the client . The client  displays a setting screen corresponding to the advanced print setting screen data  in the Web browser . The advanced print setting screen data  may not be generated each time it is supplied. Rather, the advanced print setting screen data may be generated and stored in advance in association with information that can identify the functions of the corresponding printer, for example the model number of the printer, and the stored advanced print setting screen data may simply be provided in step S. Also, the advanced print setting screen data may be stored in association with information that can identify the functions of the printer when the advanced print setting screen data is first generated.","In S, the user of the client  operates the advanced setting screen through the Web browser  to enter print settings. In S, the print setting service  determines whether the user has completed entering the print settings. If so, the process moves to S. Otherwise, the process moves to S. The completion of the enter can be determined from a press on a complete button on the Web UI, for example. In S, the print setting service  determines whether the user has changed a setting value of a setting item of the print settings. If so, the process moves to S. Otherwise, the process returns to S. In S, the print setting service  updates the advanced print setting screen data to maintain the consistency of the print settings, and supplies the updated screen data to the client. At this point, the changed setting item is preferably displayed to the user in a visually noticeable form. The determination of the consistency among the setting items may be made by, for example, having data on a list of combinations of inconsistent setting values for each setting item in advance and determining whether or not any of the combinations of item values in the list is present. For each combination of inconsistent setting item values, a prioritized item may be predetermined, or a prioritized item may be determined from the use environment. Then the value of a subordinated item may be changed to be consistent with the value of the prioritized item. The process returns to S, where the user continues inputting the print settings by operating the updated advanced print setting screen.","When the user of the client  has completed inputting the print settings and the print setting service  is notified of the completion, in S, the print setting service  supplies the entered print setting information  to the server , which has requested the URL of the advanced print setting screen. The process then moves to S.","S to S is a sub-flow in which the print setting information  set by the user is used to print the application document  with the printer . Once the print service  receives the print setting information  from the print setting server , in S, the print service  converts the application document  into the general electronic document  such as PDF. In S, the print service  outputs the print setting information  and the general electronic document  to the print proxy computer . In S, the print proxy application  uses the received print setting information  to supply a rendering instruction for printing the general electronic document  to the printer driver . In S, the printer driver  converts the rendering instruction issued by the print proxy application  into a print instruction interpretable by the printer  and supplies the print instruction to the printer . In S, the printer  performs print operations according to the print instruction to form an image on printing paper.","S to S is a sub-flow in which the print service  obtains the print setting information if the print setting server  determined in S is unavailable. If the print setting server  is unavailable, a common print setting screen is provided to the user as in conventional art. First, in S, the print service  provides the common print setting screen data  independent of the printer  to the client . In S, the user of the client  operates the common print setting screen through the Web browser  to enter print settings. In S, the print service  determines whether the user has completed entering the print settings. If so, the process moves to S. Otherwise, the process moves to S.","Information for associating the instruction to print the application document  issued by the user of the client  with the print setting information  is also used between the server  and the print setting server . For example, in S, the print service  assigns a unique print instruction number to the print instruction and supplies the print instruction number to the print setting server . In S, the print setting service  can supply the print instruction number along with the print setting information  to the server . In this manner, the print instruction can be associated with the print setting information .","[Exemplary UI]",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["111","110","110","111","110","140","102"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["111","111","140"]},"When the user of the client  changes the setting value of a certain print setting, the advanced print setting screen is updated to maintain the consistency of the print settings. For example, when the setting value of the setting item \u201cdouble-sided printing\u201d is changed from OFF to ON, the advanced print setting screen is updated so that setting values incompatible with double-sided printing among setting values for the setting item \u201cpaper type\u201d are not displayed. In this manner, selectable setting values for certain setting items are increased or decreased in response to the user's entry, so that the user can continue entering the print settings with the consistency of the print setting information maintained. Although the consistency among the setting items is maintained by the print setting server in the description for , the consistency may be maintained with a script sent along with the advanced print setting screen data to the client, for example.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["111","111"]},"The print setting information entered on the common print setting screen may not be consistent. If the print setting information  received by the print proxy application  is not consistent, the printer driver changes setting values to maintain the consistency of the print setting information . The print settings changed by the printer driver cannot be checked by the user before printing. Consequently, the print setting information entered by the user is different from the print setting information to be used in actual printing. For example, when the setting value of double-sided printing is ON while the setting value of paper type is a type incapable of double-sided printing, printing is performed with the setting value(s) of either one or both of the setting items \u201cdouble-sided printing\u201d and \u201cpaper type\u201d changed.","In this embodiment, PDF is taken as an example of the general electronic document . Alternatively, each page of the application document  may be converted into an image in a format such as JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group).","In this embodiment, the server  obtains the URL of the advanced print setting screen from the print setting server  and supplies the URL to the client . Alternatively, the server  may obtain the advanced print setting screen data  and supply the obtained advanced print setting screen data  to the client .","In this embodiment, the print proxy computer  including the print proxy application  and the printer driver  is described as a separate entity for generating the print instruction interpretable by the printer . Alternatively, the print proxy computer  may not intervene if the printer  can connect to the network, provide the print environment information , and perform printing with the print setting information  and the general electronic document . In this case, the printer returns the print environment information.","In this embodiment, the server  and the print setting server  are described as separate entities. Alternatively, the server  may take the functions of the print setting server . In this case, the server  includes the print setting service  and the print setting capability information database . Since the print environment information  and the print setting information  are now processed in the server , an API call other than a Web API, or inter-process communication, may be used to supply the information. It is noted that, in this case, rewording the print setting server as a print setting service will facilitate understanding of  and the relevant description. Even if the both servers are embodied as the same computer, each server is an independent module and the implementation of the present invention still involves inter-server communication as described in . In this case, \u201ccommunication\u201d includes not only communication over the network but also communication without intervention of a physical network, such as inter-process communication.","In this embodiment, the server  and the print setting server  are described as servers.
