{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present invention relates to deploying portlets into a portal, and more specifically, to deploying portlets into a portal by direct use of a portlet catalog via the portal.","Portal software enables the ability to execute applications to render parts of a portal page. These applications are called portlets. Portlets provide a variety of information such as current time, stock price of a company or a weather forecast, for example. These types of portlets are interesting for many customers of a portal since they provide a useful task. Today, portlet applications can be downloaded from special websites such as portlet catalogs. The portlet catalogs include a collection of web pages, which are categorizing and describing the downloadable portlet applications. Together with the description of a portlet application, a link to the web module or package is provided. This link can be used to download the portlet application.  illustrates a conventional method for deploying portlets. As shown in , in operation  a portlet catalog is searched for a required portlet application. A web module or package is then downloaded to the client machine at operation . At operation , the package is unpacked to the client machine. Then, in operation , a user\/administrator logs into the portal administration. The user then selects an option to install a portlet application at operation  and browses to the downloaded portlet application at operation . Then, the user selects the downloaded portlet application for installation at operation  and the installation is confirmed at operation .  is a conventional system employing the method of .","In , the system includes a client machine  and a plurality of servers  and . The client machine  includes a web browser  and a storage device . The server  includes a portal  having a deployment application programming interface (API)  and a storage device . The server  includes a portlet catalog  and a storage device . At a client machine , a user\/administrator searches the portlet catalog  on the server  for specified portlet applications, using the web browser . The portlet catalog  provides download links to portlet applications . These links are used to download a portlet application  from the storage device  of the server  to a storage device  of the client machine . After the portlet application  is downloaded, the user connects to the server  running the portal  and initiates the deployment of the selected portal application  via the deployment API . During the deployment, the portlet application  is copied from the storage device  of the client machine  to the storage device  of the server . If the portlet application is a package, e.g., a ZIP file, the user must first unpack it on the client machine .","There are several problems associated with the conventional method for deploying remote portlets. One problem is that the portal software does not have the ability to deploy these portlet applications without requiring the user to first download or unpack the portlet application from the portlet catalog to the client machine. This process may be very time-consuming since the user has to connect to two different servers as shown in , and handle intermediate files which have to be stored on the client machine only for transfer purposes.","The present invention provides a method for directly deploying remote portlets from a portlet catalog by providing a portlet and an extended deployment API in the portal and routing all requests to the portlet catalog through the portal, thereby eliminating the need to connect to multiple servers and to handle intermediate files.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, a computer-implemented system for deploying remote portlet applications into a portal is provided. The system includes a portal server in communication with a client, and including a portal which includes a portlet which receives a request from a user, via the client, to install a portlet application from a remote location, searches for a selected remote portlet application as selected by the user, and triggers an installation of the selected remote portlet application when selected for installation by the user, and a deployment application programming interface (API) which communicates with the portlet and deploys the selected remote portlet application to the portal when triggered by the portlet.","According to another embodiment of the present invention, a method for deploying portlets is also provided.","Additional features and advantages are realized through the techniques of the present invention. Other embodiments and aspects of the invention are described in detail herein and are considered to be a part of the claimed invention. For a better understanding of the invention with the advantages and the features, refer to the description and to the drawings.","With reference now to , there is a block diagram illustrating a system for deploying portlet applications into a portal, according to an embodiment of the present invention. As shown in , the system includes a client machine  and a plurality of servers  and . The client machine  includes a web browser  and a storage device . The server  includes a portlet catalog  and a storage device  storing portlet applications . The server  includes a portal  and a storage device . According to an embodiment of the present invention, the portal  includes a portlet  and an extended deployment API . The user (e.g., an administrator  as depicted in , for example) connects with the portal  via the web browser  at the client machine  and uses the portlet  to access the portlet catalog . That is, the portlet  allows the user to browse the portlet catalog  and to select a portlet application  for installation. Therefore, according to an embodiment of the present invention, the user only directly connects to the server  which runs the portal .","According to an embodiment of the present invention, the portlet  receives a request from a user, via the client machine , to install a portlet application , accesses and searches a portlet catalog  of the server  for a selected portlet application  as selected by the user. The portlet  also provides install information for installing the selected portlet application  and triggers an installation of the selected portlet application  when selected for installation by the user.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, the portlet  also enables the use of techniques such as web services or remote portlets (WSRP), for example, to provide a portlet catalog.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, the extended deployment API  is used to install portlet applications  from a network location, and is used by the portlet  to deploy any selected portlet application . That is, the extended deployment API  is extended to support the installation of portlet applications  from remote network locations, for example. Therefore, upon selection of a portlet application  via the portlet , the portlet  triggers the extended deployment API  to deploy the selected portlet application . That is, the extended deployment API  receives the install information provided by the portlet , and retrieves the selected portlet application  based on the install information received. Alternatively, according to another embodiment, the extended deployment API  may be used to download the web module or package directly from the remote server (reference numeral ) as shown in , for example, to the server  and then perform a deployment operation. According to another embodiment, the download functionality may be included in the portlet , for example, as discussed below with reference to .","The portlet application  is then directly installed from the portlet catalog  at the server , without requiring the user to first download the portlet application  to the client machine . Instead, the portlet application  is directly installed from the storage device  at the server  to the storage device  at the server , for example. According to an embodiment of the present invention, the selected portlet application  may be stored on a disk or in memory, for example.","According to embodiments of the present invention, there are different ways to access the portlet catalog . According to one embodiment, the portlet catalog  may be a web pages-based portlet catalog where the portlet  embeds the web pages and converts any download link to a portlet application  into a portlet URL. Therefore, when the portlet URL is selected, the installation of the portlet application  is triggered.","According to another embodiment, the portlet catalog  may be a data-based portlet catalog, where the server  provides a file which categorizes and describes the portlet applications  and provides the download links. In this embodiment, the format of the file may be an XML format, for example, however, the present invention is not limited hereto. The portlet  renders the content of the file appropriately and implements a search function. The download links are embedded as portlet URLs, for example, which triggers the installation of the selected portlet application . Alternatively, the portlet applications  may be provided in a selectable list at the portlet  where the user may select to install all selected portlet applications  by clicking an install link, for example.","According to yet another embodiment, the portlet catalog  may be a web service-based portlet catalog where the server  offers a web service which provides access to the portlet catalog  and a search function. Web service operations may be used to navigate the portlet catalog  or search for specific portlet applications . Download links may be embedded as portlet URLs, for example, to trigger the installation of the selected portlet application . Alternatively, according to another embodiment, the portlet applications  may be provided in a selectable list at the portlet , as mentioned above, and the user may click an install link to install all selected portlet applications .","In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the portlet catalog  may be a WSRP-based portlet catalog, where the server  offers a remote portlet (not shown) which implements a user interface, navigation, and logic of the portlet catalog . The remote portlet (not shown) is consumed by the portal , for example. In order to install the portlet applications  from the portlet catalog , a local portlet such as portlet  is required. The local portlet , for example, then handles the installation request and communicates with the respective extended deployment API . By selecting a portlet application  in the remote portlet, this event triggers the local portlet , for example. The local portlet  provides an install link and installs the portlet application  when the install link is selected, for example.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3","FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 3","FIG. 5"],"b":["200","200","210","210","220","220","230","230","240"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 3","FIG. 5"],"b":["70","54","54","54","60","60","54","70","70","66","54","70","62","66","62","66","70","54","62","54","62","62","60","66","70","54","54","66","70","70","66","54","66","60","60","54","54","66","66"]},"According to an embodiment, if the administrator  decides to install the portlet application  and selects the associated portlet URL, the administration portlet  triggers the installation. The administration portlet  then obtains deployment information using the download URL for example, from the extended deployment API . The deployment information may include portlet application information such as the predetermined number and name of portlets embedded in the selected portlet application . The extended deployment API  opens a network stream to a web module located on a server  containing the selected portlet application , using the download link. The extended deployment API  then process deployment descriptors and generates deployment information including suggested deployment values and returns the install information including the deployment information to the administration portlet . The administration portlet  then renders the collected install information to the administrator  and allows the administrator  to modify the deployment information associated with the selected portlet application , if necessary. The administrator  then selects to install the portlet application  by clicking on an install link, for example. The administration portlet  then updates the install information with any modified values, as modified by the administrator  and triggers the extended deployment API  with the install information to install the selected portlet application . After deployment of the selected portlet application , the administration portlet  displays the result information returned from the extended deployment API  and the administrator  may either continue to browse the portlet catalog  for other portlet applications  or may end the browsing process. The present invention is not limited to the extended deployment API  retrieving the selected portlet application  from the server .
