abstract: A video session management capability is disclosed. The video session management capability enables management of potential and/or established video sessions of mobile devices of a cellular sector (e.g., for supporting dynamic changes to the transmission bit rates of established video sessions in a cellular sector). In response to an indication of a condition associated with the cellular sector, a manager determines, for each of a plurality video senders of a respective plurality of uplink video sessions of the cellular sector, a modified transmission bit rate for the video sender for the uplink video session and propagates, toward the video sender, a message for instructing the video sender to use the modified transmission bit rate for its uplink video session.

No. 13\/208,465, entitled \u201cMETHOD AND APPARATUS FOR CONTROLLING WIRELESS UPLINK SESSIONS,\u201d which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.","The invention relates generally to communication networks and, more specifically but not exclusively, to management of wireless uplink sessions in wireless communication networks.","In various wireless ecosystems (e.g., Third Generation (3G) wireless networks, Fourth Generation (4G) wireless networks, and the like) many of the mobile user devices are equipped with video capture capabilities. This, coupled with the continuing increases in the use of social media sites (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, blogs, and the like), results in the potential to cause significant growth in the capture and streaming of video from mobile user devices. However, this potential is severely tempered due to bandwidth limitations on the wireless uplink from the mobile user devices to the wireless network.","Various deficiencies in the prior art are addressed by embodiments for managing video sessions within a wireless network.","In one embodiment, an apparatus includes a processor and a memory, where the processor is configured to control transmission bit rates of uplink video sessions of a cellular sector of a wireless network. The processor is configured to receive wireless uplink resource information indicative of an amount of wireless uplink resources available for supporting uplink video sessions within the cellular sector, receive uplink video session information identifying a plurality of uplink video sessions active within the cellular sector and comprising a plurality of transmission bit rates of the respective uplink video sessions active within the cellular sector, and, in response to a condition associated with the cellular sector, determine a modified transmission bit rate for one of the respective uplink video sessions active within the cellular sector using the wireless uplink resource information and the uplink video session information.","In one embodiment, a method for controlling transmission bit rates of uplink video sessions of a cellular sector of a wireless network is provided.

The video session scheduling capability enables scheduling of video transmissions by mobile devices of a cellular sector. For example, where a mobile device requests to transmit a video via a wireless uplink of the cellular sector, the video session scheduling capability determines one or more parameters associated with establishment of a video session for the mobile device (e.g., a time at which the video session may begin, a maximum transmission bit rate allocation for the video session, and the like). It is noted that the video session scheduling capability may support various other features and functions.","In at least some embodiments, the wireless uplink control capability includes a video session management capability. The video session management capability enables management of potential and\/or established video sessions of mobile devices of a cellular sector. For example, the video session management capability may support dynamic changes to the transmission bit rates of established video sessions in a cellular sector (e.g., decreasing the transmission bit rate(s) of one or more mobile device in order to accommodate a new video session requested by another mobile device, increasing the transmission bit rate(s) of one or more mobile devices where additional capacity on the wireless uplink may be used to support such a rate increase, and the like, as well as various combinations thereof). It is noted that the video session management capability may support various other features and functions.","Although primarily depicted and described herein with respect to use of various embodiments of the wireless uplink control capability within a specific type of wireless communication network, it will be appreciated that various embodiments of the wireless uplink control capability may be used within any suitable type(s) of wireless communication network(s).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"The exemplary wireless communication system  includes a plurality of mobile devices (MDs) -(collectively, MDs ), a Radio Access Network (RAN) , a Wireless Packet Network (WPN) , a Packet Network (PN) , a plurality of servers -(collectively, servers ), a Management System , and a Wireless Uplink Controller .","The MDs  are mobile devices configured for communicating with RAN  wirelessly. The MDs  may provide control information and content via a wireless uplink to RAN  and may receive control information and content via a wireless downlink from RAN .","The MDs  are configured to operate as sources of content streams to be propagated via a wireless uplink to the RAN  (denoted herein as wireless uplink content streams). In general, a wireless uplink content stream may be a video stream (without audio), a multimedia stream (e.g., video and one or more other types of content, such as audio, text, and so forth), and the like. In this sense, wireless uplink content streams also may be referred to herein as wireless uplink video streams where the content streams at least include a video portion (and, as noted above, also may include one or more other types of content).","The MDs  are configured to negotiate for scheduling of uplink video sessions via which the MDs  may propagate video content via a wireless uplink to RAN . For example, the MDs  are configured to send uplink video session scheduling requests for requesting scheduling of uplink video sessions. Similarly, the MDs  also are configured to receive uplink video session scheduling responses in response to the uplink video session scheduling requests, where the uplink video session scheduling responses include uplink video session scheduling information configured for use by the MDs in establishing uplink video sessions for propagation of video content via the wireless uplink (e.g., a time at which the video session may begin, a maximum transmission bit rate allocation for the video session).","The MDs  are configured to capture content and stream captured content via the wireless uplink to RAN .","The MDs  are configured to support video content capture and streaming mechanisms. For example, an MD  may support standard definition and\/or high definition video recording. For example, an MD  may include one or more video cameras (e.g., a front-facing camera at lower resolution to support video chatting, a rear-facing camera at higher resolution for other videos, and the like, as well as various combinations thereof). For example, an MD  may include one or more different video codecs (e.g., H.263, H.264 Advanced Video Coding (AVC) (Motion Picture Experts Group (MPEG)-4\u2014Part 10), H.264 AVC\u2014Scalable Video Coding (SVC), Google VP8, and the like, as well as various combinations thereof). In one embodiment, an MD  is configured to support adaptive bit rate encoding\/streaming, which provides variable bit rate encoding\/streaming in real or near real time dependent on the bandwidth and\/or processor capacity of the MD  (e.g., where MD  is configured to support multiple encoding bit rates and encode at requested ones of the supported encoding bit rates based on information such as radio conditions, end-to-end conditions, and the like). For example, an MD  may support various protocols associated with streaming of video (e.g., Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP)\/Real-Time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP) as defined in RFC 3550, Extended RTP Profile for RTCP-Based Feedback denoted as RTP Audio-Visual Profile with Feedback (RTP\/AVPF) as defined in RFC 4585, Codec Control Messages in the RTP AVPF as defined in RFC 5104, Reduced-Size RTCP as defined in RFC 5506, and the like). The MD s may support various other video capture and\/or video streaming capabilities. The MDs  also may be referred to herein as video senders supporting video capture and streaming capabilities.","The MDs  may be configured to support audio content capture and streaming mechanisms. For example, an MD  may include one or more microphones (e.g., for use in video chat, for use in narration of videos, and the like). For example, an MD  may include one or more audio codecs (e.g., AAC (MPEG-4 Part 3), Adaptive Multi-Rate (AMR), Moving Picture Experts Group Layer-3 (MP3), and the like, as well as various combinations thereof).","The MDs  may be configured to support various other functions associated with propagation of video content (e.g., sending of video session quality statistics associated with video sessions, receiving and processing of video session management information, and the like, as well as various combinations thereof).","In one embodiment, the MDs  may include various feature sets for content capture, which may be supported by various associated Software Development Kit (SDK) Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).","In at least some embodiments, at least a portion of the MDs  also may be configured to operate as receivers of content streams provided from other devices. In this sense, an MD  may be a content sender and, optionally, also may be a content receiver. Additionally, it is noted that, in at least some embodiments, one or more of the content receivers of a wireless uplink content stream provided by one of the MDs  may be any type of device(s) which may connect to PN  (e.g., mobile devices, stationary devices, and the like, as well as various combinations thereof).","For example, MDs  may be smart phones, tablet computers, laptop computers, or any other types of devices capable of capturing video and propagating the captured video via a wireless uplink of a wireless network.","The RAN  may be any suitable type of radio access network, which may be implemented differently for different types of wireless technologies. The RAN  provides an interface between MDs  and WPN . The RAN  includes a base station (BS)  supporting an associated cellular sector , where MDs  that are located within the cellular sector  are able to access RAN  via the BS  of RAN . In general, an MD  communicates with BS  via a wireless communication link which, as noted above, generally includes an uplink portion via which the MD  transmits information to BS  and a downlink portion via which the BS  transmits information to the MD . Although depicted and described herein as including a single base station (for purposes of clarity), it will be appreciated that RAN  may include any suitable number of base stations supporting any suitable number of associated cellular sectors.","The WPN  may be any suitable type of wireless packet network which, similar to RAN , may be implemented differently for different types of wireless technologies. The WPN  provides an interface between RAN  and PN . For example, in a Third Generation UMTS network, WPN  may include elements such as Serving General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) Support Nodes (SGSNs), Gateway GPRS Support Nodes (GGSNs), and the like. For example, in a Long Term Evolution (LTE) network, WPN  may include elements such as Serving Gateways (SGWs), Packet Data Network (PDN) Gateways (PGWs), Mobility Management Entities (MMEs), a Policy and Charging Rules Function (PCRF), and the like.","The PN  may be any suitable type of packet network, such as a public packet network (e.g., the Internet), a private packet network, and the like. The PN  may include and\/or provide communication to a number of network elements configured for providing various functions of the wireless uplink control capability. In one embodiment, for example, PN  supports communications for servers , Management System , and Wireless Uplink Controller .","The servers  may be any suitable types of servers, such as Web Servers (WSs), Application Servers (ASs), and the like. The servers  may include any servers which may be accessed by MDs , including servers which may be accessed unrelated to videos being provided by MDs , servers which may be accessed within the context of videos being provided by MDs  (e.g., servers hosting social networking sites and\/or other types of sites to which MDs  may provide streaming video), and the like, as well as various combinations thereof.","The Management System  may be any suitable type of management system, providing various management functions for one or more of RAN , WPN , and PN . In one embodiment, for example, Management System  may provide one or more of network and\/or service provisioning functions, network monitoring functions, and the like, as well as various combinations thereof. In one embodiment, Management System  is configured to support and\/or provide one or more functions of the wireless uplink control capability.","The Wireless Uplink Controller  is configured to provide various functions of the wireless uplink control capability. In one embodiment, Wireless Uplink Controller includes a Scheduler  configured to provide various functions of the video session scheduling capability. In one embodiment, Wireless Uplink Controller includes a Manager  configured to provide various functions of the video session management capability. It is noted that, in at least some embodiments, Scheduler  and Manager  may cooperate to provide various functions of the wireless uplink control capability. The operation of Wireless Uplink Controller  may be better understood by first considering various aspects of a wireless ecosystem such as exemplary wireless communication network  of  and various elements involved in the process of creating and delivering video in a wireless ecosystem such as exemplary wireless communication network  of .","In general, a number of elements and\/or capabilities may be involved in the process of creating and delivering video in a wireless ecosystem such as exemplary wireless communication network  of . For example, such elements and\/or capabilities may include, but are not limited to, one or more of: (1) wireless access network capabilities (e.g., bandwidth, quality of service (QoS), call admission control (CAC), and the like), (2) applications (e.g., e.g., video chat, live video for broadcast, upload live or in background to a web portal, and the like) and protocols (e.g., Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP)\/Real-Time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP), Adaptive Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), and the like), (3) codecs and associated encapsulation\/decapsulation capabilities (e.g. H.263, H.264\/AVC, SVC, VP8*, Microsoft IIS Smooth Streaming, Hypertext Markup Language 5 (HTML5), and the like), and (4) mobile device capabilities (e.g., numbers and types of cameras, camera resolution, encoding capabilities, processing power, and the like). Additional descriptions of such capabilities are provided herein.","In general, exemplary wireless communication network  of  provides a generic architecture for a wireless access network. In at least some embodiments, the following assumptions may be made for exemplary wireless communication network  of : (1) end-to-end support for Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) and\/or version 6 (IPv6) is available; (2) treatment of flows at different QoS levels is supported or at least available; (3) a bottleneck may occur at the wireless link (while wireless link bandwidth varies across technologies and generally tends to improve with each generation, the bandwidth requirement for video is quite significant, over 8 Mbps for high definition (HD) video, and thus may continue to present an issue for quite some time); (4) the architecture, in many ways, may be bound by conformance to standards which are more or less closed from the MDs  to the gateway on the edge of WPN  (e.g., a GGSN, PGW, or other similar gateway between WPN  and PN ); and (5) call admission control (CAC) is supported such that a service is admitted if the system decides that adequate resources are available to accommodate the end-to-end flows produced by the service (it is noted that this is typically applied to guaranteed bit rate (GBR) services, as opposed to best effort (BE) services); and (6) information from RAN , WPN , and\/or PN  may be leveraged in order to make intelligent decisions at the application level. It is noted that one or more of these assumptions may be modified or eliminated as needed and\/or desired. It is further noted that various other assumptions may be relied upon in providing various embodiments of the wireless uplink control capability.","In exemplary wireless communication network  of , there are many scenarios in which video may be transmitted over a wireless uplink from a MD  to RAN .","A first example of such a scenario is video chat, which may include a bidirectional video session with a one-to-one relationship, a one-to-many relationship, or even a many-to-many relationship for video conferences. For example, some video chat applications include iPhone FaceTime, Qik Chat, and the like.","A second example of such a scenario is video sharing (which may be considered to be a variation of video chat), in which a unidirectional video session accompanies an audio call (e.g., in this case, the video sender is perhaps describing a scene and the video does not need to be synchronized with the voice).","A third example of such a scenario is video broadcast, which provides a unidirectional, one-to-many distribution of video. In one embodiment, the video is streamed from the MD  to a central server that receives the video from the MD  and then transmits the video via one or more other transmission mediums. As an example, a news reporter may record video via an MD  (and stream the video from the MD  to a central server of a control room of the broadcaster (e.g., using a video camera that is equipped with cellular communication capabilities and\/or other suitable capabilities), such that the central server can modify the video as needed (e.g., with banners, logos, and the like) and then broadcast it in the usual manner to viewers. In this example, it is noted that the MD  can replace the expensive and cumbersome satellite truck that would otherwise be required in order for the reporter to provide such a report. It is noted that this is merely one example of use of the video broadcast scenario, and that video broadcast may be used in various other ways and for various other purposes.","A fourth example of such a scenario is video multicast, which provides a unidirectional one-to-many distribution of video which is sent directly to viewers as a multicast stream and\/or multiple unicast streams. In general, some types of applications that may utilize this type of service may include emergency services (e.g., providing video feeds from the scene of an accident to emergency management personnel, doctors at nearby hospitals, and the like), resort area broadcasts for live consumption, reality television from remote locations, and the like.","A fifth example of such a scenario is video-to-cloud, in which video is streamed from an MD  to a network destination (e.g., a website or other location in the cloud) so that the video can be viewed from the network destination in real time as it arrives and\/or later if it is archived. In one embodiment, potential viewers of the video may be notified of the availability of the video (e.g., an indication that a \u201clive\u201d video is in progress and\/or will be available in the future). In one embodiment, potential viewers of the video may be notified of the availability of the video in any suitable manner (e.g., via a Short Message Service (SMS) message, email, and the like). In one embodiment, notifications to potential viewers regarding availability of a video include an indication as to the manner in which the potential viewers may access the video (e.g., using a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) or any other suitable mechanism). For example, some video-to-cloud applications include Qik, Knocking Live, and YouTube.","It is noted that the foregoing scenarios are exemplary and that various other scenarios may utilize streaming of video via the wireless uplink between MDs  and RAN .","In general, each of the exemplary video transmission scenarios may have an associated set of recommendations or requirements for its sufficient or optimal utility. For example, such recommendations or requirements may include one or more of video quality, video delivery mode, video application priority, video application protocol, and the like, as well as various combinations thereof. In general, video quality corresponds to a combination of the spatial, temporal, and\/or quantization parameters that constitute the quality of the video that is viewed (which ultimately translates into the transmission bit rate of the video and\/or bandwidth required to support the video). In general, video delivery mode corresponds to the timing of the start of the video. In one embodiment, three video delivery modes are supported as follows: (1) real-time (RT), a live streaming service, which indicates that delivery of the video will be in real-time (e.g., start of delivery of the video is to begin immediately or nearly immediately); (2) near real-time (NRT), also a live streaming service, which indicates that start of delivery of the video can be delayed; and (3) background (BG), which indicates background delivery of video (e.g., such as a file transfer or other type of video in which delivery may be delayed for any suitable length of time). In general, video application priority of a video application corresponds to priority of that video application, relative to other video applications, to provide a relatively high quality of experience (QoE). In general, the video application protocol of a video application corresponds to a class of protocol used to enable the video application (e.g., where streaming video may utilize RTP or HTTP, where as background video may utilize a File Transfer Protocol (FTP) service. It is noted that other recommendations and\/or requirements may be supported within this context.","In many video applications, there are three functions typically involved in establishing and maintaining a connection for supporting streaming of video, including (1) a mechanism to create a connection, which may include a mechanism to allow video senders to notify video receivers that a video is available, and to allow the video receivers to be able to accept invitations from video senders; (2) call admission control (CAC) functions; and (3) providing QoS treatment for video packets transporting video from video senders to video receivers. These functions are described in additional detail below. It is noted that, once video applications begin taking advantage of CAC and differentiated QoS from the Network Service Provider (NSP), over-the-top (OTT) applications will be at a disadvantage, especially at times of congestion, since they will only receive Best Effort (BE) service.","In general, for at least some video applications, a video session is created to support transmission of video within the context of the video application. For video chat applications, for example, the video session creation mechanism may be similar to establishment of a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) call, of which many variations are possible. For example, some video applications (e.g., Skype and others) have proprietary implementations, whereas other video applications (e.g., Apple's FaceTime and others) have implementations based on standards (e.g., standards such as H.264, Advanced Audio Coding (AAC), Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), RTP, Secure Real-Time Transport Protocol (SRTP), and the like). For example, assuming use of a standards-based approach such as that used by Apple FaceTime, a basic message flow to establish a video session may include the following steps: (1) an initiating client initiates, with a known server (e.g., in this example, an Apple server in the network), a request to establish a video connection, where the request may be in the form of a SIP invite; (2) the SIP invite is provided from the initiating client to a viewing client (where an assumption is made that all parties have already registered); (3) following receipt of a SIP OK message from the viewing client, messaging is exchanged to negotiate audio\/video parameters for the video connection; and (4) following establishment of the video session, video\/audio are exchanged between the two participants over RTP (where it is noted that the server is not necessarily in the video\/audio path). It is noted that this general message flow is merely exemplary. The use of this general process, as well as variations of this general process, may be better understood by way of reference to descriptions of treatment of this process by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standards. It is further noted that any other suitable process may be used to establish a video session for a video application (e.g., different variations of this process may be used for other video chat applications as well as for other types of video applications, other types of processes may be used, and the like, as well as various combinations thereof).","In general, for at least some video applications, unidirectional video sessions may be established to support transmission of video within the context of the video applications, and the unidirectional video sessions can differ depending upon the type(s) of application(s) being supported. This is described below with respect to some exemplary video applications which use unidirectional video sessions.","For video share applications, for example, establishment of the unidirectional video session may be performed in a manner similar to that of video chat applications; however, in video share applications the video may lag behind the voice and, thus, the QoS requirements for video transport in video share applications are generally less stringent than for video chat applications.","For video broadcast for broadcast television applications, for example, implementations to establish and maintain a unidirectional video session may be proprietary to suit the specific application. In many cases, low latency delivery of video is critical (e.g., where the audio exchange between the news anchor and reporter must match what is being viewed). As such, in many cases, video may be streamed using the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) rather than the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection as there is no point in trying to retrieve lost video frames.","For video multicast\/broadcast for enterprise applications, for example, in which there is not necessarily an application in the architecture which can facilitate delivery of video, infrastructure within the NSP network may be used to enable an IP multicast\/broadcast to potential viewers. This scenario may have different latency requirements for different types of such applications (e.g., where low latency streaming is required for emergency services applications, whereas \u201cresort\u201d type applications may be able to tolerate delays in the actual start of the video streaming).","For video-to-cloud for consumer sites applications, for example, the video may or may not need to be viewed live, depending on the specific application. In this case, if the video is not time-sensitive, then tens of seconds of delay, minutes of delay, or even longer, may be acceptable. In many cases, the sites may advertise the video feeds as being live and, thus, the associated video applications are generally designed to provide the best possible service given the available bandwidth. As a result, many such applications employ techniques similar to those of the broadcast television model, albeit at a lower quality level requiring less bandwidth.","In general, various other types of video sessions may be established for these and\/or other types of video applications. As described herein, such video sessions may be supported via a wireless uplink of a wireless network and, thus, also may be referred to herein as uplink video sessions. As further described herein, such uplink video sessions may be controlled using various embodiments of the wireless uplink control capability.","As described above, Wireless Uplink Controller  is configured to provide various functions of the wireless uplink control capability. In one embodiment, a video session scheduling capability is provided for scheduling of video transmissions by mobile devices of a cellular sector (e.g., scheduling one or more parameters associated with video transmissions by mobile devices via a wireless uplink of the cellular sector, such as the times at which the mobile devices may begin video transmissions via the wireless uplink, the transmission bit rate allocations for video transmissions via the wireless uplink, and the like). The video session scheduling capability, by enabling video applications of mobile devices of a cellular sector to reserve\/secure adequate bandwidth on the wireless uplink, improves the reliability of video applications sending video via the wireless uplink of the cellular sector. In one embodiment, various functions of the video session scheduling capability are provided by the Scheduler  depicted and described with respect to .","The Scheduler  may utilize various functions of one or more of the components of exemplary communication system  as depicted and described herein. For example, Scheduler  may receive uplink resource information from a management system (e.g., Management System  and\/or any other suitable source of such information). For example, Scheduler  may receive uplink video session requests from MDs . For example, Scheduler  may receive mobile device location information from RAN  and\/or WPN , such that Scheduler  is able to determine, for each MD , the cellular sector to which the MD  is connected (illustratively, cellular sector  for MDs -). For example, Scheduler  may communicate with a Call Admission Control (CAC) function configured to determine whether a request for resources can be met. For example, Scheduler  may receive, from RAN  and\/or WPN , triggers indicative of presence of resource congestion and, similarly, easing of resource congestion. In one embodiment, such triggers may be provided in the form of Explicit Congestion Notifications (ECNs) from RAN  and\/or WPN . The Scheduler  may utilize various other functions of one or more of the components of exemplary communication system .","The Scheduler  is configured to manage scheduling of uplink video sessions for the cellular sector .","The Scheduler  is configured to receive requests for uplink video sessions of MDs  of cellular sector , receive information for use in scheduling uplink video sessions supported via the wireless uplink in the cellular sector , determine scheduling of uplink video sessions via the wireless uplink in the cellular sector  based on the received information for use in scheduling uplink video sessions supported via the wireless uplink in the cellular sector , and provide uplink video session responses in response to the uplink video session requests of MDs  of cellular sector .","The Scheduler  receives requests for uplink video sessions of MDs  of cellular sector . In general, a request by an MD  for an uplink video session includes information associated with the uplink video session request (e.g., a requested transmission bit rate for the uplink video session, an indication of a delivery mode associated with the uplink video session, a type of application with which the uplink video session is associated, and the like, as well as various combinations thereof): The Scheduler  may receive the request for uplink video sessions from the MDs  and\/or may receive the requests for uplink video sessions from one or more CAC functions of the network (e.g., which may operate to receive uplink video session requests of MDs  and route them to Scheduler  and\/or receive uplink video session requests of MDs  and send appropriate corresponding uplink video session requests to Scheduler  on behalf of the MDs ). In any event, Scheduler  receives indications of uplink video sessions requested by MDs  of the cellular sector .","The Scheduler  receives information for use in scheduling uplink video sessions to be supported via the wireless uplink in the cellular sector , which may include uplink resource information indicative of an amount of wireless uplink resources available for supporting uplink video sessions within the cellular sector , video session request information associated with requests by MDs  for uplink video sessions, MD status information of MDs , cellular sector status information of cellular sector , network status information (e.g., of one or more of RAN , WPN , PN , and the like), service provider policies, and the like, as well as various combinations thereof.","The Scheduler  receives information indicative of an amount of wireless uplink resources (also denoted herein as a budget of wireless uplink resources) allocated within the cellular sector  for supporting uplink video sessions within the cellular sector . The information may be represented using one or more of a current resource allocation of cellular sector , a maximum resource allocation of cellular sector , an available resources parameter of cellular sector , and the like, as well as various combinations thereof.","The resources of the cellular sector  may be any suitable resources of a cellular sector in a cellular network. In one embodiment, for example, the resources of the cellular sector  are Physical Resource Blocks (PRBs) on the air interface supported by the BS  of the cellular sector  (in which case the budget of resources is denoted as PRB_ALLOCATION). In general, a certain number of PRBs are available within each time slice within the cellular sector  during which wireless uplink transmissions from the MDs  may take place. The use of PRBs, or any similar types of resources, as a basis for scheduling of uplink video sessions is advantageous because, for each MD , the number of PRBs allocated to the MD  translates into the total transmission bit rate for the MD . This is primarily due to the fact that different MDs  may have different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) with the BS , which translate into the Modulation and Coding Schemes (MCSs) that the respective MDs  employ, which in turn determines how many bits of information may be transmitted by the respective MDs  in a single PRB (e.g., in general, MDs  located closer to BS  will be able to transmit more bits within a given PRB than MDs  located farther from BS ).","The budget of wireless uplink resources of the cellular sector  may be received from any suitable source of such information. In one embodiment, for example, the budget of wireless uplink resources of the cellular sector  may be received from Management System  (e.g., from an OAM system or any other suitable type of system).","The Scheduler  receives video session request information associated with a request by an MD  to establish an uplink video session for transmission of video content from the MD  via a wireless uplink in the cellular sector . The video session request information may be received as part of the uplink video session request and\/or obtained in response to receiving the uplink video session request. The video session request information may include one or more of transmission bit rate request information (e.g., a requested transmission bit rate requested by the MD , a minimum transmission bit rate acceptable to the MD , and the like), a type of video stream to be provided via the uplink video session, a delivery mode for the uplink video session (e.g., RT, NRT, or BG), a timeout delay value indicative of a maximum time for which start of the uplink video session may be delayed, information associated with a Service Level Agreement (SLA) of a user of the MD , device capability information associated with the MD , a list of one or more intended video receivers for the uplink video session, device capability information associated with one or more intended video receivers for the uplink video session, one or more negotiability parameters indicative of extent of negotiability of one or more of the types of information associated with the request by the MD  to establish the uplink video session, and the like, as well as various combinations thereof.","The Scheduler  may receive additional types of information which may be used to determine scheduling of the uplink video session via the wireless uplink in the cellular sector .","In one embodiment, for example, the Scheduler  may receive MD status information of MDs  (e.g., information indicative of the conditions of the signal strength and\/or MCSs of the MDs , information indicative of the battery power status of the MDs , and the like) for use in scheduling uplink video sessions to be supported via the wireless uplink in cellular sector . In one embodiment, for example, the Scheduler  is configured to weight MDs  by coupling the bandwidth requirements of the MDs  (driven by the desired quality of the video) with the MCSs of the MDs  (which dictates the efficiency with which the respective MDs  can transmit data over the wireless uplink). In some instances, the Scheduler  gives precedence to MDs  with high video quality requirements that have excellent signal strength. In some instances, the Scheduler  gives precedence to MDs  with low video quality requirements that have less than optimal signal strength.","In one embodiment, for example, the Scheduler  may receive cellular sector status information of cellular sector  (e.g., cell loading of the cellular sector , ECNs received from data paths associated with cellular sector , and the like) for use in scheduling uplink video sessions to be supported via the wireless uplink in cellular sector .","In one embodiment, for example, the Scheduler  may receive network status information of one or more portions of RAN , WPN , and\/or PN  (e.g., loading of the network portions, ECNs received from data paths associated with the network portions, and the like) for use in scheduling uplink video sessions to be supported via the wireless uplink in cellular sector .","In one embodiment, for example, the Scheduler  may receive service provider policies of the service provider for use in scheduling uplink video sessions to be supported via the wireless uplink in cellular sector .","The Scheduler  may receive any other suitable types of information which may be used in scheduling uplink video sessions to be supported via the wireless uplink in cellular sector .","The Scheduler  determines scheduling of uplink video sessions via the wireless uplink in cellular sector  based on received information for use in scheduling uplink video sessions supported via the wireless uplink in the cellular sector .","In one embodiment, the Scheduler  determines scheduling of the uplink video session via the wireless uplink in the cellular sector  by determining a time at which the uplink video session may begin and determining a bit rate allocation for the uplink video session.","In one embodiment, the Scheduler  determines scheduling of the uplink video session via the wireless uplink in the cellular sector  based on uplink resource information indicative of an amount of wireless uplink resources available within the cellular sector  and video session request information associated with the uplink video session request (and, optionally, also based on one or more other types of information that may be considered when determining scheduling of the uplink video session via the wireless uplink in the cellular sector ).","In one embodiment, the Scheduler  is configured to determine scheduling of uplink video sessions based, at least in part, on the delivery mode of the uplink video sessions being scheduled (e.g., where the delivery mode of the uplink video session may be used to determine the time at which the video session may begin). In one embodiment, as noted hereinabove, three possible delivery modes for video sessions include: (1) RT, which indicates live video having strict latency and delay requirements, but for which bandwidth usage can be variable; (2) NRT, which indicates video that is buffered locally for RT delivery (e.g., within a relatively short period of time, which may vary based on the type of video, the buffering capabilities of the MD , and the like), which allows for less strict latency and delay constraints and, thus, greater flexibility for delivery; and (3) BG, which indicates that the video may be provided at any time.","Within the context of delivery mode, it is noted that the Scheduler  may be configured to account for the delivery mode as determined based on the type of application and, optionally, the delivery mode as requested by the MD  (where the MD  may request a delivery mode for a video session that, although desired, is not necessary for the type of application of the requested video session).","As described hereinabove, a video session may or may not require RT treatment. For example, a \u201cvideo chat\u201d application (e.g., one-to-one or conference call) has a delivery mode of RT. For example, in a video share application, while the voice may be RT, the video does not necessarily need to be synchronized with the voice conversation and, thus, may have an associated delivery mode of NRT. For example, if the video session is a one-to-many scenario with no interaction, depending upon the urgency of the video, the video may be transmitted using an NRT delivery mode after any suitable delay. For example, various other video applications may deem it acceptable to transmit video in the background (e.g., for providing the video to a website, for providing off-peak distribution of the video, and the like). In at least one embodiment, Scheduler  is configured to use the requirements of the delivery mode for the video session for determining scheduling of the video session request.","Additionally, as noted above, it is possible that the MD  may request a delivery mode that is not necessary for the type of application of the requested video session (e.g., where the MD  requests RT treatment of video from a video share application which could be streamed without synchronization with the voice conversation, where the MD  requests NRT treatment of a video session that could be handled using the BG delivery mode, and the like). In at least one embodiment, Scheduler  is configured to use the delivery mode requested by the MD  for the video session for determining scheduling of the video session request.","Thus, with such an understanding of the different properties of such delivery modes, video sessions can be scheduled more intelligently without impacting the perceived QoE of the users.","The Scheduler  maintains a set of queues for managing the uplink video session requests of the cellular sector . In one such embodiment, the set of queues for a cellular sector includes a NRT queue used for queuing NRT uplink video session requests of MDs  of the cellular sector  and a BG queue used for queuing BG uplink video session requests of MDs  of the cellular sector . It is noted that, where other types of delivery modes are supported, Scheduler  may be configured to support the appropriate types of queues for the delivery modes.","In one embodiment, Scheduler  is configured to use various processes to determine scheduling of an uplink video session via the wireless uplink in the cellular sector . The processes include a VideoSessionRequest process, a VideoSessionEnded process, a VideoSessionChanged process, a SystemResourceChange process, an nrtTimeout process, an nrtExitFromSector process, an increaseSectorVideos process, an insertSessionRequest process, and a reduceSectorVideos process. For purposes of clarity in describing such processes, the processes are primarily described within the context of an embodiment in which Scheduler  receives uplink resource information indicative of an amount of wireless uplink resources available for supporting uplink video sessions within the cellular sector , receives video session request information associated with a request by a MD  to establish an uplink video session for transmission of video content from the MD  via the wireless uplink in the cellular sector  (e.g., including requested transmission bit rate and associated delivery mode), and determines, using the uplink resource information indicative of an amount of wireless uplink resources available within the cellular sector  and the video session request information associated with the uplink video session request, scheduling of the uplink video session via the wireless uplink in the cellular sector . It is noted that, although largely omitted from the description of the processes for purposes of clarity, the Scheduler  also may receive one or more additional types of information which may be used to determine scheduling of the video session via the wireless uplink in the cellular sector  within the context of these processes.","In one embodiment, Scheduler  is configured to operate on the following events as they arrive:","(1) Video Session Request:","In one embodiment, Scheduler  is configured to execute the VideoSessionRequest process when a MD  sends a video session request to the Scheduler  to reserve resources for a video session. The video session request includes video session request information configured for use by the Scheduler  in determining scheduling of the video session within the cellular sector with which the MD  is associated. For example, the video session request information may include one or more of a transmission bit rate request of the MD  (denoted as TxMAX), a minimum transmission bit rate acceptable to the MD  (denoted as TxMIN), the intended video receiver(s) for the video session, the delivery mode for the video session (e.g., RT, NRT, BG), a timeout delay indicative of the maximum time for which start of the video session may be delayed (denoted as DELAY), and the like, as well as various combinations thereof. For example, the video session request information also may include a negotiability parameter(s) indicative of the extent of negotiability of one or more of the other parameters, where any suitable numbers and types of negotiability parameter values may be supported (e.g., HARD (which indicates non-negotiability of the associated parameter(s)) and SOFT (which indicates that the parameter(s) is negotiable and, optionally, the extent of negotiability of the parameter(s)).","If the delivery mode of the video session request is RT, the Scheduler  negotiates a current bit rate (denoted as TxCBR), such that the following two conditions are satisfied: (1) CURRENT_PRB_ALLOCATION+TxCBR<PRB_ALLOCATION and (2) TxMAX\u2266TxCBR\u2267TxMIN. In this case, if the Scheduler  determines that the cellular sector has enough resources for the requested video session, the Scheduler : (1) adds TxCBRto the current PRB allocation as follows:","CURRENT_PRB_ALLOCATION=CURRENT_PRB_ALLOCATION+TxCBR; and (2) responds to the MD  with the value of TxCBR, such that the MD  may commence the video session immediately. In this case, if the Scheduler  determines that the cellular sector does not have enough resources for the requested video session and the RT mode is not indicated as being a SOFT constraint, Scheduler  executes the reduceSectorVideos process in order to try to make room for the requested video session by reducing other active sessions (and, if successful, (a) adds TxCBRto the current PRB allocation as follows:\n\nCURRENT_PRB_ALLOCATION=CURRENT_PRB_ALLOCATION+TxCBR; and (b) responds to the MD  with the value of TxCBR, such that the MD  may commence the video session immediately). In this case, if the Scheduler  determines that the cellular sector does not have enough resources for the requested video session and the RT mode is indicated as being a SOFT constraint, Scheduler  executes the insertSessionRequest process in order to insert the video session request into the NRT queue for the cellular sector, otherwise the video session request cannot be satisfied.\n","If the delivery mode of the video session request is NRT or BG, the Scheduler  determines whether it is possible to satisfy the requirements of the video session request immediately (e.g., by determining whether the following condition is satisfied: CURRENT_PRB_ALLOCATION TxMIN<PRB_ALLOCATION). In this case, if it is possible to satisfy the requirements of the video session request immediately, Scheduler  re-executes the VideoSessionRequest process for the video session request while treating the video session request as having a delivery mode of RT. In this case, if it is not possible to satisfy the requirements of the video session request immediately, the Scheduler  executes the insertSessionRequest process in order to insert the video session request into the NRT queue or the BG queue of the cellular sector  as appropriate.","(2) Video Session Ended:","In one embodiment, Scheduler  is configured to execute the VideoSessionEnded process when a video session has ended or moved from the cellular sector  to a new cellular sector, thereby freeing up resources of the cellular sector  to support other video sessions. The Scheduler  updates the current allocation of PRBs within the cellular sector  by subtracting, from the current allocation of PRBs within the cellular sector , the amount of PRBs (TxCBR) corresponding to the transmission bit rate (TXCBR) that was allocated to the terminated video session, as follows: CURRENT_PRB_ALLOCATION=CURRENT_PRB_ALLOCATION\u2212TxCBR. The Scheduler  executes the increaseSectorVideos process in order to reallocate available resources of the cellular sector  to other video sessions.","(3) Video Session Changed:","In one embodiment, Scheduler  is configured to execute the VideoSessionChanged process when a video session has reduced its allocation of PRBs within the cellular sector  (e.g., its value of TxCBRor TxMAX), thereby freeing up resources of the cellular sector  to support other video sessions. The Scheduler  updates the current allocation of PRBs within the cellular sector  by subtracting, from the current allocation of PRBs within the cellular sector , the amount of bit rate released from the modified video session, as follows:","CURRENT_PRB_ALLOCATION=CURRENT_PRB_ALLOCATION\u2212(TxCBR\u2212TxCBR). The Scheduler  then executes the increaseSectorVideos process in order to reallocate available resources of the cellular sector to other video sessions.","(4) System Resource Changed:","In one embodiment, Scheduler  is configured to execute the SystemResourceChange process at a specific time or when an associated timer expires. This may be used, for example, where it is necessary or desirable to initiate a resource change at a certain time. For example, the Scheduler  may be configured to initiate an increase of system resources at a specific time (e.g., at 5:00 PM in order to ensure adequate wireless uplink resources for a premium user such as a network news anchor providing a report via transmission of video via a wireless uplink). For example, the Scheduler  may be configured to initiate a decrease of system resources following expiration of a timer. The Scheduler  may use the SystemResourceChange process to change the available wireless uplink in various other ways.","In one embodiment, Scheduler  is configured to execute the SystemResourceChange process in response to an indication of a change in the available resources of the cellular sector .","In one embodiment, in response to an indication of a reduction in the maximum available resources of the cellular sector  (i.e., a decrease in the PRB_ALLOCATION value), Scheduler  executes the reduceSectorVideos process. In one embodiment, Scheduler  executes the reduceSectorVideos process at a specific time or when an associated timer expires. It is noted that this change may be due to any number of events or conditions, such as due to a change in the load on the cellular sector  or a change in the resource budget of the cellular sector . It is further noted that the specific time may be any suitable time and, similarly, that the timer may be set to any suitable value equal to or greater than zero (where zero would indicate that the reduceSectorVideos process would be executed immediately). The Scheduler  then sets the cellSector_State parameter to REFUSE, in order to refuse any new video session within the cellular sector  until the current allocation of resources in the cellular sector  drops below the new maximum available resources of the cellular sector  (i.e., until CURRENT_PRB_ALLOCATION\u2266PRB_ALLOCATION_new).","In one embodiment, in response to receiving an Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) message, Scheduler  sets the cellSector_State parameter to REFUSE, in order to refuse any new video session within the cellular sector  until the current allocation of resources in the cellular sector  drops below the new maximum available resources of the cellular sector  (i.e., until CURRENT_PRB_ALLOCATION\u2266PRB_ALLOCATION_new).","In one embodiment, in response to an indication of an increase in the maximum available resources of the cellular sector (e.g., PRB_ALLOCATION value has decreased), Scheduler  executes the increaseSectorVideos process in order to reallocate available resources of the cellular sector  to other video sessions.","(5) NRT Session Timeout:","In one embodiment, Scheduler  is configured to execute the nrtTimeout process when a video session request in the NRT queue of the cellular sector  has timed out. The timeout may occur for any of a number of reasons, such as where the video session took too long to start or the video recording has ceased. The Scheduler  notifies the associated MD , which may or may not respond with a request to reset the timeout timer. If the MD  responds with a request to reset the timeout timer for the video session, the Scheduler  leaves the video session request in the NRT queue of the cellular sector . If the MD  responds with a request to modify the delivery mode of the video session from NRT to BG, the Scheduler  inserts the video session request into the BG queue of the cellular sector .","(6) NRT Exit From Cellular Sector:","In one embodiment, Scheduler  is configured to execute the nrtExitFromSector process when a MD , which has a video session request currently pending in the NRT queue of cellular sector , moves to a new cellular sector. In this embodiment, the Scheduler  executes the insertSessionRequest(newSectorID) process in order to insert the video session request into the NRT queue of the new cellular sector serving the MD .","In one embodiment, Scheduler  utilizes a number of associated processes when handling such events as described above. In one embodiment, the Scheduler  is configured to execute one or more of the following processes in order to operate on events as they arrive (where use of such events is referenced hereinabove within the context of the descriptions of those events). The processes include the increaseSectorVideos process, the insertSessionRequest process, and the red uceSectorVideos process, descriptions of which follow.","(1) Increase Sector Videos Process:","In one embodiment, Scheduler  is configured to execute the increaseSectorVideos process in order to submit one or more video session requests to the videoSessionRequest process until no additional video sessions can be accommodated within the cellular sector  without exceeding the budget of resources allocated to the cellular sector  (i.e., without exceeding the PRB_ALLOCATED value). The Scheduler  may submit the video session request(s) to the videoSessionRequest process in any suitable order (e.g., always selecting the highest priority video session request that can be accommodated as an RT session within the cellular sector , randomly selecting from among video session requests that can be accommodated as RT sessions within the cellular sector , and the like).","In one embodiment, Scheduler  is configured to execute the increaseSectorVideos process in order to increase the transmission bit rates (TxCBR) of existing video sessions of the cellular sector  when the NRT queue of the cellular sector  is empty, such that (1) for each active video session, TXCBR\u2266TxMAX and (2)","CURRRENT_PRB_ALLOCATION\u2266PRB_ALLOCATION.

For example, the video sender may be granted a Guaranteed Bit Rate (GBR) and a Maximum Bit Rate (MBR) for the video session, where MBR>GBR, based on the requirements of the video sender. The Manager  receives information associated with the video session, e.g., identification of the video sender and the video receiver(s), the location of the video sender in terms of the serving base station of the video sender (which also identifies the cellular sector of the video sender), the parameters allocated for the video session (e.g., GBR, MBR, so forth), and the like, as well as various combinations thereof. The Manager  may receive information associated with a video session in any suitable manner. In one embodiment, for example, Manager  may be made aware of the video session, including identification of the video sender and the video receiver(s), using Representational State Transfer (REST)-based API web services.","The Manager  receives, for each uplink video session of the cellular sector  (and, optionally, for other cellular sectors for which the Manager  provides management functions, which have been omitted for purposes of clarity), RTCP messages generated during the uplink video session. The RTCP messages for an uplink video session may include one or more of (1) RTCP messages including Receiver Reports (RRs) and\/or Sender Reports (SRs) for the uplink video session, (2) RTCP messages including RRs\/SRs and associated AVPF information for the uplink video session, and\/or (3) RTCP messages including AVPF information (and excluding RRs\/SRs) for the uplink video session. The RTCP messages for an uplink video session may include any other suitable types of RTCP messages. While such RTCP messages are usually exchanged between the video senders and video receivers of video sessions, Manager  is configured to receive such messages and to use such messages, on a cellular sector basis, to monitor and manage potential and established uplink video sessions of cellular sectors (illustratively, cellular sector ), respectively.","The Manager  collates the information on a per cellular sector basis such that, for each cellular sector, Manager  knows all video senders active in the cellular sector as well as details of the uplink video sessions of the active video senders, respectively. The Manager  may process such information on a per cellular sector basis such that, for each cellular sector, Manager  determines the total allocated GBR and total allocated MBR for all uplink video sessions in the cellular sector.","The Manager  may be configured to function in accordance with RFC 5760 during normal uncongested operations, including receiving and processing RTCP SR messages and RR messages, receiving TMMBR messages originating from video receivers and providing the received TMMBR messages to the video senders of the associated video sessions, and the like. As a result, Manager  also may determine the transmission bit rate (denoted as TxCBR) of each video session (where TxCBRis less than or equal to MBR, and may be less than or equal to GBR in certain situations, such as under conditions resulting in a poor signal) and, thus, also may determine a total transmission bit rate of all video senders in the cellular sector (\u03a3TxCBRover all video senders in the cellular sector).","The Manager  is configured to monitor and manage established uplink video sessions of the cellular sector  (as well as other cellular sectors for which the Manager  provides management functions, which have been omitted for purposes of clarity). The Manager  is configured to modify the transmission bit rates of some or all of the video senders of the uplink video sessions in the cellular sector . The Manager  is configured to determine a new bit rate(s) for a video sender(s) in the cellular sector , based on a budget of uplink resources available in the cellular sector  for uplink video sessions, current bit rates of the video senders in the cellular sector , and the condition(s) triggering the new bit rate(s) for the video sender(s) of the cellular sector . The Manager  is configured to send a transmission bit rate modification message(s) to the video sender(s), where the transmission bit rate modification message for a video sender is configured to instruct the video sender to transmit video using the new bit rate determined by Manager . The Manager  may modify the transmission bit rates of some or all of the video senders of the uplink video sessions in the cellular sector  in response to various events and\/or conditions. The Manager  may modify the transmission bit rates of some or all of the video senders by decreasing and\/or increasing bit rates of the video senders. The transmission bit rate modification messages may be any suitable type(s) of messages. In one embodiment, the transmission bit rate modification messages are sent as TMMBR messages.","The Manager  may send respective transmission bit rate modification messages to some or all of the video senders in the cellular sector  for instructing the video senders to reduce their respective bit rates, thereby releasing resources in the cellular sector . This may be performed in response to any suitable event or condition. In one embodiment, for example, this may be done to accommodate pending and\/or new video session requests (e.g., RT video session requests, pending NRT video session requests, and the like). In one embodiment, for example, this may be done in response to an indication that there is congestion in the cellular sector . This may be performed in response to any other suitable event or condition.","The Manager  may send respective transmission bit rate modification messages to some or all of the video senders in the cellular sector  for instructing each of the video senders to increase their respective bit rates. In one embodiment, for example, this may be done where additional wireless uplink resources are available for use by the active video senders.","The Manager  may send respective transmission bit rate modification messages to some or all of the video senders in the cellular sector . In this regard, it is noted that respective transmission bit rate modification messages may be sent to all of the video senders of the cellular sector  under various conditions (e.g., for throttling bit rates of all video senders to accommodate new uplink video sessions, for throttling bit rates of all video senders during congestion in the cellular sector, and the like). Similarly, in this regard, it is noted that respective transmission bit rate modification messages may be sent to only a subset of the video senders of the cellular sector  under various conditions (e.g., where one or more video senders are consuming wireless uplink resources at the detriment of other active or pending video sources, where one or more video senders are entitled to use of additional wireless uplink resources and such additional resources are currently available within the cellular sector , and the like).","The Manager  may employ combinations of transmission bit rate modification messages, e.g., for decreasing the transmission bit rate(s) of one or more video senders of the cellular sector  and increasing the transmission bit rate(s) of one or more video senders of the cellular sector .","In at least some such embodiments, the transmission bit rate modification messages may specify modification of bit rates of the video senders by equal or unequal amounts (e.g., based on wireless transmission efficiency of the video senders, MCSs used by the video senders, SLAs of the video senders, application types and\/or applications of the video senders, and the like, as well as various combinations thereof).","In at least some such embodiments, any suitable number of transmission bit rate modification messages may be sent to any suitable numbers of video senders, where such transmission bit rate modification messages may request respective decreases and\/or increases of bit rates of the video senders. In this manner, Manager  is configured to manage the available wireless uplink resources of the cellular sector  based on various combinations of factors and conditions (e.g., based on one or more of requests for new video sessions in the cellular sector , termination of existing video sessions in the cellular sector , indications of congestion, wireless transmission efficiency of the video senders, MCSs used by the video senders, SLAs of the video senders, application types and\/or applications of the video senders, and the like, as well as various combinations thereof).","As an example, assume that (1) there are five video senders in a cellular sector, with each video sender having a GBR of 256 Kbps totaling 1.25 Mbps currently allocated for the cellular sector and (2) the maximum bandwidth that can be allocated for uplink video sessions for this cellular sector is 1.25 Mbps. For purposes of simplification, it is assumed that all video senders have identical MCS values (although it is noted that allocation of the wireless uplink resources is in terms of PRBs which may be a function of MCS value). In this example, when a request for a sixth video session, at 128 Kbps, is received, the Manager  is prompted to accommodate the new video session. In order to accommodate the new session, the Manager  issues five TMMBR messages to each of the five existing video senders, where each TMMBR message indicates a bit rate value of 224 Kbps (i.e., a 32 Kbps reduction each). In this manner, 160 Kbps of wireless uplink capacity is made available for use by the new video session to transmit video at 128 Kbps (or more) via the wireless uplink of the cellular sector. It is noted that, in this example, the transmission bit rates of each of the active video senders are degraded uniformly.","As another example, assume that (1) there are five video senders in a cellular sector, with each video sender having a GBR of 256 Kbps totaling 1.25 Mbps currently allocated for the cellular sector, two of the five video senders have associated SLAs guaranteeing them GBR of 256 Kbps, and (3) the maximum bandwidth that can be allocated for uplink video sessions for this cellular sector is 1.25 Mbps. For purposes of simplification, it is assumed that all video senders have identical MCS values (although it is noted that allocation of the wireless uplink resources is in terms of PRBs which may be a function of MCS value). In this example, when a request for a sixth video session, at 128 Kbps, is received, the Manager  is prompted to accommodate the new video session. In order to accommodate the new session, the Manager  issues three TMMBR messages to each of the three existing video senders that do not have SLAs guaranteeing them GBR of 256 Kbps, where each TMMBR message indicates a bit rate value of 192 Kbps (i.e., a 64 Kbps reduction each). In this manner, 192 Kbps of wireless uplink capacity is made available for use by the new video session to transmit video at 128 Kbps (or more) via the wireless uplink of the cellular sector. it is noted that, in this example, the transmission bit rate reductions for a subset of the video senders are influenced by the SLAs of two of the video senders (i.e., the higher level subscribers are not impacted, at the detriment of the lower level subscribers).","As another example, assume that (1) there are five video senders in a cellular sector, with each video sender having a GBR of 256 Kbps totaling 1.25 Mbps currently allocated for the cellular sector and (2) the maximum bandwidth that can be allocated for uplink video sessions for this cellular sector is 1.25 Mbps. For purposes of simplification, it is assumed that all video senders have identical MCS values (although it is noted that allocation of the wireless uplink resources is in terms of PRBs which may be a function of MCS value). In this example, when a determination is made that one of the video senders has poor radio conditions such that the video sender cannot utilize the 256 Kbps bit rate, the Manager  lowers the transmission bit rate of the video sender with the poor radio conditions and reallocates the excess wireless uplink resources to one or more of the other video senders (e.g., one or more of the other video senders having radio conditions indicative that a higher bit rate can be supported). The Manager  allocates resources freed from the video sender with the poor radio conditions to the remaining video senders with better radio conditions. In order to perform such reallocation of wireless uplink resources, the Manager  (1) issues a TMMBR message to the video sender with the poor radio conditions, where the TMMBR message indicates a bit rate below 256 Kbps and (2) issues one or more TMMBR messages to the one or more other video senders, where each TMMBR message indicates a bit rate value greater than 256 Kbps.","As another example, assume that (1) there are five video senders in a cellular sector, with each video sender having a GBR of 256 Kbps totaling 1.25 Mbps currently allocated for the cellular sector and (2) the maximum bandwidth that can be allocated for uplink video sessions for this cellular sector is 1.25 Mbps. For purposes of simplification, it is assumed that all video senders have identical MCS values (although it is noted that allocation of the wireless uplink resources is in terms of PRBs which may be a function of MCS value). In this example, a video receiver that is receiving video from one of the five video senders sends a TMMBR message requesting a lower transmission bit rate of 128 Kbps. The Manager  receives the TMMBR message from the video sender and forwards the TMMBR message to the associated video sender which then lowers its transmission rate from 256 Kbps to 128 Kbps, thereby resulting in available bandwidth which may be reallocated by Manager . The Manager  allocates the resources freed from the video sender to one or more of the other video senders. In order to perform such reallocation of wireless uplink resources, the Manager  issues one or more TMMBR messages to the one or more other video senders, where each TMMBR message indicates a bit rate value greater than 256 Kbps. It is noted that the foregoing examples are merely a few of the many ways in which the transmission bit rates of video senders may be managed (e.g., increased and\/or decreased) in accordance with the various embodiments of the wireless uplink control capability.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0160","num":"0159"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1"]},"At step , method  begins.","At step , at least one indication of at least one condition associated with the cellular sector is received.

In one embodiment, the modified transmission bit rates are determined using information associated with the at least one condition, information indicative of an amount of wireless uplink resources available for supporting uplink video sessions within the cellular sector, and information indicative of current bit rates supported by the video senders (e.g., as determined from RTCP SRs\/RRs and\/or any other suitable source(s) of such information).","At step , messages are propagated toward the video senders for instructing the video senders to use the modified transmission bit rates for the uplink video sessions.

The transmission bit rate modification messages may include TMMBR messages.","At step , method  ends.","Returning now to , it is noted that the Manager  may be configured to provide various other types of functions in conjunction with modification of bit rates of video senders of a cellular sector.","In one embodiment, Manager  is configured to monitor bit rate requirements for all devices participating in video sessions which are originating from the cellular sector. For example, the Manager  may monitor the transmission bit rate requirements of all video senders within the cellular sector and monitor the transmission bit rate requirements of all video receivers participating in video sessions originating from the cellular sector. In one embodiment, Manager  uses such information for requesting modifications of bit rates via transmission bit rate modification messages. In one embodiment, the Manager  provides such information to Scheduler  for use by Scheduler  in performing various scheduling functions (which also may result in requests by Scheduler  for Manager  to issue transmission bit rate modification messages for modifying transmission bit rates of video senders within the cellular sector).","In one embodiment, in which the Manager  is performing monitoring and management of bit rates of video senders of the cellular sector , the Manager  may be configured to provide information to the associated BS  of the cellular sector  for use by a Call Admission Control (CAC) mechanism of the BS  in performing call admission control functions. In one embodiment, for example, the total transmission bit rate of the cellular sector , as determined by Manager , may be used by the CAC mechanism of the BS  to admit additional resources when the total transmission bit rate of the cellular sector  is less than the total resources of the cellular sector . It is noted that, while the total transmission bit rate of the cellular sector  is subject to change over time as the individual TxCBRvalues of the video senders change (i.e., such that the CAC mechanism of the BS  may not be able to always safely rely on the total transmission bit rate value), with cooperation with Manager  the CAC mechanism of the BS  could rely on the total transmission bit rate translated into total resources (such as PRBs) of the cellular sector  for performing call admission by using a mechanism that would inform the Manager  to enforce TxCBRfor a video sender as the MBR (i.e., do not allow TxCBRto increase for any video sender). This mechanism may be used in response to various events and conditions (e.g., as a temporary state while the system deals with sudden congestion or for any other suitable purpose). Additionally, if a video sender determines that its new bit rate is no longer temporary, it is expected to renegotiate a new bit rate with the video receivers (e.g., via SIP messaging or any other suitable type of messaging), thereby resulting in new GBR and MBR values for the video session which may then be used by the CAC mechanism of the BS  for call admission calculations.","Although primarily depicted and described herein with respect to embodiments in which the video senders of the cellular sector  are using Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) (i.e., in which there is a single video sender and multiple video receivers for each uplink video session), it is noted that the various functions of Manager  depicted and described herein may be adapted for use within other types of uplink video sessions provided using other types of content distribution schemes.","It is noted that uplink video sessions which do not utilize the services of Manager  are possibly only afforded Best Effort treatment and, thus, would be unreliable in the event of congestion.","Although primarily depicted and described herein with respect to controlling transmission bit rates of video senders on a per cellular sector basis, it is noted that the Manager  also may be configured to control transmission bit rates of video senders of multiple cellular sectors as a group. In one embodiment, for example, in the event of congestion at a higher level of the network, the Manager  may control bit rates of video senders associated with all of the cellular sectors served by the higher level of the network experiencing congestion. For example, in the event of congestion at a Serving Gateway (SGW) in a 3GPP network, the Manager  may issue TMMBRs to some or all video senders in some or all of the cellular sectors having associated data paths supported by the SGW. Similarly, for example, in the in the event of congestion at a PDN Gateway (PGW) in a 3GPP network, the Manager  may issue TMMBRs to some or all video senders in some or all of the cellular sectors having associated data paths supported by the PGW. It is noted that the Manager  may be configured to support various other granularities of monitoring and control of bit rates of video senders.","Although primarily depicted and described herein with respect to controlling transmission bit rates of video senders using specific control protocols (e.g., RTP\/RTCP and related protocols), it is noted that Manager  also may be configured to control transmission bit rates of video senders using various other suitable protocols.
