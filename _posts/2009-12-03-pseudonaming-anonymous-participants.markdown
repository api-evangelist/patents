{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["In a computing environment, an online community or virtual community is made up of a group of people that primarily interact using online communication media such as Internet-based news, email, Internet-based social networking sites, chat rooms, forum discussions and instant messaging, for example, rather than in person. Often, the online community is used for entertainment, social, professional, educational and\/or other purposes. Online communities can supplement relational communication between people who know each other in real life, and are also often a primary form of communication between those who have never met in person, and may prefer to remain anonymous.","Many type of programs, services and software, separately or in combination, are used for online communications, including games, text-based chat rooms and forums that use voice, video text and\/or avatars. Recently, online communities utilize a shared online environment that provides for users to interact with each other, such as a virtual world or online game, and\/or collaborate with each other, such as online meetings, presentations, and live forum discussions.","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.","Presently, online collaboration and interaction environments and tools do not have a socially friendly means to identify different anonymous users in a shared online environment, such as an online meeting or forum. Commonly, when an anonymous user enters a shared online environment a next sequential number is added as a suffix to a neutral \u201cuser,\u201d or \u201canonymous,\u201d as in user, user , or anonymous , anonymous. The anonymity of the user, along with the neutral handle associated the user's interaction does not typically engender a social relevance or feeling of some sort of human interaction with others in the shared environment.","One or more techniques and\/or systems are disclosed that provide for anonymous members of a shared online environment, where people interact and\/or collaborate as users, with a given (non-neutral) name. As an example, the given name can provide contextual relevance to the shared environment by being associated with particular characteristics of the environment. Further, the given name can be socially relevant to the others in the group, and\/or familiar as a reference from popular culture. As another example, common characters from popular media can be utilized that are relevant to the shared online environment, such as movies that have a similar theme to the topics discussed in an online forum.","In one embodiment, where familiar pseudonames are assigned to anonymous user members in a shared online environment, creation of a name pool is provided for, where the name pool includes familiar names that can be contextually relevant to a group of user members in the shared online environment. Further, a name from the name pool is provided for assignment to an anonymous user member in the shared online environment. Here, the assignment of the name can be, at least in part, based on characteristics of the anonymous user member relative to the shared online environment. In another example, the name pool may comprise names that are not necessarily contextually relevant, but that comprise names that are at least familiar and\/or otherwise recognizable to user members.","To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, the following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects may be employed. Other aspects, advantages, and novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.","The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the claimed subject matter. It may be evident, however, that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","102","106","102"]},"In this example , a user member of the service  (jeremy) may have a buddy list  of other users that frequently interact with the user member. The buddy list often comprises user known the user member. However, it is common for anonymous users  (e.g., user, user, user) to join a chat environment , and add to the ongoing conversation . In the online chat environment, the users can type messages  and send them to the conversation, even adding additional expressions , such as emoticons.","While anonymous users may often join a conversation, or some other online collaboration\/interaction, as an anonymous user they typically don't engender a sense of close interaction or collaboration with the other users in the environment. A simple \u201cuser\u201d often denotes a cold, neutral feeling when interacting. However, when a user has a known name, or at least one that is recognizable and related to a collaboration topic, it may enable a more enjoyable experience for the online shared environment.","As provided herein, method may be devised that provides for assigning pseudo-usernames (pseudonames), whereby the pseudonames can be recognizable to other users in the online shared environment (e.g., a chat room). Further, the pseudonames can provide context, for example, where the pseudoname can relate to a shared experience for the users in the shared online environment, and\/or relate to a characteristic of the shared online environment (e.g., topic, type of environment, etc.). In this way, for example, anonymous user members in the online shared environment may relate and interact in a way that enhances the experience.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","202","204"]},"For example, a shared online environment may be a scientific presentation related to physics, where users may have an ongoing collaboration on a theory presented in the presentation. In this example, the user that initiated the presentation can create a name pool that includes various famous scientists from the field of physics, such as Einstein, Fermi, Hawking, etc. In this way, the names in the name pool are familiar to the users as famous scientists, and can be contextually relevant to the topic of physics.","At , in the exemplary method , a name from the name pool is provided for assignment to an anonymous user member in the shared online environment. The name is assigned to the anonymous user member, at least in part, based on characteristics of the anonymous user member relative to the shared online environment. For example, the leader of the physics collaboration may be assigned the pseudoname \u201cEinstein,\u201d as Einstein is commonly known as the leading name in physics. Further, the leader of the collaboration may be assigned \u201cEinstein\u201d based on some characteristics developed during discussions that relate to particular characteristics of Einstein, such as commonly used words, reactions, or discussion topics brought up by the leader in previous discussions.","Having assigned a name to an anonymous user member, the exemplary method  ends at .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","302"]},"In one embodiment, the name pool can comprise a number of names sufficient to assign a given name to respective anonymous members in the shared online environment. That is, the name pool will have at least a same number (or more) of names as a number of user members in the online shared environment. For example, if twelve user member spaces are assigned to a game at one time, the name pool can contain at least twelve names for assignment. In another embodiment, the name pool can be created with particular characteristics. For example, the name pool comprising characters from a fantasy novel or movie can have the characteristic \u201cfantasy\u201d assigned to it, as well as any others that are deemed appropriate (e.g., related to a specific group of users and\/or situations, such as gaming).","At , in the exemplary embodiment , the name pool is added to a database of name pools. In one embodiment a plurality of name pools can be created, where a name pool in the plurality has one or more characteristics that are related to the names in the name pool. For example, as described above, a name pool that comprises names from the US Supreme Court may have a characteristic of \u201claw,\u201d and \u201cSupreme Court.\u201d Other examples of name pools may include characters from a television sit-com, and have a characteristic of \u201ccomedy,\u201d of something else that relates the characters to the name pool. In one embodiment, the characteristics can be selected by a user, such as the user that created the name pool. In another embodiment, the name pool's characteristics may be selected automatically based on the type of characters and\/or a context for the characters (e.g., movie, TV show, novel, etc.).","In one embodiment, the name pool can be stored in a local database on a local machine connected to the shared online environment. For example, where a user creates the name pool, the name pool can be stored on the user's local machine. In this example, then the user connects to the shared online environment the name pool can be accessed from the local machine. In another embodiment, the name pool can be stored in a remote database on a remote machine connected to the shared online environment. For example, the shared online environment may be resident on a remote server to which respective users connect to collaborate. In this example, the name pool can be stored on the remote server and accessed by the shared online environment from that location.","At , an online collaboration is initiated in the shared online environment. An online shared environment may comprise a user interaction environment, in one embodiment, such as an online world where users interact with each other. In another embodiment, the online shared environment may comprise a collaboration environment, for example, where users collaborate on ideas, presentations, topics and discussions, such as a scientific chat or presentation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","402","3","404","400","402","1","414"]},"At , in the exemplary embodiment  of , a name pool is selected for the online shared environment based, at least in part, on characteristics of the name pool relative to characteristics of the online shared environment. In one embodiment, a name pool can be selected by a user, such as the user that initiates or creates the online shared environment. For example, as illustrated in , because the collaboration involves law topics , and the presentation topic relates to a US Supreme Court decision , user may select a name pool  that comprises US Supreme Court justice names.","In another embodiment, the name pool may be selected automatically, based on the characteristics of the name pool and the online shared environment. For example, as shown in , then the law conference  is initiated, characteristics for the conference can be included. In this example, the service that hosts the online shared environment can automatically (e.g., programmatically) search the database for a name pool that comprises the characteristics included with the initiated conference (e.g., law and Supreme Court decision). In this way, as shown in the exemplary embodiment , the name pool  that comprises the US Supreme Court justices can be selected for the law conference .","In the exemplary embodiment  of , a loop begins at . At , an anonymous user enters the online shared collaboration. For example, a user may log into the law conference collaboration , of , as directed by an invitation sent out to interested parties. As another example, users may log into or browse to online shared environments regularly as anonymous users, or periodically, such as a gaming or virtual world environment. Some examples may include online meeting websites, Intranet conference sites, online gaming and virtual worlds, chat rooms, live (or otherwise) forums and discussion sites, and more.","At , a determination is made as to whether a name is available for the anonymous user in the name pool. For example, a name can be available for assignment to the anonymous user if all of the names in the name pool have not been assigned already. That is, there are more names in the name pool that anonymous users in the online shared environment. A name may not be available for the anonymous user if the names are already fully assigned to existing anonymous users in the online shared environment, and\/or names have been reserved for users (e.g., where a leader of the discussion in  reserves \u201cRoberts\u201d A as the Chief Justice of the US Supreme Court).","At , if a name is available for the anonymous user (\u201cYES\u201d from ), a new name from the name pool is assigned to the anonymous user. In one embodiment, a user can assign the name from the name pool to the anonymous user member when the user member enters the shared online environment. For example, as illustrated in the exemplary embodiment  of , the leader or initiator of the law group collaboration\/discussion  can assign the name \u201cRoberts\u201d A to themselves from the name pool . Further, the leader\/initiator may wish to assign names  from the name pool  to respective anonymous user members that enter the law group conference . As another example, a user that enters anonymously may assign a name from the name pool  (e.g., from the available names, Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor) to themselves when they enter the online shared environment. As shown in , user may have a particular affinity to Justice Alito and can assign the pseudoname \u201cAlito\u201d  to their username in the conference.","In another embodiment, a name may be assigned from the name pool to an anonymous user member automatically, when the user member enters the shared online environment anonymously. For example, when an anonymous user enters the online shared environment a next name from the name pool can be assigned. In other embodiments, the names may be ranked in the name pool in a preference, such as based on importance in the affiliated reference (e.g., novel, movie, etc.) or some other characteristic, and are assigned to anonymous users in order of entrance to the online environment.","In one embodiment, the names can be assigned from the name pool based on characteristics of the anonymous users in relative context with the names from the pool. For example, if a group of anonymous users regularly meet online, such as for weekly law group conferences as in , they may display particular characteristics based on discussion and\/or actions (e.g., chattiness, shyness, aggression, kindness, or particular topics of conversation, etc.). In this example, the name assignment can be based on the user member's developed characteristics, where the name may have similar characteristics associated with it. For example, where a user acts like a particular movie character (e.g., a sidekick), the name of the associated (sidekick) movie character can be automatically (or chosen by a user) selected for that particular user member.","At , in the exemplary embodiment  of , if a name is not available for the anonymous user (\u201cNO\u201d from ), a new name can be created and added to the name pool for the online shared environment. For example, as shown in , if all of the names are assigned to users  from the name pool  a name can be created and added to the name pool. In one embodiment, a random name tag can be created and added to the pool. In another embodiment, a contextually relevant name can be created, for example, a name of a previous Supreme Court justice or some other judge or law related name. At , the newly created and added name can be assigned to the anonymous user. If another anonymous user enters the online collaboration, the loop can return to .","As described above,  illustrates an example of implementing one or more of the techniques and\/or systems for assigning familiar names to anonymous users of a shared online environment, for example. In this example, users  can be assigned names from the name pool , and collaborate as avatars A and B in the exemplary conference . Often, a leader A may present a discussion topic , and other user members B can discuss  by sending written comments . In this exemplary embodiment , the users are using names from a socially identifiable pool of names, such as US Supreme Court Justices, in a shared space for collaboration on legal issues. In this way, in this example, the users may be more recognizable and, as such, may enable an enhanced experienced during the conference, when compared with the anonymous discussion illustrated in .","A system may be devised that can facilitate assigning of pseudonames that are socially recognizable to other users in the online shared environment (e.g., online conference). In this way, for example, anonymous user members in the online shared environment may relate and interact in a way that enhances the experience.  is a component block diagram of an exemplary system  system for assigning familiar pseudonames to anonymous user members in a shared online environment.","A database , which can be resident in storage  (e.g., memory) on a computing device , provides for storage of a name pool . A name pool creation component  provides for creation of the name pool , where the name pool can be stored in the database . The name pool  comprises familiar names that can be contextually relevant to a group of user members in a shared online environment, such as instantiated on the computing device . A name assignment component  assigns a name from the name pool  to an anonymous user member in the shared online environment. The assignment of the name from the name pool  is, at least in part, based on characteristics of the user member relative to the shared online environment. It will be appreciated, that while it may be more common to provide contextually relevant names, this may be difficult if not impossible in some instances. Accordingly, in one example the name pool  may merely comprise names that are familiar to the users so that the users would recognize the fundamental make up of the pool (e.g., the names of castaways\/characters on a television show). The character names may or may not be assigned to respective users based upon the relationships between the characters and\/or the relationships between the users and\/or any correlation therebetween. Similarly, the name pool  may merely comprise (common) first names with little to no context to at least give different users an identity and not just the name \u201cAnonymous\u201d or \u201cUser\u201d.","In one embodiment, the database  may reside in remote data storage, for example, on a remote server that comprises an instantiation of the shared online environment. In this embodiment, a remote connection  can be made between the local user's computing device  and the database , when creating and\/or using the name pool . In another embodiment, the database  may reside on a user's local machine, such as , in local data storage, such as . In this embodiment, the local computing device may have a connection  to the shared online environment when using the name pool.","It will be appreciated that respective components in the exemplary system  are not limited to a particular location. It is anticipated that those skilled in the art may devise alternate embodiments for locations and interconnections for the respective components. For example, while the database  may reside on a local computer (e.g., ), the name pool creation component  and name assignment component  may reside on a remote server, having a connection  to the local machine. Further, other configurations between a remote and local computing device are anticipated.","In one embodiment, the database can comprise one or more name pools, respectively having a plurality of names. In this embodiment, the respective one or more name pools can have one or more characteristics that relate to the plurality of names in the name pool. For example, several name pools may be created that can be used in different shared online environments. Where users interact in a virtual world that takes place on a remote island, the characters from a famous television show about castaways on an island can be used to populate the name pool, for example. Further, where users are involved in a murder mystery game, characters from a popular detective murder game can be used to populate another name pool. In this example, respective name pools can have corresponding characteristics assigned to them, so that when an appropriate shared online environment is initiated, the name pool having matching characteristics can be selected.","In one embodiment, the familiar names for the name pool can comprise names from one or more media elements from popular culture. Several example of media elements from popular culture may include: movies, books, televisions shows, stories (e.g., oral tradition stories), games (e.g., board games, video games, etc.), historical events (e.g., World War II), and songs. As an example, a popular old English epic poem is that of Beowulf, describing heroic acts of Beowulf in old Denmark. This tale includes characters such as Beowulf, Grendel, Grendel's mother, Hroogar the king, Wiglaf and others. In this example, these names comprise in the name pool may have particular characteristics that can be assigned to the pool, such as epic poem, fantasy, old English, and others.","In one embodiment, the name pool creation component  can to allow one or more users to select one or more names in the name pool. For example, where a leader or initiator of the shared online experience creates respective names for the pool. Further, other users may be allowed to contribute to the name pool, for example, by selecting contextually relevant names for themselves, to be added to the pool. Additionally, the name pool creation component may allow one or more of the users to select one or more characteristics for the name pool, such as \u201cfantasy,\u201d \u201claw,\u201d or \u201csports.\u201d","In another embodiment, a user may merely select a media element (as described above) and a particular characteristic, such as \u201cnovel\u201d and \u201cmurder,\u201d and the name pool creation component  may automatically (e.g., computationally) select names for the name pool, such as characters from a murder mystery novel. In this way, for example, a plurality of name pools can be created by selecting themes and particular media elements from which to draw names from.","In another embodiment, the name assignment component  may automatically (e.g., computationally) assign a name from the name pool  when a user member enters the shared online environment anonymously. As an example, the anonymous user may merely be automatically assigned a next available name from the name pool, such as where the names in the name pool are ordered (e.g., by the creator of the name pool). As another example, the anonymous user may be assigned a name that comprises characteristics appropriate for the user, such as where the user has establish particular nuances and quirks relative to the shared online environment.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","600","620","550","502"]},"Further, the exemplary system  comprises a name addition component  that can add an appropriate new name to the name pool if existing names in the name pool are fully assigned to existing user members in the shared online environment. For example, if the name pool  comprise ten pseudonames, and each of the ten pseudonames have been assigned to user members that have already anonymously connected to the shared online environment, the name addition component  can create a new name, so that when another user anonymously joins the shared environment a name will be available for assignment. In one embodiment the name addition component  may randomly create a tag, or may create a name that is relevant to the characteristics of the name pool.","Still another embodiment involves a computer-readable medium comprising processor-executable instructions configured to implement one or more of the techniques presented herein. An exemplary computer-readable medium that may be devised in these ways is illustrated in , wherein the implementation  comprises a computer-readable medium  (e.g., a CD-R, DVD-R, or a platter of a hard disk drive), on which is encoded computer-readable data . This computer-readable data  in turn comprises a set of computer instructions  configured to operate according to one or more of the principles set forth herein.
