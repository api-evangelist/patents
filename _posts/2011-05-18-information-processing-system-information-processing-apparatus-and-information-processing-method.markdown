{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS","First Embodiment","Second Embodiment"],"p":["The present application claims priority from Japanese Patent Application No. JP 2010-119025 filed in the Japanese Patent Office on May 25, 2010, the entire content of which is incorporated herein by reference.","The present disclosure relates to an information processing system, an information processing apparatus, and an information processing method, which are capable of receiving and recording a content.","In recent years, information processing apparatuses such as a personal computer (PC), a cellular phone, and a personal digital assistant (PDA) have been more and more decreased in size and weight, and such information processing apparatuses can be connected to the Internet from the outside home so as to browse web pages, videos, and the like, which offer information about a destination. Further, with an information processing apparatus equipped with a camera, it is also possible to save image data captured in the outside home by the use of the camera, and to transfer the image data via a network to terminals of other users.","By the way, there has been proposed a system in which a user can utilize positional information of an image, that the user captured in the outside home in the past, to extract a broadcast program corresponding to a preference of the user from electronic program guide (EPG) data, and to record the extracted broadcast program. In this system, positional information (latitude and longitude information) related to a broadcast program is recorded on the EPG data. When the positional information of the image that the user was captured in the outside home in the past is compared with the positional information of the EPG data, a programmed recording of the broadcast program related to the location where the user captured the image in the past is performed (for example, see Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2009-290631 (paragraph [0005], FIG. 1) (hereinafter, referred to as Patent Document 1).","The system as in Patent Document 1 determines a broadcast program related to the location where the user captured the image in the past in such a manner that the positional information of the image that the user was captured in the past is compared with the positional information of the EPG data. Here, the photographing activity itself by the user is contributed to generate the preference information of the user. Thus, a difference in frequency of the photographing activity between the users is easy to be reflected to the results of this service. That is, a user who does not frequently capture images may not satisfactorily enjoy this service. For this reason, there is desired a system capable of satisfactorily collecting the preference information of the users without depending on action such as the photographing activity, which may cause the difference in frequency between the users, so as to determine a broadcast program corresponding to a preference of each of the users.","In addition, in the case where a broadcast program corresponding to a preference of the user is recorded on a recording apparatus at home, the user view the recorded program at home, generally. On the other hand, when the user visits a sight during a tour or the like, if the user is allowed to view a recorded program related to the sight, it is possible to provide the user with useful information, and thus it is possible to increase the enjoyment of the tour of the user. However, when the user visits the sight for the tour, the user may not view the recorded program recorded by the recording apparatus at home, and even may not know that the program related to the sight is recorded.","In view of the above-mentioned circumstances, there is a need for providing an information processing system, an information processing apparatus, and an information processing method, which allows the user to know that a broadcast program related to a place where the user is in the outside home is recorded, and to view the recorded program as necessary.","In order to achieve the above-mentioned object, an information processing system according to an embodiment of the present disclosure includes a first information processing apparatus and a second information processing apparatus configured to be connectable via a network to the first information processing apparatus.","The first information processing apparatus includes a content recording unit configured to record a content and to obtain and record a sights keyword related to the recorded content.","The second information processing apparatus includes a place-name accumulating unit, a sights keyword acquisition unit, a sights keyword determining unit, and a content-record informing unit.","The place-name accumulating unit obtains and accumulates place-name information corresponding to a current location of the second information processing apparatus.","The sights keyword acquisition unit obtains the sights keyword recorded on the first information processing apparatus.","The sights keyword determining unit narrows down a sights candidate in the place-name information, to thereby extract sights-candidate place-name information, and determines the sights keyword corresponding to the sights-candidate place-name information.","The content-record informing unit informs that a content related to the determined sights keyword is recorded on the first information processing apparatus.","With this, for example, in the case where the user with the second information processing apparatus sightsees, in the timing when the user comes by near a sight that was introduced in a program recorded on the first information processing apparatus, the second information processing apparatus is capable of informing the user of the presence of the content recorded on the first information processing apparatus.","The first information processing apparatus further includes an electronic-program-guide acquisition unit configured to obtain electronic program guide data including information about a plurality of contents.","The content recording unit performs at least one of an extraction of the sights keyword from caption data included in the recorded content, and an extraction of the sights keyword from the information about the recorded content in the electronic program guide data obtained by the electronic-program-guide acquisition unit.","The content recording unit extracts sights keywords with respect to the same content from both of the caption data and the electronic program guide data, and hence it is possible to extract more sights keywords.","The place-name accumulating unit obtains a global positioning system (GPS) information corresponding to the current location of the second information processing apparatus, and obtains place-name information based on the obtained GPS information.","With this, it is possible to satisfactorily collect the place-name information without depending on action, which may cause a difference in frequency between the users, and to determine a content related to the sights, that the user visited in the past, of the broadcast program.","The sights keyword determining unit determines place-name information obtained by removing place-name information appearing on a regular basis in time, as a result of the narrowing of the sights-candidate place-name information.","With this, the place-name that the user visits on a regular basis is removed from the sights candidates, and hence the place-name corresponding to a preference of the user is narrowed down as a sights candidate. Thus, it is possible to increase the accuracy for narrowing down the sights candidate.","The second information processing apparatus further includes a reproduction unit configured to obtain via the network the content recorded on the first information processing apparatus and reproduce the content.","With this, for example, in the case where the user with the second information processing apparatus sightsees, in the timing when the user comes by near a sight that was introduced in a program recorded on the first information processing apparatus, the second information processing apparatus is capable of reproducing the content recorded on the first information processing apparatus.","The first information processing apparatus further includes a place-name acquisition unit and a programmed-recording unit.","The place-name acquisition unit obtains the sights-candidate place-name information from the second information processing apparatus.","The programmed-recording unit detects information about the content including the sights-candidate place-name information from the electronic program guide data obtained by the electronic-program-guide acquisition unit, and carries out a programmed recording based on the detected information about the content.","With this, it is possible to automatically record a content related to the sight, that the user visited in the past, on the first information processing apparatus.","The first information processing apparatus further includes a place-name information determining unit and a place-name information informing unit.","The place-name information determining unit extracts place-name information from caption data included in the content to be reproduced by the reproduction unit of the second information processing apparatus, as caption place-name information, to thereby determine caption place-name information corresponding to the sights-candidate place-name information.","The place-name information informing unit informs that the determined caption place-name information is included in the content to be reproduced by the reproduction unit.","With this, it is possible to inform the user of the fact that it is a scene related to the sight, that the user visited in the past, during reproducing the content recorded on the first information processing apparatus.","An information processing apparatus according to an embodiment of the present disclosure includes a content recording unit, a connection unit, a place-name acquisition unit, and a programmed-recording unit.","The content recording unit records a content and obtains and records a sights keyword related to the recorded content.","The connection unit is connectable via a network to an information processing terminal including a place-name accumulating unit configured to obtain and accumulate place-name information corresponding to a current location, a sights keyword acquisition unit configured to obtain the sights keyword recorded on the content recording unit, a sights keyword determining unit configured to narrow down a sights candidate in the place-name information, to thereby extract sights-candidate place-name information, and to determine the sights keyword corresponding to the sights-candidate place-name information, and a content-record informing unit configured to inform that a content related to the determined sights keyword is recorded on the first information processing apparatus.","The place-name acquisition unit obtains sights-candidate place-name information from the information processing terminal.","The programmed-recording unit detects information about a content including the sights-candidate place-name information from the electronic program guide data obtained by the electronic-program-guide acquisition unit, and carries out a programmed recording based on the information about the detected content.","The information processing terminal further includes a reproduction unit configured to obtain via the network the content recorded on the first information processing apparatus and reproduce the content.","The information processing apparatus further includes a place-name information determining unit and a place-name information informing unit.","The place-name information determining unit extracts place-name information from caption data included in the content to be reproduced by the reproduction unit of the information processing terminal, as caption place-name information, to thereby determine caption place-name information corresponding to the sights-candidate place-name information.","The place-name information informing unit informs that the determined caption place-name information is included in the content to be reproduced by the reproduction unit.","An information processing apparatus according to an embodiment of the present disclosure includes a content recording unit, a place-name accumulating unit, a sights keyword determining unit, and a content-record informing unit.","The content recording unit records a content and obtains and records a sights keyword related to the recorded content.","The place-name accumulating unit obtains and accumulates place-name information corresponding to a current location.","The sights keyword determining unit narrows down a sights candidate in the place-name information, to thereby extract sights-candidate place-name information, and determines the sights keyword corresponding to the sights-candidate place-name information.","The content-record informing unit informs that a content related to the determined sights keyword is recorded on the content recording unit.","According to the embodiments of the present disclosure, it is possible to record a content corresponding to a preference of the user, and further to utilize the content depending on the activity of the user in the timing corresponding to the activity of the user.","These and other objects, features and advantages of the present disclosure will become more apparent in light of the following detailed description of best mode embodiments thereof, as illustrated in the accompanying drawings.","Hereinafter, embodiments of the present disclosure will be described with reference to the drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0074"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"1"},"As shown in the drawing, this information processing system  includes a video recorder  (first information processing apparatus, information processing apparatus, recording apparatus), a portable information terminal  (second information processing apparatus, information processing apparatus, information processing terminal), and an Internet  (network).","[Video Recorder ]","The video recorder  is capable of receiving content data of programs provided through broadcast waves of a terrestrial digital broadcasting and a satellite broadcasting, and of recording the content data on a recording medium such as a digital versatile disc (DVD) or a Blu-ray disc (registered trade mark) (BD).","The video recorder  includes a sights program recording module , a recorder-side sights program database , a sights program acquisition application program interface (API) , a place-name log updating API , a recorder-side place-name log storage unit , and a sights program monitoring module .","When the user selects a broadcast program or the sights program monitoring module  notifies the sights program recording module  of a broadcast program, the sights program recording module  (content recording unit) records the broadcast program. Then, the sights program recording module  extracts sights keywords from information about the recorded program which is included in electronic program guide data (EPG data) obtained through the Internet  by the use of a network connection unit  (electronic-program-guide acquisition unit), and from caption data multiplexed in the entity data of the program. After that, the sights program recording module  registers those sights keywords, the latitude and longitude data of the sights, and the like on the recorder-side sights program database .","The recorder-side sights program database  is a database in which the sights keywords, a program ID, a time, a play URL, the latitude and longitude data, and the like, which are extracted by the sights program recording module , are accumulated.","The sights program acquisition API  is an API for providing the content of the recorder-side sights program database  to a sights program synchronizing module  of the portable information terminal  in an extensible markup language (XML) format.","When the place-name log updating API  (place-name acquisition unit) is called by a place-name log synchronizing module  of the portable information terminal , the place-name log updating API  obtains, from the place-name log synchronizing module , place-name information (sights-candidate place-name information) with sights candidate flags being set among the place-name logs collected by the portable information terminal . Then, the place-name log updating API  accumulates the place-name information in the recorder-side place-name log storage unit  as recorder-side place-name logs .","The recorder-side place-name log storage unit  is a section storing the sights-candidate place-name information obtained by the place-name log synchronizing module  of the portable information terminal  and the recorder-side place-name logs  including time information described in time sequence. The sights-candidate place-name information described in the recorder-side place-name logs  accumulated by the recorder-side place-name log storage unit  is compared with place-name keywords extracted from the EPG data and the caption data accumulated in the recorder-side sights program database , in the sights program monitoring module . The sights program recording module  is notified of the matching program as a programmed-recording target program.","The sights program monitoring module  (programmed-recording unit) obtains the EPG data via the Internet  through the network connection unit  (electronic-program-guide acquisition unit). Based on genre information associated with the EPG data, the sights program monitoring module  detects a program related to the sights. Further, the sights program monitoring module  divides the program information extracted from the EPG data into morphemes. When a morpheme corresponds to the place-name information recorded on the recorder-side place-name logs  stored on the recorder-side place-name log storage unit , the sights program monitoring module  notifies the sights program recording module  of that program as a programmed-recording target program. It should be noted that the program related to the sights refers to a program whose title includes a place-name or a keyword of \u201ctourist\u201d or \u201ctour,\u201d for example. When the user makes a setting that a sights program recording is performed in advance, the sights program recording module  becomes effective. The effective sights program recording module  executes a detection of the program related to the sights based on the EPG data regularly obtained.","Further, when the recorded program is reproduced, the sights program monitoring module  (place-name information determining unit, place-name information informing unit) divides the caption data about that program into morphemes. When a morpheme corresponds to the sights-candidate place-name information recorded on the recorder-side place-name logs  stored on the recorder-side place-name log storage unit , the sights program monitoring module  notifies the user of the sights-candidate place-name information and the time information associated to the sights-candidate place-name information by displaying a pop-up window.","[Portable Information Terminal ]","The portable information terminal  is an electronic apparatus capable of connecting to the Internet  so as to browse web pages, transmit and receive electronic mails, reproduce moving images and music, and utilize other applications. The portable information terminal  has a GPS function of regularly receiving the positional information (latitude and longitude information) of the portable information terminal . Thus, the portable information terminal  is capable of obtaining a place-name by utilizing a place-name search service on the web based on the positional information obtained by the use of this GPS function, to thereby accumulate the history of the place-names of the destinations of the user as the place-name logs.","The portable information terminal  includes a place-name accumulating module , a terminal-side place-name log storage unit , a place-name log synchronizing module , a terminal-side sights program database , a sights program synchronizing module , and a sights notification module .","The place-name accumulating module  (place-name accumulating unit) uses the GPS function to regularly obtain from a GPS providing server  the positional information (latitude and longitude information). Further, the place-name accumulating module  obtains the place-name information corresponding to the positional information by utilizing the service on the web, to thereby update terminal-side place-name logs  of the terminal-side place-name log storage unit .","Further, the place-name accumulating module  (sights keyword determining unit) removes place-names appearing on a regular basis or on a continuous basis in time in the terminal-side place-name logs . When the place-name corresponding to the current positional information is a place-name other than the place-names appearing on a regular basis or on a continuous basis in time in the terminal-side place-name logs , the place-name accumulating module  narrows down the place-name corresponding to the current positional information as a sights candidate, and extracts the sights-candidate place-name information.

Then, the sights notification module  notifies the user of the fact that the recorded program related to the sights can be reproduced and viewed in the portable information terminal .","The sights program monitoring module  detects the program related to the sights on the basis of the EPG data obtained in advance, and requests the sights program recording module  to perform a programmed recording of the program. When the user makes a setting that a recording of the sights program is performed in advance, the sights program recording module  becomes effective. The effective sights program recording module  performs a detection of the program related to the sights based on the EPG data regularly obtained.","Further, when the recorded program is reproduced, the sights program monitoring module  divides the caption data about the program into morphemes. When a morpheme corresponds to the place-name information (sights-candidate place-name information) with flag information indicating that it is the sights candidate recorded on the place-name logs  stored on the place-name log storage unit  being set, the sights program monitoring module  notifies the user of the sights-candidate place-name information and the time information associated to the sights-candidate place-name information by displaying a pop-up window.","According to the above-mentioned configuration, as in the first embodiment, without a transferring of the sights-candidate place-name information from the place-name log synchronizing module  to the place-name log updating API , a transferring of the sights program data from the sights program acquisition API  to the sights program synchronizing module , and a transferring of the recorded program from the video recorder  to the portable information terminal , it is sufficient that the portable information terminal  execute the processing only within the portable information terminal . In addition, it is unnecessary to configure the place-name log synchronizing module , the place-name log updating API , the sights program acquisition API , and the sights program synchronizing module .","It should be understood by those skilled in the art that various modifications, combinations, sub-combinations and alterations may occur depending on design requirements and other factors insofar as they are within the scope of the appended claims or the equivalents thereof."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":"110"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["1112","1112"],"i":"a "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["1113","1113"],"i":"a "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":"112"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":"120"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":"113"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":"120"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["130","100","250","200"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIG. 11","b":"210"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 12","b":["221","220"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":"FIG. 13","b":"260"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":"FIG. 14","b":["140","100","230","200"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIG. 15","b":["151","150"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 16","b":"160"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"figref":"FIG. 17","b":"161"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"figref":"FIG. 18","b":"162"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":"FIG. 19"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0068"},"figref":"FIG. 20"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0069"},"figref":"FIG. 21"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0070"},"figref":"FIG. 22","b":"100"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0071"},"figref":"FIG. 23","b":"200"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0072"},"figref":"FIG. 24","b":"300"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
