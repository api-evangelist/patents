{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present invention was developed with Government support under Army Research Laboratory Contract No. W911NF-04-2-0021. The Government has certain rights in this invention.","This invention relates to microelectronic devices, and more particularly, to power transistors and related fabrication methods.","Power devices are widely used to carry large currents and support high voltages. For example, circuits in motor drives, appliance controls, robotics, lighting ballasts and other applications often require semiconductor switching devices that can carry large currents and support high blocking voltages. One type of power device is the bipolar junction transistor (BJT). The bipolar junction transistor has been the switching device of choice for many high power applications because of its ability to handle relatively large current densities and support relatively high blocking voltages.","A BJT typically includes a semiconductor material having two opposing p-n junctions in close proximity to one another. Thus, BJTs may be referred to as \u201cn-p-n\u201d or \u201cp-n-p\u201d transistors. In operation, charge carriers enter a region of the semiconductor material of a first conductivity type adjacent one of the p-n junctions, which is called the emitter. Most of the charge carriers exit the device from a region of the semiconductor material of the first conductivity type adjacent the other p-n junction, which is called the collector. A third region of the semiconductor material, known as the base, is positioned between the collector and the emitter and has a conductivity type that is opposite the conductivity type of the collector and the emitter. The two p-n junctions of the BJT are formed where the collector meets the base and where the base meets the emitter.","BJTs are current controlled devices in that a BJT is turned \u201con\u201d (i.e., it is biased so that current flows from the emitter to the collector) by flowing a current through the base of the transistor. When current is injected into or extracted from the base, depending upon whether the BJT is n-p-n or p-n-p, the flow of charge carriers, i.e., electrons or holes, which can move from the emitter to the collector, may be affected. By flowing a small current through the base of a BJT, a proportionally larger current passes from the emitter to the collector. Typically, a BJT may require a relatively large base current (e.g., one fifth to one tenth of the collector current) to maintain the device in its \u201con\u201d state. As high power BJTs have large collector currents, they also typically have significant base current demands. Relatively complex external drive circuits may be required to supply the relatively large base currents that can be required by high power BJTs. These drive circuits are used to selectively provide a current to the base of the BJT that switches the transistor between its \u201con\u201d and \u201coff\u201d states. Structural and operational details of BJTs are discussed in by B. Streetman (2nd edition (1980), chapter 7).","The material that makes up a device can contribute to the operability and usefulness of the device. For example, conventional BJTs are typically formed of silicon (Si), but can also include gallium arsenide (GaAs) and indium phosphide (InP). Silicon carbide (SiC) has also been used as a material for BJTs. SiC has potentially advantageous semiconductor characteristics, for example, a wide bandgap, high electric field breakdown strength, high thermal conductivity, high melting point and high-saturated electron drift velocity. Thus, relative to devices formed in other semiconductor materials, for example, Si, electronic devices formed in SiC may have the capability of operating at higher temperatures, at high power densities, at higher speeds, at higher power levels and\/or under high radiation densities. SiC BJTs are discussed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,945,394 to Palmour et al., and U.S. Pat. No. 6,218,254 to Singh et al.","Due to device properties such as relatively low on-resistance at relatively high current density, positive temperature coefficient (PTC) for the on-resistance, and\/or relatively fast switching speeds, SiC power bipolar junction transistors (BJTs) may be desirable for use in high-power systems. SiC BJTs may have the potential to operate at high temperatures and\/or relatively harsh environments, for example, due to the absence of a gate oxide. However, SiC BJTs typically require a continuous base drive current. Also, while SiC BJTs may provide a relatively high current gain, the open base breakdown voltage may be significantly reduced. The current gain of SiC BJTs may also be limited by recombination in the base, the base-emitter space charge region, and\/or surface recombination.","According to some embodiments of the present invention, a packaged electronic device includes a wide bandgap bipolar driver transistor having a base terminal, a collector terminal, and an emitter terminal, and a wide bandgap bipolar output transistor having a base terminal, a collector terminal, and an emitter terminal. The collector terminal of the output transistor is coupled to the collector terminal of the driver transistor, and the base terminal of the output transistor is coupled to the emitter terminal of the driver transistor to provide a Darlington pair. An area of the output transistor is at least about 3 times greater than an area of the driver transistor in plan view.","In some embodiments, an area ratio of the output transistor to the driver transistor may be between about 3:1 to about 5:1. For example, in some embodiments, the area ratio of the output transistor to the driver transistor may be about 5:1. A blocking voltage of the device may be greater than about 5 kilovolts (kV).","In some embodiments, the device may further include a wide bandgap bipolar avalanche transistor having a base terminal coupled to the base terminal of the output transistor, a collector terminal, a collector terminal coupled to the collector terminal of the output transistor, and an emitter terminal coupled to the emitter terminal of the output transistor.","In some embodiments, the packaged power electronic device may include a substrate of a first conductivity type. The substrate may include a common collector terminal thereon that provides the collector terminals of the driver and output transistors. A drift layer of the first conductivity type is provided on the substrate opposite the common collector terminal. The drift layer may have a lower carrier concentration than that of the substrate.

A region of the first conductivity type may be provided in the base layer at a bottom of the trench between the first and second mesas. The region may have a dopant concentration that is sufficient to electrically isolate the driver transistor and the output transistor from one another.","In some embodiments, a region of the first conductivity type may be provided in the second mesa of the base layer adjacent to the base terminal of the output transistor. The region of the first conductivity type may be electrically connected to the emitter terminal of the output transistor on the second portion of the emitter layer. A portion of the base layer between the region of the first conductivity type therein and the drift layer may be thinner than a portion of the base layer between the second portion of the emitter layer and the drift layer to provide a non-destructive avalanche current path within an active area of the device.","In some embodiments, the driver and output transistors may be silicon carbide (SiC) devices, and the packaged power electronic device may have a current gain of greater than about 300 at room temperature. The current gain of the packaged power electronic device may increase as collector current density of the output transistor increases, and the current gain of the packaged power electronic device may decrease as operating temperature of the device increases.","In some embodiments, the driver transistor may be a second driver transistor, and the device may further include a first driver transistor having a base terminal, a collector terminal, and an emitter terminal. The emitter terminal of the first driver transistor may be coupled to the base terminal of the second driver transistor, and the collector terminal of the first driver transistor may be coupled to the collector terminals of the second driver transistor and the output transistor. The first driver transistor, the second driver transistor, and the output transistor may be silicon carbide (SiC) bipolar junction transistors, and the device may have a current gain of greater than about 10,000.","According to further embodiments of the present invention, a method of fabricating a packaged power electronic device includes providing a wide bandgap bipolar driver transistor having a base terminal, a collector terminal, and an emitter terminal on a substrate, and providing a wide bandgap bipolar output transistor having a base terminal, a collector terminal, and an emitter terminal on the substrate. The collector terminal of the output transistor is coupled to the collector terminal of the driver transistor, and the base terminal of the output transistor is coupled to the emitter terminal of the driver transistor to provide a Darlington pair. In plan view, an area of the output transistor is at least 3 times greater than an area of the driver transistor.","In some embodiments, an area ratio of the output transistor to the driver transistor may be between about 3:1 to about 5:1. For example, in some embodiments, the area ratio of the output transistor to the driver transistor may be about 5:1. A blocking voltage of the device may be greater than about 5 kilovolts (kV).","In some embodiments, the substrate may be of a first conductivity type, and may include a common collector terminal thereon that provides the collector terminals of the driver and output transistors.

The exposed portion of the base layer may be etched to provide the trench therein that defines the first and second electrically isolated mesas thereof.","In some embodiments, the trench may surround a periphery of the driver transistor. A junction termination extension region of the second conductivity type may be provided surrounding a periphery of the output transistor.","In some embodiments, a first region of the second conductivity type may be formed in the drift layer at a bottom of the trench adjacent the first mesa of the base layer, and a second region of the second conductivity type may be formed in the drift layer at the bottom of the trench adjacent the second mesa of the base layer.","In some embodiments, the trench may not extend completely through the base layer. A region of the first conductivity type may be formed in the base layer at a bottom of the trench between the first and second mesas. The region may have a dopant concentration that is sufficient to electrically isolate the driver transistor and the output transistor from one another.","In some embodiments, regions of the second conductivity type may be implanted into the first and second mesas of base layer at edges thereof. The implanted regions may have a greater dopant concentration than other regions of the base layer. The base terminal of the driver transistor may be provided on the implanted region of the first mesa, and the base terminal of the output transistor may be provided on the implanted region of the second mesa. A width of the implanted regions of the second conductivity type in the base layer may be less than about half of a width of the first or second portions of the emitter layer.","In some embodiments, a region of the first conductivity type may be formed in the second mesa of the base layer adjacent to the base terminal of the output transistor. The region of the first conductivity type may be electrically connected to the emitter terminal of the output transistor on the second portion of the emitter layer. A distance between the region of the first conductivity type and the drift layer may be less than a distance between the second portion of the emitter layer and the drift layer to provide a non-destructive avalanche current path within an active area of the device.","In some embodiments, the driver transistor may be a second driver transistor, and a first driver transistor having a base terminal, a collector terminal, and an emitter terminal may be provided on the substrate adjacent thereto.

This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. In the drawings, the size and relative sizes of layers and regions may be exaggerated for clarity.","It will be understood that when an element or layer is referred to as being \u201con\u201d, \u201cconnected to\u201d or \u201ccoupled to\u201d another element or layer, it can be directly on, connected or coupled to the other element or layer or intervening elements or layers may be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being \u201cdirectly on,\u201d \u201cdirectly connected to\u201d or \u201cdirectly coupled to\u201d another element or layer, there are no intervening elements or layers present. As used herein, the term \u201cand\/or\u201d includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.","It will be understood that although the terms first and second are used herein to describe various regions, layers and\/or sections, these regions, layers and\/or sections should not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one region, layer or section from another region, layer or section. Thus, a first region, layer or section discussed below could be termed a second region, layer or section, and similarly, a second region, layer or section may be termed a first region, layer or section without departing from the scope of the present invention.","Furthermore, relative terms, such as \u201clower\u201d or \u201cbottom\u201d and \u201cupper\u201d or \u201ctop,\u201d may be used herein to describe one element's relationship to another element as illustrated in the Figures. It will be understood that relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in addition to the orientation depicted in the Figures. For example, if the device in the Figures is turned over, elements described as being on the \u201clower\u201d side of other elements would then be oriented on \u201cupper\u201d sides of the other elements. The exemplary term \u201clower\u201d can therefore encompass both an orientation of \u201clower\u201d and \u201cupper,\u201d depending of the particular orientation of the figure. Similarly, if the device in one of the figures is turned over, elements described as \u201cbelow\u201d or \u201cbeneath\u201d other elements would then be oriented \u201cabove\u201d the other elements. The exemplary terms \u201cbelow\u201d or \u201cbeneath\u201d can, therefore, encompass both an orientation of above and below.","The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the invention. As used herein, the singular forms \u201ca\u201d, \u201can\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will be further understood that the terms \u201ccomprises,\u201d \u201ccomprising,\u201d \u201cincludes,\u201d and\/or \u201cincluding,\u201d when used in this specification, specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements, and\/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, and\/or groups thereof.","Embodiments of the invention are described herein with reference to cross-sectional illustrations that are schematic illustrations of idealized embodiments of the invention. As such, variations from the shapes of the illustrations as a result, for example, of manufacturing techniques and\/or tolerances, are to be expected. Thus, embodiments of the invention should not be construed as limited to the particular shapes of regions illustrated herein but are to include deviations in shapes that result, for example, from manufacturing. For example, a region illustrated or described as a rectangle may have rounded or curved features due to normal manufacturing tolerances. Thus, the regions illustrated in the figures are schematic in nature and their shapes are not intended to illustrate the precise shape of a region of a device and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.","Unless otherwise defined, all terms (including technical and scientific terms) used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. It will be further understood that terms, such as those defined in commonly used dictionaries, should be interpreted as having a meaning that is consistent with their meaning in the context of this disclosure and the relevant art and will not be interpreted in an idealized or overly formal sense unless expressly so defined herein.","Further improvement in the current gain of SiC BJTs can be achieved by utilizing two or more SiC BJTs connected to provide a Darlington pair, also referred to herein as a Darlington transistor. SiC Darlington transistors may provide a greater current gain, but with an increased forward voltage drop (for example, greater than about 2.7 V) as compared to a SiC BJT, which may make SiC Darlington transistors less attractive for low voltage applications (e.g., less than about 5 kV). However, for high voltage applications (for example, greater than about 5-10 kV) where transistors may typically be operated at higher forward voltages, the offset or increased forward voltage drop of a SiC Darlington transistor may be generally acceptable.","Accordingly, some embodiments of the present invention provide a 10 kV 4H\u2014SiC bipolar Darlington transistor that has a forward voltage drop similar to that of a 10 kV SiC BJT, but with a higher forced current gain (for example, a current gain of about 336 in some embodiments) at room temperature. As such, the current gain of an SiC bipolar Darlington transistor according to some embodiments of the present invention may be more than 10 times higher than that of a 10 kV SiC BJT. The temperature dependence of the on-resistance and the current gain for Darlington transistors according to some embodiments of the present invention are also described in greater detail below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":["FIG. 1A","FIG. 1A"],"b":["10","1","12","2","16","1","12","10","10","10","10","16","2","16","12","1","12","16","2","16","12","1","12","10","1","12","2","16","12","16","10","30"],"i":["b","c","e","c ","c ","b ","e "],"sub":"B "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":["FIG. 1B","FIG. 1C","FIG. 1B","FIGS. 1B and 1C"],"b":["100","100","100","116","112","116","116","112","116","112"]},"As shown in , according to some embodiments of the present invention, the 10 kV SiC Darlington transistor  may be implemented as a monolithic structure that is formed on a bulk single crystal n-type 4H SiC substrate . The right-hand side of  illustrates a cross-sectional view of the output BJT , while the left-hand side of  illustrates a cross-sectional view of the driver BJT . Both BJTs  and  may have a cell pitch of 25 \u03bcm. The layers , , and  of the BJTs  and  may be grown on the n-type 4H\u2014SiC substrate , and all of the layers may be grown in one epitaxial run. In some embodiments, the substrate  may be cut about 8 degrees off-axis prior to growth of the layers , , and\/or  thereon. As used herein, the term \u201coff-axis\u201d refers to a tilt of the substrate surface relative to another surface or plane.","In particular, a layer of n-type conductivity SiC may be provided on the upper surface of the substrate  to form an n drift layer . The carrier concentration of the substrate  is higher than the carrier concentration of the n drift layer . Thus, the SiC substrate  may be referred to as an n substrate. The n-type drift layer  may be about 128 \u03bcm thick, and may have a dopant concentration of, for example, about 5.3\u00d710cm. In contrast, the dopant concentration of the drift layer in conventional 10 kV devices may be on the order of about 5\u00d710cmor more. A p-type base layer  is provided on the n drift layer . The p-type base layer  may be, for example, epitaxially grown following the growth of the n drift layer , and may comprise a p-type conductivity SiC layer having a thickness of about 0.5 \u03bcm. The p-type base layer  may be doped to a concentration of, for example, about 6\u00d710cm, and may include p regions \u2032 therein having a higher dopant concentration for the base contact. An n SiC emitter layer  is provided on the p-type base layer . The n emitter layer  may be about 2 \u03bcm thick, and may be heavily doped with, for example, nitrogen. With regard to the carrier concentrations, the p and n conductivity type regions and epitaxial layers described above may be as heavily doped as possible without causing excessive fabrication defects. Suitable dopants for producing the p-type regions include aluminum, boron or gallium. Suitable dopants for producing the n-type regions include nitrogen and phosphorus.","Still referring to , the n emitter layer  may be patterned, for example, using reactive ion etching (RIE), to form the emitter \u201cfingers\u201d and of the driver BJT  and the output BJT , respectively. The widths of the emitter fingers \/and the p regions \u2032 may be about 10 micrometers (\u03bcm) and about 5 \u03bcm, respectively. The base layer  may also be patterned to provide a trench  that electrically isolates the driver BJT  and the output BJT . In particular, the base layer  may be etched to form electrically isolated mesas and with a spacing or gap  of about 4 \u03bcm or less, such that both BJTs  and  are shielded from each other in the OFF state. In some embodiments, additional p regions \u2032 may be implanted or otherwise provided in the n-type drift layer  at a base or bottom of the trench  adjacent each of the mesas and , as shown in , to provide improved isolation between the driver BJT \u2032 and the output BJT \u2032, thereby increasing the blocking voltage of the Darlington transistor \u2032. The p regions \u2032 may be spaced apart by a distance of about 2-3 \u03bcm or less. In other embodiments, as shown in , the base layer  may not be completely etched-through to define the trench  therein, and a lightly doped n-type region \u2033 may be implanted or otherwise provided in the base layer  at a bottom of the trench  between the mesas and to provide isolation between the driver BJT \u2033 and the output BJT \u2033 of the Darlington transistor \u2033.","As shown in , a 900 \u03bcm wide p-type junction termination extension (JTE)  is implemented around the periphery of the active area of the output BJT  to reduce the electric field crowding under reverse bias. Surface passivation may be performed by a wet thermal oxidation for about 2 hours at greater than about 1000\u00b0 C., followed by a one hour argon (Ar) annealing, and then nitrogen oxygen (NO) re-annealing at about 1175\u00b0 C. for about three hours. After thermal oxidation, 1 \u03bcm silicon dioxide and 500 nm silicon nitride may be deposited by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) to protect the thermal passivation layer.","Referring again to , ohmic contacts are formed on the n silicon carbide emitter fingers and to define the emitter terminals and for the driver and output BJTs  and , respectively. Ohmic contacts are also formed on the p regions \u2032 of the base layer  to define the base terminals and for the driver and output BJTs  and , respectively. For example, after patterning the field oxide layer provided by the PECVD process, the ohmic contacts may be formed on the emitter layer  and the base layer  by sintering nickel (Ni) and aluminum\/titanium (Al\/Ti) films, respectively. Two metal systems with relatively thick titanium\/gold layers may be used. For example, the first metallization may connect the base regions \u2032 through a bus, while the second metallization may connect the interdigitized emitter fingers \/. An ohmic contact is further formed on the lower surface of the substrate  to provide a collector terminal \/for both the driver BJT  and the output BJT .","Accordingly, as shown on the left-hand side of , the n-type substrate , the n-type drift layer , the p-type mesa , and the n-type emitter finger define the driver BJT . Likewise, as shown on the right-hand side of , the n-type substrate , the n-type drift layer , the p-type mesa , and the n-type emitter finger define the output BJT . The ohmic contact \/on n substrate  opposite the drift layer  provides the collector terminals for both the driver BIT  and the output BJT , as well as the collector terminal of the 10 kV SiC Darlington transistor . A conductive line  electrically connects the base terminals of the output BJT  to the emitter terminal of the driver BJT . The contact on the p region \u2032 of the base layer  provides the base terminal of the 10 kV SiC Darlington transistor , and the contact on the emitter finger provides the emitter terminal of the 10 kV SiC Darlington transistor .","The area ratio of the output BJT  as compared to the driver BJT  may affect the current gain of Darlington transistors according to some embodiments of the present invention. As used herein, the term \u201carea ratio\u201d refers to the relative footprint of the output transistor on a wafer or substrate as compared to that of the driver transistor in plan view. For example, a comparatively large driver BJT may provide a higher current gain at lower current densities, but the gain may be sharply reduced at higher current densities. Some embodiments of the present invention provide a SiC Darlington transistor where the area or footprint of the output BIT  is many times greater than that of the driver BJT . For example, in some embodiments, the area ratio of the output BJT  to the driver BJT  may be approximately 5:1; in other embodiments, the area ratio of the output BJT  to the driver BJT  may be approximately 4:1; and in still other embodiments, the area ratio of the output BJT  to the driver BJT  may be approximately 3:1. However, embodiments of the present invention may include output-to-driver transistor area ratios within a range of about 3:1 to about 5:1, which may be critical to providing the higher current gains described herein. In particular, the current gain of a Darlington transistor whose constituent output and driver transistors have an output-to-driver transistor area ratio of between about 3:1 to about 5:1 may provide a greater current gain than a Darlington pair with an output-to-driver transistor area ratio of greater than about 5:1, as well as a greater current gain than a Darlington pair with an output-to-driver transistor area ratio of less than about 3:1. Thus, in order to provide higher current gain and reduce the required base current according to some embodiments of the present invention, the output-to-driver transistor area ratio should be within the critical ranges described herein.","Referring again to , the Darlington die  may have a chip size of about 4.2 mm by about 4.2 mm, with an active area of about 3.7 mm(including the area occupied by both the output BJTs  on the die  and the driver BJTs  on the die ). SiC BJTs with a similar chip size were also fabricated in conjunction with the SiC Darlington transistor  on the same wafer for purposes of comparison, as described below with reference to the experimental results illustrated in the graphs of .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIGS. 1A-1C","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":"100","sub":["B, BJT ","B, BJT","B, Darlington ","B, Darlington","CE ","CE"],"sup":["2 ","2","2","2","2","2","2","2 ","2"]},"Still referring to , SiC Darlington transistors according to some embodiments of the present invention provide a higher current gain than a single SiC BJT. In particular, power SiC Darlington transistors according to some embodiments of the present invention may be operated in the saturation or the quasi-saturation region, where the forward drop and, hence, the conduction losses may be lower. The current gain under these operation conditions is typically referred to as the forced current gain (\u03b2). The forced current gain \u03b2may be approximately equal to the product of the driver transistor current gain \u03b2and the output transistor current gain \u03b2(e.g., \u03b2\u2248\u03b2\u00d7\u03b2), where the driver transistor operates in its active region, and where the output transistor operates in its saturation or quasi-saturation region. As used herein, the \u201ccurrent gain\u201d of the driver and output transistors refers to the ratio of their respective collector currents (I) to their respective base currents (I). In other words, \u03b2=I\/I, and \u03b2=I\/I. The forced current gain of a Darlington transistor according to some embodiments of the present invention \u03b2may be approximately equal to I\/I.","As shown in , Darlington transistors according to some embodiments of the present invention may have a forced current gain \u03b2of about 336 and a base current Iof about 4 mA at power dissipation density of about 200 W\/cm, as compared to a forced current gain \u03b2of about 30 for a SiC BJT under similar conditions. The gain could be even higher and higher collector current levels when both driver and output BJTs of the Darlington transistor according to some embodiments of the present invention operate in the active region. For example, a forced current gain of about 1100 was measured on Darlington transistor according to some embodiments of the present invention at a collector current density of about 120 A\/cm, as compared to a forced current gain of about 43 for a SiC BJT under similar conditions. Accordingly, Darlington transistors according to some embodiments of the present invention provide a forced current gain many times that of a conventional SiC BJT. As such, Darlington transistors according to some embodiments of the present invention may be operated with a reduced base current as compared to a single BJT in high voltage applications, which may reduce power consumption of the driver circuit.","The blocking characteristics of SiC Darlington transistors according to some embodiments of the present invention are also shown in . As used herein, a \u201cblocking voltage\u201d refers to the voltage that may be applied across the collector and the emitter of a transistor when the transistor is in its \u201coff\u201d state without significant leakage current flowing through collector and the emitter. The \u201cbreakdown voltage\u201d of a transistor refers to the voltage applied across collector and the emitter of the transistor in its \u201coff\u201d state at which significant leakage current starts to flow. In particular, the open-emitter blocking voltage (BV) for a Darlington transistor according to some embodiments of the present invention was measured to be about 10 kV at a leakage current of less than about 1 mA\/cm. The open-base blocking voltage (BV) for a Darlington transistor according to some embodiments of the present invention was less than about 9.5 kV at the same leakage current. It is noted that Darlington transistors according to some embodiments of the present invention may have a reverse blocking voltage that is about 2 kV lower than a comparable BJT fabricated on the same or similar wafer with a similar die size. However, the structures of  may provide improved isolation between the driver BJT and the output BJT due to the implanted p-type regions \u2032 and n-type regions \u2033 therein, respectively, which may increase the blocking voltage in some embodiments.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0070"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["300","310"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0071"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"sub":["forced ","sp, on ","sp, on ","forced","sp, on ","forced ","sp, on ","forced ","sp, on ","forced "],"b":["405","415"],"sup":"2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0072"},"figref":["FIGS. 5 and 6","FIG. 5","FIG. 6","FIG. 1B","FIG. 5","FIG. 6"],"b":["52","54","56","58","100","100","100","54","54","60","56","56","112","116","100","100","60","56","56","56","60","56","56","56","112","116","100"],"sup":"+","i":["d ","o ","d ","o "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0074","num":"0073"},"figref":"FIG. 7A","b":"10"},"As shown in , the SiC Darlington transistor \u2032\u2033 includes a SiC NPN driver BJT Q  connected to a SiC NPN output BJT Q  in a manner similar to that described above with reference to .
