title: System and method for optimizing network capacity in a cellular wireless network
abstract: A system and method is disclosed for increasing the efficiency of a cellular communication network, reduce ongoing operating costs and increase revenue. According to one aspect, a method is disclosed for increasing the efficiency of a cellular communication network whereby network capacity in the radio access network (RAN) and baseband processing for wireless connections are dynamically adjusted to automatically provision sufficient bandwidth and baseband processing capacity in response to changes in the network. The method is further extended by implementing policy management which allows wireless carriers to develop and implement network based policies to automatically increase or decrease the amount of processing resources and network bandwidth required from any cell site, hub or mobile switching office. According to another aspect, network efficiency is enhanced by utilizing a novel cellular network infrastructure. RF signals from cell site antennas of various technology types are demodulated, digital bit information is extracted from the RF signals, processed, and groomed into Gigabit Ethernet/Resilient Packet Ring (GigE/RPR) or Ethernet over copper traffic flows using specific Quality of Service (QoS) priorities. The GigE/RPR traffic flows are routed to hub sites or mobile switching offices, at which point the packetized information is extracted and converted to RF signals that are equivalent to the signals that were received at the antenna. The RF signals are sent over coaxial cable to a network hub including a pool of Base Transceiver Stations (BTSs) (or Node Bs). The hub is coupled to one or more mobile switching offices via a second fiber optic ring.

No. 60\/445,388 filed on Feb. 6, 2003.","The present invention relates generally to improvements to cellular wireless communication networks, and more particularly to a novel network infrastructure and method for increasing efficiency in a cellular wireless communication network.","Cellular wireless networks are designed to support voice and data services and are generally known to include a \u201cnetwork infrastructure\u201d that facilitates wireless communications with mobile stations operating within a respective service coverage area. The network infrastructure typically includes a plurality of base stations dispersed throughout the service coverage area, each of which supports wireless communications within a respective cell (or set of sectors). The base stations couple to base station controllers (BSCs), with each BSC serving a plurality of base stations. Each BSC couples to a mobile switching center (MSC), which also couples to the public switching network (PTSN), the Internet and\/or other MSCs.","Wireless interface standards have been promulgated to standardize wireless communications between the mobile terminals and the base stations of the network infrastructure. Wireless interface standards include, for example, the Advanced Mobile Phone Service (AMPS) standards, the Global System for Mobile telecommunications (GSM) standards, the Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) standards, the Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) standards, General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) standards and the ENHANCED DATA rates for Global EVOLUTION (EDGE) standards. Generations of these standards are generally referred to as first generation (1G), second generation (2G), third generation (3G), fourth generation (4G), etc. Each advancing generation of standards typically supports a greater number of services, a greater number of features, and provides better communication qualities. Resultantly, network infrastructures supporting these superior service offerings must provide increased performance levels, both from a network infrastructure perspective and from a wireless link perspective.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["102","104","1","104","2","106","102","104","106","108","110","108","110"]},"The legacy network infrastructure  shown includes DS3\/DS1\/DS0 cross-connect systems (DCS) for routing traffic around the MSO, echo cancellation systems for voice enhancements, channel banks to transport signaling links, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) concentrators and Internet Protocol (IP) routers for handling data traffic. The legacy infrastructure connects to a Network Operations Center (NOC)  that runs network management software to control the network, and also connects to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN)  to allow calls to\/from the wired network. Call signaling for setting up and tearing down calls is accomplished using Signaling System  (SS) .","Modern cellular wireless communication systems, such as the one shown in , use digital technology and associated methods to transfer information between the various network elements. For example, at the mobile station (MS) , voice is digitized and compressed and the resulting bit stream is combined with data from applications and digital control information. The combined bit stream is encoded and modulated onto an assigned radio frequency carrier and transmitted over the air to antennas  connected to respective base transceiver stations . The base transceiver station  demodulates the received signals, extracts the bit stream and decodes the digital information. The decoded digital information is then transported over terrestrial facilities (via T1 or E1 lines) to a base station controller  for processing. After processing, the base station controller  forwards the information associated with voice communications to a mobile switching center  for connection to other mobile switches or to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) . Data traffic is sent to the GSN . The base station controller  manages radio access network (RAN) functions such as roaming and handoffs. The process is reversed for information flowing from the network to the mobile station (MS) .","One drawback of prior art communication systems, such as the one shown in , is that as cellular wireless networks migrate to 3rd Generation (3G) systems, it is expected that the number of base transceiver stations will increase dramatically by a factor of two or three. This increases the complexity of the control, management and maintenance of the network.","Another drawback of prior art communication systems is that the underlying network infrastructure is based on T1\/E1 and SONET\/SDH standards, which are fixed in nature and cannot react to changes in demand due to mobile network conditions.","A further drawback of prior art communication systems, as exemplified in , is that the network cannot intelligently transport antenna traffic to and from the base transceiver station  and efficiently aggregate the traffic associated with different technologies at a cell site.","From the disclosure above, the present invention recognizes that there is a need for a high capacity, scalable network infrastructure for use in the radio access network (RAN) with the ability to dynamically adjust capacity, intelligently route and transport traffic between antennas, base transceiver stations, hubs, and mobile switching offices.","A system and method is disclosed for increasing the efficiency of a cellular communication network, reduce ongoing operating costs and increase revenue.","According to one aspect, a method for increasing the efficiency of a cellular communication network is disclosed whereby network capacity in the RAN and baseband processing for wireless connections are dynamically adjusted to automatically provision sufficient bandwidth and baseband processing capacity in response to changes in the network. The method is referred to by the inventors as Continuous Network Optimization (CNO). The CNO method of network optimization is further extended by implementing policy management which allows wireless carriers to develop and implement network based policies to automatically increase or decrease the amount of processing resources and network bandwidth required from any cell site, hub or mobile switching office.","According to another aspect, network efficiency is enhanced by utilizing a novel cellular network infrastructure. Briefly described, the network infrastructure includes a novel MIC2010\u2122 Remote Radio Unit (RRU) disposed at each cell site. The RRUs are essentially packet transceiver systems which perform, inter alia, low-level RF processing functions normally associated with a base station transceiver. The RRUs are configured to (1) receive RF\/IF signals from co-located cell site antennas, (2) demodulate RF\/IF signals received from the antennas to extract the bit-stream generated and transmitted from a mobile station, and (3) perform signal conditioning, digital processing and packetization on the demodulated bit stream. The packetized demodulated bit stream (traffic) is sent from each RRU to a hub over a fiber packet ring or high-speed copper pair(s). The hub includes a novel MIC2022\u2122 Traffic Consolidator Unit (TCU) and a pool of conventional base transceiver stations (BTSs) (or Node Bs). The packetized traffic is received at the hub for depacketization and conversion back to an RF signal that is equivalent to the RF signal received at the antenna. Conversion back to an RF signal is a necessary step in order to connect to existing BTSs (or Node Bs). Alternatively, the packetized signal can be sent directly to a next generation BTS (or Node B) that supports a packet interface, eliminating the need to convert back to an RF signal. The RF signal is then fed to a base transceiver station (BTS) for processing. The output of the BTS is assembled for transport to the base station controller over T1 (or E1) facilities. The T1 (or E1) signals are packetized and output over a second fiber-optic packet ring to a base station controller (BSC) located in a mobile switching office (MSO). The MSO includes a TCU which receives the packetized T1 (or E1) signal from the hub via the second fiber packet ring and converts the T1\/E1 signal to a channelized circuit-switched T1\/E1 signal that connects to a base station controller (BSC) or Radio Network Controller (RNC). The novel network infrastructure advantageously reduces overall operations costs, enables sharing of network resources and increases network-level reliability.","The invention additionally provides, according to a further aspect, an integrated test and performance monitoring module which advantageously simplifies operations, test and performance monitoring.","It will also be recognized that the present techniques may be readily adapted to various existing systems, such as 2G and 3G mobile networks like GSM, CDMA, WiFi, or UMTS, and the like, as well as other communication systems.","In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention, a communication network provides wireless communication services, such as wireless data communication services, to a plurality of mobile stations operating within the communication network. Stated specifically, in accordance with one aspect, a novel network infrastructure is disclosed for increasing the efficiency of the network. In accordance with another aspect, a continuous network optimization algorithm is disclosed for further enhancing the efficiency of the network in the context of the novel network infrastructure.","The system of the present invention provides many important advantages and efficiencies over prior systems. By utilizing the novel network infrastructure of the invention, overall operations costs are reduced, sharing of radio and network bandwidth resources is enabled and the reliability of the access network is increased. More specific advantages include the substantial elimination of stranded radio capacity, network capacity and baseband processing by automatically adjusting and optimizing network resources responsive to the behavior of the network. A further advantage of the invention is the reduction in backhaul transport costs by 50% or more. Such reduced costs may be realized by supporting alternative backhaul methods over dark fiber or high-speed copper pairs. In addition to a realized cost benefit, by transporting over dark fiber, failures associated with T1 (or E1) facilities are also eliminated. Another advantage of the invention is realized through the incorporation of auto-detection and auto-provisioning capabilities which substantially eliminates the time needed to provide new bandwidth to cell sites, hub and mobile switching offices. A further advantage of the invention is an ability to groom and route traffic based on various indicia, including but not limited to (a) traffic types (i.e., RF signals from various antennas, (b) technology types, and (c) service providers. The groomed (segregated) traffic allows for transportation over packet ring or copper pair using Quality of Service flows. Another advantage of the invention is the support of alternative network architectures, for example, in one embodiment, a multiplicity of base station transceivers are resident at a central location (hub) to facilitate sharing of baseband processing resources to accommodate dynamic changes in network behavior. A still further advantage of the invention is the reduction in the number of cell sites and base station transceivers for a given area. This is achieved through a combination of using smart antennas at the various cell sites in communication with centralized base station transceivers under control of the continuous network optimization (CNO) process. Yet another advantage of the invention is the reduction in cell site and mobile switching office complexity. Specifically, a remote radio unit (RRU), disposed at a remote cell site, streamlines cell site architecture by reducing the number of individual components.","Further, a traffic consolidator unit (TCU) streamlines the mobile switching office by consolidating legacy functionality. This is accomplished by incorporating DS3\/DS1\/DS0\/Subrate cross-connect functions into the TCU architecture. Another advantage of the invention is a reduction in the frequency of network failures experienced on T1 facilities, which improves service quality. This is achieved by incorporating a capability to dynamically adjust the bandwidth and baseband processing allocated to cell sites and compensate for changes in the mobile network. A still further advantage, is that by implementing auto-detection and auto-provisioning, operations costs are reduced and service introduction intervals are significantly reduced.","In an operation according to the present invention, RF signals from cell site antennas of various technology types (e.g. UMTS (WCDMA), cdma2000, GSM, GPRS, EDGE, 802.11x, public safety, etc.) are demodulated, digital bit information is extracted from the RF signals, processed, and groomed into Gigabit Ethernet\/Resilient Packet Ring (GigE\/RPR) or Ethernet over copper traffic flows using specific Quality of Service (QoS) priorities. The GigE\/RPR traffic flows are routed to hub sites or mobile switching offices, at which point the packetized information is extracted and converted to RF signals that are equivalent to the signals that were received at the antenna. The RF signals are sent over coaxial cable to a pool of Base Transceiver Stations (BTSs) (or Node Bs).","In the reverse direction, RF signals containing a digital bit stream are sent over the coaxial cable from the base station transceiver (BTS) in a hub. The RF signals are demodulated and the bit stream extracted, packetized and groomed into GigE\/RPR traffic flows. The GigE\/RPR flows terminate at the cell sites where the bit steam is reassembled from the packets, converted to RF signals and sent to the antenna for broadcast to the mobile stations.","In one embodiment, the BTSs (or Node Bs) are next generation BTSs and are configured to directly receive the packetized GigE\/RPR traffic flows thereby eliminating the complex and costly RF subsystems in the BTS (or Node B).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","121","123","101","102","103","131","134","200","136","138","140","136","121","123","150","136","155","1","155","2","160"]},"As stated above, communication network  is bi-directional. That is, in a reverse direction, traffic flows coming from the Traffic Consolidator Unit  into the Remote Radio Units (RRUs) - from the packet ring  are analyzed to determine if the traffic should terminate on a first Remote Radio Unit or be allowed to pass through to the next Remote Radio Unit on the ring. If the traffic is destined for the current Remote Radio Unit, packets are fed into an RRU QoS\/RPR processing function that is a software subprocess that runs on the Applications Processor. The QoS\/RPR process determines the destination and associated priority of the packet traffic in order to terminate or pass through to the next node. This is part of the RPR protocol capability and is preferably implemented as a software process that runs on the Applications Processor.","It is further noted that communication system  can be a multi-frequency, multi technology wireless access network providing cellular, PCS and wireless data coverage via a distributed fiber access system. Communication system  can accommodate current wireless technologies such as TDMA, CDMA, GSM, as well as next generation 3G wireless protocols such as GPRS, 1XRTT, EDGE, 3XRTT, and W-CDMA. 802.11x is also supported.","Remote Radio Units RRU  through RRU  are capable of communicating with a plurality of mobile stations (MS) - via the cell site antennas -. The air interface standard can conform to any suitable standard or protocol, and may enable both voice and data traffic, such as data traffic enabling Internet access and web page downloads.","Mobile stations - may be any suitable wireless communication devices, including conventional cellular telephones, PCS handset devices, portable computers, telemetry devices, and the like, which are capable of communicating with the remote radio units via the cell site antennas. Other types of access terminals, including fixed access terminals, also may be present in wireless network . However, for the sake of simplicity, only mobile stations are shown.","Reference is now made to , which shows a flowchart diagram of a method for transporting digital bit streams extracted from radio frequency (RF) signals between antennas and processing elements in a wireless communications network.","At act , a mobile station (MS), e.g., MS , transmits an RF modulated encoded baseband traffic bit stream to a cell site antenna At act , the cell site antenna captures the RF signal.","At act , it is determined whether the RF network capacity requires adjustment. If true, the process continues at act , otherwise the process continues at act . To make such a determination, the RRU connects to the RF Front End\/Smart Antenna with an RF interface (coax cable) and a control link (e.g. RS-232 or other standard interface). The status of the RF domain is obtained from the control link and is used as input for the CNO parameters. The RF status obtained from the control link will provide status indicators of low (less than 40% usage), average (\u02dc50% usage), or high (at capacity, more RF channels required) for RF activity.","At act , the CNO adjusts the RF network capacity. The CNO detects if a change in RF capacity has been made by the smart antenna.","At act , the RRU, e.g. RRU  processes the RF modulated signal to extract the encoded baseband traffic bit stream.","At act , the RRU  packetizes the encoded baseband traffic bit stream for transmission over a fiber packet ring.","At act , it is determined whether the network capacity, as distinguished from the RF network capacity at act , requires adjustment. (Note: the RRU does adjust \u201cnetwork-side\u201d capacity by increasing or decreasing the required bandwidth for transport to the hub). If true, the process continues at act , otherwise the process continues at act . The determination is made by utilizing the RF capacity indications of low, average, or high from act . The previously obtained RF capacity indications translate into specific bandwidth increments that can be programmed (adjusted) by the customer, or invoked automatically using preset policies.","At act , the continuous network optimization (CNO) application adjusts the network capacity.","At act , the TCU  extracts the encoded baseband traffic bit stream from the packets.","At act , it is determined whether an existing BTS (or Node B)  in the hub requires an RF interface or if a next generation BTS\/Node B is used that accepts a packet interface. In other words, it must be determined whether the BTS is a legacy system that requires an RF interface or if it is a next generation version that can accept a packet interface. This can be determined when the TCU  is installed in a hub and it is connected to the BTSs.","At act , the TCU  converts the encoded baseband traffic bit stream to an RF signal.","At act , it is determined whether an adjustment is required for the baseband processing capacity. If true, the process continues at act , otherwise the process continues at act .","At act , the continuous network optimization module adjusts the baseband processing capacity.","At act , the BTS, extracts the encoded baseband traffic bit stream to perform baseband processing.","At act , the TCU  in the hub packetizes the processed baseband traffic bit stream for transmission to the MSO .","At act , it is determined whether the network capacity requires adjustment. If true, the process continues at act , otherwise the process continues at act .","At act , the continuous network optimization module adjusts the network capacity.","At act , the TCU, e.g., TCU 170-1 in the MSO 155-1 depacketizes, formats and routes the traffic bit stream to the BSC, e.g., BSC 180-1 and MSC, e.g, MSC 190-1.","Table I below illustrates a comparison of bit rates for existing cell sites and bit rates in accordance with the invention. The invention supports interface flexibility by supporting 100 Mbps over a single copper pair as well as up to 1 Gbps over fiber to cell sites. These alternatives are less expensive from an operation expense perspective than current methods. In addition, the invention supports wireless specific interfaces such as GSM Abis and UMTS Iub. The advantage of this approach is that significantly more bandwidth can be supported to cell sites in comparison to what is available today. Support for GSM and UMTS interfaces enables intelligent grooming of traffic by being able to recognize active and idle channels.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE I"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},"Existing Network",{},"Invention","OPEX per"]},{"entry":[{},"Bit Rate","OPEX per month","Bit Rates","Month"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Cellsite to Hub or","(T1) 1.5 Mbps \u00d7 N","$300 to","Up to 100 Mbps","$50 to $100"]},{"entry":["MSO","(N = 2 to 6)","$1000 per",{},"per copper"]},{"entry":[{},{},"T1",{},"pair"]},{"entry":["Cellsite to Hub or","(DS3\/T3) 45 Mbps","$3500 to","Up to 1 Gbps","Dark Fiber:"]},{"entry":["MSO",{},"$5,000 per",{},"No monthly"]},{"entry":[{},{},"DS3",{},"OPEX"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"Upfront cost"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"Paid as"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"CAPEX"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["101","103","101","103","131","134","104","101","103","101","103","402"]},"MIC2010-Remote Radio Unit (RRU)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0069"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["101","103","101","103","51","53","55","1","55","2","55","3","57","59","61","63","53","110"]},"A.

A more complete description of the rolling wave policy is provided below.","Three main sub-processes are used to implement continuous network optimization (CNO) and are described as follows.","I. RF Capacity Detection (RFCD) Sub-process","To determine if an increase\/decrease in RF capacity has occurred in the Smart Antenna , the CNO  RFCD sub-process operates with the RF Front-End control function located within the RRU -. The RF Front-End control function, in turn, operates with the RF Front-End\/Smart Antenna complex. The RRU - RF Front-End control function detects if the Smart Antenna has increased or decreased RF capacity using a control link. The RRU interfaces to the RF Front-End\/Smart Antenna complex with an RF or Intermediate Frequency (IF) signal via a coaxial cable and a separate control link such as an RS-232 interface. Control and status information is exchanged over the control link from the RRU to the RF Front-End\/Antenna.","In operation, the CNO  RFCD sub-process monitors the RF traffic capacity requirements by monitoring a set of parameters, defined below, and uses this information to determine if an increase\/decrease in RF activity has occurred. The status of the current RF traffic capacity is fed into the CNO  Network Capacity Detection and Adjustment (NCDA) sub-process (See item II).","It is noted that the CNO  RFCD sub-process can operate with either conventional antennas and\/or smart antennas to provide improvements in signal quality which enables an increase in the number of users or higher data rates from existing users.","Table II lists several parameters that are used by the CNO  RFCD sub-process to monitor the RF traffic capacity. The parameters listed in Table II are compared to predefined thresholds and decisions are made based on the comparison.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0117","num":"0130"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"98pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"119pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE II"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Parameter","Parameter Definition"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Digital Signal Level Monitor","monitors the RF signal after it is"]},{"entry":[{},"converted to a digital signal."]},{"entry":["RF Front End Antenna","monitors RF Front-End and\/or"]},{"entry":["Monitor","antenna presence"]},{"entry":["RF Carrier Capacity Indicator","Monitors active carriers"]},{"entry":["Network Capacity channel","Monitors active\/idle network channels"]},{"entry":"indicator"},{"entry":["Congestion_indicator","Monitors network congestion level"]},{"entry":["Alarm_Threshold_monitor","Monitors various alarms and"]},{"entry":[{},"thresholds that trigger events"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"II. Network Capacity Detection and Adjustment (NCDA) Sub-process","The NCDA sub-process uses the RF capacity status information obtained from the RFCD sub-process defined above to determine if a change in network-side capacity is required. If it is determined that a change in network bandwidth is necessary, the NCDA sub-process automatically adjusts the bandwidth between the following sites: (1) Cellsite and hub, (2) Hub to Mobile Switching Office (MSO), (3) Hub to hub, (4) MSO to MSO.","III. Baseband Processing Distribution and Adjustment (BPDA) Sub-process","The Baseband Processing Distribution and Adjustment (BPDA) sub-process uses RF capacity and network status information obtained from the RFCD sub-process and NDCA sub-process, respectively, to determine what level of baseband processing resources are required. The TCU  connects to a number of existing BTSs (or Node Bs) - or next generation BTSs that incorporate a packet interface and do not require an RF signal, to enable sharing of baseband processing resources.","The CNO  BPDA sub-process is the basis for the Virtual Baseband Processing capability. By placing the BTS (or Node B) resources into hub locations, as illustrated in , the TCU  an more efficiently access these resources and share them as baseband processing capacity requirements increase or decrease. This creates a pooling capability that helps to reduce underutilized BTS (or Node B) resources.","Policy Management","To utilize the features of Continuous Network Optimization (CNO), policies are created and imposed on the network to meet a variety of needs. Generally, policies are created for scheduled and unscheduled localized events and for loss of network resources. It is understood that policies to meet needs other than those described herein are within contemplation of the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0125","num":"0138"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIG. 13"],"b":["200","1302","1200","1302","1302","1","1302","2","1302","5","200","1302","1","1302","2","1302","3","1302","4","1302","5"]},"In operation, the policies are managed by the policy management module  which receives network status information from the CNO  and in response, issues requests for network changes to the CNO .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0127","num":"0140"},"figref":"FIG. 14","b":["1302","1200","101","103","101","103","1302","1200","1200","138","1302","1200"]},"Depending on which policy is implemented, certain parameters are used to provide status information. Values for the parameters are derived from various hardware components, other software processes in the RRU, or assigned by a network operator during the provisioning of the network. For example, for an alternate routing policy, the primary hub ( ) and backup hub ( ) parameters will be used to determine how packets should be sent through the network. These values would be derived from the Management System and contain the destination address of the primary and backup hubs.","The parameters, according to one embodiment, include:","maximum and minimum bandwidth( )","bandwidth increment( )","day( )","date( )","time( )","policy duration( ) (that the policy is in effect)","adjacent cells( )","maximum bandwidth threshold( )","minimum bandwidth threshold( )","maximum baseband processing( )","minimum baseband processing( )","maximum baseband processing threshold( )","minimum baseband processing threshold( )","primary hub( )","backup hub( ),","applicable CNO parameters defined above, and","user defined parameters( ).","These parameters are used by the CNO process  to adjust the bandwidth and baseband process capacity in the network. The CNO process  receives constant updates on the status of the RF portion of the network and the baseband processing capacity. The CNO process reads the values of policy parameters and compares them to the current settings in the network to determine if an adjustment is required and how to make the adjustment.","1Policy\u2014Rolling Wave","The Rolling Wave policy is used to maintain bandwidth and processing resources throughout the network where usage patterns mimic a rolling wave. The inventors have identified that the demand for resources in a cell rise and fall over a period of time and moves, in wavelike fashion, to adjacent cells. This type of pattern characterizes rush hour traffic. The rolling wave policy is typically applied to cells along a specific path. For example, in the morning at the start of the rush-hour, resources are increased at the first cell and then to each successive cell in the path as the traffic builds along the path. Resources at the first cell are decreased as the rush-hour traffic subsides and moves to each cell along the path. The pattern is reversed for the afternoon rush-hour traffic. The policy can be implemented by increasing resources based on a schedule or it can be done dynamically in response to the subscribers demands for service.","The policy may be otherwise implemented by adding a fixed amount of bandwidth based on a schedule with additional bandwidth added dynamically to meet fluctuating demand.","Rolling Wave Policy Example","One specific example of how the rolling wave policy may be implemented is as follows. Consider a network of cell sites configured to cover a major traffic corridor between an urban business district and the suburbs. Commuters travel along the corridor toward the city in the mornings and away from the city in the afternoon. The rush-hour commute can be two to three hours. During this time, the cell sites along the corridor experience an increase in demand for bandwidth as the rush-hour traffic increases and mobile users pass through each cell along the route. As the rush-hour winds down, the commuter traffic decreases and so does the bandwidth demand in the cells. This pattern of increase and decrease in bandwidth occurs in the cells along the traffic corridor like a moving wave. In the face of this \u201crolling wave\u201d of mobile users, the CNO works to maintain a level of bandwidth in each cell based on the policies established by the network operator. In general, the \u201crolling wave\u201d policy is used to change the bandwidth at each cell site and processing capacity at the hub in response to changes in the demand for service by mobile users. At the start of the rush-hour, the CNO process will detect an increase in mobile connections at the first cell along the corridor. This can be done by sensing an increase in RF signals, an increase in the number of service requests on the mobile control channel, an increase in the number of active channels or from messages from an external operations system. The CNO process reports the increased activity to the policy management system. The policy management system determines if the \u201crolling wave\u201d policy is applicable and passes the configuration parameters to the CNO process. The CNO will adjust the bandwidth based on the policy parameters in response to the conditions in the radio access network. This continues for the duration of the policy or until the receipt of new instructions from the policy management system. In the morning rush-hour commute the rolling wave policy begins at a cell in the suburbs designated by the network operator. In the afternoon it will begin at a cell at the edge of the city designated by the network operator. The CNO process will increase the bandwidth of the network connection at the first cell, instruct the hub site to increase the processing capacity if necessary, and instruct the adjacent cells to increase the network bandwidth at their sites. This is in anticipation of the increase in mobile traffic that will be passing through the cells. The CNO process continues to monitor the mobile RF traffic until it falls below the established threshold signaling the end of the rush-hour.","2Policy\u2014Local Event","Another policy that may be implemented is the so-called \u201clocal event\u201d policy which can be a scheduled local event or an unscheduled local event. A scheduled local event can be, for example, a concert, festival, sporting event, trade show or conference. These events are characterized by an increase in demand for resources in a defined area of a few city blocks, a neighborhood, or metro area. The demand will be experienced for several hours and then dissipate or it can fluctuate daily for one to two weeks. A policy for this type of event will allow scheduling the addition of network resources for the duration of the event. By contrast, an unscheduled local event can be, for example, a localized disaster caused by fire, hazardous spill, or terrorist attack. When the CNO process detects an increased demand for resources in the affected areas, the policy will direct CNO to increase network resources to those areas. The policy will also allow the network operator to decide how much of the available resources will be devoted to emergency traffic. This can be done by reserving some resources for emergency traffic or recovering resources in use and directing them to emergency traffic. The CNO process will have the capability of detecting and reporting increased emergency traffic.","3Policy\u2014Network Outages","Network outages can be scheduled or unscheduled events. Scheduled network outage events typically occur when equipment is removed from service for planned maintenance. A policy for this will shift resources from the affected cell or cells to the adjacent cells in anticipation of increased traffic from those cells. By contrast, an unscheduled network outage event typically occurs when equipment is removed from service due to failure or unplanned maintenance.","4Policy\u2014Grooming and Routing","Grooming and routing policies are used to change the path of traffic through the access network between cell site antennas and hub sites where the pool of BTSs (or Node Bs) are located and between hub sites and MSOs. The grooming and routing policies are used to route traffic between cell site antennas and backup hubs in the event of a failure at the primary hub. If there is a failure at an MSO the policies can also be used to route traffic between hubs and backup MSOs. The policies will include information to determine location of backup sites, location of BTSs, minimum and maximum bandwidth between sites and optional parameters defined by the network operator.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0159","num":"0172"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},"5Policy\u2014Priority Access","Priority access policies are used to determine how the radio access network will be configured to transport traffic between cell site antennas, hubs and MSOs. The priority access policies will define the parameters for setting minimum and maximum bandwidth, quality of service (Qos), priority level, alternate routes, and any optional network settings defined by the network operator. These policies are used to control access based on a number of factors, including individual subscribers, subscriber groups, service types or classes, time of day, ingress and egress location, carrier frequency and other operator defined criteria. The priority access policies are checked by the policy management system when a request is received for priority access. Requests for priority access can be sent to the policy management system from the CNO process or from external customer care systems through an application programming interface (API). The request will provide sufficient information for the policy management system to determine which policy to apply. After checking the priority access policy, the policy management system sends a request to the CNO process to configure the network elements to meet the criteria in the policy.","Additional functions of the RRUs - and TCUs  are described as follows.","(A) QoS\/Resilient Packet Ring Function (QRF)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0163","num":"0176"},"figref":"FIG. 15","b":["101","103","138"]},"The QoS\/RPR function is software that runs on an Applications Processor that is resident in each of the RRUs - and TCUs  and is performed in compliance with the well known RPR standard. The QoS function allows control and traffic channels to be mapped into high, medium, and low priority QoS flows. This is accomplished by using high, medium, and low-priority transmit buffers -, -, -. These QoS classes are mapped into high and medium\/low transit buffers -, - which control the flow onto the packet ring .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0165","num":"0178"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},"(B) GSM and UMTS Frame Processing","An application will allow GSM and UMTS frame processing to provide intelligence about these wireless specific interfaces. This will enable more efficient grooming and bandwidth optimization methods to be implemented.","(C) Virtual Antenna Switching","The solution enables the signals from any antenna to be routed to any BTS (or Node B) port in any hub location. This is referred to as virtual antenna switching. By placing the BTS (or Node B) resources into hub locations, the TCU  can more efficiently access these resources and share them as baseband processing capacity requirements increase or decrease. This creates a pooling capability which helps to reduce underutilized BTS (or Node B) resources.","(D) Straight Talk Service","Straight Talk Service allows two or more mobile users - to establish direct voice communication by sending packetized voice directly from one mobile station to another without going through the circuit switched voice network. The RRU - or TCU  can detect the mobile subscriber IP address and use that to route packet voice through the network to the appropriate destination. The mobile station must support the ability to allow users to invoke this feature by pushing a button to initiate voice packetization before communication begins.","(E) Priority Access Service","Priority Access Service allows various technology types to be prioritized into flows such as GSM\/GPRS\/EDGE, UMTS, Public Safety, etc. and routed to appropriate equipment for processing. An alternative implementation allows the user population to be prioritized into general and higher priority users. This is accomplished by the RRU - identifying the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) and\/or the Mobile Subscriber ISDN number (MSISDN) of the user, which allows user traffic to be separated and routed in specific Quality of Service (QoS) priority flows. Straight Talk Service and Priority Access are illustrated in ",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0174","num":"0187"},"figref":"FIG. 17"},"It will be apparent to those of skill in the art that the disclosed apparatus and method has numerous applications in the area of cellular communications.","Although this invention has been described with reference to particular embodiments, it will be appreciated that many variations will be resorted to without departing from the spirit and scope of this invention as set forth in the appended claims.
