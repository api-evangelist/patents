Field of Invention","The present invention relates generally to asset classes performance calculation. More specifically, the present invention relates to systems and methods for measuring private equity (and generally private capital) investment performance, that would otherwise be measured in IRR terms.","2. Discussion of Related Art","Performance measurement is an important task for both investors and investment managers. Whichever asset class is considered, performance must be calculated in order to measure and compare the profitability of investments and to adopt proper risk management and asset allocation methodologies.","As private equity is increasingly becoming a typical investment allocation for institutional investors, banks, and high net worth individuals, its risk\/reward characteristics need to be better understood and managed like for any other asset class. Unfortunately, applying standard performance evaluation techniques to private equity is a challenging task.","In fact, the lack of time series of market prices makes objectively difficult the use of standard risk management and asset allocation methodologies and the definition of the absolute and relative risk profiles for private equity.","Private equity investing, differently from all other asset classes, require the capital committed normally not being invested immediately at the subscription of the contract, generally a Limited Partnership Agreement (LPA); the committed capital is rather \u201ccalled\u201d to be invested by the general partner (GP or investment manager) discretionarily both in terms of timing and quantity, within the limits set in the LPA, over the certain terms of the contract. Therefore, private equity investments require and generate a stream of negative and positive cash flows spread over the term of a contract.","In this context, the main performance measures that have been used in practice in the art are the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) and variants thereof, and so called multiples on capital.","An example of such approach will be now illustrated with reference to and , which illustrate representative pro-form a cash flow patterns of an hypothetical private equity fund, considered on a stand-alone basis.","In this simplified representation, an hypothetical investor (limited partner\u2014LP) who commits 100 cash units to a fund that contractually is expected to have a 10 years term, over this term will see the cash called and returned by the investment manager (the GP) as described respectively by the contributions and distributions rows of the table depicted in . The consequent investor's cash and total wealth positions are arithmetically derived in the table, under the assumption (as in the art) that the net asset value of the investments in place (NAV Invested Capital) is calculated as the net asset value of the future net cash flows, discounted at their pooled internal rate of return.","By investing (i.e. committing his total initial wealth of 100\u2014the stand alone hypothesis) in the representative fund described by , the hypothetical investor sees, over the 10 years term, his net wealth growing from 100 to 230 cash units. On a stand alone basis, he will calculate his net wealth to have increased in the 10-year period by a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.7%. The GP will instead (customarily) summarize the results of its investment activity by reporting the standard measures of internal rate of return (IRR) at 44% and multiple (Total Value versus Paid In\u2014TVPI) of 2.3\u00d7 on the invested capital.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"i":["b ","a. "]},"The discrepancy between the IRR of the investment and the CAGR of the wealth is conceptually reconciled by analyzing the net cash utilization pattern of the private equity mechanics For the hypothetical fund considered, shows that the maximum level of net cash drawn from the investor's commitment is 40 units (or 40% of the committed capital) reached at year 3. This means that, on average over the term of the contract, always more of 60% of the initial commitment is left to the investor. It also means that, on average, the investment manager has used less than 40% of the initially committed capital but overall has increased it by a factor of 325%.","The example shows the potential of private equity as a capital-efficient investment methodology, with capital efficiency effectively captured by the IRR measure. This is particularly true in cases, such as the one represented, when the private equity investments produce good results. Nevertheless, even in this simple case, the IRR measure fails to indicate how good these results are.","However, in general terms, neither the IRR nor the multiples are appropriate measures for the purposes of providing meaningful, and comparable, performance data for private equity. In fact such measures are prone to misleading indications, as will be shown below with another example, and with reference to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},"Intuitively instead, the three initiatives may not be identically attractive as the performance indicators (identical IRR and TVPI value) could imply. Assuming identical commitment dates and amounts for the three opportunities, the initiative represented by Portfolio A provides a much faster turnover of the capital, invested at year 1 and fully divested at year 3. In other words Portfolio A appears to have a lower opportunity cost.","More misleading conclusions could be drawn without the information regarding the level of drawn capital versus the amount originally committed. In fact, while the limited use of capital increases the IRR, large amounts of committed capital left undrawn on the balance sheet of investors dilute the actual growth of their total wealth.","The several shortcomings of IRR and multiples with respect to calculation, to prioritization of investment projects and to comparison against the average return of to other asset classes are well known in the art.","In particular, it is known that IRR should not be compared to the average rate of return of stock market indices over the same period, not only due to the fact that IRRs and time-series averages of market returns are different in nature, but also because the underlying amounts invested in private equity at any point in time over the comparison period should be different from those of the equity market index.","Moreover, multiples, such as the Distributed over Invested Capital (DIC) or the Total Value over Paid In capital (TVPI), fail to take into account the time value of money and therefore their significance is limited in a context of comparison and prioritization of investment projects.","Alternative methodologies, such as the Public Market Equivalent (PME) and the Modified IRR (MIRR), have been proposed to overcome the above mentioned limitations; however, these methodologies in substance replace the IRR as reinvestment rate with a determined hurdle rate or a benchmark's rate of return, improving comparability but adding elements of subjectivity.","Summarizing, traditional methodologies for measuring private equity performance known in the state of art fail to provide performance indicators which are objective, meaningful, not misleading and comparable with the other asset classes.","In particular such methodologies do not take into account concepts such as financial duration and discounting to deal with the peculiarities of the capital call based investment mechanics, for which private equity is either cash at work or waiting to be deployed. When used, the concept of duration is calculated adopting subjective discount rates, such as the IRR, therefore hindering its effectiveness.","This leads to a \u201cvaluation isolation\u201d anomaly, that causes private equity to be incomparable with all other asset classes; as a result, private equity is put at a disadvantage, in terms of general understanding and risk-return appreciation, versus most of the other asset classes.","The aim of the present invention is to provide a new system and method for the calculation of performance data for private equity overcoming the above mentioned drawbacks.","Within this aim, an object of the present invention is to introduce a system and method for the calculation of performance data for private equity (or generically capital) investments which is able to produce time weighted calculation data for private equity, thus removing the inefficiencies caused by the current valuation standards.","Another object of the invention is to provide a system and method for the calculation of performance data for private equity suitable to render private equity comparable with other asset classes, thus removing the valuation isolation of private equity.","Yet another object of the invention is to provide a system and method for the calculation of performance data for private equity which allows the reconciliation between the GP's objectives of efficient use of the capital and the LP's allocation of the cash availabilities.","Another object of the invention is to provide a system and method for the calculation of performance data for private equity which improves transparency and benchmarking and creates the conditions for applications that increase liquidity.","At least one aspect is directed to a computer implemented method for the calculation of performance data for a private equity fund. The computer implement method includes an act of acquiring, at an input device, input data representative of a first transaction of cash flow patterns of said private equity fund during a term of said fund, said term being divided into a plurality subperiods t, t, . . . t, wherein for each subperiod t, a value for contribution Contrand a value for the distribution Distrin to that subperiod is supplied.

The computer implemented method also includes an act of calculating, based on said second transaction and said third value, a sixth value representative of a duration adjusted return on capital\u2014DaRC.","At least one aspect is directed to a non-transitory computer readable medium having stored thereon sequences of instruction that include instructions that will cause a processor to acquire input data representative of a first transaction of cash flow patterns of a private equity fund during a term of said fund, said term being divided into a plurality subperiods t, t, . . . t, wherein for each subperiod t, a value for contribution Contrand a value for the distribution Distrin that subperiod is supplied.

measure, the fully diluted DaRC (fdDaRC) indicates the rate of return generated by the private equity transaction assuming that all cash, if not deployed is invested at the rates of the reference yield curve, until the last distribution is received by the investor.","The fDaRC thus reconciles the DaRC model with the CAGR of the investor wealth.","The fdDaRC can be calculated as the return from the investment of the committed capital, growing at dDaRC for the period defined by the Ddand then at the cash rates on the reference yield curve over the period between the duration of the distributions and the time of the full liquidation of the transaction, that is to say when the last cash distribution is received (t).","A possible method for defining and calculating the fdDaRC

present value of future net cash flows discounted using the IRR of the transaction grossed up by the undrawn and reimbursed cash availabilities invested at the rates prevailing over the reference

a private equity investment to the investor's net wealth on a stand-alone and unlevered basis. In fact it has the following features:\n\n","It has been shown that the invention fully achieves the intended aim and objects, since DaRC-based performance indices overcome the issues of IRR and are meaningfully comparable to the indices or the performance series of the investments in all other asset classes.","In fact, adequately aggregated DaRC data allows meaningful comparisons with average returns of public markets over comparable time horizons. This makes it possible to estimate risk premiums, alpha and real rate of returns of private equity funds interests.","Moreover the above described systems and methods allow one to derive robust, realistic and practical time weighted performance data for private equity: the key indicator is the diluted Duration adjusted Return on Capital (dDaRC).","As in the fixed income world the zero coupon bond equivalence (and the duration) is pivotal for comparing securities with different characteristics, the dEBT puts private equity transactions in the condition of having their derived unlevered, time-weighted performance measures (dDaRC) objectively comparable among them and against other types of investments.","Differently from the IRR based approach, the methodology's output is a realistic and replicable rate of return, that can be calculated even in the extreme circumstances of negative net duration, is unambiguous also in case of decrease of value, and allows direct and synthetic replications.","An additional advantage of the disclosed systems and method is the fact that, if it is applied to equity and fixed income securities, it provides the results that are obtained calculating their respective compound average growth rate of return and yield to maturity.","The disclosed systems and methods also have several practical applications, in that they introduce a common denominator to integrate primary placements and secondary transactions on listed and unlisted alternative investment vehicles.","In particular, the track record of teams in fund raising expressed in terms of dDaRC will be compared to the expected dDaRC of the outstanding potential secondary trades and the expected returns of listed alternative vehicles.","Clearly, several modifications will be apparent to and can be readily made by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the present invention.","For instance, based on the dDaRC as the reference rate, the system and method can also be extended to create over the counter (OTC) derivative contracts, such as swaps, forward, options, futures, etc, or private equity benchmarks. Benchmark-related products and derivative contracts further enhance the possibility of comparison and arbitrage.","The systems and methods can be also advantageously applied to derivatives. Applied to derivatives, the DaRC can be used the valuation engine for the quoted contracts, for instance for comparing a direct fund investment to the investment in a call option on the same fund.","Similarly the diluted EBT disclosed in the systems and methods can be applied to private capital futures. With initial and maintenance margins recreating the leverage\/capital efficiency effect, a long position in a private capital future consists in the purchase of a contract that has a predetermined maturity. The pricing of the future over its life will reflect the expectation of investors with regards to the dDaRC of the specific fund interest, anticipating the evolution pattern of the underlying net asset value. The dDaRC will have a dynamic intuitively correlated to the level of the general economy and with the valuation level of the relevant public equity markets.","Moreover, the time weighted nature of the disclosed DaRC-based performance indicators opens to a broad range of applications in the field of benchmarking, since they present the properties required for valid and effective benchmarks, such as investability, as an alternative to other portfolios under consideration; appropriateness, since there is consistence with the portfolios being measured against it; transparence, since the investments in the benchmark and how they perform are understood, and performance can be explained; unambiguity, since name and weight of the index\/peer group members are clearly defined.

For instance, the computer system  may include specially programmed, special-purpose hardware, such as an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) tailored to perform a particular operation disclosed herein. While another example may perform the same function using a grid of several general-purpose computing devices running MAC OS System X with Motorola PowerPC processors and several specialized computing devices running proprietary hardware and operating systems.","The computer system  may be a computer system including an operating system that manages at least a portion of the hardware elements included in the computer system . In some examples, a processor, data processing engine, or controller, such as the processor , executes an operating system. Examples of a particular operating system that may be executed include a Windows-based operating system, such as, Windows NT, Windows 2000 (Windows ME), Windows XP, Windows Vista or Windows 7 operating systems, available from the Microsoft Corporation, a MAC OS System X operating system available from Apple Computer, one of many Linux-based operating system distributions, for example, the Enterprise Linux operating system available from Red Hat Inc., a Solaris operating system available from Sun Microsystems, or a UNIX operating systems available from various sources. Many other operating systems may be used, and examples are not limited to any particular operating system.","The processor  and operating system together define a computer platform for which application programs in high-level programming languages are written. These component applications may be executable, intermediate, bytecode or interpreted code which communicates over a communication network, for example, the Internet, using a communication protocol, for example, TCP\/IP. Similarly, aspects may be implemented using an object-oriented programming language, such as .Net, SmallTalk, Java, C++, Ada, or C# (C-Sharp). Other object-oriented programming languages may also be used. Alternatively, functional, scripting, or logical programming languages may be used.","Additionally, various aspects and functions may be implemented in a non-programmed environment, for example, documents created in HTML, XML or other format that, when viewed in a window of a browser program, can render aspects of a graphical-user interface or perform other functions. Further, various examples may be implemented as programmed or non-programmed elements, or any combination thereof. For example, a web page may be implemented using HTML while a data object called from within the web page may be written in C++. Thus, the examples are not limited to a specific programming language and any suitable programming language could be used. Accordingly, the functional components disclosed herein may include a wide variety of elements, e.g. specialized hardware, executable code, data structures or objects, that are configured to perform the functions described herein.","In some examples, the components disclosed herein may read parameters that affect the functions performed by the components. These parameters may be physically stored in any form of suitable memory including volatile memory (such as RAM) or nonvolatile memory (such as a magnetic hard drive). In addition, the parameters may be logically stored in a propriety data structure (such as a database or file defined by a user mode application) or in a commonly shared data structure (such as an application registry that is defined by an operating system). In addition, some examples provide for both system and user interfaces that allow external entities to modify the parameters, such as sponsor types and sectors, and thereby configure the behavior of the components.","Having now described some illustrative embodiments, it is apparent that the foregoing is illustrative and not limiting, having been presented by way of example. In particular, although many of the examples presented herein involve specific combinations of method acts or system elements, those acts and those elements may be combined in other ways to accomplish the same objectives. Acts, elements and features discussed only in connection with one embodiment are not intended to be excluded from a similar role in other embodiments.","Note that in , the enumerated items are shown as individual elements. In actual implementations of the systems and methods described herein, however, they may be inseparable components of other electronic devices such as a digital computer. Thus, actions described above may be implemented at least in part in software that may be embodied in an article of manufacture that includes a program storage medium. The program storage medium includes non-transitory and other data signals embodied in one or more of a carrier wave, a computer disk (magnetic, or optical (e.g., CD or DVD, or both)), non-volatile memory, tape, a system memory, and a computer hard drive.","Any references to embodiments or elements or acts of the systems and methods herein referred to in the singular may also embrace embodiments including a plurality of these elements, and any references in plural to any embodiment or element or act herein may also embrace embodiments including only a single element.","References in the singular or plural form are not intended to limit the presently disclosed systems or methods, their components, acts, or elements to single or plural configurations.
