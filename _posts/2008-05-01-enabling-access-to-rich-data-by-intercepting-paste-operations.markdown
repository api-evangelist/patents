title: Enabling access to rich data by intercepting paste operations
abstract: Systems and methods for enabling access to data, including data represented using a variety of “richer” data formats, are disclosed. Such systems and methods may be useful, among a variety of cases, with applications or entities that may not typically be able to access such richer data. In at least some implementations, data copied to a clipboard and formatted using a variety of formats may be provided or accessed by a destination application as part of a paste operation even when the destination application may not natively provide the ability to access all of the data formats that might exist on a clipboard. In at least some implementations, such access may be provided without modifying or augmenting the data placed on the clipboard.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Clipboard systems are a common part of many modern operating systems or computer systems. Typically a clipboard system enables applications or other entities to \u201ccopy\u201d or \u201ccut\u201d data to a computer-implemented \u201cclipboard,\u201d and enables the same or other applications or entities to \u201cpaste\u201d data from the clipboard. The clipboard is available to or shared between applications and entities and enables the transfer of information or data between such applications and entities.","At least some clipboard systems enable the transfer of multiple pieces of data as well as the transfer of data in multiple formats. For example, in some clipboard systems an application may have the ability to add a single logical piece of data or information to the clipboard in multiple different formats. For example, an application might place a text representation of a piece of data as well as an image representation of the same piece of data on the clipboard. A destination application to which such a piece of data may be pasted might then be able to access the format of the data that is most useful to the destination application.","In order to participate in information sharing or transfer using a clipboard, any executable code or application must generally have the ability to interact with the clipboard system. Such interaction may be accomplished through the use of application programming interfaces (APIs) or a variety of other mechanisms. While some applications or entities may have the ability to access the full capabilities of a clipboard system\u2014including perhaps the ability to request alternative data formats for a particular piece of data on the clipboard, in some cases at least some applications may only have access to a limited subset of a clipboard system's functionality. As just one example, a page displayed by a web browser typically only has access to data on a clipboard that is formatted as text. That is, even if the clipboard includes, say, an image or one or more other representations of a piece of data, and even if the page may have the capability of using these other representations of the data, the page may not be able to access the other data formats.","The following presents a simplified summary of the disclosure in order to provide a basic understanding to the reader. This summary is not an extensive overview of the disclosure and does not identify key or critical elements of the invention or delineate the scope of the invention. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts disclosed herein in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.","Described herein are various techniques and technologies directed to enabling access to additional and sometimes \u201cricher\u201d data formats in applications or other entities that may not typically be able to access such additional data. More particularly, in at least some implementations, data copied to a clipboard and formatted using a variety of formats may be provided or accessed by a destination application as part of a paste operation even when the destination application may not natively provide the ability to access all of the data formats that might exist on a clipboard. In at least some implementations, such access may be provided without modifying or augmenting the data placed on the clipboard.","Described herein are various techniques and technologies directed to enabling access to additional and sometimes \u201cricher\u201d data formats in applications or other entities that may not typically be able to access such additional data. More particularly, in at least some implementations, data formatted using a variety of formats may be provided or accessed by a destination application even when the destination application may not natively provide the ability to access all of the data formats that might exist on a clipboard. In at least some implementations, such access may be provided without modifying or augmenting the data placed on the clipboard.","As used herein, a \u201cclipboard\u201d or \u201cclipboard system\u201d should be interpreted as an entity that provides functionality associated with the transfer of data between different entities, including, for example, between different applications, web pages, and so on. Some clipboard systems may provide the capabilities of adding data to a \u201cclipboard\u201d\u2014perhaps associated with a copy or cut operation\u2014and reading data from a clipboard\u2014perhaps associated with a paste operation. The same or other clipboard systems may provide the ability to hold multiple pieces of data, or items, at the same time. Furthermore, the same or other clipboard systems may provide the ability to hold multiple representations or formats for a particular data item. For example, a clipboard system might have the ability to hold, say, a formatted text, plain text, and image representation of the same item. The same or other clipboard systems may enable a destination application to use or request a particular format or representation of an item. For example, a word processing application might use the formatted text representation, a simple text editor the plain text representation, and an image processing application the image representation. Some applications may enable a user to choose between multiple representations or formats and paste one or more of such representations. For example, some applications provide a \u201cpaste special\u201d or other similar option that enables the user to choose between multiple formats when pasting information.","While many applications\u2014including the word processing, text editor, and image processing applications introduced in the previous paragraph\u2014may have the capability of accessing one or more data formats associated with data items on the clipboard, in at least some implementations some applications may only have the capability of accessing a limited set of data formats or a single data format. For example and in at least some implementations, a web browser as well as pages or other information displayed or provided by a web browser may only be able to access a simple text representation of a data item that exists on the clipboard. Furthermore, executable code included in web pages or other information displayed by a browser\u2014such as JavaScript code included with or referenced by an HTML page\u2014may only have the capability of accessing a text representation of a data item that exists on the clipboard.","While some applications or entities may only have access to a single or more limited set of data formats or representations, it may still in some implementations be possible to transfer or communicate richer or more extensive data. As just one example, additional or richer data might be represented as text\u2014say, as XML or using some other data representation language or format\u2014and then the richer text might be communicated using the clipboard, perhaps using only a \u201cplain text\u201d or similar clipboard format. One specific example of a text format that can hold rich data is the Live Clipboard format. In some implementations, a format such at the Live Clipboard format, or other format, may define one or more ways to represent, encode, or otherwise make available for transfer a variety of additional or richer data. In the case of Live Clipboard, for example and without limitation, the data format may enable the transfer of \u201cstructured\u201d data including XML or other representations of a variety of data, references to \u201cfeeds,\u201d and references to \u201cpresentation\u201d data that may be used as part of displaying the data. The Live Clipboard format is described in more detail elsewhere herein, including below with reference to .","Generally as used herein, the terms \u201cstructured information\u201d or \u201cstructured data\u201d may refer to information or data that has additional meaning when compared to plain text. For example, a text field that contains, say, a first name or last name, might not comprise structured data. In contrast, an XML fragment that conforms to the hCard schema, or some other schema, for representing contact information, and contains, say, name, address, phone number, email address, and so on, in a structured format such as, for example, the hCard format, would be considered structured data. Structured information may also in some embodiments include a wide variety of other information. For example, structured information may include information about the data\u2014metadata\u2014like its type or content type, as well as references to other or additional data, and so on. Furthermore, although this example mentions hCard and XML, it is important to note that structured data is not limited to hCard and XML information and may comprise a wide variety of data types and be represented using a wide variety of data representation formats. Similarly, a reference may in some embodiments be implemented using something like a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) that identifies information, like a changed or updated version of copied data, or a \u201cReally Simple Syndication\u201d or \u201cRich Site Summary\u201d (\u201cRSS\u201d) or Atom feed, at some endpoint on a network. However, a reference may be embodied in a variety of ways and may identify information of a wide variety of types.","A text or richer format, such as the Live Clipboard format, may be used in a variety of ways. For example, a source application or a web page hosted in a browser might include executable code\u2014such as JavaScript, perhaps\u2014that generates and places data represented in a richer format on the clipboard. In some examples, such data might be indicated to the clipboard system as using the text format and, as a result, when that data is pasted to a destination application that requests the text format, all of the rich data represented using the richer format may be provided to the destination application.","If the destination application has the capability of interpreting the richer data, it may be able to do additional processing or provide additional functionality that might not be possible without access to the richer data. As just one specific example, suppose that a user views a web page that displays contact information for a variety of people or other entities. In this example, when the user selects a particular contact or contacts and indicates that they want to copy the selected contact information to the clipboard, the page might generate, say, a Live Clipboard representation of the contact information\u2014perhaps using hCard\u2014and place the resulting Live Clipboard XML on the clipboard. Further suppose that the user then pastes the Live Clipboard data on the clipboard to another web page or some other application and, for the purposes of this example, that the destination page or application is also associated with maintaining contact information. If the user pastes the information into an application that can recognize that the pasted data includes Live Clipboard information, or even just hCard information, the destination application might be able to, for example, treat the pasted data as comprising information for a full contact (or perhaps set of contacts), and maybe even automatically create \u201ccontacts\u201d or other data entities. In contrast, if the user pastes the richer data into an application such as a simple text editor that does not recognize or treat the richer data in any particular special manner, the text editor may just display the text\u2014in this case, this might simply mean that the Live Clipboard XML might be included in the document or text currently being displayed by the text editor application.","Richer formats may enable the transfer of richer data in some implementations, but the existence of a richer data format represented, for example, as text, and even the existence of destination applications or entities that can interpret the richer data format are not always sufficient to enable the transfer of richer information between entities or applications. One common example where a richer data format isn't sufficient may occur when a source application is not aware of or does not provide data using a richer data format that can be understood by a destination application. For example, a source application might not be aware of the Live Clipboard format and might not add information that uses the Live Clipboard format to a clipboard. In some implementations it may be possible to convert or augment data so that the data can be understood by a destination application. For example, it may be possible to recognize when information about a contact is placed on a clipboard and then convert this information to a format such as the Live Clipboard format.","However, even if source data can be converted to a data format that can be understood by a destination application, there may in some cases be no suitable way to place such information on the clipboard so that it can be accessed by the destination application. As an example, suppose a user of a personal information management application (or PIM application)\u2014say, perhaps, the Microsoft Outlook application written by Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash.\u2014indicates that they want to copy a calendar item or appointment to the clipboard. The PIM application might create a data item on the clipboard that represents the calendar item. Such a data item might contain information associated with the calendar item in a simple text format\u2014not as Live Clipboard or some other richer data format, but simply as, say, the description of the calendar item and the time and date, separated by tabs, commas, or some other delimiter. This simple text representation of the calendar item enables a user to paste information about the calendar item or event into a text editor or other application. The data item added by the PIM application might also contain the calendar item information in one or more other richer formats\u2014for example, in the case of Microsoft Outlook, the calendar information might be represented using a format like the iCalendar format and then such iCalendar information might be included on the clipboard as a reference to a file with an .ics extension or as an \u201cICS file.\u201d As a result of the multiple data formats added to the clipboard for this single data item, if the user subsequently pastes the data item into a simple text editor, they might see the contact information in the simple text format. If they paste the data item into an application that can interpret file references with iCalendar data, that application might be able to interpret and use all of the rich information represented in the attached or referenced file.","However, if they paste such a data item into a web page or other application that could interpret and use rich calendar item information represented using a text format\u2014like Live Clipboard in some cases\u2014but that might only have access to information on the clipboard in a text format (or might have access only to some other format or set of formats), the web page or application might not be able to access the richer or more extensive information. That is, as the destination application in this case might only have access to the simple text representation that doesn't include all of the calendar item information, the destination application may not be able to access all of the calendar information, even though the application has the capability of using more extensive calendar information and even though the more extensive information exists in the referenced ICS file.","In some cases one attempt to resolve such a problem might involve the use of a \u201cconverter\u201d or \u201cadapter\u201d application that, say, \u201cwatches\u201d or observes the clipboard and, in this specific example, upon seeing a data item with a referenced ICS file, converts the data in the ICS file to a Live Clipboard data and then replaces the simple text representation of the data item that is already on the clipboard with the Live Clipboard representation. However, this relatively simple approach also has a few problems, the biggest of which is that it requires deleting information that is already on the clipboard, by replacing the simple text representation with the more complex Live Clipboard representation. In general and with many computer systems or clipboard implementations, overwriting or deleting information on the clipboard is at best considered a bad practice and may not be allowed (instead, the recommended approach\u2014when all applications can access multiple data formats\u2014is generally to add alternative data formats). In this example if the simple text representation is overwritten with a Live Clipboard representation, a user that pastes the calendar data item into an application that can interpret Live Clipboard data may have access to richer data, but a user that pastes the calendar item into an application that cannot interpret the Live Clipboard data might see an extensive amount of XML rather than simply the short and easy-to-read text representation that was originally placed on the clipboard.","The techniques and technologies described herein are directed to resolving this problem by, in at least some implementations, making a richer representation of a data item\u2014such as perhaps a Live Clipboard representation\u2014available to some applications while not changing the representation on the clipboard or changing the experience of other applications or entities that also might use the data item. In at least some implementations, elements of the techniques and technologies described herein may intercept paste operations and then provide a richer representation of data on the clipboard to the destination.","Turning now to , shown therein is an exemplary generalized operational flow  including various operations that may be performed when enabling access to rich data when interacting with a clipboard system. Operations that may be associated with a source application, from which data is copied (or cut), may in some implementations be associated with the first column; operations that may be associated with a destination application, to which data may be pasted, may in some implementations be associated with the second column; and operations associated with an adapter or converter application or other executable code may in some implementations be associated with the third column. The following description of  may be made with reference to other figures. However, it should be understood that the operational flow described with reference to  is not intended to be limited to being used with the elements described with reference to these other figures. In addition, while the exemplary operational flow of  indicates a particular order of execution and is divided into three columns, in one or more alternative embodiments the operations may be ordered differently and may be performed by just a single entity or application or may be performed by other combinations of applications or executable code. Furthermore, while the exemplary operational flow contains multiple steps, it should be recognized that in some implementations at least some of these operations may be combined or executed contemporaneously.","In an exemplary implementation of operation , an adapter application or other executable code may identify existing paste targets that can receive richer data and, when identified, may register for notification of paste operations initiated using identified paste targets.","Generally, a \u201cpaste target\u201d may be understood herein to refer to some entity by which a user or other executable code may initiate a paste operation, where the entity may be associated with receiving, interpreting, or otherwise using richer data. Paste targets may take a variety of forms and be implemented in a variety of ways. In one example, a paste target might comprise an \u201cedit control\u201d or \u201ctext box control\u201d of some type. With such an exemplary edit control, a user may click or take some other operation to \u201cselect,\u201d \u201cgive focus to,\u201d or otherwise indicate a desire to interact with the edit control, and may then choose to paste information from the clipboard in one or more of a variety of ways, including through the use of a menu item, a keyboard shortcut, and so on. Other types of paste targets may have different visual appearances (or may have no visible appearance at all), and may be interacted with in the same or other ways.","In some implementations, only particular edit controls or other elements may be considered to be paste targets, and such a differentiation\u2014if it exists\u2014may be made in a variety of ways. In such implementations, some elements of a user interface\u2014for example, some edit controls or text boxes\u2014may be enabled to support the pasting of richer data, while other elements of a user interface, including perhaps other edit controls or text boxes, are not so enabled. For example, in an implementation where a user interface is represented using a technology like HTML, an edit control may be defined, as just two examples, using an HTML \u201cinput\u201d element with a \u201ctype\u201d attribute set to the value \u201ctext\u201d or using an HTML \u201ctextarea\u201d element. In at least some of such implementations, an edit control that is to support the pasting of richer data might have, for example, a \u201cclass\u201d attribute with a particular value or name, or might be denoted in some other fashion. Other edit controls may not have or use the same value or name for the \u201cclass\u201d attribute or other characteristic and therefore may in some implementations be considered to not support the pasting of richer data as described herein. In some implementations, which edit controls enable the pasting of richer data may be determined in other ways, or all edit controls may support the pasting of richer data without the use of any particular identifying characteristic.","In at least some exemplary implementations, a paste target may include or be associated with an HTML \u201cdiv\u201d element and an edit control or text control, including an HTML \u201cinput\u201d element with a \u201ctype\u201d attribute set to the value \u201ctext,\u201d or an HTML \u201ctextarea\u201d element. The paste target may have some kind of visible representation, like an image associated in some fashion with the \u201cdiv\u201d element. In other implementations, the paste target may just comprise an edit control itself, or might comprise some other arrangement or composition of one or more user interface elements or controls. In some implementations, the edit control may be transparent or not visible\u2014in at least some of such implementations, an image or other user interface element or elements that are associated with the edit control or with a containing element, like a \u201cdiv\u201d element, may enable a user to interact with the paste target. If the edit control is not visible, it may appear to a user that they are interacting with the visible user interface element\u2014the image, say\u2014when they are in fact interacting with the edit control.","Furthermore, in at least some implementations a paste target may have another user interface representation, or may not have any explicit user interface or visible representation at all. For example, an application or web page itself\u2014not just a particular part or user interface element of the application or web page\u2014may in some cases be implemented to respond to paste initiation operations\u2014such as a keyboard command like \u201cControl-V\u201d\u2014by initiating a paste operation. In at least some of such implementations, the resulting destination data may be placed in some part of the user interface, possibly independently of where the mouse or other selection was at the time the paste operation was initiated. As just one example, a paste operation performed \u201canywhere\u201d on a particular web page might result in the pasting of information at, say, the bottom of a list being displayed as part of the page. In the same or yet other implementations, destination data provided to the destination may not result in any visible change in the user interface. For example, destination information might be processed, saved, or otherwise used in some manner without any change to the user interface.","Once a paste target has been defined or exists\u2014for example, because the author of an HTML page has included an edit control with a particular \u201cclass\u201d attribute in a page\u2014the identification of paste targets may be accomplished in a variety of ways depending on characteristics such as the nature of the destination applications that include paste targets, the operating system in use, and so on. In at least some implementations, at least part of identifying paste targets may involve enumerating user interfaces, applications, or the like, and further enumerating elements that might be paste targets. As just one very specific example, and without limitation, when paste targets that enable access to richer data may occur as part of a web page displayed by a browser, paste targets may be identified by enumerating all of the web browser applications, web browser tabs, web browser windows, and the like. In the specific case of the Internet Explorer application written by Microsoft Corporation, each user interface element that displays a web page may exist as an operating system \u201cwindow,\u201d and also have at least some characteristics that are shared between instances of the window that displays web pages or other content, such as the same name. In the case of Internet Explorer, a window that displays web pages or other content may be referred to, for example, as a \u201cweb browser control\u201d or the like. In such an implementation, the identification of paste targets may be accomplished, in part, by first identifying each web browser control or each window that has this particular name. (In the case of Internet Explorer and also with other applications, this may enable the identification of paste targets in applications that use, contain, or include web browser controls, even when the applications are not considered to \u201cweb browser\u201d applications. For example, the Visual Studio development environment, also produced by Microsoft, uses web browser controls to display help information in at least some implementations.)","It should be noted that in at least some contexts and at least some of the time, an operating system window is separate from and not the same as a \u201cwindow\u201d that might typically be perceived by a user. For example, an operating system window might be any operating system entity that has a \u201cwindow handle,\u201d which might include a wide array of windows that, for example, do not have menu bars, maximize and minimize buttons, and so on; do not have the capability of being independently moved; and the like. For example, in the case of the Microsoft Windows operating system, many elements of a \u201cwindow\u201d perceived by a user may in and of themselves be windows\u2014for example, in some cases a button may be a window, a text box may be a different window, and so on.","In specific examples that use web browser controls or the like, the identification of paste targets may further be accomplished by identifying edit controls or other user interface elements that are denoted as being paste targets, including through the use of techniques such as identifying characteristics like the use of the HTML \u201cclass\u201d attribute as described above. In the specific example of Internet Explorer, and also possibly applied to a variety of other applications, a representation of the content displayed by the web browser control or the like may be retrieved in some fashion and then examined for the presence of paste targets. At least some implementations of Internet Explorer, and also some other applications, provide access to the information they display using one or more \u201caccessibility interfaces.\u201d (Such interfaces are so named because they are often used to provide access to applications, data, or the like to individuals with disabilities, such as with the use of \u201cscreen reader\u201d applications for those that cannot see a user interface.) In the specific example of Internet Explorer, the implementation of an accessibility interface may in some cases provide access to a computer-readable representation of the HTML page or other displayed content. Such a representation may then be examined for the presence of paste targets. For example, using an accessibility interface, it may be possible to enumerate all of the edit controls in a particular HTML page and identify the edit controls that have a particular value for the HTML \u201cclass\u201d attribute.","The manner in which notifications of the initiation of paste operations may be received also depends on a variety of characteristics, including the nature of the destination applications, the operating system in use, and the functionality associated with the clipboard system. In many implementations, one or more of a variety of APIs may be provided that enable executable code to be called, or \u201ccalled back,\u201d when a particular operation or event occurs. For example, an API might exist and be used that enables a particular piece of executable code to be called or executed when a paste operation is initiated with one or more paste targets, edit controls, or the like. Using such an API, or a different API, some implementations of this operation may be able to specify executable code that will be called when a paste is initiated for a paste target.","In one or more exemplary implementations of operation , an adapter application or other executable code may register or otherwise configure itself or other code to be notified or gain knowledge of new paste targets that enable access to richer data. That is, some implementations of the already described operation  may identify existing paste targets, while some implementations of operation  may be related to registering to be notified when new paste targets\u2014targets that may not have existed when the operation  was executed\u2014are created or come into existence. When one or more of such new paste targets come into existence, the adapter or other application may then register to be notified when a paste operation is initiated using the new paste targets. Such registration for notification of paste operation initiation may in some implementations be accomplished in a similar fashion to that described previously with reference to the operation . For example, in some implementations of this operation, an adapter or other application may register\u2014perhaps using an API provided by the operating system or windowing environment\u2014to be notified when any new applications, windows, or other relevant elements are created. Upon being notified, the adapter application may then examine the new element and find any paste targets that are to enable access to richer data. If any paste targets are found, the adapter application or other entity may then register to be notified of when any paste operations associated with those paste targets are initiated.","In an exemplary implementation of operation , a copy (or cut) operation (or some other clipboard operation) may place data on the clipboard. Such data may be referred to in some instances as \u201csource data,\u201d because it originates with a \u201csource application.\u201d The addition or transfer of data to the clipboard may be implemented in a variety of ways and may in at least some implementations be exactly the same whether access to richer data is being provided as described herein or not. That is, in at least some implementations this operation may simply be a copy or cut operation like any copy or cut operation: after the operation has completed, source data from the source application may exist on the clipboard. As described previously, such source data may be associated with one (or in some cases more than one) data item, and the information associated with each data item may be represented in one or more data formats.","It should be noted that, as used herein in the context of transferring information, the term \u201ccopy\u201d may also include a \u201ccut\u201d operation, where the difference may be that data associated with a copy operation may remain in the location from which it is being copied. In contrast, data being \u201ccut\u201d may be removed, through some means, from the location from which it is being copied. In both copy and cut operations, data may be placed on the clipboard\u2014the difference may be in what happens at the location from which the data is copied or cut. It should further be noted that in some implementations cut, copy, and paste operations, as well as data transfer operations that do not explicitly use system-provided cut, copy, or paste functionality, may be performed through multiple different user interface actions. For example, a user may initiate a copy operation using a \u201cCopy\u201d menu item, using a keyboard command like \u201cControl-C,\u201d or some other command, and so on. In some embodiments, a user may also or instead employ one or more of a variety of other actions, such as \u201cdrag and drop\u201d gestures, to transfer data. For example, a user may select, indicate, or otherwise identify some data to be transferred, copied, or cut by, say, selecting the data using computer mouse movements, and then initiate a data transfer, copy, or cut operation by \u201cdragging\u201d the selected entity or data to some other location\u2014perhaps by clicking and holding a mouse button, and then finally \u201cdrop\u201d the entity as part of the data transfer operation or to initiate a paste operation at the indicated location. As used herein, copy, cut, and paste operations should be considered to encompass any set of user actions or gestures, including those associated with such drag and drop implementations. It should also be further noted that, in some implementations, alternative user actions and gestures\u2014including possibly drag and drop gestures\u2014may be implemented without the use of system-provided cut, copy, and\/or paste functionality. For example, a \u201cdrag\u201d operation may not actually result in the execution of some or all of the same executable code associated with a copy or cut operation, and a drop operation may not result in the execution of some or all of the same executable code as a paste operation. Nonetheless, such systems may still use the techniques described herein. As a result, as just one example, a drop operation might result in the providing of generated or converted data in a way that is the same as or similar to the manner in which a paste operation might result in the providing of generated or converted data.","Continuing with a description of the exemplary operations, in one or more exemplary implementations of operation , a paste operation may be initiated in a destination application. Generally, such a paste operation may be associated with a paste target like those described previously, and may be initiated in one or more of a variety of fashions, including through the use of a menu item, a keyboard shortcut, a drag and drop operation, and so on.","As part of initiating a paste operation, in some implementations a user or other entity may select or otherwise indicate a particular paste target. The selection of the paste target might be performed in a variety of ways, depending, among other things, on how the paste target is implemented and the desired user experience. In one example, if the paste target comprises an edit control, a user may select the edit control. In another example, a user might select a control that is associated with an HTML \u201cdiv\u201d element by selecting a visible representation of the control\u2014like perhaps an image associated with the \u201cdiv\u201d element\u2014using a mouse, or using the keyboard perhaps by using a \u201cTAB\u201d key to move the focus between different controls or user interface elements. In yet other examples, a paste target may be selected or indicated in a variety of other ways.","Then, to actually initiate a paste operation, the user or entity may take some action that in some implementations is related to an edit control associated with the paste target. That is, for example, as the edit control may provide paste functionality, or may be associated with paste functionality provided by the application or provided elsewhere, the initiation of the paste operation may use the edit control. For example, in at least some cases where the edit control is associated with an HTML \u201ctextarea\u201d or text \u201cinput\u201d control, the user may initiate a paste operation by right or left clicking the control and choosing a paste menu item from a resulting pop-up menu. In such an example, the pop-up menu may in some implementations be provided by the edit control. In the same or other cases, a user might use a keyboard command like \u201cControl-V\u201d or use a general top-level application paste menu item. As the edit control may not be visible, it may appear, and the user may believe, that the interaction is with a visible representation associated with the selected control even though the actual interaction may be with the edit control itself. For example, in a case where an edit control is not visible and is located in the same physical location as an image, the user may believe that they are interacting with the image, not with the not visible edit control. Such an arrangement\u2014with a not visible edit control providing paste functionality and a visible representation with which the user appears to interact\u2014may be used in a variety of scenarios, including with web pages displayed by a web browser. Edit controls used in non-web browser contexts may operate the same or in a similar fashion, or may operate differently.","In an exemplary implementation of operation , a paste notification may be received as a result of the paste operation that was initiated in operation  and also possibly as a result of the registration for paste notification that was accomplished in one or more of operation  and operation . In some implementations, this operation may result in the execution of callback or other code in an adapter or other application, and such code may also execute or use operation  and operation , as described below.","In one or more implementations of operation , destination data may be generated using at least some of the source data that exists on the clipboard. Generally, the destination data may then\u2014as a result of one or more subsequent operations\u2014be provided or used by the destination application in which the paste operation was initiated. The nature of the source data used and the extent and format of the destination data may vary widely, and may generally encompass some or all of the source data (including possibly multiple data formats associated with a particular or each data item), and may produce destination data in one or more of a variety of formats. As just one example, an implementation of this operation might identify a data item on the clipboard as including\u2014as introduced previously\u2014a reference to an ICS file, where the file contains contact information in the iCalendar format. This implementation might then create the corresponding Live Clipboard XML data that represents the same or similar information that exists in the ICS file, perhaps by, say, converting the iCalendar data to the hCard format, and then encapsulating the hCard data in Live Clipboard XML. In the same or other implementations of course, a variety of other source data might be used, and a variety of other destination data in a variety of formats might be produced. In some implementations, including those where the destination application may be configured to use text data and those that use data in the Live Clipboard format or other XML or text format, the destination data may comprise text.","In some implementations, this operation may be implemented, at least in part, using an extensibility system. Such a system might, for example, enable users or other entities to \u201cplug in\u201d executable code or other instructions that specify, for example, how to convert particular source data to particular destination data. Using such a system, the source and destination data that an implementation of operation  may interpret or generate may be extended or changed without changing an adapter or other application that provides an implementation of operation . As just one example, when a new source application or source data format is introduced or becomes common, a plug in may be provided that can convert from the new source data format and produce destination data in some other format.","In an exemplary implementation of operation , the destination data generated in operation  may be provided to the destination application in which the paste operation was initiated. This operation may be implemented in a variety of ways depending on characteristics such as the manner in which the destination application is implemented and the functionality available to the adapter application or other executable code associated with operation . For example, in some implementations of operation , the adapter application or other executable code may be able to programmatically change the contents of the edit control or paste target associated with the paste operation initiated in operation . For example, as part of the paste notification received in operation , or perhaps part of the paste target identification accomplished in operation  or operation , a \u201chandle\u201d or other identifier associated with the paste target or some element associated with the paste target\u2014such as an edit control\u2014may have been provided or have been accessible. Using this handle or identifier, executable code that implements at least part of operation  may be able to call a \u201cSet Text\u201d function, or the like, and provide the destination data. (In the case of a \u201cSet Text\u201d function, the destination data most likely would be provided as text.) For example, in the specific case where the paste target in the destination application is configured to understand and interpret information in the Live Clipboard format, the destination data provided using the \u201cSet Text\u201d or other function may be XML text that conforms to the Live Clipboard format. As a result of this operation, the destination data may now be accessible to the destination application\u2014for example, if the destination data was set to be the text of an edit control that is part of the destination application, the destination application may be able to access the destination data by reading the contents of the edit control's text property, or the like.","Finally, in an implementation of operation , the destination application may use the destination data it received as part of operation  in one or more ways, including by updating a user interface, by processing the data in one or more of a variety of ways, by storing the data, and so on. As just one example, a web page that includes a paste target and that can interpret Live Clipboard data might examine the destination data and, if it is Live Clipboard data that includes information understood or associated with the page\u2014perhaps the page displays contacts and the Live Clipboard data includes an hCard representation of a contact\u2014might execute code that retrieves relevant data from the Live Clipboard representation and uses it to update the user interface associated with the page. Executable code in the destination application may be configured to be called when the text associated with a paste target\u2014perhaps the text associated with an edit control\u2014is changed, perhaps by subscribing or registering to be called when a \u201cText Change\u201d event, or the like, is fired or occurs; may poll the paste target or other repository of destination data and take action when the data associated with the paste target changes; or may identify when to use the destination in a variety of other ways.","Turning now to , shown therein is an exemplary system  that demonstrates one manner in which access to richer data may be enabled by an adapter application. The system includes a source application , a destination application , an adapter application , and a clipboard . The adapter application in turn is shown as including a watcher module , a registration module , a converter module , and an input\/output module .

Furthermore, it should be understood that the exemplary graphical representations of the systems and user interfaces shown in , and in other figures included herein, are provided only for purposes of discussion, and in no way should be construed as limiting the scope of the techniques described herein to any particular graphical or other representation.","Generally the source application , the destination application , and the adapter application  may be one or more applications, web pages hosted in a web browser or other application host, or other executable code as introduced previously and described elsewhere herein or that are evident to one of skill in the art, while the clipboard  may be a clipboard system that enables information to be exchanged between applications and other entities, also as introduced elsewhere herein and known in the art. Some or all of the operations previously described with reference to  may in some implementations be associated with the source application, the destination application, the adapter application, and the clipboard.","Generally, the source application  may be considered to provide or be associated with source data placed on the clipboard  while the destination application  may include one or more paste targets that may ultimately include or have access to destination data generated or provided by the adapter application , as described in more detail below and also with reference to the operations of . For example, the copying of source data to the clipboard operation  described previously with reference to  may in some cases take place in or be associated with the source application, while the paste initiation operation  and\/or the use of destination data operation  may in some implementations take place in or be associated with a destination application.","The adapter application  may in some implementations exist as an application that might run transparently or \u201cin the background\u201d and provide access to richer data in applications with appropriately configured paste targets. The watcher module  may include functionality associated with the detection of new paste targets including identifying new paste targets using steps as described previously with reference to, for example, operation  of . The registration module  may include functionality such as that associated with identifying a paste target, registering the adapter application to be notified when a paste operation using a paste target is initiated, and may include functionality associated with, for example, operation  of . The converter module  may include functionality associated with converting source data to destination data, including in some implementations an extensibility or \u201cplug-in\u201d system and functionality associated with, for example, operation  of . Finally, the input\/output module  may include functionality associated with, for example, receiving a paste notification when a paste operation is initiated, including in manners such as those described previously with reference to, for example, operation  of . The input\/output module may also or instead include functionality associated with providing generated data, including in some implementations data generated by the converter module, to the destination application, including functionality associated with, for example, operation  of .","In some implementations an adapter application  may be written or implemented so that the execution of the adapter application and the functionality it provides does not require elevated privileges, such as \u201cadministrator\u201d or \u201croot\u201d access. Such an application may then in some cases be installed and\/or used by a wider variety of users.","It should be noted that while the source application , the destination application , and the adapter application  are shown in the exemplary system  as being separate applications that might exist in a single computer system, that the applications may in fact exist as part of fewer than three separate applications, and might exist as part of multiple different computer systems, as long as the computer systems are able to communicate data placed on a clipboard between the different computer systems. In addition, while the source application  and destination application  are shown as being separate applications, in some implementations source and destination functionality may be implemented as part of the same application, same web page, or related web pages, and the like.","Turning now to , shown therein is an exemplary system  that includes a graphical example of one mechanism for representing clipboard data, including a representation of data that might exist as destination data or might be provided to a destination application. The exemplary system may contain clipboard data , structured data , feed data , presentation data , and other data . Any or all of the structured data, feed data, presentation data, and other data may include references in at least some implementations. Structured data may be associated with one or more structured data formats, such as structured data format   and structured data format N . A structured data format may contain one or more items, such as item   and item N . Feed data may be associated with feeds like feed   and feed N , while a feed may be associated with some number of sets of feed items, such as feed items   and feed items N . A set of feed items, like feed items  , may be associated with some number of feed items, like feed item   and feed item N .

In some implementations, clipboard data may include some structured representation of the data itself (which may itself include references to additional data), feed or subscription information associated with a reference to additional data and about the structured data or about other data, and additional presentation or display representations of the structured data. In general, the term \u201cclipboard data\u201d may be interpreted to refer to destination data, including data generated by an adapter application or as part of a generate destination data operation, as described elsewhere herein.","In some implementations, clipboard data, such as the clipboard data , may be represented using a markup language, like XML, for example, or some other representation. It should be noted that while the system  and the clipboard data  may be described herein with reference to XML elements, XML attributes, and so on, the use of XML is not required and any description of such use herein is provided for exemplary purposes only.

A structured data format may be associated with some or all of the \u201ccontenttype\u201d, \u201ctype\u201d, and \u201cencoding\u201d attributes, as well as other attributes. The \u201ccontenttype\u201d attribute may represent the content type of data for the contained \u201citem\u201d elements. For example, this attribute may contain data defined by the Internet Assigned Names Association (IANA), like \u201ctext\/calendar\u201d, \u201capplication\/xhtml+mL\u201d, and so on. The \u201ctype\u201d attribute may represent a schema or format type of the data for the contained \u201citem\u201d elements. This may be useful, for example, if an IANA format identifier provided may not be sufficient to completely determine the type. For example, when the \u201ccontenttype\u201d attribute has a value of \u201ctext\/calendar\u201d there may be sufficient information to determine that the data associated with an \u201citem\u201d element is formatted using the iCal standard. In contrast, when the \u201ccontenttype\u201d attribute has a value such as \u201capplication\/xhtml+xml\u201d, additional information may be necessary to determine the format of the data in the \u201citem\u201d element. For example, in this case, the \u201ctype\u201d attribute might have a value of \u201cvevent\u201d, which might indicate that the data is formatted using the hCal standard. Finally, an \u201cencoding\u201d attribute may represent how the data associated with the \u201citem\u201d elements is encoded.","In some implementations, when multiple formats are provided, such as with multiple instances of structured data format   and structured data format N , it may be useful to order the formats in some fashion. For example, \u201chigher fidelity\u201d formats\u2014formats that may provide more data, for example\u2014might be ordered before \u201clower fidelity\u201d formats that do not provide as much data. (Lower fidelity formats may be more widely accepted by destinations, and so still may be preferable for some uses, or for some applications, web pages, and so on.)","After the format of the data is defined, for example, using a structured data format, like structured data format  , one or more items that are represented using that format may be provided. These items may correspond, for example, to the item   and item N . In some representations, these items may be associated with \u201citem\u201d elements that are perhaps located as children of \u201cdata\u201d and \u201cformat\u201d elements.","An \u201citem\u201d may represent data itself and may be associated with some or all of \u201cdescription\u201d and \u201cref\u201d attributes, as well as other attributes. The \u201cdescription\u201d attribute may represent additional data defined by the user or application. The \u201cref\u201d attribute may contain a reference, for example a URL, associated with the item.","The \u201citem\u201d element may also contain data itself. For example, when using XML, if the data can be represented as well-formed XML data that uses, say, the UTF-8 encoding, then the XML corresponding to the data may be appended as a child of the \u201citem\u201d element. In some other cases, for example when the data may not be represented as well-formed UTF-8 XML data, the data may reside in a CDATA section for the \u201citem\u201d element, optionally encoded in the format described by the \u201cencoding\u201d attribute of the enclosing \u201cformat\u201d element.","Data associated with either or both of the \u201cformat\u201d and \u201citem\u201d elements may include both \u201cby-value\u201d and \u201cby-reference\u201d data. That is, the actual data itself may be included, for example, in the \u201citem\u201d element. Alternatively, or in addition to the actual data, a reference to the data or to additional data may be included. That is, an \u201citem reference\u201d may be included in the data for a structured data item. In some implementations, for example, the reference to the data may be stored using the previously introduced \u201cref\u201d attribute. For example, in an item that contains information about a single contact or person, a by-value copy of the data might be provided as part of the \u201citem\u201d element itself, and a reference to that contact\u2014perhaps as a URL\u2014might be provided using the \u201cref\u201d attribute of the \u201citem\u201d element. In some cases, for a particular item, only by-value data may be provided, while in other cases only by-reference data may be provided, and while in yet other cases, both by-value and by-reference data may be provided.","In some implementations, when there are multiple structured data formats, the ordering of items beneath each format may indicate how items correspond to each other. For example, if clipboard data  includes two structured data formats X and Y, corresponding in some implementations to two \u201cformat\u201d elements, the first \u201citem\u201d element of format X may correspond to the first \u201citem\u201d element of format Y.

clipboard data representations may be associated with subscription or feed information that may be, in some implementations, associated with the feed data . Such information may be useful, for example, to transfer references to data, to represent feeds or sequences of data, enable subscriptions to data or feeds, and so on. In one example, item data may be provided using, for example, the structured data , and information about a feed that may be used to update the item data may be provided using the feed data . For example, an initial set of contacts or contact information might be provided using the structured data , and information in the feed data  may be provided to enable an application to later update the contacts initially provided using the structured data. In another example, the feed data may refer to some other data or information\u2014that is, for example, the feed data may refer to data that is not transferred in the structured data .

Note also that references may be represented and communicated in other fashions that do not use feed references in feed data.

A feed may be associated with some or all of the \u201ctype\u201d, \u201cref\u201d, \u201cdescription\u201d, and \u201cauthtype\u201d attributes, as well as other attributes. The \u201ctype\u201d attribute may represent the type of data that exists at the location specified, for example, by the \u201cref\u201d attribute. For example, the \u201ctype\u201d attribute may include values such as \u201cRSS\u201d, \u201cAtom\u201d, and so on, or other values. Generally, a wide variety of feed types may be used, depending upon, for example, the capabilities of the endpoints. For example, some implementations may support RSS, other implementations may support RSS and also support extensions to RSS to implement other functionality, and so on. For example, some endpoints may support \u201cSimple Sharing Extensions\u201d to enable bi-directional synchronization of data using RSS or other feed types. The \u201cref\u201d attribute may represent a specific reference or address associated with the feed, like a URL. In some implementations, this reference may be the location of the feed itself. The \u201cdescription\u201d may represent some user-specified data associated with the feed. Finally, the \u201cauthtype\u201d attribute may represent some type of authentication technique or techniques that may or must be used when accessing the feed.","Each feed may contain some number of sets of feed items, such as feed items   and feed items N . These may be represented in some cases by one or more \u201cfeeditems\u201d elements. In turn, a set of feed items may contain some number of feed items, which might be represented using \u201cfeeditem\u201d elements.","A set of feed items may be associated with the \u201ccontenttype\u201d, \u201ctype\u201d, and \u201cxpath\u201d attributes, as well as other attributes. The \u201ccontenttype\u201d attribute may represent the content type of data for the contained \u201cfeeditem\u201d elements. For example, similar to the structured data, this attribute may contain data defined by IANA, like \u201ctext\/calendar\u201d, \u201capplication\/xhtml+xml\u201d, and so on. The \u201ctype\u201d attribute may represent a schema or format type of the data for the contained \u201cfeeditem\u201d elements. This may be useful, like before and for example, if an IANA format identifier provided may not be sufficient to completely determine the type. For example, when the \u201ccontenttype\u201d attribute has a value of \u201ctext\/calendar\u201d there may be sufficient information to determine that the data associated with a \u201cfeeditem\u201d element is formatted using the iCalendar standard. In contrast, when the \u201ccontenttype\u201d attribute has a value such as \u201capplication\/xhtml+xml\u201d, additional information may be necessary to determine the format of the data in the \u201cfeeditem\u201d element. For example, in this case, the \u201ctype\u201d attribute might have a value of \u201cvevent\u201d, which might indicate that the data is formatted using the hCal standard.","The \u201cxpath\u201d attribute may represent a query\u2014perhaps using the XPath standard, but also represented using some other query language or standard\u2014that returns or otherwise identifies data items from the feed. For example, if a feed is retrieved using the \u201cref\u201d attribute of the parent \u201cfeed\u201d element, in some cases the query represented by the \u201cxpath\u201d attribute may be executed against the contents of the retrieved feed to identify particular data items in the feed. This may enable the feed to contain a variety of data, only some of which may be relevant for or associated with the clipboard data, and still enable the clipboard data to be associated directly with the relevant data. In addition, this may enable the relevant portions of the data to be changed, perhaps at some later time, by only changing the value of this attribute; the actual data in the feed would not necessarily need to change. In implementations that do not use the \u201cxpath\u201d attribute, or a similar type of attribute or query, all of the data associated with the feed may be relevant to, for example, a subsequent update or data retrieval operation.","Similar to with the structured data discussed previously, in some implementations, when multiple formats are provided, it may be useful to order the formats in some fashion. For example, higher fidelity formats\u2014again, formats that may provide more data, for example\u2014might be ordered before lower fidelity formats that do not provide as much data. As before, lower fidelity formats may be more widely accepted, and so still may be preferable for some uses, or for some applications, web pages, and so on.","A set of feed items may in turn be associated with or contain some number of \u201cfeeditem\u201d elements, which may in some cases, enable information retrieved from the feed to be linked to \u201citem\u201d elements provided, for example, in the structured data . A \u201cfeeditem\u201d element may be associated with an \u201cid\u201d attribute, or some other attribute or data, which may represent some type of identifier, perhaps a unique identifier, for the feed item. In implementations that do not use or include elements like the \u201cfeeditem\u201d element, data may still be retrieved and used, but in some cases the data may not be linked to the structured data also provided with the clipboard data.","In at least some implementations, if there are multiple instances of feeds, like feed   and feed N , the ordering of \u201cfeeditem\u201d elements beneath each feed may indicate that particular items correspond to each other. For example, in the case where there are two \u201cfeed\u201d elements named X and Y, the first \u201cfeeditem\u201d element associated with \u201cfeed\u201d X may correspond to the first \u201cfeeditem\u201d element associated with \u201cfeed\u201d Y. Also, in clipboard data that has structured data , the ordering of \u201cfeeditem\u201d elements may correspond to the ordering of \u201citem\u201d elements provided in the structured data .","An example clipboard data representation that uses feed data  is provided below, after the discussion of presentation data.","Finally, some clipboard data representations may be associated with presentation data, such as presentation data  and presentation format   and presentation format N . Such data may provide a formatted or display representation of data that may also be provided elsewhere in the clipboard data. For example, where the structured data  includes a contact, perhaps in the hCard or vCard formats, the presentation data may be associated with an instance of the same contact data represented using HTML, JPEG, or some other presentation data format. In many cases destination applications, web pages, or the like, that do not understand data in one or more structured data formats may still understand a display representation, like HTML or JPEG, and so may still be able to at least display or present the clipboard data.","Presentation may be represented in multiple ways, including, for example, in a manner similar to the following:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0098","num":"0097"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00011","num":"00011"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"105pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"<lc:presentations>","0 or 1 elements"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003<lc:format\/>","1 or more elements"]},{"entry":[{},"<\/lc:presentations>"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"When represented like this, the \u201cpresentations\u201d element may correspond to the presentation data , and the \u201cformat\u201d element may correspond to the presentation format   and presentation format N .","The presentation data  may be associated with some number of presentation formats. Each presentation format, perhaps represented by a \u201cformat\u201d element, may be associated with some or all of the \u201ccontenttype\u201d, \u201ctype\u201d, \u201cencoding\u201d, \u201cdescription\u201d, and \u201cref\u201d attributes, as well as other attributes. The \u201ccontenttype\u201d attribute may represent the content type of data, for example, for a CDATA section associated with this format. For example, this attribute may contain data defined by IANA, like \u201capplication\/xhtml+xml\u201d, and the like. The \u201ctype\u201d attribute may represent a schema or format type of the data for the format. Like before, this may be useful, for example, if an IANA format identifier provided may not be sufficient to completely determine the type. The \u201cencoding\u201d attribute may represent how the data associated with, for example, a CDATA section is encoded. The \u201cdescription\u201d attribute may represent data defined by the user or application. Finally, the \u201cref\u201d attribute may contain a reference, for example a URL, associated with the item.","Similar to with structured data, a \u201cformat\u201d element may also contain data itself. For example, when using XML, if the data can be represented as well-formed XML data that uses the UTF-8 encoding, then the XML corresponding to the data may be appended as a child of the \u201cformat\u201d element. In some other cases, for example when the data may not be represented as well-formed UTF-8 XML data, the data may reside in a CDATA section for the \u201cformat\u201d element, optionally encoded in the format described by the \u201cencoding\u201d attribute.","As just one example, suppose clipboard data or destination data is desired that represents contact information in the hCard format, an RSS feed associated with the contact information\u2014so the contact information can be updated at some later point in time, for example\u2014and an HTML representation of the contact data\u2014perhaps useful, for example, if a destination of the clipboard data does not understand the hCard format.","With such an example, the hCard contact data might be represented as

In some examples, schema definitions might be included using a top-level element\u2014one named \u201cschemas\u201d perhaps\u2014that might include child elements\u2014each perhaps named \u201cschema\u201d\u2014that contain information defining the schemas. Such schema information might be referenced using other parts of the clipboard data or destination data representation, including the \u201cformat\u201d element, the \u201cfeeditem\u201d element, and the like.","As just one specific example, a clipboard data or destination data representation that includes a schema definition associated with a contact might be represented as follows, where the \u201cschemaid\u201d attribute in the \u201cformat\u201d element references the \u201cschema\u201d element with the \u201cid\u201d attribute that has a value of \u201c1\u201d:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0113","num":"0112"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00016","num":"00016"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"<?xml version=\u201c1.0\u201d encoding=\u201cutf-8\u201d ?>"},{"entry":"<lc:liveclipboard version=\u201c0.93\u201d"},{"entry":"xmlns:lc=\u201chttp:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/schemas\/liveclipboard\u201d>"},{"entry":"<lc:data>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003<lc:format type=\u201ctext\/xml\u201d schemaid=\u201c1\u201d>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2002<lc:item>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003<URI>http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/contacts\/abcde<\/URI>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003<Name>John Doe<\/Name>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003<Address>1 Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052<\/Address>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003<PhoneNumber>425-555-1212<\/PhoneNumber>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2002<\/lc:item>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003<\/lc:format>"},{"entry":"\u2003<\/lc:data>"},{"entry":"\u2003<lc:schemas>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003<lc:schema id=\u201c1\u201d"},{"entry":"type=\u201chttp:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XMLSchema\u201d>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2002<xs:schema xmlns:xs=\u201chttp:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XMLSchema\u201d>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003<xs:complexType name=\u201cSimpleContact\u201d>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2002<xs:sequence>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<xs:element name=\u201cURI\u201d minOccurs=\u201c1\u201d maxOccurs=\u201c1\u201d"},{"entry":"type=\u201cxs:anyURI\u201d\/>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<xs:element minOccurs=\u201c1\u201d maxOccurs=\u201c1\u201d name=\u201cName\u201d"},{"entry":"type=\u201cxs:string\u201d\/>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<xs:element minOccurs=\u201c0\u201d maxOccurs=\u201c1\u201d"},{"entry":"name=\u201cAddress\u201d type=\u201cxs:string\u201d\/>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<xs:element minOccurs=\u201c0\u201d name=\u201cPhoneNumber\u201d"},{"entry":"type=\u201cxs:string\u201d\/>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2002<\/xs:sequence>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003<\/xs:complexType>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2002<\/xs:schema>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003<\/lc:schema>"},{"entry":"\u2003<\/lc:schemas>"},{"entry":"<\/lc:liveclipboard>"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}},"br":{}},"Turning now to , this figure and the related description are intended to provide a brief and general description of an exemplary computing environment in which the various technologies described herein may be implemented. Although not required, the technologies are described herein, at least in part, in the general context of computer-executable instructions, such as program modules that are executed by a controller, processor, personal computer, or other computing device, such as the computing device  illustrated in .","Generally, program modules include routines, programs, objects, components, user interfaces, data structures, and so on, that perform particular tasks, display particular information, or implement particular abstract data types. Operations performed by the program modules have been described previously with the aid of one or more block diagrams and operational flowcharts.","Those skilled in the art can implement the description, block diagrams, and operational flows in the form of computer-executable instructions, which may be embodied in one or more forms of computer-readable media.
