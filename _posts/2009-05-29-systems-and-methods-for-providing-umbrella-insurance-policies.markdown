{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Umbrella insurance refers to an insurance policy that protects the assets and future income of the policyholder above and beyond the standard limits set on their primary (i.e., underlying) insurance policies. Typically, an umbrella policy is pure liability coverage over and above the coverage afforded by the underlying policy, and is sold in increments of one million dollars. The term \u201cumbrella\u201d is used because it covers liability claims from all policies underneath it, such as automobile and homeowner's policies. For example, if one has an automobile insurance policy with liability limits of $500,000 and a homeowner's policy with a limit of $300,000, then with a million dollar umbrella insurance policy, one's limits become in effect, $1,500,000 on the automobile policy and $1,300,000 on a homeowners liability claim. Umbrella insurance may also provide coverage for claims that may be excluded by the primary policies often including, but not limited to: false arrest, libel, slander, and invasion of privacy.","While umbrella policies have long been thought of as coverage only needed by the very rich, it is becoming more and more apparent that everyone should have an umbrella policy. However, currently, no systems or methods exist for a customer to apply for and be issued an umbrella policy using a convenient automated process. Also, many current umbrella insurance product and pricing structures are very antiquated with many of the policy processes being performed manually. For example, typically, approximately 50% of the umbrella insurance policy renewals require manual intervention by a customer service representative and most adjustments to umbrella insurance policies are often performed at time of policy renewal instead of mid-term due to the manual process required.","In this regard, there is a need for systems and methods that overcome the shortcomings described above and others.","This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.","In consideration of the above-identified shortcomings of the art, systems and methods for providing an umbrella insurance policies are described herein.

Thus, although the physical environment depicted may show the connected devices as computers, such illustration is merely exemplary and the physical environment may alternatively be depicted or described comprising various digital devices such as PDAs, televisions, MP3 players, etc., software objects such as interfaces, COM objects and the like.","There are a variety of systems, components, and network configurations that support distributed computing environments. For example, computing systems may be connected together by wired or wireless systems, by local networks or widely distributed networks. Currently, many networks are coupled to the Internet, which provides an infrastructure for widely distributed computing and encompasses many different networks. Any such infrastructures, whether coupled to the Internet or not, may be used in conjunction with the systems and methods provided.","A network infrastructure may enable a host of network topologies such as client\/server, peer-to-peer, or hybrid architectures. The \u201cclient\u201d is a member of a class or group that uses the services of another class or group to which it is not related. In computing, a client is a process, i.e., roughly a set of instructions or tasks, that requests a service provided by another program. The client process utilizes the requested service without having to \u201cknow\u201d any working details about the other program or the service itself. In a client\/server architecture, particularly a networked system, a client is usually a computer that accesses shared network resources provided by another computer, e.g., a server. In the example of , any entity , , , , , ,  and  can be considered a client, a server, or both, depending on the circumstances.","A server is typically, though not necessarily, a remote computer system accessible over a remote or local network, such as the Internet. The client process may be active in a first computer system, and the server process may be active in a second computer system, communicating with one another over a communications medium, thus providing distributed functionality and allowing multiple clients to take advantage of the information-gathering capabilities of the server. Any software objects may be distributed across multiple computing devices or objects.","Client(s) and server(s) communicate with one another utilizing the functionality provided by protocol layer(s). For example, HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a common protocol that is used in conjunction with the World Wide Web (WWW), or \u201cthe Web.\u201d Typically, a computer network address such as an Internet Protocol (IP) address or other reference such as a Universal Resource Locator (URL) can be used to identify the server or client computers to each other. The network address can be referred to as a URL address. Communication can be provided over a communications medium, e.g., client(s) and server(s) may be coupled to one another via TCP\/IP connection(s) for high-capacity communication.","In light of the diverse computing environments that may be built according to the general framework provided in  and the further diversification that can occur in computing in a network environment such as that of , the systems and methods provided herein cannot be construed as limited in any way to a particular computing architecture. Instead, the embodiments should be construed in breadth and scope in accordance with the appended claims.","Referring next to  shown is a block diagram of an example system for providing umbrella insurance policies. Shown are an example customer , network , customer interface generator , example customer service representative , umbrella insurance underwriting engine , customer homeowner's insurance records database , and customer automobile insurance records database . The customer interface generator  and example customer  are operably connected to each other through the network  such that they may be in remote communication with each other. The customer  may be operably connected to the network  via a personal computer or one or more mobile devices. A mobile device as described herein may include, but is not limited to, one or a combination of the following types of wireless devices: cellular phone, smart phone, satellite phone, personal digital assistant (PDA), mobile computing devices, handheld computers, and other mobile communication devices The network  may be one or a combination of the following types of networks: computer communications network, the Internet, an intranet, data communications network, close or long range wireless network, satellite network, cellular network, telephone network, radio network, etc. The customer interface generator  is operable for providing an interface to the customer for electronically interacting with the umbrella insurance policy underwriting engine  in order to obtain an umbrella insurance quote and be issued an umbrella insurance policy. For example, the customer interface generator  may generate interactive web pages to be presented to the customer over the network , which may be the Internet. The umbrella insurance policy underwriting engine  is in operable communication with the customer interface generator  over a computer network, for example.","The umbrella insurance policy underwriting engine  and customer interface generator  may also be in operable communication with and\/or be operably connected to the customer homeowner's insurance records database  and the customer automobile insurance records database  via a computer network, for example. In one embodiment, the customer interface generator , customer homeowner's insurance records database  and the customer automobile insurance records database  are all connected to a network controlled or operated by an insurance company. In addition to the customer homeowner's insurance records database , there may be other insurance records databases having data on fire insurance, renter's insurance, etc, connected to a network controlled or operated by the insurance company.","The insurance company may provide a variety of insurance products to the customer  such as homeowner's, automobile, personal property, liability and umbrella insurance products and the customer  may be a new or existing customer of the insurance company. If the customer is an existing customer, then the customer homeowner's insurance records database  and the customer automobile insurance records database  may have existing data on the customer's current and past insurance policies with the insurance company as well as other customer data. However, the customer homeowner's insurance records database  and the customer automobile insurance records database  may also be those of a different insurance company to which the umbrella insurance policy underwriting engine has access.","The customer service representative  is also in operable communication with the customer interface generator . Thereby, the customer service representative  has access to and can interact with the same or similar interface generated by the customer interface generator  as that for the customer . Essentially the customer service representative  will be able to monitor the customer's interactions with the interface generated by the customer interface generator  and interact with the interface in a similar manner to provide assistance to the customer  and intervene in the automated processes for providing umbrella insurance policies to the customer  as needed.","Referring next to , shown is a flowchart illustrating an example process for providing a quote in a process for providing umbrella insurance policies. A customer such as that customer  of , for example, may electronically access an interface for providing umbrella insurance policies. The interface may be generated by a customer interface generator such as that in , for example. If an existing customer, the customer's identity may be authenticated  through the generated interface. Information is then collected  regarding the customer's household for purposes of issuing an umbrella policy quote. This information may be collected through the electronic interface (e.g., a web interface) and may include, but is not limited to, one or more of the following types of information: age of people within the customer's household, credit score of the customer, insurance credit score of the customer, number of products the customers holds with the insurance company, how long the customer has been a customer of the insurance company, exposures of the customer regarding their underlying insurance coverage, vehicles in storage of the customer, farm exposure of the customer, animal liability of the customer, information regarding oil tanks of the customer, vehicles or properties of the customer used in business, driving record of the customer and others in the customer's household, information regarding litigation the customer has been involved in, open or closed liability claims against the customer, claims history of customer's automobile, homeowner's, renter's, fire, watercraft and umbrella insurance, number of rental properties of the customer, whether the customer races vehicles or watercraft, whether there is unsupervised use of motorized watercraft by minors, information regarding the ownership or use of high-powered boats, information regarding non-owned automobile of the customer, whether the customer or customer's household member is high profile or high social status, information regarding dog breeds within the household, information regarding swimming pools of the customer, information regarding trampolines of the customer, and information regarding an underwriting relationship of the customer to the insurance company providing the quote. The underwriting relationship of the customer may be at different levels depending on the history the customer has with the insurance company previously underwriting insurance policies for the customer. The information listed above may be collected by questions presented to the customer in an automated fashion such as on a web page interface wherein the customer may provide answers on the same web page interface. Also, the information above may be automatically retrieved from existing customer records as well.","If the customer is an existing customer, the customer's existing automobile and homeowner's insurance records are then automatically accessed   and one or more pieces of accessed information are automatically displayed  to the customer for verification. The displayed information may include, but is not limited to, information regarding existing insured vehicles, homes, other insured property, coverage amounts, and information regarding existing insurance policies. The customer may then update, change or add information as applicable. If the customer is not an existing customer, they may be allowed to add vehicles, homes or other pieces of property via the same interface to obtain underlying coverage.","It may then be automatically decided  whether to accept, refer or decline the customer's umbrella policy application based on a number of factors including the information gathered from the customer and accessed in the existing records of the customer and other criteria explained further below in reference to . The automatic decision process may, for example, be performed by the Umbrella Insurance Policy Underwriting Engine  shown in . It is then automatically determined  whether the application has been accepted. If it has been accepted, then a premium may be automatically calculated  and a quote automatically displayed  based on the calculated premium. If the application is not accepted (i.e., either declined or deferred) a message may be automatically displayed  to the customer to contact a customer service representative at a given phone number. The automated process for calculating  the premium may, for example, be performed by the Umbrella Insurance Policy Underwriting Engine  shown in . An example automated process for calculating  the premium is described further with reference to  below.","Referring next to , shown is a flowchart illustrating an example process for issuing an umbrella insurance policy based on a quote provided according to the process shown in . First, a quote is electronically displayed with umbrella coverage amount options. For example, a quote may be displayed for $1,000,000 of coverage, but the customer may be given options to see what the quote would be for other coverage amounts (such as 2, 3, 4, or 5 million dollars of coverage, for example). It is then determined whether the customer selected to change the amount of coverage. If the customer did change the coverage amount (e.g., by selecting 2 million dollars of coverage in a drop-down menu), then the quote is automatically recalculated  according to the selected coverage amount. In one embodiment, the quote calculations for a plurality of optional amounts of coverage would be calculated ahead of time during the calculation of the initial coverage amount so that the quote calculations could be immediately displayed when the corresponding amount of coverage is selected.","Next, the customer's electronic acceptance of the quote may be received  (e.g., initiated by the customer clicking on an \u201caccept\u201d or \u201cnext\u201d button) and the customer's existing automobile and homeowner's insurance records are automatically accessed  . The current underlying coverage and required underlying coverage amounts may then be displayed . The current underlying coverage amounts are those amounts of underlying insurance coverage retrieved from the accessed automobile and homeowner's insurance records of the customer. The required underlying coverage amounts are those which the customer is required to maintain in order to keep the umbrella policy in effect. An electronic acceptance may be received  from the customer of the required underlying coverage amounts and then the umbrella insurance policy may be automatically issued  and the umbrella policy information displayed to the customer.","Referring next to , shown is a flowchart illustrating an example process for determining  whether to accept, defer or decline an application for an umbrella insurance policy according to the process shown in . First, customer information is automatically gathered  from accessed existing customer records and answers provided by the customer through the provided electronic interface (e.g., a web interface). This information may include, but is not limited to, one or more of the following: age of people within the customer's household, credit score of the customer, insurance credit score of the customer, number of products the customers holds with the insurance company, how long the customer has been a customer of the insurance company, exposures of the customer regarding their underlying insurance coverage, vehicles in storage of the customer, farm exposure of the customer, animal liability of the customer, information regarding oil tanks of the customer, vehicles or properties of the customer used in business, driving record of the customer and others in the customer's household, information regarding litigation the customer has been involved in, open or closed liability claims against the customer, claims history of customer's automobile, homeowner's, renter's, fire, watercraft and umbrella insurance, number of rental properties of the customer, whether the customer races vehicles or watercraft, whether there is unsupervised use of motorized watercraft by minors, information regarding the ownership or use of high-powered boats, information regarding non-owned automobile of the customer, whether the customer or customer's household member is high profile or high social status, information regarding dog breeds within the household, information regarding swimming pools of the customer, information regarding trampolines of the customer, and information regarding an underwriting relationship of the customer to the insurance company providing the quote. The underwriting relationship of the customer may be at different levels depending on the history the customer has with the insurance company previously underwriting insurance policies for the customer.","A customer score is then automatically calculated  based on the gathered information. The score may be calculated , for example by providing different values to the different pieces of information listed above as they are applicable to the particular customer and adding those values together to obtain a total score. It is then automatically determined  whether to accept, refer or decline umbrella insurance application based on calculated score. For example, if the customer score is below or above a certain value, then an automatic decision may be made to refer the application for further underwriting review. Also, for example, if the customer score is below or above a different certain value, then an automatic decision may be made to decline the application. The automated process described for determining  whether to accept, defer or decline an application for an umbrella insurance policy may be performed, for example, by the umbrella insurance policy underwriting engine shown in . Also, The Customer Service Representative () has the ability to override Acceptability decisions derived scores determined from the variables in the Underwriting Engine ().","Referring next to , shown is a flowchart illustrating an example process for calculating  a premium quote for an umbrella insurance policy according to the process shown in . First, customer information is automatically gathered  from accessed existing customer records and answers provided by the customer through the provided electronic interface (e.g., a web interface). This information may include, but is not limited to, one or more of the following: insurance credit score, military status, military commission source, military rank, collateral of the customer held by the insurance company providing the quote or bank associated with the insurance company providing the quote, prior auto insurance lapses, umbrella insurance tenure with the insurance company providing the quote, auto insurance tenure with the insurance company providing the quote, and whether the customer owns a home.","An underwriting relationship level value of the customer may then automatically calculated  by assigning scores to attributes related to the gathered customer information above and summing all the scores together. Next, the customer may automatically be placed  into a tier based on the calculated underwriting relationship level value. Finally, umbrella policy quotes are automatically calculated  based on the tier into which customer was placed and based on predetermined optional amounts of coverage.","Referring next to , shown is a flowchart illustrating an example process for automatically updating a customer's existing umbrella insurance policy based on changes to the customer's underlying insurance policies. First, it is automatically determined  whether a change has been made to the customer's underlying homeowner's or automobile insurance policy. For example, this change may have been made by the customer adding or removing a vehicle or home from a policy, changing coverage amounts, changing risk factors, etc. These changes may be detected by computerized systems of the insurance company or other service provider with access to insurance records of the customer.","If a change has been made, then the customer's umbrella insurance policy records are automatically accessed . It is then automatically determined  whether an adjustment is needed to the customer's current umbrella policy in view of the changes to the customer's underlying homeowner's or automobile insurance policy. For example, if the customer adds a vehicle or home to their underlying insurance policy or policies, then additional umbrella coverage based on that additional vehicle or home added may be needed. If an adjustment is needed to the customer's current umbrella policy in view of the changes to underlying homeowner's or automobile insurance policy, then customer's umbrella insurance policy is automatically updated  in view of the changes made to customer's underlying homeowner's or automobile insurance policy. These automatic updates may have been preauthorized by the customer and may be performed by computerized systems of the insurance company accessing and updating the umbrella insurance records of the customer. Additionally, the policy changes may then be automatically communicated to the customer and\/or reflected in the customer's next insurance billing statement.","It is noted that the foregoing examples have been provided merely for the purposes of explanation and are in no way to be construed as limiting of the present invention.
