More specifically, the present invention relates to collecting entity aliases from various sources.","The detection and identification of entity aliases are often needed in the fields of security, business analysis and scientific research. The term \u201centity\u201d, as used herein, refers to specific entities, objects or events for which information is stored, for example, a person's name, a place's name, an organization's name, a product's name, etc. An entity often has several \u201caliases,\u201d which refer to additional assumed names of the entity, for example, the legacy names, the abbreviations, or the commonly misused names of the entity. For example, the organizational entity \u201cBeijing Scientific and Technology University\u201d has aliases including \u201cBeijing College of Iron and Steel Technology\u201d (legacy name), \u201cBei Ke Da\u201d (abbreviation), \u201cSteel College\u201d (abbreviation of legacy name), \u201cCapital Scientific and Technology University\u201d (misused name), etc. In an ideal entity dataset, it is desirable that all of these aliases are identified and merged into one group, so that such an entity dataset can better serve various applications, such as building a data warehouse, performing client relationship management (CRM) and fraud detection. The detection and identification of entity aliases are becoming increasingly important.","The existing solutions to the entity alias problem focus on the discrimination of the identity of entities, that is, to discriminate whether two or more entities are identical from various available clues. These solutions can be divided into two categories based upon whether they use a reference dataset. In the first category, all the input entities are matched to the existing reference entities, and those entities matching with a same reference entity are regarded as aliases. In the second category, the input entities are directly matched to each other. In either solution, the core matching method relies on computing the morphologic, orthographic, phonetic, or semantic similarities of the tokens associated with the entities. For example, the phonetic-based Soundex algorithm encodes all English words by removing vowels and representing the consonants with six phonetic classifications of human speech sounds (bilabial, labiodental, dental, alveolar, velar, and glottal). The \u201cedit distance\u201d algorithm assumes that the differences between two strings can be measured by three kinds of writing alternations (insertion, deletion, substitution). The \u201cbehavior-based\u201d algorithm asserts that two entities are connected if they share similar semantic links in a dataset (e.g., if two Email IDs have the same patterns of inbound and outbound emails, then they are most probably owned by a same entity).","The above two existing solutions to the entity alias problem discriminate a number of entities (the \u201cinput entities\u201d) after having obtained these entities through certain ways, but the solutions do not concern how to get these input entities. Therefore, these solutions cannot solve the problem of obtaining a collection of all the possible aliases for a specific entity.","On the other hand, with the flouring Web 2.0 technology, social tags for Web objects are easily available from social tag websites. In a network-socialized environment, authors and readers are allowed to select their preferred \u201ctags\u201d for a Web object (e.g., Web pages, images, or video segments), i.e., keywords or terms associated with that Web object, and share with others. The social tags, as metadata conferred by the public to Web objects, make possible the social sharing of the network information. For example, when a reader is interested in a Web object, he can get a list of tags added by others to the Web object from the social tag websites, so that the reader may quickly determine the property and usage of the object.","However, social tags, as a tool for enabling the social sharing of network information, has not yet been utilized in collecting entity aliases.","Accordingly, what is needed is a method and system to enhance the above described characteristics of the prior art to provide for improved collection of entity aliases.","The object of the present invention is to solve the above problem in the prior art and to provide a method, apparatus and computer program product for collecting entity aliases automatically and quickly.","According to the first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for collecting entity aliases that includes obtaining, from a web search engine, at least one Web object associated with a user' input entity. The method also includes obtaining, from a social tag website, a respective set of social tags for each of the Web objects and defining, based upon the respective set of social tags, candidate aliases for the user's input entity. The method additionally includes refining the candidate aliases to obtain a collection of aliases of the user's input entity","According to the second aspect of the present invention, there is provided an apparatus for collecting entity aliases includes a web object collection component that obtains, from a web search engine, at least one Web object associated with a user' input entity. The apparatus also includes a social tag collection component that obtains a respective set of social tags for each of the Web objects from a social tag website and defines candidate aliases for the user's input entity based upon the respective set of social tags. The Apparatus further includes an aliases refinement component refines the candidate aliases to obtain a collection of aliases of the user's input entity.","According to the present invention, it is possible to automatically and quickly collect the aliases of almost all the real world entities by obtaining a large number of associated Web objects and their social tags. In addition, social tags reflect the public's cognition of the Web objects associated with the entity. Therefore, the alias collecting based on the social tags have a social nature. As compared with other alias collecting methods which are based on the collector's subjective cognition, the results of the present invention are more comprehensive and more time-effective. Based on the collection of entity aliases obtained by the present invention, the alias resolution can be directly performed by verifying whether designated entities appear in the same one collection.","Below, embodiments of the invention will be described in detail in conjunction with the appended figures. The figures form a part of the specification and illustrate some embodiments of the invention. It is understood that other embodiments may be used and changes in structures and operations may be made without departing from the scope of the invention.

The received social tags  are considered as candidate aliases of the user's input entity . Then, social tag collection component  provides these social tags (i.e., candidate aliases)  to the alias refinement component  for refinement processing.","Alias refinement component  applies named entity recognition (NER) technology to each tag  provided by the social tag collection component , so as to recognize and label the entities therein. Then, the entities are ranked according to one or more of the following criteria: the homogeneity between the entity as recognized and the user's input entity  (i.e., whether the recognized entity and the user's input entity  are of the same kind, and if not, the degree of similarity between them), the occurrence frequency of the tags which contain the recognized entity, and the authoritativeness of the Web objects from which the entity is obtained, etc. Finally, those entities which have a rank higher than a predetermined threshold are determined as a collection of aliases of the user's input entity .","Next, the method for collecting entity aliases according to the present invention will be explained with reference to the processing flowchart in , which illustrates a processing flow of a method for collecting entity aliases according to one embodiment of the present invention. In this example, it is assumed that the user wants to collect the aliases of the organizational entity \u201cCornell University\u201d.","In step , Web object collection component , upon receiving the entity name \u201cCornell University\u201d input by the user, searches for the input entity \u201cCornell University\u201d on Web search engine websites  such as Google, Baidu, and Yahoo!, so as to obtain a list of Web objects associated with the entity.","Web object collection component  can search for Web objects associated with an entity on Web search engine website  in the following two ways.","The first way is to search by means of programming interface of the Web search engine. Generally, major Web search engine service providers like Google and Yahoo! have provided convenient application programming interfaces. In this case, Web object collection component  directly sends the content to be searched to Web search engine website  via the programming interface, and the website  returns the search results in a structuralized form. Table 1 shows an example using the application programming interface of Google (Google API). The search function using the Google API is able to be realized through the following Java pseudo codes based on the specific client key obtained in advance from Google company and the Google API development toolkit downloaded in advance:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"105pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"112pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["GoogleSearch s = new","\/\/ create a Google search service"]},{"entry":["GoogleSearch( );","instance;"]},{"entry":["s.setKey(clientKey);","\/\/ set client key in the service instance"]},{"entry":["s.setQueryString(name of the","\/\/ set query string"]},{"entry":"entity to be searched);"},{"entry":["GoogleSearchResult result =","\/\/ start Goolgle to conduct search, and"]},{"entry":["s.doSearch( );","\u2003the search results are obtained from"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003GoogleSearchResult"]},{"entry":["GoogleSearchResultElement[ ]","\/\/ obtain search results data array,"]},{"entry":["re = run.getResultElements( );","each item in the data array being"]},{"entry":[{},"called a \u201cSearch Result Element\u201d"]},{"entry":["for each","\/\/read the items in the search results"]},{"entry":["GoogleSearchResultElement e in","from the data array of the Result"]},{"entry":["the array re, {","Elements"]},{"entry":["\u2003e.getURL( );","\/\/get the URL of the search results"]},{"entry":["\u2003e.getTitle( );","\/\/ get the title of the search results"]},{"entry":"}"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"The second way is to use Internet connection to get the returned page from the Web search engine, and then analyze the format of the returned page to obtain the search results.

The learned model  describes the contribution probability of all the features in the feature vector to each named entity type.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["504","601","505","602","508","603","604"]},"For the example of \u201cCornell University\u201d, the recognition result of the named entity recognition engine for the collected social tags are illustrated in TABLE 6:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00006","num":"00006"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"133pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},"TABLE 6"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Social tags","Results of named entity recognition"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Cornell","\u201cCornell\u201d: family name, proper noun"]},{"entry":[{},"Cornell_University","\u201cCornell\u201d: family name, proper noun"]},{"entry":[{},{},"\u201cCornell_University\u201d: name of"]},{"entry":[{},{},"university"]},{"entry":[{},"Mann_Library","\u201cMann\u201d: family name, proper noun"]},{"entry":[{},{},"\u201cMann_Library\u201d: name of building"]},{"entry":[{},"Cornell_Univ","\u201cCornell\u201d: family name, proper noun"]},{"entry":[{},{},"\u201cCornell_Univ\u201d: abbreviation of"]},{"entry":[{},{},"university name"]},{"entry":[{},"Big_Red","\u201cBig_Red\u201d: nickname"]},{"entry":[{},"Computer_Science","\u201cComputer_Science\u201d: name of discipline"]},{"entry":[{},"Cornell_U","\u201cCornell\u201d: family name, proper noun"]},{"entry":[{},{},"\u201cCornell_U\u201d: abbreviation of university"]},{"entry":[{},{},"name"]},{"entry":[{},"academia","No named entity"]},{"entry":[{},"gradschool","No named entity"]},{"entry":[{},"new_york","\u201cnew_york\u201d: name of place"]},{"entry":[{},"Library","\u201cLibrary\u201d: general name of buildings"]},{"entry":[{},"College","\u201cCollege\u201d: general name of universities"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"Step filters away those tags containing no entity.","In step , the entities recognized in step are ranked according to one or more of the following criteria or the combination thereof: the homogeneity with the entity input by the user, the occurrence frequency of the tags which contain the entity, and the authoritativeness of the Web objects from which the entity is obtained, etc. For example, types like \u201cuniversity name\u201d and \u201cabbreviation of university name\u201d can be regarded as having a higher homogeneity with the user's input entity, while types like \u201cgeneral name of buildings\u201d and \u201cname of place\u201d are regarded as having a lower homogeneity with the user's input entity. Regarding the authoritativeness of the Web objects, as mentioned in step  previously, it can be determined from URL type of the Web objects. For example, Web objects of \u201chomepage\u201d type can be regarded as having the highest authoritativeness, Web objects of \u201centry page\u201d type can be regarded as having a lower authoritativeness, and Web objects of \u201carticle page\u201d type can be regarded as having the lowest authoritativeness.","In step , those entities with a rank higher than a predetermined threshold in step are collected as the aliases of the user's input entity.","For the example of \u201cCornell University\u201d, the collection of aliases finally determined by the aliases refinement component  based on a predetermined combination of the above criteria is as follows:\n\n","In similar ways to the above example, it is possible to automatically and quickly collect the aliases of almost all the real world entities by obtaining a large number of Web objects and their social tags.","The present invention has been described above with reference to one embodiment. It should be noted that, the description of one embodiment is only for illustration purpose and shall not be understood as limiting the present invention. For example, in the embodiment described above, entity aliases collection apparatus  accesses to search engine website  like Google and Baidu via network  to obtain a list of Web objects associated with the input entities. However, those skilled in the art can appreciate that the present invention is not limited to this. Entity aliases collection apparatus  itself can run a search engine or can be coupled to a local search engine apparatus to obtain a list of Web objects associated with the input entities. As another example, in the embodiment described above, social tag collection component  collects social tags for all the Web objects returned by the web object collection component . However, the present invention is not limited to this. Instead, according to predetermined rules, social tags can be collected only for some of the Web objects (e.g., Web objects of specific types, or a certain number of Web objects from the beginning of the returned list).","Moreover, the present invention may be embodied as computer program product, and can be accessed from computer readable medium. The computer readable medium provides program code for use in conjunction with computers or any other instruction executing systems. The computer readable medium may be electronic, magnetic, optical, electromagnetic, infra and semiconductor devices. The specific examples of computer readable medium include semiconductor or solid memory, magnetic tape, removable disk, random access memory (RAM), read only memory (ROM), hard disk and optical disk. The current examples of optical disk include CD-ROM, CD-R\/W, and DVD, etc.","Although a specific embodiment of the invention has been disclosed, it will be understood by those having skill in the art that various modifications and changes can be made without departing the spirit and scope of the present invention.
