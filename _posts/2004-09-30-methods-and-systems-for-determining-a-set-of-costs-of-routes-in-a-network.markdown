No. 60\/508,633 filed on Oct. 3, 2003, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.","At least a portion of the disclosure herein was developed in accordance with solicitation NSF 02-056, Proposal 0349676, and\/or SBIR award 0232169, and accordingly, the U.S. government may have certain rights in the disclosed methods and systems.","(1) Field","The disclosed methods and systems relate generally to routing schemes, and more particularly to routing techniques that improve network lifetime and latency.","(2) Description of Relevant Art","Ad-hoc networks generally can be understood to be a collection of wireless hosts forming a temporary network without the support of centralized administration and\/or support services typically associated with infrastructure-based networks such as wide area networks. Mobile ad hoc networks extend the notion of ad hoc networks to include cases where nodes are allowed to move relative to each other such that the routing topology itself is dynamic. As provided herein, ad hoc networks and mobile ad hoc networks will be referred to collectively as ad hoc networks.","Ad hoc networks can be used, for example, in an emergency situation where emergency personnel may need unencumbered access to situational awareness information and\/or to share information with others. Given the likely disruption of public communications infrastructure due to, for example, subscriber overload during crisis situations, the use of wireless communication devices is essential to emergency personnel. Ideally, these wireless devices should be portable, lightweight, and have long battery life. As a result, these devices have limited range. The aforementioned ad-hoc networks allow for multi-hop configurations so that users who are otherwise out of range of each other can still communicate.","The lifetime of an ad hoc network as a whole is clearly subject to the battery capacity of constituent node devices. Moreover, not only are the bandwidths of these wireless devices necessarily limited, but the capacity of any given wireless link is in general varies as a function of the signal-to-noise ratios observed between the end nodes. Routing algorithms should therefore consider link capacity, available node energy, and traffic load in optimizing the performance of ad hoc networks.","Traditional \u201cshortest path\u201d schemes that are employed in ad-hoc network routing typically yield routing topologies where small numbers of network paths are heavily used. Such schemes can cause path contention, which increases latency through queueing delay, reduces throughput, and induces disproportionately heavy leads on a few network nodes (e.g., devices). Uneven loading can cause premature network failure due to accelerated draining of node device batteries at one or more critical nodes.","Some research regarding ad-hoc network routing includes energy conservation routing techniques to ameliorate the aforementioned battery problem; however, such energy routing techniques if used by themselves as standalone algorithms can more than triple latency, create energy-wasting routing loops, and are sensitive to traffic load assumptions.","The disclosed methods and systems provide for routing schemes that improve network lifetime and latency while making the routing solution less sensitive to network traffic load assumptions. In example embodiments, the networks are ad-hoc networks, although the methods, systems, and processor program products are not limited to ad-hoc networks. The disclosed methods and systems illustrate mathematical optimization of network lifetime and network latency, and subsequently a mathematical optimization that reduces solution sensitivities to assumed traffic loads.","Disclosed are methods, systems, and processor program products for determining a set of costs of routes in a network, including: providing a model of the network, optimizing the model for maximum network lifetime, updating the model using a constraint based on the maximum network lifetime, optimizing the updated model for minimum network latency, modifying the updated model using a constraint based on the minimum network latency, and, optimizing the modified updated model by balancing the network across multiple pathways to provide the costs. Providing a model comprises specifying at least one constraint based on the energy of nodes in the network, for example, a constraint based on an initial battery energy of nodes in the network. In an embodiment, providing a model comprises specifying at least one constraint based on available node communications capacity for nodes in the network.","Optimizing the model for maximum network lifetime can include determining a maximum (achievable) network lifetime, and also, updating the model using a constraint based on the maximum network lifetime can include constraining the model based on a percentage of the maximum network lifetime, where the percentage can be between zero and one-hundred.","Optimizing the updated model for minimum network latency can include determining the minimum number of relays to communicate information between network nodes based on the maximum network lifetime. The constraint(s) based on the maximum network lifetime can include a percentage of the maximum network lifetime, where the percentage can be between one and one-hundred. Accordingly, modifying the updated model using a constraint based on the minimum network latency can include constraining the updated model based on a multiplier of the number of relays, where the multiplier can be greater than or equal to one.","In an embodiment, optimizing the modified updated model by balancing the network across multiple pathways includes optimizing using quadratic programming. As is understood in the art, the quadratic programming provides the costs.","In some embodiments, the methods and systems can include providing a model of the network, optimizing the model for minimum network latency, updating the model using at least one constraint based on the minimum network latency, optimizing the updated model for maximum network lifetime, modifying the updated model using at least one constraint based on the maximum network lifetime, and, optimizing the modified updated model by balancing the network across multiple pathways to provide the costs.","Also disclosed are methods, systems, and processor program products for computing a set of costs of routes in a network, where such systems and methods can include a fast approximation, and may include constructing a list of selected nodes that includes nodes for which an optimal route to a core node is identified, associating therewith a nexthop to reach the core node and a cost to reach the core node through the nexthop, constructing a list of available nodes which have been selected and have neighbors which have not been selected, for each of the available nodes, identifying an available node and computing a cost of each unselected neighbor to reach the core node through the identified available node, selecting the identified available node and unselected neighbor having the lowest cost, generating alternative nexthops by constructing a list of selected neighbors having a cost to reach the core through the identified available node, the cost within a threshold, removing the identified available node from the available node list if the identified available node has no unselected neighbors, adding the unselected neighbor having the lowest cost to the available node list if said neighbor node has unselected neighbors, and, returning to identifying an available node until the available node list is empty.","Also disclosed are systems and processor program products for implementing the disclosed methods. For example, disclosed are processor program products disposed on a processor readable medium and having instructions to optimize a model of a network for maximum network lifetime, update the model using at least one constraint based on the maximum network lifetime, optimize the updated model for minimum network latency, modify the updated model using at least one constraint based on the minimum network latency, and, optimize the modified updated model by balancing the network across multiple pathways to provide the costs. As provided herein, the order of the lifetime and latency optimizations can be reversed in the disclosed methods, systems, and processor program products.","Other objects and advantages will become apparent hereinafter in view of the specification and drawings.","To provide an overall understanding, certain illustrative embodiments will now be described; however, it will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that the systems and methods described herein can be adapted and modified to provide systems and methods for other suitable applications and that other additions and modifications can be made without departing from the scope of the systems and methods described herein.","Unless otherwise specified, the illustrated embodiments can be understood as providing exemplary features of varying detail of certain embodiments, and therefore, unless otherwise specified, features, components, modules, and\/or aspects of the illustrations can be otherwise combined, separated, interchanged, and\/or rearranged without departing from the disclosed systems or methods.

Optimal routing schemes attempting to minimize latency will try to minimize the number of hops N (which is a multiplier on nearly all the terms), and accept the resulting queuing delays as a matter of course; however, since adding a single packet of queuing delay at each node effectively doubles the latency, (two packets of queuing delay triples the latency, etc.), ignoring the path contention that arises using standard optimal routing techniques can severely impact delivery latency.","Two basic types of \u201cclassic\u201d optimal routing protocols include distance-vector protocols, of which the Routing Information Protocol (RIP) is an example, and link-state protocols, of which the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol is an example. Distance-vector (DV) protocols are characterized by the exchange of large amounts of cost information between small numbers of nodes. Specifically, each node provides its current notion of the minimum cost path and an associated next hop for reachable destinations only to its immediate neighbors. As such, only partial knowledge of the topology is maintained at each node. Optimal routes for each destination are (re)computed after each exchange using the Bellman-Ford scheme. A majority of current generation MANET routing protocols are DV-based.","In contrast, link-state (LS) protocols are characterized by the exchange of small amounts of cost information between large numbers of nodes. Specifically, each node provides other nodes in its routing domain with its cost to reach each of its immediate neighbors. As such, LS protocols develop and maintain a complete description of the routing topology as part of its normal operation, in contrast with DV protocols. Optimal routes for each destination are (re)computed after each exchange using the Dijkstra scheme. The communications overhead needed for route maintenance using LS protocols is actually smaller than that for DV protocols, at the expense of somewhat increased computational load.","Both the Bellman-Ford and the Dijkstra schemes admit the use of a variety of cost metrics, including hop count, delay, bandwidth, and monetary measures. The shortcoming of either scheme in terms of minimizing latency, however, is not due to the choice of metric, but rather the tendency of both techniques to produce routing topologies where a small number of \u201ccore\u201d routes carry much of the traffic. With only a small number of routes carrying most of the traffic, path contention is unavoidable and a result includes queuing delays that can impact delivery latency.","As an example, consider the operation of the Bellman-Ford scheme. When a node receives an update from a neighbor advertising a lower cost path to a destination, the node updates its cost information and modifies its route so that all packets for that destination address are forwarded through that neighbor. Hence, a neighbor offering a low cost path to one or more destinations is in fact inviting all upstream routers to forward packets through it along the same path. The results are routing topologies with a strong tendency for establishing common paths.","The additional topology information available within a LS routing approach can provide other alternatives. Since each node has identical information to every other node, each node can, using substantially identical calculations, predict the route all other nodes will select to reach any given destination. As such, each node can then construct a route to any given destination that minimizes the expected path contention integrated across the set of all possible send nodes. This approach, referred to as Power-aware Latency Minimized Statistical Routing (PALMS), not only reduces the expected delivery latency, but also distributes delivery across multiple parallel paths, thereby more evenly distributing energy consumption. In particular, using consumed energy as a cost metric, distributed energy consumption results directly from the optimization process.","A simulation using a set of routes to a central core node from all other nodes within a fixed radius was performed using the base Dijkstra scheme and the aforementioned PALMS approach. Such simulation showed a tendency of the Dijkstra approach to yield routing topologies with a small number of heavily loaded links; however the PALMS approach produced a considerably more diffused routing tree. Such a result can be inferred to result from a manner that PALMS network nodes leverage the multiple pathways. Specifically, PALMS uses Concurrent Multipath Routing (CMR) techniques to randomly route packets along the different possible paths on a packet-by-packet basis. This allows PALMS to distribute transmission load even when the traffic to a given receiver is largely from a single sender and part of the same flow. In some experimental embodiments, PALMS demonstrated an ability to keep networks alive twice as long when compared with shortest path schemes such as Dijkstra, while maintaining or even improving upon throughput and latency. Moreover, because of its intentional use of multipath, PALMS demonstrated superior robustness to differences between assumed and actual network loads.","In a maximum system lifetime problem formulation, a wireless networking configuration can be modeled as a directed graph G(N, A) where N is the set of all nodes and A is the set of all directed links (i, j) where i, j\u03b5N. Let Sbe the set of all nodes that can be reached by node i with a certain power level in its dynamic range. It can be assumed that link (i, j) exists if and only if j\u03b5S. Let each node i have the initial battery energy E, and let Qbe the rate at which information is generated at node i belonging to commodity c\u03b5C, where C is the set of all commodities. Assume that the transmission energy for node i to transmit an information unit to its neighboring node j is e, and the rate at which information of commodity c is transmitted from node i to node j is called the flow q. Further, let Qand qbe the aggregate flows of all commodities,

In the illustrated embodiments, dwas set to 250 m (based on known 802.11 cutoff characteristics) and Nborwas set to 10 (sufficiently high that after scaling the topology graph remained fully connected). The few segmented topologies generated using these parameters were discarded. Further, in constructing these results, all nodes were assumed to begin with the same amount of energy, the energy cost of transmitting between any pair of adjacent nodes is assumed to be the same (consistent with an 802.11 model), and all nodes have identical information generation rates, e.g., Q=Q, \u2200i\u03b5N\u2212D,\u2200c\u03b5C.","In a first comparison of default and optimized system lifetimes, a comparison is performed of the maximum system lifetime achievable for each topology with the nominal system lifetime obtained by solving the minimum system latency problem without considering system lifetime.

For this experiment, the number of nodes in the topology varied between 20 and 100 in increments of 10, using 10 random topologies at each increment. For each topology, the associated system lifetime produced by solving the system latency minimum problem was divided by the maximum achievable system lifetime for that topology obtained by solving the system lifetime maximization problem.  present solutions provided by two methods for solving Linear Programming problems, namely Simplex and Interior Point.

The curves in  show the average ratio over a set of ten trials for each number-of-nodes setting, with the maximum and minimum ratio values for the ten trials shown as error bars about the average.","With respect to , on average, the nominal solutions to the minimum system latency problem (produced by either the simplex or the interior point techniques) yield a system lifetime that is about half of that achievable using an explicit system lifetime maximization approach. A related observation is that the resulting system lifetime produced by solving the minimum system latency problem varies considerably based on the specific topology, ranging from a low of nearly 25% of the maximum possible lifetime to a high of nearly 90% of the maximum achievable lifetime. Further, in general the, interior point technique appears to perform slightly better, although not consistently better upon close examination of the individual data points.","A further experiment compared the maximum system lifetime achievable for each topology with the system lifetime obtained from solving the latency-constrained system lifetime maximization problem. The results shown in  for \u03b2=1 (e.g., the problem is constrained to produce the minimum system latency possible) demonstrate a marked improvement in average system lifetime, indicating an approximate 50% increase in system lifetime; however, the actual fraction of the maximum system lifetime achieved for a specific topology can vary greatly, ranging from a low of nearly 40% to a high of 100% (e.g., solutions are possible that simultaneously yield the maximum system lifetime and the minimum system latency). Additionally, it can be observed that the simplex method and the interior point method will produce the same system lifetime and system latency results for the latency-constrained maximum system lifetime problem, although the solution vectors will in general not be the same. The results for the two experiments are shown together on the same graph in .","Also performed was a comparison of the minimum system latency achievable for each topology with the nominal system latency obtained by solving the maximum system lifetime problem without considering system latency. This initial comparison provides a sense for the typical level of improvement that might be expected in system latency using latency minimization techniques over the latency produced by solving the maximum system lifetime problem with no latency constraints. In this comparison, the number of nodes in the topology varied from 20 to 100 in increments of 10, using 10 random topologies at each increment. For each topology, the associated system latency produced by solving the system lifetime maximization problem was divided by the minimum achievable system latency for that topology obtained by solving the system latency minimization problem. The results are shown in  for solutions obtained using a Simplex-based problem solver, and in  for solutions produced by an Interior Point-based problem solver.","A review of  indicates that the simplex solver provides better results in that the system latencies are considerably smaller and there is less variation in the actual results (e.g., the latencies resulting from solving the lifetime maximization problem using the simplex solver are less random). Because the interior point method can produce system latencies that are, on average, twice as much as the minimum achievable system latency, and in some cases more that three times as much,  are indicative of performing both lifetime and latency optimizations, since lifetime or latency optimization alone can produce degraded performance in the other measure. Accordingly, simply calculating routes that provide maximal system lifetime does not necessarily provide a good routing solution from a network latency perspective, and further, a solution which minimizes system latency under system lifetime constraints can provide significantly improved performance.","To emphasize this latter statement, a further experiment included comparing the minimum system latency achievable for each topology with the system latency obtained as a result of solving the lifetime-constrained system latency minimization problem.  illustrates the results for \u03b1=1 (e.g., the problem is constrained to produce the maximum system lifetime possible) and demonstrates that the addition of the secondary latency optimization allows a maximum lifetime routing configuration to realize system latencies that are only marginally greater than the minimum possible system latency as the average increase for these experiments was less than 3%. Unlike the lifetime evaluation experiments, however, the actual fraction of the minimum system latency achieved for a specific topology varies very little, ranging from a low of 0% (e.g., some topologies admitted routing configurations where the minimum latency and the maximum lifetime can be achieved simultaneously) to a high of less than 10%. For comparison, the results for the previous two experiments are shown together on the same graph in  to demonstrate the differences between the maximum lifetime solutions which ignore latency issues, and lifetime constrained minimum latency solutions.","Using the lifetime-constrained minimum latency formulation, an operating characteristic curve can be constructed for a given network topology by varying \u03b1 between 0 and 1. The resulting curve expresses the optimal trade between achievable system latency and system lifetime.","An example of this type of trade analysis for a 30 node topology (e.g., ) is shown in . It can be understood that the 30 node topology selected corresponds to the topology of the set of ten 30-node topologies that yielded performance values closest to the \u201caverage\u201d performance curves. In , system latency L is normalized by dividing by the minimum achievable latency L, such that a normalized system latency value of one represents a maximum system lifetime routing configuration, with suboptimal latency characteristics (from a system latency perspective) having normalized system latencies greater than one. Similarly, the system lifetime T is normalized by the maximum achievable system lifetime T, such that a normalized system lifetime value of one represents a maximum system lifetime routing configuration, with suboptimal configurations (from a system lifetime perspective) having normalized system lifetimes less than one. Normalized in this fashion, the normalized system lifetime is identically \u03b1.","For comparison purposes, also shown in  are the maximum lifetime and minimum latency points produced by both the simplex and interior point methods for this topology, and the lifetime constrained latency minimized point for \u03b1=1 (marked as TC Min Latency), and the latency constrained lifetime maximized point for \u03b2=1 (marked as LC Max Lifetime). These two latter points must lie along the optimal lifetime-latency characteristic curve, and represent the bounding points between which a solution must lie that attempts to optimize both parameters.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0093","num":"0110"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 10","FIG. 10","FIG. 11","FIG. 10","FIG. 11"]},"Although the differences in latency between the worst and the best set of routes for a maximum lifetime operating point (normalized lifetime of one) are only about 10% for the  network, the differences become more pronounced as the network increases in size. To illustrate this,  show operating curves for the example 50 and 100 node topologies, respectively, of . From , it can be recognized that the difference increased to 50% for the 50 node topology, and increases further to two and one-half times the minimal achievable latency for the 100 node topology.  provide magnified views of , respectively. Table 1 shows a portion of the routing table produced by solving the lifetime constrained minimum latency problem for the 100 node topology of , and it can be noted that there are not any multipath routes.","From , it can be observed that although multipath solutions are allowable and can emerge from the LP problem solvers, in general, such solutions are not produced. An example of this phenomenon is presented in Table 2, which shows the routing table produced by the lifetime-constrained minimum latency problem solution for the 100 node example of . This implies that the solutions are sensitive to the load assumptions, as can be seen from the following examples.","As a first example, consider a four node network with nodes labeled N (North), S (South), E (East), and W (West) as shown in . In the upper row, the assumed load is that of a unit of traffic from N to S. Here, all three configurations are \u201coptimal\u201d since node N must carry the maximum load of one, with the loads on both E and W necessarily being less than or equal to N's load level (note that all latencies are also equal). In the lower row, it is then revealed that node W must also send some smaller amount of load \u03b5 to N. Accordingly, the rightmost configuration allows the greatest variation in the actual value of \u03b5 before the system lifetime begins to degrade. Hence, configurations that balance load distributions across multiple pathways are more robust to differences between actual and assumed network loads.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0097","num":"0114"},"figref":["FIG. 18","FIG.

series of network simulations were conducted using the ns2 public domain network simulation package. This package provides detailed propagation and channel access models for several radio-based physical and link layer technologies, including the currently popular 802.11 series of wireless networking devices.","For these simulations, the  100-node topology was selected at least partially because of the distinct middle where there are no nodes, thus requiring the routing schemes to route accordingly.","For the first set of simulation experiments, 400 \u201cflows\u201d were randomly chosen including fixed length (e.g., 50 packet, \u02dc50 Kbyte) TCP-based transfers between randomly selected sender and receiver pairs. Although this number of flows may be small compared to the total number of possible flows (100 senders to 99 receivers, for 9900 possible flows), it is sufficient to compare the different routing strategies. The simulation was configured to use the nominal 802.11 parameters for cutoff distance (250 m) and base data rate (1 Mbps) for all nodes. In general, the typical throughput for a single, isolated flow across multiple hops was on the order of 160 Kbps (or roughly 20 kilobytes per second). The typical duration of an isolated transfer (without any intervening losses) was on the order of 2.5 seconds.","The start time of each flow in the sequence of flows was controlled by an \u201caverage inter-arrival time\u201d parameter, which provided coarse control over the simultaneous load.

The simplex-based maximum lifetime, lifetime-constrained minimum latency, and optimal PALMS approaches have similar maximum node loads of approximately 3000 for the simulation examples, all of which are better than the minimum latency routing approach which has over twice the load. The interior-point based solution to the maximum lifetime problem performs relatively poorly with respect to the node loading (even though it still outperforms the minimum latency approach); however closer inspection reveals that the elevated load is caused by the increased loss probability induced by the considerably longer average path lengths produced by the interior point solution, such that the elevated packet counts are actually due to retransmissions of lost packets.","Based on these results, the lifetime-constrained minimum latency solution and the optimal PALMS solution provide the comparatively best results, with essentially the same performance to within experimental error. Although the lifetime-constrained minimum latency solution appears to provide better maximum node loading, this is a side effect caused by channel contention between peers that arises in 802.11 systems causing an elevated number of dropped packets requiring retransmission (unipath routes give rise to less peer contention than do multipath routes). Since this is a well-known problem that the 802.11 community is working to address to improve peer-to-peer networking, the similarity of these results is encouraging. Both approaches produce node loadings that are less than half that produced by traditional minimum latency routing techniques, and both approaches produce latencies which are approximately half that produced by newer, energy-preserving maximum lifetime routing techniques.","For the second simulation experiment, two widely separated sender-receiver pairs were selected as the only providers of traffic within the example network.

The current version of the fast PALMS scheme derives from the core Dijkstra scheme.","With regard to Dijkstra, given a connected graph G=(N,L) with node set N and link set L, a set of weights d>0 for each link, and some fixed node s in N, find a shortest path from s to each node v in N. Dijkstra's scheme is an iterative procedure that at each stage selects a node from the set of remaining, as yet unselected nodes that have the smallest cost to reach core node s. With this overview in mind, the Dijkstra scheme proceeds as:","(1) Construct a \u201cselected\u201d node list S that will contain those nodes for which an optimal route to core node s has already been identified, along with its corresponding optimal downstream \u201cnexthop\u201d to reach the core and an associated cost to reach the core through that nexthop. Initially this list contains only the core node s, a nexthop that is itself, and its cost to reach the core (itself) through that nexthop which is zero.","(2) Next, construct an \u201cavailable\u201d node list A that will contain those nodes which have been selected and also have neighbors which have not yet been selected. Initially this list also contains only the core node s.","(3) For each node n in A, compute the cost for each of n's as-yet unselected neighbors to reach the core through n. The cost for some neighbor m to reach the core through n is identically n's cost to reach the core plus the cost dl of traversing the link l\u2032 connecting m and n. The node nand neighbor mpair with the lowest cost determines that neighbor node mis the next node to be selected.","(4) \u201cSelect\u201d node mby adding it to S, recording its nexthop to the core (i.e., node n), and its corresponding cost to reach the core through that nexthop (i.e., n's cost to reach the core plus the cost dl of traversing the link l.)","(5) Once neighbor node mhas been selected, if node nhas no more remaining unselected neighbors, it is removed from A. If node mitself has any neighbors which have not yet been selected, it is added to A.","(6) If A is now empty, the scheme is complete; otherwise, repeat, starting at (3).","The Dikstra scheme can thus be modified to create the approximate PALMS scheme as follows: Once a neighbor node mhas been identified in (3), construct a complete list of all of m's neighbors that (a) have already been selected and (b) which yield a cost to reach the core that is within (1+\u03b3) of the cost to reach the core through nfor some small \u03b3\u22670. This list constitutes a set of alternative nexthops that can be used to reach s from node m, that are guaranteed to be downstream from m, (e.g., since they have already been selected and hence will not produce routing loops). The remainder of the scheme remains unchanged.","Once that scheme terminates at (6), a suitable set of weights for distributing traffic across the alternative set of nexthops is identified. The weights for the downstream paths can be set so that they are equal and sum to 1.0, e.g., the weights are 1.0 divided by the total number of nexthops. The foregoing scheme is illustrated in .","While improved schemes can be further created for constructing weights with better load distribution properties in the presence of multiple competing flows, the presented scheme provides the best spreading when there is only a single flow while bounding system latency. It can be understood that setting \u03b3=0 can guarantee that the multipath solution achieves the minimum system latency possible.","Table 5 is the same as Table 3 with the addition of the approximate PALMS scheme (\u201cFast Palms\u201d, or \u201cFP\u201d). As Table 5 indicates, Fast PALMS has comparable throughput and latencies to the minimum latency, lifetime constrained minimum latency, and the Optimal PALMS approaches, and has a maximum node loading that, while not as good as lifetime constrained minimum latency and the Optimal PALMS approaches, is considerably better than the minimum latency solution and better than the interior point solution to the maximum lifetime problem.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0133","num":"0150"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00005","num":"00005"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"84pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"84pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"84pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},"TABLE 5"]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"5 s Inter-arrival times","2.5 s Inter-arrival times","1 s Inter-arrival times"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"10"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"9","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"10","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Avg","Avg","Max","Avg","Avg","Max","Avg","Avg","Max"]},{"entry":[{},"Goodput","Latency","Load","Goodput","Latency","Load","Goodput","Latency","Load"]},{"entry":["Approach","(kbps)","(ms)","(pkts)","(kbps)","(ms)","(pkts)","(kbps)","(ms)","(pkts)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"10","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"10"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"21pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"21pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"9","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"10","colwidth":"21pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["MTS","143","73","2804","103","74","3062","76","75","3317"]},{"entry":["MTI","42","99","4909","33","101","5356","24","101","5681"]},{"entry":["ML","163","64","6635","129","64","6986","95","65","7712"]},{"entry":["TCML","161","64","2608","125","65","2767","90","65","3061"]},{"entry":["OP","158","62","3172","130","63","3352","81","66","3810"]},{"entry":["FP","157","62","4367","116","61","4558","89","67","4935"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"10","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"What has thus been described are methods, systems, and processor program products for determining a set of costs of routes in a network, including providing a model of the network, optimizing the model based on maximum network lifetime, updating the model using a constraint based on the maximum network lifetime, optimizing the updated model for minimum network latency, modifying the updated model using a constraint based on the minimum network latency, and, optimizing the modified updated model by balancing the network across multiple pathways to provide costs of routes in the network.
