title: Systems, methods and computer program products for automating financial institution client positive pay return decisions
abstract: Systems, methods, and computer program products are provided for automatically processing positive pay return decisions. Positive pay return decisions are financial client decisions that authorize return of a pay item, such as a check, in the event that the client determines that the pay item warrants return, such as in the instance in which the check has been fraudulently altered or the like. Automated processing provides for deleting pay status from a service management system, creating a credit transaction to credit an appropriate demand deposit account and creating a return file that identifies the item and the reason for return.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["In general, embodiments herein disclosed relate to systems, methods, and computer program products for services provided to financial institution clients and, more specifically, automating the process related to client positive pay return decisions.","Financial institutions, such as banks and the like, offer account reconciliation services to various clients, such as small business clients, corporate clients, large commercial clients and the like. Account reconciliation benefits the client by having the financial institution reconcile accounts, or otherwise make certain that accounts are in balance. Thus, eliminating the need for the client to dedicate resources to accommodate this time-consuming task.","As part of the overall account reconciliation service or as a separate offering, many financial institutions also offer clients a fraud prevention service; commonly referred to by those skilled in the financial services area as a positive pay service. Most clients will issue paper-based checks in the course of their business. Positive pay service provides a means for identifying mismatches between what the client identifies as should be on the check and what actually shows up on the check during payment processing, and then allows the client to make a decision on whether to authorize payment on the check or to issue a return decision (i.e., payment denied).","According to many such positive pay services, a client will send the financial institution an issue file that lists all of the checks that are going to issue within an upcoming time frame, for example, the next day, week, month, etc. The issue file includes information found on the check, such as account number, serial number, amount or the like. Once the financial institution receives the check for payment, the financial institution matches up the information on the check versus the information provided in the issue file. As long as the information matches, the check is authorized for payment. However, in the event that the check does not match the information in the issue file, the client is given the opportunity to make a decision, referred to as a positive pay decision, as to whether to proceed with payment or whether to return the check as payment denied.","Typically, the financial institution implements a client access program to provide the client with the opportunity to make decisions on items that the financial institution has identified as potentially fraudulent (i.e., items in which the received check does not match the information in the client supplied issue file). The client must make a pay or return decision on all items identified by the financial institution within a specified time period in order for the financial institution to meet their right of return window. In most instances the right of return window is 24 hours in which the financial institution must return\/deny payment and, if a return is not made within the return window, payment occurs. As such, if the client does not disposition an identified item within the specified time period, a default decision is applied to the item. While the client is typically afforded the option of making their default decision a pay decision or a return decision, in most instances, to insure against improperly authorizing payment, the default decision will be a return decision.","In practice, the client's specified time\/deadline for making payment\/return decisions is typically within a few hours of the financial institution's right of return window. Thus, if the client fails to make decisions on numerous identified items within their allotted time, causing the identified items to be classified as a default decision, and the client's default decision is a return decision, the financial institution must process the return within a short period of time to insure that the right of return window is still open. This same scenario presents itself if the client positively identifies numerous identified items as return decision and the decisions are made at or near the clients' allotted time for making such decisions.","Currently, once return decisions are received from the client (or default decisions that are associated with returns) the processing that proceeds is entirely manual and, therefore, unduly labor intensive. First, a financial institution representative monitors the receipt of decision reports from the client and from these reports identify those items having a return decision status. In practice, once these items have been identified the financial institution representative is required to manually enter account number and serial number in a service management system and create a credit adjustment in the service management system, which a supervisor then reviews. In addition, the representative must pull an image of the check being denied payment, write a return check ticket and communicate with the returns department, which further processes the return. In many instances, the manual nature of the return process creates a time-crunch problem for the financial institution because all of these manual processes must be completed prior to the expiration of the right of return window. This problem is exasperated if the client's return decisions or default decisions occur proximate the right of return window.","It should also be noted that in many instances financial institutions are able to charge a premium for their positive pay service because they insure against payment of fraudulent actions. In this regard, the financial institution becomes liable for mismatched information that the financial institution failed to identify as potentially fraudulent, items identified as potentially fraudulent but not communicated to the client for a decision process, potentially fraudulent items identified by the client as a return decision that the bank does not return and\/or potentially fraudulent items identified by the client as a return decision that the bank does not meet the right of return window. Thus, if the financial institution is unable to process a client's request for return within the allotted right of return window, the financial institution may, based on service configuration, be liable for the payment amount. Additionally, the manual nature of the current process provides for many opportunities for human-error type defects due to incorrect entry of data and the like.","In addition, current methods are not readily conducive to providing an audit trail back to the external user\/client representative that authorized the return decision. This type of audit trial information is not only invaluable to the accounts reconciliation processing operations, but is also valuable to the client services functions to research client's inquires and the like. From the reconciliation processing aspect, the audit trail provides a means to substantiate the clients' positive pay actions when authorizing return or payment of a potentially fraudulent item.","Therefore, a need exists to develop systems, method, computer program products and the like for automating the processing of financial institution client positive pay return decisions. The desired systems, methods and computer program products should alleviate problems related to manually processing client decisions within a short period of time in order to meet the right of return window. In addition, the desired systems, methods and computer program products should eliminate problems related to manual observation of return decisions and entry of data related to return decisions or associated default decisions, which may lead to returns being overlooked or improperly processed so as to result in payment. In addition, to defect-reduction, the desired systems, methods and computer program products should provide for efficiency and cost-savings by reducing the manual involvement required to process the positive pay return decisions. Additionally, the desired systems, methods and computer program products should provide for an enhanced audit trail that traces the positive pay decision back to the external user\/client that made the return decision.","The following presents a simplified summary of one or more embodiments in order to provide a basic understanding of such embodiments. This summary is not an extensive overview of all contemplated embodiments, and is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of all embodiments nor delineate the scope of any or all embodiments. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of one or more embodiments in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.","Methods, devices, systems and computer program products are described herein that provide for automatically processing positive pay return decisions. Positive pay return decisions are financial client decisions that authorize return of a pay item, such as a check, in the event that the client determines that the pay item warrants return, such in the instance in which the check has been fraudulently altered or the like. Automated processing provides for deleting pay status from a service management system, creating a credit transaction to credit an appropriate demand deposit account, creating a return file that identifies the item and the reason for return and the like. By eliminating manual processing the financial institution lessens time constraints created by processing returns between the time allotted for client positive pay decisions and the right of return window for making such returns. In addition, the automated processing mitigates human-error defects that may lead to erroneously returning a valid pay item or failing to return a pay item that a client has designated for return.","A method for automated processing of positive pay return decisions defines a first embodiment of the invention. The method includes identifying one or more suspect, e.g., potentially fraudulent, pay items and providing the one or more suspect pay items to an associated financial institution client, i.e., the client that issued the pay items. The method further includes receiving decisions on the one or more suspect pay items from the client, such that one or more of the decisions is a return decision. Additionally, the method includes automatically processing the one or more return decisions including crediting the accounts associated with the one or more suspect pay items having the return decision.","According to specific embodiments of the method, automatically processing the return decisions further includes automatically deleting one or more pay items associated with the return decision from a database, such as a service management system database or the like, that indicates a paid status.","According to other specific embodiments of the method, automatically crediting the accounts associated with the pay items further includes automatically creating one or more credit transactions and automatically communicating the credit transactions to one or more demand deposit accounts associated with the one or more pay items having the return decision. In one further embodiment the credit transactions may be automatically communicated to the demand deposit accounts via a transaction exchange. The credit transactions may include an account number, a check serial number and an amount.","According to yet another specific embodiment of the method, automatically processing the return decisions may include automatically creating a return file that includes an identifier identifying the pay item being returned and a reason for the return and automatically communicating the return file to a return database.","In accordance with another specific embodiment of the method, identifying one or more suspect pay items further includes receiving a payment issue file from the financial institution client that includes information pertaining to a plurality of pending pay items and comparing the information in the payment issue file to information on received pay items to determine the one or more suspect pay items. In further embodiments of the method, providing one or more suspect pay items further comprises loading the one or more suspect pay items on a client access platform.","Yet another embodiment of the method includes failing to receive a decision on one or more of the suspect pay items within a predetermined allotted time limit, such that the failure to receive the decision automatically prompts a default decision. According to certain embodiments, the client has predefined the default decision as a return decision, such that the default decisions provide for the same automated processing, herein disclosed, that return decisions undergo.","An apparatus for automated processing of positive pay return decisions provides for another embodiment of the present invention. The apparatus includes a computing platform having at least one processor and a memory. The apparatus further includes a positive pay module stored in the memory, executable by the processor, and operable to reconcile client accounts. The positive pay module includes a suspect pay item identification sub-module operable to identify one or more suspect pay items and a suspect pay item client interface sub-module operable to present the one or more suspect pay items to an associated financial institution client. The positive pay module also includes a return decision processing sub-module operable to receive decisions, including return decisions, on the one or more suspect pay items from the client and automatically process the return decisions, including, automatically, crediting accounts associated with the one or more suspect pay items having the return decision.","According to specific embodiments of the apparatus, the return decision processing sub-module further includes a paid status deletion routine operable to automatically delete one or more pay items associated with the one or more return decisions from a database, such as a service management system database, that indicates a paid status for the pay item(s).","According to yet other specific embodiments of the apparatus, the return decision processing sub-module further includes a credit transaction routine operable to automatically create credit transactions and automatically initiate communication of the credit transactions to one or more demand deposit accounts associated with the suspect pay items having the return decision. In one such embodiment, automatically initiating communication of the credit transactions includes automatically initiating communication of the credit transactions via a transaction exchange to the one or more demand deposit accounts.","In still further specific embodiment of the apparatus, the return decision processing sub-module further includes a return file routine operable to automatically create a return file that includes an identifier identifying the pay item being returned and a reason for the return and automatically initiate communication of the return file to a return database.","In yet other embodiments of the apparatus, the suspect pay item identification sub-module is operable to receive a payment issue file from the financial institution client that includes information pertaining to a plurality of pending pay items and compare the information in the payment issue file to information on received pay items to determine the one or more suspect pay items. Additionally, the suspect pay item client interface sub-module may include a client access platform operable to provide for the loading of the one or more suspect pay items on the platform.","According to other embodiments of the apparatus, the positive pay module includes a default decision processing sub-module operable to provide a client-defined default decision to one or more of the suspect pay items not having a received client decision within a predetermined time limit, wherein the client-defined default decision may be one of a pay decision or a return decision. In such embodiments, in which the positive pay module includes a return decision processing sub-module, the return decision processing sub-module is operable to automatically process the default decisions defined by the client as a return decision.","A computer program product including a computer-readable medium defines yet another embodiment of the invention. The medium includes a first set of codes for causing a computer to identify one or more suspect pay items and a second set of codes for causing a computer to provide the one or more suspect pay items to an associated financial institution client. The medium additionally includes a third set of codes for causing a computer to receive decisions on the one or more suspect pay items from the client, such that one or more of the decisions is a return decision. Additionally, the medium includes a fourth set of codes for causing a computer to process, automatically, the one or more return decisions, including codes for causing the computer to credit one or more accounts associated with the one or more suspect pay items having the return decision.","In accordance with specific embodiments of the computer program product, the fourth set of codes is further operable to cause the computer to delete, automatically, one or more pay items associated with the one or more return decisions from a database, such as a service management system database, that indicates a paid status. In other specific embodiments, the fourth set of codes is further operable to cause the computer to create, automatically, one or more credit transactions and initiate, automatically, communication of the credit transactions, to one or more demand deposit accounts associated with the one or more pay items having the return decision. Additionally, according to other specific embodiments of the computer program product, the fourth set of codes is further operable to cause the computer to create, automatically, a return file that includes an identifier identifying the pay item being returned and a reason for the return and initiate communication of the return file to a return database.","Thus, methods, devices, systems and computer program products are described herein that provide for automatically processing positive pay return decisions. Positive pay return decisions are financial client decisions that authorize return (i.e., denial of payment) of a pay item, such as a check, in the event that the client determines that the pay item warrants return, such as in the instance in which the check has been fraudulently altered or the like. Automating the processing of positive pay return decision provides for, but is not limited to, deleting pay status from a service management system, creating a credit transaction to credit an appropriate demand deposit account, creating a return file that identifies the item and the reason for return and the like. By eliminating manual processing, the financial institution lessens time constraints created by manually processing returns between the time allotted for client positive pay decisions and the right of return window allotted for making such returns. In addition, the automated processing mitigates human-error defects that may lead to erroneously returning a valid pay item or failing to return a pay item that a client has designated for return.","To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, the one or more embodiments comprise the features hereinafter fully described and particularly pointed out in the claims. The following description and the annexed drawings set forth in detail certain illustrative features of the one or more embodiments. These features are indicative, however, of but a few of the various ways in which the principles of various embodiments may be employed, and this description is intended to include all such embodiments and their equivalents.","Embodiments of the present invention will now be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which some, but not all, embodiments of the invention are shown. Indeed, the invention may be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will satisfy applicable legal requirements. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of one or more embodiments. It may be evident; however, that such embodiment(s) may be practiced without these specific details. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.","Various embodiments or features will be presented in terms of systems or apparatus that may include a number of devices, components, modules, and the like. It is to be understood and appreciated that the various systems or apparatus may include additional devices, components, modules, etc. and\/or may not include all of the devices, components, modules etc. discussed in connection with the figures. A combination of these approaches may also be used.","The steps and\/or actions of a method or algorithm described in connection with the embodiments disclosed herein may be embodied directly in hardware, in a software module executed by a processor, or in a combination of the two. A software module may reside in RAM memory, flash memory, ROM memory, EPROM memory, EEPROM memory, registers, a hard disk, a removable disk, a CD-ROM, or any other form of storage medium known in the art. An exemplary storage medium may be coupled to the processor, such that the processor can read information from, and write information to, the storage medium. In the alternative, the storage medium may be integral to the processor. Further, in some embodiments, the processor and the storage medium may reside in an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC). In the alternative, the processor and the storage medium may reside as discrete components in a computing device. Additionally, in some embodiments, the events and\/or actions of a method or algorithm may reside as one or any combination or set of codes and\/or instructions on a machine-readable medium and\/or computer-readable medium, which may be incorporated into a computer program product.","In one or more embodiments, the functions described may be implemented in hardware, software, firmware, or any combination thereof. If implemented in software, the functions may be stored or transmitted as one or more instructions or code on a computer-readable medium. Computer-readable media includes both computer storage media and communication media including any medium that facilitates transfer of a computer program from one place to another. A storage medium may be any available media that can be accessed by a computer. By way of example, and not limitation, such computer-readable media can comprise RAM, ROM, EEPROM, CD-ROM or other optical disk storage, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium that can be used to carry or store desired program code in the form of instructions or data structures, and that can be accessed by a computer. Also, any connection may be termed a computer-readable medium. For example, if software is transmitted from a website, server, or other remote source using a coaxial cable, fiber optic cable, twisted pair, digital subscriber line (DSL), or wireless technologies such as infrared, radio, and microwave, then the coaxial cable, fiber optic cable, twisted pair, DSL, or wireless technologies such as infrared, radio, and microwave are included in the definition of medium. \u201cDisk\u201d and \u201cdisc\u201d, as used herein, include compact disc (CD), laser disc, optical disc, digital versatile disc (DVD), floppy disk and blu-ray disc where disks usually reproduce data magnetically, while discs usually reproduce data optically with lasers. Combinations of the above should also be included within the scope of computer-readable media.","Thus, methods, apparatus, systems and computer program products are described herein that provide for automating clients' positive pay return decisions. As previously noted, positive pay is an anti-fraud service offered by financial institutions, such as banks or the like, to protect clients and the financial institutions against altered checks and\/or counterfeit check fraud.","In practice, the client transmits a list of checks that will be issued in the near-term or checks that have recently issued, including account numbers, serial numbers, and amount. Subsequently, when the checks are presented to the financial institution for payment, the financial institution matches each check against the previously received client list. If the presented check numbers and amounts match those on the previously submitted list, the check is sent through for payment. In certain instances, if one or more of the items on the check do not match the items presented on the client list, the client is notified for the purpose of making a decision on the pay item\/check. The mismatch of information between the received check and the clients presented list means that the check is suspect or otherwise potentially fraudulent. The client may determine that the mismatch is erroneous, inconsequential or otherwise does not effect payment of the check, in which case the client will decision the pay item as \u201cpay\u201d. Since in most instances payment processing occurs in parallel with positive pay decision processing, no action is required if the client determines that payment is warranted. If the client determines that the mismatch is an error that warrants payment to be stopped, for example, a fraudulent action is deemed to have occurred, the client will decision the pay item\/check as \u201creturn\u201d.","It is also noted that since payment processing occurs in parallel with positive pay processing, the financial institution has a finite time in which they can affect payment stoppage of a pay item. This is referred to in the industry and herein as the \u201cright of return window\u201d. Once the window expires, the financial institution can no longer stop payment of the pay item. As such, the financial institution must create a deadline for the client's to decision the mismatched\/suspect pay items. If the client does not respond with a decision within their allotted time period, the decision is deemed to be a default decision. The financial institution provides for the client to define their default decision as being either pay or return, although in most instances, to insure against improper payments, the client will designate the default as return.","Since the clients' deadline for responding to positive pay decisions is typically proximate (e.g., within a few hours) to the right of return window, if processing of the return decision requires various different functions to be performed manually, persistent problems occur, such as inevitable human-errors, insuring that the returns are processed within allotted time and the like.","In accordance with present embodiments of the invention, automating the processing of positive pay return decisions eliminates the possibility of human errors occurring, such as failing to return\/stop payment on a pay item which the client decisions as such and\/or returning\/stopping payment on a pay item which does not require such or which the client has not authorized for return. Additionally, automated processing mitigates problems related to meeting time deadlines and, as such, provides for a less labor-intensive and more cost efficient process.","Referring to  a block diagram is depicted of a system  for automated positive pay return decisioning, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The system  includes apparatus  configured to provide for automated processing of positive pay return decisions. As previously noted apparatus  may include one or multiple devices. In multiple device embodiments, the devices may be in networked communication with one another. Apparatus  includes a computing platform  having at least one processor  and a memory .","Memory  of apparatus  includes an account reconciliation module  that provides for a financial institution to offer an account reconciliation service to clients, such as corporate\/business clients. The reconciliation service generally provides for the financial institution to insure that the clients' accounts are properly balanced. In addition, the account reconciliation service, may also provide for a positive pay service, whereby suspect (e.g., potentially fraudulent) pay items\/checks are brought to the attention of the client for the purpose of the client making a pay\/return decision on the suspect pay items. Thus, account reconciliation module  may include positive pay module . It should be noted that the positive pay service may be provided by the financial institution outside of the context of the account reconciliation service and, therefore, for the purposes of the invention, the account reconciliation module is deemed an optional element that is required in all embodiments of the invention.","The positive pay module  includes suspect pay item identification sub-module  operable to identify pay items, such as checks or the like that may be potentially fraudulent or for some other reason the payment on the item is suspect or otherwise deemed to be in question. According to one embodiment of the invention the suspect pay item identification sub-module  received client submitted listings of pending or issued pay items\/checks, including information pertaining to the pay items, such as account number, serial numbers and amounts and compares the listings to pay items received for payment to determine if a mismatch exists.","The positive pay module  additionally includes suspect pay client interface sub-module  operable to provide for presenting the suspect pay items to the client for decisioning and receiving the related client decision responses. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the suspect pay client interface sub-module  may implement a client access platform, such as financial institution-implemented client access platform or the like, as the platform for presenting the suspect pay items to the client , which accesses the platform via computing device , and for receiving client decisions\/responses to the identified suspect pay items.","In accordance with present embodiments of the invention, the positive pay module  additionally includes a return processing sub-module  operable to automatically process positive pay return decisions, and\/or default decisions associated with return decisions. Automatic processing includes crediting the account associated with the return pay item\/check. In accordance with specific embodiments, automatic processing of the return decision includes, but is not limited to, deleting the paid status of the pay item from a database, such as a service management system database implemented in conjunction with the accounts reconciliation system. In addition, according to further specific embodiments, automatic processing of the return decision includes automatically creating a return file that includes a pay item identifier and the reason for the return and initiating the communication of the return file to a returns department\/database.","According to other specific embodiments of the invention, the return processing sub-module  is operable automatically create credit transactions and initiate communication of the credit transactions, via a transaction exchange or the like, to one or more demand deposit accounts associated with the one or more suspect pay items. The credit transactions including an account number, a check serial number and an amount.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["102","102","104","110","112","104","108","108"]},"Further, computing platform  also includes processor , which may be an application-specific integrated circuit (\u201cASIC\u201d), or other chipset, processor, logic circuit, or other data processing device. Processor  or other processor such as ASIC may execute an application programming interface (\u201cAPI\u201d) layer  that interfaces with any resident programs, such as account reconciliation module , positive pay module  or the like, stored in the memory  of apparatus .","Processor  includes various processing subsystems  embodied in hardware, firmware, software, and combinations thereof, that enable the functionality of apparatus  and the operability of the apparatus on a network. For example, processing subsystems  allow for initiating and maintaining communications, and exchanging data, with other networked devices. It should be noted that any of the modules, sub-modules, and routines shown and described as being in memory  may alternatively be embodied in processing subsystems .","The memory  of apparatus  includes account reconciliation module  that provides for a financial institution to offer an account reconciliation service to clients, such as corporate\/business clients. The account reconciliation module  includes positive pay module . As previously noted, in certain embodiments of the invention, the positive pay service and, thus, positive pay module  may be provided for outside of the context of an account reconciliation service. In such embodiments, the account reconciliation module  is obviated . In addition, the account reconciliation service, may also provide for a positive pay service, whereby suspect (e.g., potentially fraudulent) pay items\/checks are brought to the attention of the client for the purpose of the client making a pay\/return decision on the suspect pay items.","The positive pay module  is operable to identify and provide to the associated client suspect pay items\/checks (i.e., potentially fraudulent pay items\/checks) and allow for the client to make pay or return decisions on the suspect items. If the client determines that the suspect item\/check should be returned (e.g., payment processing stopped), the present invention provides for automatically processing the return decision.","Thus, positive pay module  includes suspect pay item identification sub-module  operable to identify pay items, such as checks or the like, which may be potentially fraudulent or may, for some other reason, warrant return. According to one embodiment of the invention the suspect pay item identification sub-module  is operable to receive a client pay item list  that includes a listing of issued or soon-to-issue pay items\/checks, including the serial number, account number and amount. In turn, the financial institution receives pay items  and applies pay item match routine  to determine if pay items match and, if they do match, whether any of the information (e.g., account number, serial number, amount) listed in the client pay item list  mismatches the corresponding information on the received pay item\/check. If a mismatch is determined this pay item is deemed to be a suspect pay item that requires pay\/return decisioning by the client.","The positive pay module  additionally includes suspect pay client interface sub-module  operable to provide for presenting the suspect pay items to the client for decisioning and receiving the related client decision responses. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the suspect pay client interface sub-module  may implement a client access platform , such as financial institution-implemented client access platform or the like, as the platform for presenting the suspect pay items to the client and for receiving client decisions\/responses to the identified suspect pay items. It is also noted that the suspect pay client interface sub-module  may implement other electronic means to communicate the suspect pay items to the client and receive client decisions, such as email communication, wireless communication or the like.","In accordance with present embodiments of the invention, the positive pay module  additionally includes a return processing sub-module  operable to automatically process positive pay return decisions, and\/or default decisions associated with return decisions. Automatic processing includes crediting the account associated with the return pay item\/check.","In accordance with specific embodiments, return processing sub-module  includes paid status deletion routine  operable to delete the paid status of the pay item from a database. In on embodiment of the invention, the paid status deletion routine  is operable to automatically delete the paid status from a pay item\/check detail file  in a service management system database  that is implemented in conjunction with the accounts reconciliation system.","In addition, according to further specific embodiments, return processing sub-module  includes credit transaction routine  that is operable to automatically create credit transactions  and initiate communication of the credit transactions, via a transaction exchange  or the like, to the demand deposit accounts  associated with the suspect pay items identified as requiring return. Accordingly, the credit transaction may include the account number of the account to be credit and an amount.","Additionally, according to still further specific embodiments, return processing sub-module  includes return file routine  operable to automatically create a return file  that includes a pay item identifier and the reason for the return and initiating the communication of the return file to a return file database .","According to other specific embodiments of the invention, the positive pay module  includes a default decision processing sub-module  operable to automatically determine default decisions and the client's predetermined decision (i.e., either pay or return) corresponding to the default decision. In this regard, the default decision processing sub-module  applies a predetermined deadline to decision requests and if a client response\/decision is not received within the allotted predetermined time period, the suspect pay item is determined to be a default decision. The default decision processing sub-module  is further operable to access the client profile database , which includes client profiles  to determine the client's default status. Accordingly, the client profile may include account reconciliation configuration  and\/or positive pay configuration  that indicates the default decision . In instances in which the default decision is return, the default decision is processed automatically as described in relation to return decision processing sub-module .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","302"]},"At Event , the suspect pay items are presented to the associated client. According to one embodiment of the invention, a client access platform is implemented to provide the client access to the suspect pay items\/checks and to allow the client the ability to decision the pay items as either pay or return.","At Event , client decisions are received for the suspect pay items\/checks and at Decision , a determination is made as to whether any of the client decisions are return decisions. If one or more of the client decisions for the suspect items is determined to not be a return decision, in other words one or more of the client decisions is determined to be a pay decision, at Event , no further action is taken on the pay decisions. As previously noted payment processing typically occurs in parallel with positive pay processing, such that payment processing will proceed unless an indication is provided to stop payment processing.","If a determination is made that one or more of the client decisions are return decisions, at Event , automatic processing of the return decisions ensues. At Event , the paid status of the pay item is deleted from a corresponding Service Management System (SMS) pay item detail file (Data ). Deletion of the paid status prevents further payment processing from occurring.","At Event , a credit transaction is automatically created and communicated to a corresponding Demand Deposit Account (DDA) (Data ). In accordance with an embodiment, the communication of the credit transaction to the DDA (Data ) is conducted via Transaction eXchange (TrX) (Data ). In certain embodiments of the invention, the credit transaction may warrant a supervisory approval or the like, prior to processing the credit transaction.","At Event , a return item file (Data ) is created, which may include a pay item identifier and the reason for the return. The return item file (Data ) is subsequently communicated to a return database associated with a return service department.","Referring now to , a flow diagram is provided of a method  for automatically deleting the paid status of a return decisioned pay item, according to another embodiment of the invention. At Event , the service management system is interrogated to retrieve the pay item\/check detail file that matches the pay item in the return decision and, at Event , a Service Management System (SMS) routine is called-up to delete the item in the corresponding pay item\/check detail file.","In conjunction with the execution of the deletion of the item from the pay item\/check detail file, at Event , a temporary \u201cnot-on-file\u201d status is assigned to the deleted paid item. At Event , the visibility of the deleted paid item is maintained, with the \u201cnot-on-file\u201d status visible, for one reconciliation cycle. The reconciliation cycle may be any predetermine time period. At Decision , a determination is made as to whether the reconciliation cycle has expired. If the reconciliation cycle has not expired then, at Event , the visibility of the deleted paid item is maintained. If the reconciliation period has expired then, at Event , the deleted paid item is purged from the check detail file and visibility, in the form of the \u201cnot-on-file\u201d status, is no longer maintained in the file.","Turning the reader's attention to , a flow diagram is presented of a method  for automatically creating a credit transaction, in accordance with another embodiment of the invention. At Event , a return decision is identified. The return decision may be identified based on a client's decision returned to the financial institution or, in the event that a client's decision is not returned within the allotted time period for responding, the return decision may be identified based on a default decision.","At Event , based on the identification of the return decision, a credit adjustment record is automatically created in the adjustment file. The credit adjustment record includes the account to be credited and the amount. At Event , the return reason code is translated into a return reason description. The return reason code is typically provided for by the client via the client-access platform or, in the instance in which, the return decision is based off of a default decision, the return reason code may indicate default. At Event , the return reason descriptor is added to the credit adjustment record.","At Decision , a determination is made as to whether the approval date on the credit adjustment record is the current date. The approval date needs to be the current date in order for the credit transaction to be extracted for inclusion on the transaction exchange file. If the approval date is not the current date, at Event , the approval date is changed to the current date. If the approval date is the current date or once the approval date has been changed to the current date, at Event , the credit adjustment is communicated to the transaction exchange and, at Event , the credit adjustment is applied to the corresponding demand deposit account.","Referring to , a flow diagram is depicted of a method  for automatically processing return decisions as they are received from a customer access platform, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. At Event , Virtual Storage Access Method Auto Update (VSAMAU) files are updated with the current set of pay\/return decisions returned from the customer access platform. The VSAMAU file is created for each client response period, for example, if the client response period is a business day, a VSAMAU file is created each business day with one record for each positive pay item reported from the client via the client-access platform.","Once the VSAMAU is updated, at Event , the VSAMAU file is passed sequentially to remove any indicated return decision from the online Customer Information Control System (CICS), Service Management System (SMS) master file. In practice, a batch utility is implemented to start a CICS background task, the task opens the VSAM file, reads each new decision and attempts to apply the decision, if the decision is a return decision, to the service management system. At event , the result of each update to the service management system is recorded in the VSAM file as an online CICs adjustment record.","At Event , the VSAMAU file is again sequentially passed to determine decision activity and to report the current status of each exception. After all of the decision records have been processed, the CICS task closes the VSAM file.","At Event , a batch reporting program is implemented to create an intra-period\/intra-day report of all pay\/return decisions that have been applied and the exception status. The report may be in summary form and\/or in detail form.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0081","num":"0080"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 7"],"b":"700"},"At Event , \u201cvirtual\u201d exceptions are created as indicated by reverse positive pay decisions received from the client via the client access platform. At optional Event , the positive pay decisions and the reverse positive pay decisions are translated to a suitable format is the client access format warrants such translation.","At Event , the \u201cvirtual\u201d exceptions are added to the VSAMAU file and, at Event , Virtual Storage Access Method Auto Update (VSAMAU) files are updated with the current set (i.e., the final period\/daily set) of pay\/return decisions returned from the customer access platform.","At Event , the VSAMAU file is read and pay\/return decisions are created for un-decisioned items based on the clients predetermined default decision settings. In one embodiment of the invention, the default decision may be located in the account's profile record located in the Quality Management System (QMS) master file.","At Event , the VSAMAU file is passed sequentially to remove any indicated return decision from the online Customer Information Control System (CICS), Service Management System (SMS) master file. In practice, a batch utility is implemented to start a CICS background task, the task opens the VSAM file, reads each new decision and attempts to apply the decision, if the decision is a return decision, to the service management system. At event , the result of each update to the service management system is recorded in the VSAM file as an online CICs adjustment record.","At Event , the VSAMAU file is again sequentially passed to determine decision activity and to report the current status of each exception. After all of the decision records have been processed, the CICS task closes the VSAM file.","At Event , a batch reporting program is implemented to create an intra-period\/intra-day report of all pay\/return decisions that have been applied and the exception status. The report may be in summary form and\/or in detail form. At Event , a back-up VSAMAU file is created and, at Event , the contents of the VSAMAU file are deleted and a new file defined for the subsequent period\/day's run.","Finally, turning to , a flow diagram is depicted of a method  for automatically processing positive pay returns, according to an embodiment of the present invention. At Event , suspect, e.g., potentially fraudulent, pay items are identified, According to one embodiment of the invention, suspect pay items may be identified by receiving a payment issue file from the financial institution client that includes information pertaining to pending or recently issued pay items and comparing the information in the payment issue file to information on received pay items. If a mismatch exists between the information in the client-supplied list and the information on the received pay item\/check, the pay item is deemed to be suspect.","At Event , the suspect pay items are provided to an associated financial institution client, i.e., the client that issued the pay items. According to certain embodiments, the suspect pay items may be provided to the client via a client access platform or the like, which allows for the client to readily access the suspect pay items are provide decisions on the pay items.","At Event , decisions are received on the suspect pay items. Decisions on the suspect pay items may further include default decisions received on un-decisioned suspect pay items based on expiration of the clients' allotted time for responding to the decision process.","At Event , the return decisions are automatically processed, including crediting the accounts associated with the return decisions. According to specific embodiment of the invention, automatically processing may include deleting pay items associated with the return decision from a database, such as a service management system database or the like, that indicates a paid status. Further, automatically processing may include creating credit transactions and automatically communicating the credit transactions to one or more demand deposit accounts associated with the one or more pay items having the return decision. According to yet another specific embodiment of the invention, automatically processing the return decisions may include automatically creating a return file that includes an identifier identifying the pay item being returned and a reason for the return and automatically communicating the return file to a return database.","Thus, methods, devices, systems and computer program products described herein that provide for automatically processing positive pay return decisions. Positive pay return decisions are financial client decisions that authorize return (i.e., denial of payment) of a pay item, such as a check, in the event that the client determines that the pay item warrants return, such in the instance in which the check has been fraudulently altered or the like. Automating the processing of positive pay return decision provides for, but is not limited to, deleting pay status from a service management system, creating a credit transaction to credit an appropriate demand deposit account, creating a return file that identifies the item and the reason for return and the like. By eliminating manual processing, the financial institution lessens time constraints created by manually processing returns between the time allotted for client positive pay decisions and the right of return window allotted for making such returns. In addition, the automated processing mitigates human-error defects that may lead to erroneously returning a valid pay item or failing to return a pay item that a client has designated for return.","While the foregoing disclosure discusses illustrative embodiments, it should be noted that various changes and modifications could be made herein without departing from the scope of the described aspects and\/or embodiments as defined by the appended claims.
