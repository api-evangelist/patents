title: Damage tolerant microstructure for lamellar alloys
abstract: A damage tolerant microstructure for a lamellar alloy, such as a lamellar γTiAl alloy, is provided in accordance with the present invention. The alloy comprises a matrix and a plurality of grains or lamellar colonies, a portion of which exhibit a nonplanar morphology within said matrix. Each of the lamellar colonies contains a multitude of lamella with irregularly repeating order. The γTiAl platelets have a triangular (octahedral) unit cell and stack with γ twins. The αTiAl platelets are irregularly interspersed. The unit cell for αTiAl is hexagonal. Each of the layers has a curved, nonplanar structure for resisting crack formation and growth.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)"],"p":["The Government of the United States of America may have rights in the present invention pursuant to Contract No. F33615-94-C-2422 awarded by the Department of the Air Force.","The present invention relates to a damage tolerant microstructure for lamellar alloys and to a method of producing same.","The current microstructure of lamellar \u03b3TiAl alloys is composed of an equiaxed (prior \u03b2) grain structure with planar lamella as shown in FIG. . The grains or lamellar colonies themselves exhibit a lamellar stack of TiAl (\u03b3) and TiAl (\u03b1) platelets such as that shown schematically in FIG. . Interlaminar or intralaminar shear between the layers of the lamellar stack has been identified in fatigue and fracture tests as one of the principal mechanisms leading to monotonic and cyclic crack formation, such as that shown in , in gamma TiAl alloys possessing a lamellar microstructure. High and low cycle fatigue fractures and near threshold small crack growth test fractures show interlaminar shear at their failure origins below 1200 degrees Fahrenheit.","It is an object of the present invention to provide a damage tolerant microstructure for lamellar alloys such as lamellar TiAl alloys.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide a method for providing a damage tolerant microstructure for lamellar alloys such as lamellar \u03b3TiAl alloys.","The foregoing objects are attained by the present invention.","In accordance with the present invention, a damage tolerant microstructure for lamellar \u03b3TiAl alloys broadly comprises a matrix and a plurality of lamellar colonies within said microstructure having a nonplanar morphology.","In accordance with the present invention, a method for forming a damage tolerant microstructure for lamellar alloys broadly comprises the steps of casting the alloy and extruding the cast alloy at a temperature in the range of 1290 to 1315 degrees Centigrade at an extrusion ratio in the range of from 90:1 to 100:1.","Other details of the damage tolerant microstructure for lamellar alloys of the present invention, as well as other objects and advantages attendant thereto, are set forth in the following detailed description and the accompanying drawings wherein like reference numerals depict like elements.","Lamellar \u03b3TiAl alloys in accordance with the present invention have a microstructure exhibiting a plurality of grains referred to as lamellar colonies having a nonplanar morphology within the matrix. The alloys may also have planar grains within the matrix as well as the lamellar colonies having the nonplanar morphology. The lamellar colonies having a nonplanar morphology typically include many stacked layers, each with a curved or non-planar structure. In a \u03b3TiAl alloy, some of these layers consist of TiAl (\u03b3) and other layers consist of TiAl (\u03b1). Each of the lamellar colonies contains a multitude of lamella with irregularly repeating order. The \u03b3TiAl platelets have a triangular (octahedral) unit cell and stack with \u03b3 twins. The \u03b1TiAl platelets are irregularly interspersed. The unit cell for \u03b1TiAl is hexagonal. By forming layers with a curved or non-planar structure, the grains are better able to resist crack formation caused by interlaminar or intralaminar shear.","In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the lamellar colonies having a nonplanar morphology comprise at least 10% of the lamellar colonies within the matrix and are located along outer edges of the matrix. By having the lamellar colonies with the nonplanar morphology at the outer edges, the alloy becomes more resistant to fatigue damage. Further, in a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the lamellar colonies having the nonplanar morphology have a fine structure with average grain sizes being in the range of 0.8 to 1.09 microns. Fine grain structures are desirable because they are more resistant to the formation of deleterious cracks which lead to failure of the alloy.","Lamellar alloys, such as \u03b3 TiAl alloys, having the advantageous nonplanar morphology may be formed by vacuum arc melting the alloy constituents, casting the alloy into a bar or strip stock, and extruding the cast alloy at a temperature in the range of from 1290 degrees Centigrade to 1315 degrees Centigrade and at an extrusion ratio in the range of 90:1 to 100:1. Any suitable extrusion device known in the art may be used to perform the extrusion step.","Referring now to , a damage tolerant microstructure for a lamellar alloy in accordance with the present invention is shown. The alloy is a lamellar \u03b3TiAl alloy having a composition consisting of 46 wt % Al, 5-10 wt % Nb, 0.2 wt % boron, 0.2 wt % carbon, and the balance titanium and unavoidable impurities which has been extruded at a temperature of 1310 degrees Centigrade and an extrusion ratio of 100:1. The \u03b1 transus temperature of this alloy is 1310 degrees Centigrade.","As can be seen from the foregoing discussion, lamellar alloys having a microstructure in accordance with the present invention, particularly \u03b3 TiAl alloys, are advantageous in that they will exhibit improved fatigue resistance and a higher threshold for small crack fracture resistance.","It is apparent that there has been provided in accordance with the present invention a damage tolerant microstructure for lamellar alloys which fully satisfies the objects, means and advantages set forth hereinbefore. While the present invention has been described in the context of specific embodiments thereof, other alternatives, modifications, and variations will become apparent to those skilled in the art having read the foregoing description. Accordingly, it is intended to embrace those alternatives, modifications, and variations which fall within the broad scope of the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIGS. 4-6"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
