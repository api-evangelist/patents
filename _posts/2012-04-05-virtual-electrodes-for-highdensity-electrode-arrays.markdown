title: Virtual electrodes for high-density electrode arrays
abstract: The present embodiments are directed to implantable electrode arrays having virtual electrodes. The virtual electrodes may improve the resolution of the implantable electrode array without the burden of corresponding complexity of electronic circuitry and wiring. In a particular embodiment, a virtual electrode may include one or more passive elements to help steer current to a specific location between the active electrodes. For example, a passive element may be a metalized layer on a substrate that is adjacent to, but not directly connected to an active electrode. In certain embodiments, an active electrode may be directly coupled to a power source via a conductive connection. Beneficially, the passive elements may help to increase the overall resolution of the implantable array by providing additional stimulation points without requiring additional wiring or driver circuitry for the passive elements.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","GOVERNMENT INTEREST","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/516,818, filed Apr. 8, 2011 and entitled, \u201cVIRTUAL ELECTRODES,\u201d the entire contents of which are specifically incorporated herein by reference without disclaimer.","This invention was made with government support under DE-SC0004116 awarded by the Department of Energy. The government has certain rights in the invention.","This invention relates to bio-stimulation devices and more particularly relates to virtual electrodes for implantable bio-stimulation devices.","Electrical stimulator devices are used to stimulate various types of organic tissue. For example, electronics may be interfaced with the nervous system of a human body through use of neurostimulators. A neurostimulator is a device that may be implanted into human tissue, and provides stimulation to neurons through electrical pulses. For such reasons, neurostimulators may be referred to as implanted pulse generators (IPGs).","A typical neurostimulator includes one or more electrodes. Some neurostimulators include arrays of electrodes configured in implantable devices. For example,  illustrates a typical system  for neurostimulation. The system  includes an implantable electrode array  which may be implanted in organic tissue . For example, the implantable electrode array  may be implanted in a human brain or near optical or auditory nerves. The system  also includes a controller  coupled to the implantable electrode array . The electrode controller  is often located outside of the body. In certain systems, however, the electrode controller  may also be implantable.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["102","102","202","204","107","102","106","204","102","202","106","204","106","202","204","106","202"],"i":["a","d","a","d","a","d ","a","d "]},"In order to increase the stimulation resolution of an electrode array , additional electrodes  may be included in the electrode array . For example, in the case of a retinal prosthesis, the electrode array  may originally have included nine electrodes . In an effort to increase resolution, the electrode array  could eventually include sixty-four electrodes  and then two hundred electrodes  or more in later versions.","In prior stimulator systems, as the number of electrodes increases, for the same size device, each electrode has to be smaller. This causes the current density at the vicinity of the stimulating electrodes to grow accordingly, to a point in which further miniaturization may lead to current density magnitudes that can damage the tissue. Additionally an additional wire and an additional driver circuit are typically required for each electrode, and the wire needs to have a large enough section to allow the appropriate amount of current to flow. These wires make the implant bulkier, mechanically stiffer, and in general harder to conform to delicate anatomical features.","The present embodiments are directed to implantable electrode arrays having virtual electrodes. The virtual electrodes may improve the resolution of the implantable electrode array without the burden of corresponding additional wiring and complexity of electronic circuitry. In a particular embodiment, a virtual electrode may include one or more passive elements. For example, a passive element may be a metalized layer on a substrate that is adjacent to, but not directly connected to an active electrode. In certain embodiments, an active electrode may be directly coupled to a power source via a conductive connection. Beneficially, the passive elements may help to increase the overall resolution of the implantable array by providing additional stimulation points without requiring additional wiring or driver circuitry for the passive elements.","In the proposed scheme, the excitation waveform used in the electrodes has higher frequency components than what the body can react to. The neural cells being stimulated respond then to an averaged stimulus over time.","Embodiments of an apparatus for stimulating biological tissue are described. In one embodiment, the apparatus includes a first active electrode configured to receive a current from a current source and injecting it into organic tissue. The apparatus may also include a second active electrode configured to return current emitted by the first active electrode to ground. Additionally, the apparatus may include a region defining a virtual electrode disposed between the first active electrode and the second active electrode.","In further embodiments, a portion of the current emitted by the first active electrode is collected in the region defining the virtual electrode. Additionally, the time-average current density present in the region defining the virtual electrode is sufficient to stimulate biological tissue in proximate to the region defining the virtual electrode. The region defining the virtual electrode may include one or more passive elements. The passive elements may include a conductive layer disposed on a substrate in the region defining the virtual electrode. Additionally, an electrical insulation barrier may be disposed between the first and second active elements and the one or more passive elements. In one embodiment, the one or more passive elements are shaped in a pattern of a cross, a center point of the cross being disposed at a center point of the region defining the virtual electrode. In another embodiment, a majority portion of the region defining the virtual electrode comprises the one or more passive elements.","In such embodiments, the apparatus may include a plurality of active electrodes arranged in an array. Additionally, the apparatus may include a plurality of regions defining virtual electrodes, the virtual electrodes positioned between the plurality of active electrodes in the array. This is accomplished by means of tiling the same electrode pattern over a larger region.","Embodiments of systems for stimulating biological tissue are also presented. In one embodiment, the system includes an implantable bio-stimulator device. The implantable bio-stimulator device may have a first active electrode configured to inject current into tissue from a current source, a second active electrode configured to sink the current injected by the first active electrode, and a region defining a virtual electrode disposed between the first active electrode and the second active electrode. Additionally, the system may include a current source coupled to the implantable bio-stimulator device and configured to supply current to the first and second active electrodes in the implantable bio-stimulator array. In a further embodiment, the system includes an electrode controller coupled to the implantable bio-stimulator device, and configured to control operation of the implantable bio-stimulator device.","The system may also include one or more conductors coupling the first and second active electrodes to the electrode controller. The electrode controller may also include one or more driver circuits coupled to the first and second active electrodes, the driver circuit configured to supply current from the current source to the first and second active electrodes according to a timing sequence.","Methods of stimulating biological tissue are also presented. In one embodiment a method includes providing a stimulating current to a first active electrode in an implantable bio-stimulator device, and collecting return current from a second active electrode in the implantable bio-stimulator device. The first active electrode and the second active electrode may be arranged in an array configuration with one or more regions defining virtual electrodes disposed adjacent to the first active electrode and the second active electrode.","Additionally, the method may include providing the stimulating electrical charge in a pulse current pulse having finite pulse duration, the pulse duration sufficient to allow a portion of the electrical charge injected by the first electrode to accumulate in a region defining a virtual electrode. The region defining a virtual electrode may have one or more passive elements configured to steer the injected electrical charges to a predetermined position within the region defining the virtual electrode.","Additionally, the methods may include providing a plurality current waveforms to a plurality of active electrodes in an implantable array of bio-stimulator electrodes comprising both active electrodes and virtual electrodes, wherein the duration, timing, waveform, and firing sequences of the injected current is sufficient to generate a stimulation current in the virtual electrodes. A sequence of the waveforms may be applied to preselected active electrodes in the array of electrodes according to a predetermined pattern.","The foregoing has outlined rather broadly the features and technical advantages of the present invention in order that the detailed description of the invention that follows may be better understood. Additional features and advantages of the invention will be described hereinafter which form the subject of the claims of the invention.
