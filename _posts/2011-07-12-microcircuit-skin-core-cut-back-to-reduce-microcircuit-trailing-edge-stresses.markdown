title: Microcircuit skin core cut back to reduce microcircuit trailing edge stresses
abstract: A casting system for forming an airfoil portion of a turbine engine component is provided. The casting system includes a main body core for forming at least one internal cavity in the airfoil portion, a microcircuit skin core for forming a cooling microcircuit embedded in a wall of the airfoil portion, and a trailing edge core for forming a cooling passage in a trailing edge of the airfoil portion. The microcircuit skin core has at least one cut-back portion which is sized so as to provide said cooling microcircuit embedded in the wall with a length which allows heat-up of the trailing edge core from a gas path.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)"],"p":["The subject matter described herein was made with government support under Contract No. F33615-03-D-2354-0009 awarded by the Department of the Air Force. The government of the United States of America may have rights to the subject matter described herein.","The present disclosure relates to a core system for use in casting an airfoil portion of a turbine engine component.","High heat load applications for turbine engine components require intermediate wall cores (microcircuits) which are embedded between a main body core and an external surface of a turbine airfoil to provide cooling and shielding from coolant heat pick up. In providing such systems in the past, unwanted thermal stresses have been created.","In accordance with the instant disclosure, there is provided a casting system for forming an airfoil portion of a turbine engine component. The casting system broadly comprises a main body core for forming at least one internal cavity in said airfoil portion, a microcircuit skin core for forming a cooling microcircuit embedded in a wall of said airfoil portion, a trailing edge core for forming a passage in a trailing edge of said airfoil portion, and said microcircuit skin core having at least one cut-back portion which is sized so as to provide said cooling microcircuit embedded in said wall with a length which allows heat-up of the trailing edge core from a gas path.","It has been found by the inventors that full body microcircuits are needed to cool portions of highly heat loaded turbine components. In additional embodiments, the present disclosure shows how to locally remove the microcircuit skin core and\/or microcircuit trailing edge pedestals to reduce thermal gradients across the region of the part.","Further in accordance with the present disclosure, there is provided a turbine engine component having an airfoil portion. The airfoil portion has an internal cavity through which cooling air flows, a cooling microcircuit embedded in a wall, said cooling microcircuit receiving cooling air from said internal cavity, a trailing edge core having an inlet region, and said cooling microcircuit embedded in said wall having an exit end which terminates at said inlet region of said trailing edge core so as to expose said trailing edge cooling microcircuit to heat-up from a gas path following adjacent a surface of said wall.","Other details of the microcircuit skin core cut back to reduce microcircuit trailing edge stresses are set forth in the following detailed description and the accompanying drawings wherein like reference numerals depict like elements.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIGS. 1 and 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["8","10","22","12","14","8","16","15","12","18","10","19","12","20","22","20","18","16","23","18","25","16","30","20","31","22","20","16","18","20","24","26"]},"Microcircuit skin cores , such as that shown in , create the shielded region  of the trailing edge microcircuit . This is because in such designs, the microcircuit skin core  creates the double wall airfoil between the external skin surface  and the trailing edge microcircuit . Certain applications of such a microcircuit skin core  and a trailing edge microcircuit  can reveal high thermal gradients across the airfoil trailing edge shielded region  as a result of the double-wall airfoil construction in this region.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 4"],"b":["30","18","27","20","30","10","18","22","28","22","26","26"]},"As shown in , the cutback microcircuit skin core  exposes the trailing edge microcircuit  to heat-up from the gas path. As can be seen by the circled area  in , a trailing edge shielded region  is not present, which exposes trailing edge microcircuit  to the pressure side gas path.","The cut-back portion(s)  may be located anywhere along the span of the airfoil. When cutting back the microcircuit skin core , the cut-back portion  may have a gradual blend area , such as in the form of a curved or an arcuate section, which leads to the portion  of the skin core which forms the fluid exit of the microcircuit  formed by the skin core . The gradual blend area  is desirable to insure a smooth flow of fluid in the final microcircuit . As can be seen from , the portion  may overlap the portion of the trailing edge core  forming the inlet region of the trailing edge microcircuit  in a chordwise direction. At least one cut-back portion  of the skin core  may be found in the region where the platform of the turbine engine component would be formed.","As shown in , the cut back microcircuit skin core  maybe cut-back to expose the holes that form the pedestals within the trailing edge microcircuit . The skin core  is provided with a trailing edge  which does not extend beyond the trailing edge  of the main body core .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["18","40","25","16","44","20"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["18","50","18","40","18","25","16","26","18"]},"As shown in each of ,  and , the skin core  has a non-cut back region  which forms the exit for the cooling microcircuit . This non-cut back portion  extends beyond the trailing edge  of the main body core  and overlaps the inlet portion  of the trailing edge core .","As can be seen from , using the casting system of the present invention, one is able to form a cooling microcircuit  which is connected to an internal cavity  through which cooling air flows and which has an exit end  which terminates at the external skin surface .","Referring now to , the cooling microcircuit  has a length so that it only overlaps an inlet region  of the trailing edge microcircuit  and terminates in a chordwise manner at said inlet region. As a result, the trailing edge microcircuit  is exposed to heat-up from the gas path which flows along the surface  of the wall in which the cooling microcircuit  is embedded. The effect of this arrangement is that thermal stresses are decreased in the trailing edge region.","A test of a microcircuit without the cutback and a microcircuit with a cut-back as described hereinabove was conducted to determine the percent reduction in stress caused by the microcircuit design of the present disclosure. As shown in , a 42% reduction in stress was obtained.","As can be seen from the foregoing discussion, the microcircuit core system with the cut-back microcircuit skin core  described hereinabove reduces the thermal gradients between the microcircuit skin core  and the microcircuit trailing edge . Thermal gradients are reduced, thereby the thermal stresses are also reduced. As stresses are reduced, the fatigue capability is increased.","There has been described herein a microcircuit skin core cut back to reduce microcircuit trailing edge stresses. While the microcircuit skin core has been described in the context of specific embodiments thereof, other unforeseen alternatives, modifications, and variations may become apparent to those skilled in the art having read the foregoing description. Accordingly, it is intended to embrace those alternatives, modifications, and variations as fall within the broad scope of the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 8"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
