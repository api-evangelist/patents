title: High-priority communications session within a wireless communications system
abstract: An access network receives a request from an access terminal for communication session support resources associated with a communication session, determines whether sufficient communication session support resources are available for allocating to the access terminal and selects communication session support resources from another access terminal for de-allocation, the selected at least one communication session support resource associated with a communication session having a lower priority than the communication session. The access network sends instructions to the at least one other access terminal to facilitate de-allocation of the selected communication session support resource, and allocates communication session support resources to the access terminal for supporting the communication session after the selected communication session support resource is de-allocated from the other access terminal.

Field of the Invention","Embodiments of the invention relates to setting up a high-priority communications session within a wireless communications system.","2. Background","Wireless communication systems have developed through various generations, including a first-generation analog wireless phone service (1G), a second-generation (2G) digital wireless phone service (including interim 2.5G and 2.75G networks) and a third-generation (3G) high speed data\/Internet-capable wireless service. There are presently many different types of wireless communication systems in use, including Cellular and Personal Communications Service (PCS) systems. Examples of known cellular systems include the cellular Analog Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS), and digital cellular systems based on Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA), Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), the Global System for Mobile access (GSM) variation of TDMA, and newer hybrid digital communication systems using both TDMA and CDMA technologies.","The method for providing CDMA mobile communications was standardized in the United States by the Telecommunications Industry Association\/Electronic Industries Association in TIA\/EIA\/IS-95-A entitled \u201cMobile Station-Base Station Compatibility Standard for Dual-Mode Wideband Spread Spectrum Cellular System,\u201d referred to herein as IS-95. Combined AMPS & CDMA systems are described in TIA\/EIA Standard IS-98. Other communications systems are described in the IMT-2000\/UM, or International Mobile Telecommunications System 2000\/Universal Mobile Telecommunications System, standards covering what are referred to as wideband CDMA (WCDMA), CDMA2000 (such as CDMA2000 1xEV-DO standards, for example) or TD-SCDMA.","In wireless communication systems, mobile stations, handsets, or access terminals (AT) receive signals from fixed position base stations (also referred to as cell sites or cells) that support communication links or service within particular geographic regions adjacent to or surrounding the base stations. Base stations provide entry points to an access network (AN)\/radio access network (RAN), which is generally a packet data network using standard Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) based protocols that support methods for differentiating traffic based on Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. Therefore, the base stations generally interact with ATs through an over the air interface and with the AN through Internet Protocol (IP) network data packets.","In wireless telecommunication systems, Push-to-talk (PTT) capabilities are becoming popular with service sectors and consumers. PTT can support a \u201cdispatch\u201d voice service that operates over standard commercial wireless infrastructures, such as CDMA, FDMA, TDMA, GSM, etc. In a dispatch model, communication between endpoints (ATs) occurs within virtual groups, wherein the voice of one \u201ctalker\u201d is transmitted to one or more \u201clisteners.\u201d A single instance of this type of communication is commonly referred to as a dispatch call, or simply a PTT call. A PTT call is an instantiation of a group, which defines the characteristics of a call. A group in essence is defined by a member list and associated information, such as group name or group identification.","The group communication or PTT call is generally initiated from an originating access terminal that sends the initial request for the group communication. Conventional systems require multiple communications from the originator to establish communication links to the wireless network\/group communication infrastructure to enable the establishment of the group call. These multiple communications can lead to additional delay in establishing the group call and therefore a degradation in the overall user experience.","Embodiments are directed to setting up a high-priority communications session in a wireless communications network operating in accordance with a wireless communications protocol. An access network receives a request from an access terminal (e.g., a target access terminal, a session originator, etc.) for communication session support resources associated with a communication session. The access network determines whether sufficient communication session support resources are available for allocating to the access terminal for supporting the communication session. The access network selects at least one communication session support resource from at least one other access terminal for de-allocation, the selected at least one communication session support resource associated with a communication session having a lower priority than the communication session. The access network sends instructions to the at least one other access terminal to facilitate de-allocation of the selected at least one communication session support resource, and allocates one or more communication session support resources to the access terminal for supporting the communication session after the selected at least one communication session support resource is de-allocated from the at least one other access terminal.","Aspects of the invention are disclosed in the following description and related drawings directed to specific embodiments of the invention. Alternate embodiments may be devised without departing from the scope of the invention. Additionally, well-known elements of the invention will not be described in detail or will be omitted so as not to obscure the relevant details of the invention.","The word \u201cexemplary\u201d is used herein to mean \u201cserving as an example, instance, or illustration.\u201d Any embodiment described herein as \u201cexemplary\u201d is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments. Likewise, the term \u201cembodiments of the invention\u201d does not require that all embodiments of the invention include the discussed feature, advantage or mode of operation.","Further, many embodiments are described in terms of sequences of actions to be performed by, for example, elements of a computing device. It will be recognized that various actions described herein can be performed by specific circuits (e.g., application specific integrated circuits (ASICs)), by program instructions being executed by one or more processors, or by a combination of both. Additionally, these sequence of actions described herein can be considered to be embodied entirely within any form of computer readable storage medium having stored therein a corresponding set of computer instructions that upon execution would cause an associated processor to perform the functionality described herein. Thus, the various aspects of the invention may be embodied in a number of different forms, all of which have been contemplated to be within the scope of the claimed subject matter. In addition, for each of the embodiments described herein, the corresponding form of any such embodiments may be described herein as, for example, \u201clogic configured to\u201d perform the described action.","A High Data Rate (HDR) subscriber station (e.g. a 1xEV-DO enabled wireless device), referred to herein as an access terminal (AT), may be mobile or stationary, and may communicate with one or more HDR base stations, referred to herein as modem pool transceivers (MPTs) or base stations (BS). An access terminal transmits and receives data packets through one or more modem pool transceivers to an HDR base station controller, referred to as a modem pool controller (MPC), base station controller (BSC) and\/or mobile switching center (MSC). Modem pool transceivers and modem pool controllers are parts of a network called an access network. An access network (AN) (also referred to herein as a radio access network (RAN)) transports data packets between multiple access terminals.","The access network may be further connected to additional networks outside the access network, such as a corporate intranet or the Internet, and may transport data packets between each access terminal and such outside networks. An access terminal that has established an active traffic channel connection with one or more modem pool transceivers is called an active access terminal, and is said to be in a traffic state. An access terminal that is in the process of establishing an active traffic channel connection with one or more modem pool transceivers is said to be in a connection setup state. An access terminal may be any data device that communicates through a wireless channel or through a wired channel, for example using fiber optic or coaxial cables. An access terminal may further be any of a number of types of devices including but not limited to PC card, compact flash, external or internal modem, or wireless or wireline phone. The communication link through which the access terminal sends signals to the modem pool transceiver is called a reverse link or traffic channel. The communication link through which a modem pool transceiver sends signals to an access terminal is called a forward link or traffic channel. As used herein the term traffic channel can refer to either a forward or reverse traffic channel.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 1A","b":["100","100","102","104","120","102","126","102","108","110","112","102","108","110","112"]},"Referring back to , the components of the wireless network  and interrelation of the elements of the exemplary embodiments of the invention are not limited to the configuration illustrated. System  is merely exemplary and can include any system that allows remote access terminals, such as wireless client computing devices , , ,  to communicate over-the-air between and among each other and\/or between and among components connected via the air interface  and RAN , including, without limitation, carrier network , the Internet, and\/or other remote servers.","The RAN  controls messages (typically sent as data packets) sent to a base station controller\/packet control function (BSC\/PCF) . The BSC\/PCF  is responsible for signaling, establishing, and tearing down bearer channels (i.e., data channels) between a packet data service node  (\u201cPDSN\u201d) and the access terminals \/\/\/. If link layer encryption is enabled, the BSC\/PCF  also encrypts the content before forwarding it over the air interface . The function of the BSC\/PCF  is well-known in the art and will not be discussed further for the sake of brevity. The carrier network  may communicate with the BSC\/PCF  by a network, the Internet and\/or a public switched telephone network (PSTN). Alternatively, the BSC\/PCF  may connect directly to the Internet or external network. Typically, the network or Internet connection between the carrier network  and the BSC\/PCF  transfers data, and the PSTN transfers voice information. The BSC\/PCF  can be connected to multiple base stations (BS) or modem pool transceivers (MPT) . In a similar manner to the carrier network, the BSC\/PCF  is typically connected to the MPT\/BS  by a network, the Internet and\/or PSTN for data transfer and\/or voice information. The MPT\/BS  can broadcast data messages wirelessly to the access terminals, such as cellular telephone . The MPT\/BS , BSC\/PCF  and other components may form the RAN , as is known in the art. However, alternate configurations may also be used and the invention is not limited to the configuration illustrated. For example, in another embodiment the functionality of the BSC\/PCF  and one or more of the MPT\/BS  may be collapsed into a single \u201chybrid\u201d module having the functionality of both the BSC\/PCF  and the MPT\/BS .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 1B","FIG. 2","FIG. 1A","FIG. 1A","FIG. 1B"],"b":["126","126","160","165","170","175","170","160","175","170","102","108","110","112","120","160","160","160","120","122","10","10"]},"Referring to , the broadcast serving node (BSN)  may be configured to support multicast and broadcast services. The BSN  will be described in greater detail below. The BSN  communicates with the RAN  (e.g., the BSC\/PCF ) via a broadcast (BC) A connection, and with the application server  via the Internet . The BCA connection is used to transfer multicast and\/or broadcast messaging. Accordingly, the application server  sends unicast messaging to the PDSN  via the Internet , and sends multicast messaging to the BSN  via the Internet .","Generally, as will be described in greater detail below, the RAN  transmits communication messages, received from the BSN  via the BCA connection, over a broadcast channel (BCH) of the air interface  to one or more access terminals .","Referring to , the access terminal , (here a wireless device), such as a cellular telephone, has a platform  that can receive and execute software applications, data and\/or commands transmitted from the RAN  that may ultimately come from the carrier network , the Internet and\/or other remote servers and networks. The platform  can include a transceiver  operably coupled to an application specific integrated circuit (\u201cASIC\u201d ), or other processor, microprocessor, logic circuit, or other data processing device. The ASIC  or other processor executes the application programming interface (\u201cAPI\u201d)  layer that interfaces with any resident programs in the memory  of the wireless device. The memory  can be comprised of read-only or random-access memory (RAM and ROM), EEPROM, flash cards, or any memory common to computer platforms. The platform  also can include a local database  that can hold applications not actively used in memory . The local database  is typically a flash memory cell, but can be any secondary storage device as known in the art, such as magnetic media, EEPROM, optical media, tape, soft or hard disk, or the like. The internal platform  components can also be operably coupled to external devices such as antenna , display , push-to-talk button  and keypad  among other components, as is known in the art.","Accordingly, an embodiment of the invention can include an access terminal including the ability to perform the functions described herein. For example, the access terminal can include logic configured to bundle a connection request and a reservation for QoS resources into an access message and logic configured to transmit the access message to an access network. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the various logic elements can be embodied in discrete elements, software modules executed on a processor or any combination of software and hardware to achieve the functionality disclosed herein. For example, ASIC , memory , API  and local database  may all be used cooperatively to load, store and execute the various functions disclosed herein and thus the logic to perform these functions may be distributed over various elements. Alternatively, the functionality could be incorporated into one discrete component. Therefore, the features of the access terminal in  are to be considered merely illustrative and the invention is not limited to the illustrated features or arrangement.","The wireless communication between the access terminal  and the RAN  can be based on different technologies, such as code division multiple access (CDMA), time division multiple access (TDMA), frequency division multiple access (FDMA), the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), or other protocols that may be used in a wireless communications network or a data communications network. The data communication is typically between the client device , MPT\/BS , and BSC\/PCF . The BSC\/PCF  can be connected to multiple data networks such as the carrier network , PSTN, the Internet, a virtual private network, and the like, thus allowing the access terminal  access to a broader communication network. As discussed in the foregoing and known in the art, voice transmission and\/or data can be transmitted to the access terminals from the access network using a variety of networks and configurations. Accordingly, the illustrations provided herein are not intended to limit the embodiments of the invention and are merely to aid in the description of aspects of embodiments of the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 3A","b":["310","302","228","120","320","120"]},"Once the bundled message  is received at the access network , the access network can process the request . In , the access network can allocate a traffic channel (TCH) and the requested QoS resources for the requested reservations, assuming the traffic channel and QoS resources are available. Specifically, the access network  can acknowledge the access message (ACAck), , transmit a traffic channel assignment (TCA), , and transmit a reservation accept message (ReservationAccept), . These messages can be transmitted on a control channel (CC) to AT . A data rate control (DRC) message can be sent, , from the AT  to establish a data communication rate with the AN . After successfully receiving and decoding the DRC and pilot, the AN  can transmit a Reverse Traffic Channel Acknowledge (RTCAck) message, , on the forward traffic channel (F-TCH). Upon receipt of the RTCAck message, the AT  can send a Traffic Channel Complete (TCC) message, , on the reverse traffic channel (R-TCH). Dedicated channels are then established in both the forward and reverse directions and the AT  and the AN  can both communicate data bidirectionally. The various messages communicated between access terminal  and access network  are known in the art and are documented in 3GPP2 C.S0024-A Version 3.0, cdma2000 High Rate Packet Data Air Interface, dated Sep. 12, 2006, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Accordingly, a detailed explanation of the setup procedures and messages will not be provided herein.","If the DOS message or other application layer message is optionally bundled in the connection request access message, that information does not impact the traffic channel setup, discussed in the foregoing. Generally, the application specific data can be detected and merely passed on to the appropriate destination by AN . However, the application specific information may further reduce latency in delay sensitive applications by providing data needed (e.g., a PTT call request) for further processing by remote applications (e.g., a PTT server) to establish the data communication (e.g., a PTT call) once the traffic channels are setup between AT  and AN . Accordingly, the data included in the application layer message does not have to wait for the establishment of the traffic channels between the AT  and AN  before being forwarded to the network.","As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art the QoS resources needed may vary for different applications or within applications. The following examples describe QoS design under different QoS resource scenarios:\n\n","If some of the In-Call Signaling and Media reservations are already allocated to the originator AT at the time of arrival of a call setup packet, the AN\/RAN may only activate the In-Call Signaling and Media reservations that are not currently allocated.","As noted above, embodiments of the invention can reduce process delays in delay sensitive applications. A group communication\/Push-to-Talk (PTT) system is an example of a delay sensitive system that can take advantage of reduced connection times offered by the communication signal bundling disclosed herein. For example, embodiments of the invention provide for an AT to send a request to turn on the reservations for needed QoS resources (e.g., In-Call Signaling and Media reservations for a PTT call) by transmitting a ReservationOnRequest message in the same access capsule as its connection request (e.g., ConnectionRequest+RouteUpdate) message. Optionally, a DataoverSignaling (DOS) message can be bundled in the same access capsule. If the In-Call Signaling forward and reverse QoS reservations are allocated at the time of the PTT call, the AT can request the Media QoS reservations to be turned on. These requests can be made as part of the ReservationOnRequest message.","The group communication system may also be known as a push-to-talk (PTT) system, a net broadcast service (NBS), a dispatch system, or a point-to-multi-point communication system. Typically, a group of access terminal users can communicate with one another using an access terminal assigned to each group member. The term \u201cgroup member\u201d denotes a group of access terminal users authorized to communicate with each other. Although, group communication systems\/PTT systems may be considered to be among several members, the system is not limited to this configuration and can apply to communication between individual devices on a one to one basis.","The group may operate over an existing communication system, without requiring substantial changes to the existing infrastructure. Thus, a controller and users may operate in any system capable of transmitting and receiving packet information using Internet protocol (IP), such as a Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) system, a Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) system, a Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) system, satellite communication systems, combinations of land line and wireless systems, and the like.","Group members may communicate with each other using an assigned access terminal, such as access terminals (ATs) , , and . The ATs may be wireline or wireless devices such as terrestrial wireless telephones, wireline telephones having push-to-talk capability, satellite telephones equipped with push-to-talk functionality, laptop or desktop computers, paging devices, or any combination thereof. Furthermore, each AT may be able to send and receive information in either a secure mode, or a non-secure (clear) mode. It should be understood that reference to an AT is not intended to be limited to the illustrated or enumerated examples, and may encompass other devices that have the capability to transmit and receive packet information in accordance with the Internet Protocol (IP).","When a group member wishes to transmit information to other members of the group, the member may request the transmission privilege by pressing a push-to-talk button or key (e.g.,  in ) on an AT, which generates a request formatted for transmission over a distributed network. For example, the request may be transmitted over the air to one from AT  or more MPTs (or base stations) . A BSC\/PCF, which may include a well-known inter-working function (IWF), packet data serving node (PDSN), or packet control function (PCF), for processing data packets may exist between MPT\/BS  and the distributed network. However, the requests may also be transmitted through the public switched telephone network (PSTN) to a carrier network . The carrier network  may receive the request and provide it to the RAN .","Referring to , one or more group communication servers  can monitor traffic of the group communication system through its connection to a distributed network. Since the group communication server  can be connected to the distributed network through a variety of wired and wireless interfaces, geographic proximity to group participants is not necessary. Typically, a group communication server  controls communications between the wireless devices of set group members (ATs , , , ) in a PTT system. The wireless network illustrated is merely exemplary and can include any system whereby remote modules communicate over-the-air between and among each other and\/or between and among components of a wireless network including, without limitation, wireless network carriers and\/or servers. Further, a series of group communication servers  can be connected to a group communication server LAN .","The group communication server(s)  can be connected to a wireless service provider's packet data service node (PDSN) such as PDSN , shown here resident on a carrier network . Each PDSN  can interface with a base station controller  of a base station  through a packet control function (PCF) . The PCF  may be located in the base station . The carrier network  controls messages (generally in the form of data packets) sent to a MSC . The MSC  can be connected to one or more base stations . In a similar manner to the carrier network, the MSC  is typically connected to the BTS  by both the network and\/or Internet for data transfer and PSTN for voice information. The BTS  ultimately broadcasts and receives messages wirelessly to and from the wireless ATs, such as cellular telephones , , , , as is well known in the art. Accordingly, the general details of a group communication system will not be further discussed. Further, although the description herein discusses specific aspects of specific systems (e.g., PTT, QChat\u00ae, 1xEV-DO) to provide additional details and examples, embodiments of the invention are not limited to these specific illustrations.","As discussed above, the AT  requests a traffic channel in order to establish a communication (e.g., a PTT call). The PTT call can be originated by the originator AT  if both, traffic channel and QoS resources for In-Call Signaling and Media are available (additional details regarding the QoS resources are provided below and in ). In the conventional systems, the AT  would have to establish the traffic channel connection with the AN  and then request the QoS resources. However, to reduce this delay in accordance with embodiments of the invention, the signaling messages need to establish the PTT call are bundled in the initial access channel message along with the original connection request.","1xEV-DO Revision A is designed to provide efficient access to packet data networks and is widely based on the Internet for its network architecture. Data traffic traversing Internet Protocol (IP) network elements at the PDSN , PCF , and RAN  can be based on standard Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)-based protocols that support methods for differentiating traffic based on QoS requirements. QoS between the AT  and the 1xEV-DO Revision A network is configured as described in the 3GPP2 X.S0011-004-C Version 2.0 cdma2000 Wireless IP Network Standard: Quality of Service and Header Reduction specification, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. Data traffic transmitted over the air interface between the AT  and the RAN  can be configured for appropriate QoS treatment via 1xEV-DO Revision A protocols as described in the 3GPP2 C.S0024-A Version 3.0 document referenced above. 1xEV-DO Revision A provides standard mechanisms to offer intra-AT and inter-AT QoS. Intra-AT QoS provides differentiation of data streams belonging to the same user, while inter-AT QoS provides differentiation of packets belonging to different users.","To achieve QoS, traffic differentiation should be available end-to-end. All network components including the AT , RAN  (BTS , BSC ), PDSN , and Internet routers should implement\/support QoS. End-to-end QoS in 1xEV-DO Revision A networks can be achieved through the following mechanisms:\n\n","QoS in a 1xEV-DO Revision A network is also based on the proper mapping or binding of the following elements for the AT's PPP session, such as follows:\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0065"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","302","120"]},"Although the foregoing description provides many details specific to a PTT\/QChat\u00ae system and the 1x EV-DO network to provide a detailed illustration of various aspects of embodiments of the invention, those skilled in the art will appreciate that embodiments of the invention are not limited to any specific application and\/or network. Embodiments of the invention can include any application that has QoS requirements. Further, any network that can support the allocation of QoS resources bundled with the initial connection setup request can also be included in embodiments of the invention.","Referring to , a flowchart illustrating the bundling process according to embodiments of the invention is provided. For example, the method can include an application identifying a communication to be requested that requires QoS resources (e.g., a PTT call), in block . Additional messages can be considered for bundling (e.g., DOS message) , if the additional message is used and there is room in the access probe. A request for a bundled access message (e.g., access probe) can then be communicated from the application layer, in block , to lower layers for bundling of the requested messages in the access probe. As used herein the application layer can include the requesting application (e.g., a PTT client) and a bundling API that facilitates interface between the application layer and the lower layers (e.g., RLC, MAC, and Physical Layers). However, it will be appreciated that embodiments of the invention are not limited to this configuration. For example, the application itself could contain the functionality of the bundling API.","In block , after the receipt of the bundled request, the QoS request can be added to the access probe. Likewise, in block , the DOS message can be added to the access probe if requested and there is sufficient space in the access probe. Additionally, in block , the connection request and route update messages are added to the access probe. A check can be performed to determine whether the bundled message is complete, in block . If not, the process can loop back to check for the missing messages, as they may be delayed. A delay element (e.g., timer) can also be set at the application layer, in block , to allow for the bundling of the access probe. The process can loop via block  until the application layer receives an indication from the lower layers that the message bundling is complete  (or until the event is timed out and the access probe is sent). After receiving the confirmation, the access probe delay can be released, , and the access probe can be transmitted .","As discussed in the foregoing, the trigger (e.g., ) can be any event that causes an application to initiate a connection request with QoS requirements, which are known to the application. The trigger may be activated manually via hard key or soft key activation, may be activated in response to a received signal (e.g., voice command, signal from the network, etc.) or may be activated in response to condition detected by the application.","For example, as illustrated in , an access terminal (AT) , may receive a trigger, such as an announce message or call setup message, , in a PTT system. Specifically, a call setup message, , can be transmitted via PDSN  and AN . Access network  can forward the call setup message over a control channel, , to the target AT . Upon receipt and decoding of the call setup packet, AT  can determine that the requested communication (e.g., a PTT call) uses QoS resources. Accordingly, the call setup message received from the network can serve as a trigger to initiate the bundling of the subsequent response.","For example, AT  can respond with a bundled request, , including a connection request (e.g., ConnectionRequest,+RouteUpdate), a QoS reservation (e.g., ReservationOnRequest) and optionally an application layer message (e.g., DOS) on an access channel. Including the DOS allows for application data to be sent to a destination prior to establishing a traffic channel. Requesting the QoS resources allows for the allocation of the need QoS resources prior to establishing the traffic channel. Accordingly, the responsiveness of the communication system may be improved. Upon receipt of the connection request a traffic channel and requested resources can be allocated, , at access network (AN) . The traffic channel assignment (TCA), QoS resources acceptance, and acknowledgement of the access channel message can be transmitted, , to AT . The traffic channel setup can continue in ,  and , until both the AN  and AT  are prepared to send and receive data as discussed in the foregoing and known in the art. Accordingly, a detailed explanation will not be provided.","Embodiments of the invention described above with respect to  are generally directed to implementations where each call has the same priority as other calls, or alternatively where the illustrated call flow is for a low-priority call. In other words, protocols for handling how to re-distribute system resources such that higher-priority calls can be accepted even where system resources cannot support those calls based on a current load or resource allocation (e.g., too many traffic channels have been assigned, etc.) have not yet been discussed. As used herein, a \u201cresource\u201d or system resource corresponds to any type of call support parameter that is allocated by the RAN  for supporting calls (e.g., a TCH, a QoS, a given amount of bandwidth, etc.). Rather, referring to  for example, if system resources (e.g., a TCH) is unavailable, the call is denied\/rejected. Accordingly, embodiments that are directed to system resource re-distribution to accommodate higher-priority calls and\/or a transport channel (e.g., by adding a SYN message for TCP, or INIT message when using SCTP) will now be described.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0073"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},"Referring to , in A, the initiator (\u201cAT \u201d) sends, to the RAN , a message requesting to initiate a high-priority call to one or more ATs. The RAN  receives the call request and forwards the call request to the application server . In A, the RAN  analyzes the received call request and interprets the request as a high-priority call. For example, the RAN  can check a flag contained in the call request that indicates whether the call request corresponds to a high-priority call, or alternatively the RAN can automatically associate high-priority status with certain access terminals (e.g., a security officer's phone, etc.).","In A, the RAN  determines whether sufficient system resources are available for handling the requested call in AT l's sector. For example, the RAN  can check its current load based on the resources consumed by ATs  . . . N which are also within AT 's sector in this example. For this embodiment, assume that sufficient resources are determined to be available in A.

Also, while the examples below are directed to a two-priority level implementation, referred to as \u201chigh\u201d priority and \u201clow\u201d priority, in other embodiments of the invention more than two priorities can be implemented, as will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art. In this case, \u201chigh\u201d priority and \u201clow\u201d priority are relative such that high priority is above low priority, but is not necessarily a highest available priority, just as low priority is not necessarily a lowest available priority.

For example, the RAN  can check its current load (e.g., a number of allocated TCHs and\/or QoS resources) based on the resources consumed by ATs  . . . N which are also within AT 's sector in this example. For this embodiment, assume that sufficient resources are determined not to be available in A.","In A, instead of rejecting or denying the call request (e.g., as in ) due to the lack of resources to handle the high-priority group call for AT , the RAN  selects one or more resources from lower-priority calls for de-allocation (e.g., assuming that all other resources are not allocated for high priority calls). For example, the RAN  may select a given amount of resources (e.g., TCHs and\/or QoSs) from randomly selected ATs among ATs  . . . N that are engaged in lower-priority calls for de-allocation (e.g., cancellation or reduction), such that a threshold amount of resources for AT 's high priority group call is made available. As used herein, the de-allocation selection may correspond to a complete de-allocation (e.g., to remove all previously assigned QoS resources, traffic channels, etc.) or a partial de-allocation (e.g., to remove less than all previously assigned QoS resources such that the AT for which de-allocation is selected has a lower QoS guarantee, fewer traffic channels, etc.) . . . Next, in A, the RAN  sends instructions to the randomly selected ATs among ATs  . . . N to de-allocate (e.g., reduce or cancel) previously allocated resources (e.g., a TCH only, a TCH and QoS, etc.). After the de-allocation of A, the RAN  allocates, at least partially, the de-allocated and newly available resources for the high-priority group call to AT , A. In A, a tone or alert message is played at AT  in response to the resource allocation, indicating that AT  can begin speaking (e.g., after one or more target ATs accept the call, not shown in ).","Above,  has been described at a relatively high level that is applicable across many different wireless communication protocols. Below,  illustrate example implementations of the process of  within 1xEV-DO Rev. A and 1xEV-DO Rev. B, respectively.","Accordingly, referring to , assume that ATs  . . . N, which are not targets of the group call and are located in the same sector as AT , are allocated TCH and\/or QoS resources associated with low-priority calls, B. In B, AT  is in an idle state, and AT  exits the idle state and determines to request or initiate a high-priority call (e.g., an emergency call), B. For example, the determination of B can be in response to a user of AT  pushing a PTT button for calling a high-priority PTT group.","Accordingly, in B, AT  configures a ConnectionRequest message with a flag for indicating a high-priority call (e.g., alternatively referred to as \u2018Emergency\u2019, although the call itself need not be a 911-type Emergency call), and transmits the configured ConnectionRequest message (e.g., ConnectionRequest,+RouteUpdate), a QoS reservation (e.g., ReservationOnRequest) and optionally an application layer message (e.g., DOS) on a reverse link access channel (e.g., similar to  of ). However, unlike  of , the ConnectionRequest is configured to convey the high-priority status of the requested call. For example, one or more unused field settings in the ConnectionRequest message can be used to convey high-priority status, such as the 4-bit RequestReason field which conventionally conveys only two settings; namely, whether the call request is AT or RAN initiated. In an example, the RequestReason field in the ConnectionRequest message can be set to indicate either high or low priority, or alternatively a specific priority level (e.g., level 0, level 1, level 2, etc.). Again, because the 4-bit RequestReason field is conventionally used only to convey two (2) settings (i.e., AT or RAN initiated),  (i.e., 2\u22122) different priority levels can potentially be indicated by the remaining unused bits. In an alternative example, the 4-bit Reserved field in the ConnectionRequest message can be used to convey the priority level (e.g., in place of or in addition to the RequestReason field).","In another alternative example, the call request signaling message (i.e., DOS (QSP CALL)) may have a given special Diffserv Code Point (DSCP) in a header portion configured to convey high priority status to the RAN  and\/or the application server . For example, DSCPs can be used for Mobile-Originated calls if the RAN performs the framing\/deframing of application layer packets. This is because the framing protocol, when using DOS over EMFPA in EV-DO systems, the IP header is a fixed offset in bytes from the end of the DOS message. Therefore, the RAN can peek into the IP header directly, even though it is technically at the application layer. As will be appreciated, in this manner, DSCP values can potentially be used to convey information both to the RAN  and the application server .","Alternatively, instead of using fields already defined by the standard (e.g., in this case, 1xEV-DO Rev. A), AT  and RAN  can each agree to use a proprietary QoS ProfileID to indicate the priority status of the call. Thus, in this example, when AT  requests the high-priority call in B, the RAN  determines that the call is a high-priority call based on a ReservationLabel associated with the QoS ProfileID that indicates high-priority status. However, it will be appreciated that this alternative embodiment may require the client device, or AT , to manage its configuration of resources with the RAN  and activate them during the onset of a group call. As will be appreciated, B and B of  may correspond to A of .","After receiving the bundled ConnectionRequest message on the access channel, the RAN  sends AT  an acknowledgment to the access message (ACAck), B, and forwards the application layer message (e.g., DOS) to the application server , B.","In B, the RAN  analyzes the received ConnectionRequest message and determines that the call request is for a high-priority call. For example, the RAN  can extract a flag contained in a RequestReason field, a DSCP value of a DOS (QSP CALL) signaling message, a Reserved field and\/or within a ReservationLabel associated with a QoS ProfileID to determine the high priority status (e.g., again, if more than two priority levels are established, the \u2018high\u2019 priority level can be any priority level above the lowest level of priority.

Further, as will be appreciated, in an example, the RAN  can select only a TCH for de-allocation, or can select both a TCH and a QoS resource for de-allocation.

Then, after receiving an indication that the call has been accepted by at least one other AT from the application server , the RAN  transmits a QSP: STATUS(success) message to AT  over the F-TCH, B.

B, the ConnectionRequest message and ReservationOnRequest message each contain an EmergencyIndicator bit that can be set to a given logic level (e.g., a higher logic level or \u201c1\u201d) to indicate high-priority status.","While a single bit in the ConnectionRequest only allows for one priority level, which may in fact be used by E-911 services when VoIP is part of the handset, the 1-bit field in the ReservationOnRequest message may provide a greater degree of flexibility in indicating call priority to the RAN . In this example, the Emergencyindicator bit can be set to a first logic level (e.g., a lower logic level or \u201c0\u201d) for low-priority calls and a second logic level (e.g., a higher logic level or \u201c1\u201d) for priority calls.

Accordingly, embodiments will now be described where target ATs for a high-priority group call are allocated sufficient resources for the call irrespective of whether those resources are initially available.","Referring to , AT  corresponds to a target AT (e.g., unlike , A, B or C, where AT  corresponded to the call initiator) for a group call (e.g., which may be initiated as in  (e.g., via a flag contained in a signaling message to the application server , such as the call request message in A, or via a DSCP value of the call request packet), A. Next, the application server  configures a call set-up message for the call that indicates its associated high-priority status, A, and forwards the configured call set-up message to the RAN , A. The RAN  receives the configured call set-up message, and transmits a message (e.g., an announce message, a page for target AT , etc.) at least to target AT  within target AT 's sector, A, and receives a request for resources to participate in the call from the target AT  in response to the call set-up message, A. At this point, assume the RAN  is aware that the request for resources received at A is associated with a high-priority call. As will be described below in greater detail, the RAN  may become aware of the high-priority status based on a flag contained either within the configured call set-up message from the application server  in A, or a flag within the request for resources from the target AT  in A.","Next, the RAN  determines whether sufficient resources are available for allocation to the target AT , A.

After receiving the page in B, target AT  becomes aware that the RAN  is attempting to send a message to target AT , and target AT  responds to the page with a request for resources (e.g., RUP+ConnectionRequest) on a reverse link access channel, B. It is worth noting that the request for resources transmitted in B need not include a high-priority flag (e.g., a RequestReason and\/or Reserved field within the ConnectionRequest message) because at least within this example, the flag (e.g., special DSCP value) of the announce message is sufficient to convey the high-priority status to the RAN . However, it is still possible target AT  can indicate the high-priority status I the resource request message of B.","In B, the RAN  checks to see whether sufficient resources are available for allocating to target AT  for the call. As noted above, if sufficient resources are available, the resources are simply allocated.

Sending announce messages over the control channel within a DOS message is described in more detail within U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/974,833, entitled \u201cMULTICAST MESSAGING WITHIN A WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM\u201d, filed on Sep. 24, 2007, assigned to the assignee of the subject application and hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety, and also within U.S. Non-Provisional application No. Ser.

In an example, the RAN  is not necessarily aware that the announce message is for a high-priority call, but does know to transmit the announce message on the downlink CCH as a DOS message, which is a quicker way to transmit announce messages that consumes more resources on the downlink CCH. In an alternative example, the RAN  can be configured to assume that any announce message transmitted on the downlink CCH in a DOS message is for a high-priority call.","After a CCH scheduling delay, C, the RAN  sends the announce message within a DOS message on the downlink CCH at least to target AT , C. In an example, the RAN  can expedite the DOS message transmission of C by placing the DOS message ahead of other queued CCH messages for low-priority calls. After receiving the DOS message in C, target AT  determines to accept the announce call in C also determines, because the announce message is transmitted as a DOS message on the downlink CCH, that the call is a high-priority call. Accordingly, target AT  transmits a request for resources and announce ACK indicating the high-priority status of the call (e.g., RUP+ConnectionRequest(High-Priority)+ReservationOnRequest+DOS(ANNOUNCE-ACK)) on a reverse link access channel, C.

In yet another example, the high-priority status need not be conveyed to the RAN  at all in the message of C if the RAN  is configured to interpret any DOS announce message as having a high-priority. In any case it may be assumed that after the RAN  receives the message of C, the RAN  is aware of the high-priority call status. After receiving the announce ACK, the RAN  forwards the announce acknowledgment to the application server , which can then begin transmitting group messages to target AT  from the call initiator, C.","In C, the RAN  checks to see whether sufficient resources are available for allocating to target AT  for the call.

A storage media may be any available media that can be accessed by a computer. By way of example, and not limitation, such computer-readable media can comprise RAM, ROM, EEPROM, CD-ROM or other optical disk storage, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium that can be used to carry or store desired program code in the form of instructions or data structures and that can be accessed by a computer. Also, any connection is properly termed a computer-readable medium. For example, if the software is transmitted from a website, server, or other remote source using a coaxial cable, fiber optic cable, twisted pair, digital subscriber line (DSL), or wireless technologies such as infrared, radio, and microwave, then the coaxial cable, fiber optic cable, twisted pair, DSL, or wireless technologies such as infrared, radio, and microwave are included in the definition of medium. Disk and disc, as used herein, includes compact disc (CD), laser disc, optical disc, digital versatile disc (DVD), floppy disk and blu-ray disc where disks usually reproduce data magnetically, while discs reproduce data optically with lasers. Combinations of the above should also be included within the scope of computer-readable media.","Accordingly, an embodiment of the invention can include a computer-readable medium including code stored thereon for bundling communication messages in a wireless network comprising: code for causing a computer to bundle a connection request and a reservation for QoS resources into an access message, and code for causing a computer to transmit the access message to an access network. Further, any of the functions describe herein can be included in as additional code in further embodiments of the invention.","While the foregoing disclosure shows illustrative embodiments of the invention, it should be noted that various changes and modifications could be made herein without departing from the scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. The functions, steps and\/or actions of the method claims in accordance with the embodiments of the invention described herein need not be performed in any particular order. Furthermore, although elements of the invention may be described or claimed in the singular, the plural is contemplated unless limitation to the singular is explicitly stated."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["A more complete appreciation of embodiments of the invention and many of the attendant advantages thereof will be readily obtained as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in connection with the accompanying drawings which are presented solely for illustration and not limitation of the invention, and in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 1B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIGS. 3A-3C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 9A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 9B","FIG. 9A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 9C","FIG. 9A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 10A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 10B","FIG. 10A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 10C","FIG. 10A"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
