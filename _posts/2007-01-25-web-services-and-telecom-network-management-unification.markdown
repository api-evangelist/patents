title: Web services and telecom network management unification
abstract: A method of unifying web services and telecom network management is described. The method comprises exporting an external model representation of at least one entity of a service oriented architecture of a service oriented architecture manager and importing the exported external model representation of the at least one entity as a network management data model entity of a network manager. The method further comprises subscribing, by the network manager, to subsequent updates of the at least one entity.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Telecommunication (\u201cTelecom\u201d) service providers recruit third party independent software vendors (ISVs) to deliver services to run on the telecommunication network infrastructure, both within and outside the Telecom service provider domain. Telecom service providers need to be aware of how service outages affect their subscriber base consuming or registered to use the affected services. Some solutions, such as a Hewlett-Packard (HP) Service Delivery Platform (SDP), use a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) to deploy new services rapidly within the Telecom service provider infrastructure by reusing common services leveraging third party-provided services. The Telecom Network Operations Center (NOC) needs to be alerted about fault and performance issues at the SOA level so that potential \u201cend-user service outages\u201d can be addressed quickly. Telecom NOC staff monitor separate platforms, e.g., separate computer systems, in order to manage web services and telecom networks.","Telecommunication networks and web services providers exist in largely independent domains. The information models used by software from these different domains differ presenting difficulties to developers, users, and service and network providers. By not presenting the information from the information models in a single information model, the support staff may be delayed in responding to service issues.","For example, automatic announcement of web service outages are not possible unless the alerts raised by a web services management platform is sent to software generating the announcements.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","102","106","106","106","102","104","108","110","114","114"]},"In accordance with at least some embodiments, SOAM  generates a Resource Description Framework (RDF) model  representation, i.e., an external model representation, of service model  and ISM  imports the RDF graph into SID . The RDF family of specifications from the World Wide Web Consortium provide a lightweight ontology for the exchange of knowledge in the Web. RDF captures the knowledge in a set of triples, each consisting of subject, predicate and object. XML provides a common notation for representing RDF triples, although it is not the only notation that can be used. RDF model  captures information in service model  of SOAM. In at least some embodiments, RDF model  captures the same information as in service model . After importation of RDF model  into SID , ISM  is able to obtain updated information for a Web service  from SOAM , and more particularly, information from service model  converted into the RDF model.","In at least some embodiments, SOAM  generates and transmits an alert signal  to ISM  in response to an update of status information for a particular Web service . The alert is generated within SOAM  by a monitoring engine based on metrics provided from the Web services and threshold values, e.g., performance thresholds, set by the operator on those metrics. In some embodiments, SOAM  generates and transmits alert signal  responsive to an update of status information from a particular web service . In some embodiments, alert signal  provides updated information to ISM  corresponding to updated information for service model  which caused the fault to be generated. In at least some other embodiments, ISM  requests an update (update request ) from service model  of information in SID  corresponding to imported RDF model . In at least some embodiments, alert signal  comprises information identifying a particular web service  in service model  causing the alert signal and ISM  transmits update request  comprising information based on the representation of the particular identified Web service  to the service model.","In at least some embodiments, responsive to receipt of update request  from ISM , SOAM  generates and transmits an update  specifying updated information for service model . For example, if ISM  and SOAM  have not communicated for a period of time such that RDF model  imported into SID  are out of date, the ISM may transmit an update request  to the SOAM. In some embodiments, SOAM  generates and transmits an update  specifying updated information specific to the particular web service  which caused the generation of alert signal . In this manner, alerts generated by web service(s)  managed by SOAM  are provided to SID  and ISM  for presentation, e.g., via a display, to a user of the ISM, i.e., a single interface such as a telecom network management system may be used to interact with both telecom networks and web services. As described above, in some embodiments, alert  comprises the updated information specific to the particular web service  which caused the generation of alert signal .","In some further embodiments, ISM  may transmit a clear alert signal to SOAM . For example, in response to an alert  transmitted from SOAM  to ISM , the ISM may clear, e.g., reset, the fault in the corresponding entity in SID . Clearing the fault in SID  may then cause generation and transmission, e.g., by ISM , of a clear alert message to SOAM  and the corresponding entity in service model  and\/or web service . In at least one embodiment, the clear alert message may be generated from ISM  as part of execution of a rule in rule set .","For simplicity and clarity,  depicts a single web service ; however, in some embodiments, more than one web service may be present. Software that is accessible over a computer network and which provides specific functionality and supports interaction with other software entities on computers connected to the network may be regarded as a web service. In at least one embodiment, web services may follow standards in order to allow better tooling support from vendors. In at least one other embodiment, web services may not follow and\/or may follow a select set of standards.","According to at least one example, the interfaces to web services may be according to Representational State Transfer (REST) or Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) specifications, or other conventions agreed among web service designers. For example, a shipping company may have implemented a business service to match vehicle drivers to package pickup requests received by the shipping company. The business service may access a location mapping web service which responds to a pickup request comprising a given location of the package and a given location of the nearest available driver by generating map images of the requested destination and route, and turn-by-turn directions.","SOAM  generates service model  based on discovering one or more Web service(s)  managed by the SOAM. Service model  represents web service(s)  discovered by SOAM  as managed entities and the dependencies of business services on the Web services, e.g., the dependency of the package and driver matching service on the location mapping Web service in the above example, and inter-dependency of Web services are represented in the service model.","Service model  entities managed by SOAM  differ from SID  entities managed by ISM . Service model  is a service model in an internal representation of SOAM , or in a language such as a Service Modeling Language (SML). SID  is a service model in the Shared Information and Data (SID) model, standardized in the Telecom Management Forum. RDF model  represents service model  entities corresponding to web service(s)  as a set of triples, e.g., a subject-predicate-object expression. For example, a particular web service  entity in service model  may comprise a name attribute such as \u201cName\u201d and a unique identifier attribute such as \u201cUniqueIdentifier.\u201d In some embodiments, a particular web service  entity comprises a name attribute and a unique identifier attribute and additionally a fault attribute such as \u201cFault.\u201d In at least some embodiments, a particular web service  entity comprises a service attribute, e.g., a response time, a throughput value, and other performance-related values. The service attribute may be compared to a threshold value by SOAM  in determining whether a service differs from a particular performance threshold, e.g., whether the service meets or exceeds a threshold, whether the service is below a given threshold, etc.","Because of the entity differences between service model  entities and SID  entities, ISM  applies a rule set  to RDF model  entities in order to import (represent) the service model entities in the SID. In some embodiments, a web service  entity from service model  may be represented as a resource entity in SID  and a business process from the service model may be represented as a service in the SID.  depicts a high-level mapping of attributes between service model  entities and SID  entities.
