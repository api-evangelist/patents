title: Intrascan data dependency
abstract: A mass spectrometer data dependent method and apparatus is introduced to alter scanning parameters based upon data acquired during that scan. Such a method an apparatus may include the identification of ion species of interest meeting user specified criteria so that a determination can be made as to whether or not the present scan is to be continued, terminated, or alternatively paused while such a decision is being made. Such a method of operation saves overall cycle time and allows examination of, for example, marker ion ratios for additional peptides that might otherwise be missed.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to the field of mass spectrometry, and more particularly to a mass spectrometer system and method that provides for one or more data dependent decisions to be made as to altering scan parameters based upon information acquired during the scan.","2. Discussion of the Related Art","Data dependent experiments currently involve collecting a mass spectral scan and then performing one or more subsequent scans based upon the analysis of data in the first scan. Generally described, data-dependent acquisition involves using data derived from an experimentally-acquired mass spectrum in an \u201con-the-fly\u201d manner to direct the subsequent operation of a mass spectrometer; for example, a mass spectrometer may be switched between MS and MS\/MS scan modes upon detection of an ion species of potential interest. Utilization of data-dependent acquisition methods in a mass spectrometer provides the ability to make automated, real-time decisions in order to maximize the useful information content of the acquired data. Current systems and methods that provide for real time data dependent functionality include, but are not limited to: the Data Dependent Experiment\u2122 (DDE) tool utilized by Thermo Finnigan LLC of San Jose, Calif., the Data Directed Analysis (DDA) tool by Waters Corporation (Micromass\u2122) and the Information Dependant Acquisition\u2122 (IDA\u2122) system marketed by MDS Sciex Inc. and Applera Corporation.","Data-dependent acquisition methods may be characterized as having one or more input criteria, and one or more output actions. The input criteria employed for conventional data-dependent methods are generally based on parameters such as intensity, intensity pattern, mass window, mass difference (neutral loss), mass-to-charge (m\/z) inclusion and exclusion lists, and product ion mass. The input criteria are employed to select one or more ion species that satisfy the criteria. The selected ion species are then subjected to an output action (examples of which include performing MS\/MS or MS\u201d analysis and\/or high-resolution scanning). In one instance of a typical data-dependent experiment, a group of ions are mass analyzed, and precursor ion species having mass spectral intensities exceeding a specified threshold are subsequently selected as precursor ions for MS\/MS analysis, which may involve operations of isolation, dissociation of the precursor ions, and mass analysis of the product ions.","Generally, a mass spectrometer configured to provide such data dependent analysis most often includes: an ion source to transform introduced molecules in a sample into ionized fragments; an analyzer to separate such ionized ions by their masses by applying electric and magnetic fields; and a detector to measure and thus provide data for identifying and calculating the abundances of each ion fragment present. Moreover, such a mass spectrometer system often can and does include a two-dimensional (2D) and\/or a three-dimensional (3D) ion trap that enables the storage of ions over a large range of masses for relatively large periods of time. Once the ions are formed and stored, various known techniques can be performed for isolating the desired ions of interest and for conducting MS\/MS or (MS)experiments. In particular, MS\/MS often involves fragmentation of an ion or ions of interest in order to obtained desired information regarding the one or more ions' structure.","The fragmentation process itself typically includes the use of an auxiliary voltage of low amplitude (e.g., up to about 20 volts at a duration of up to about tens of milliseconds) configured with a resonance frequency to match desired ions frequencies of motion, which in turn is determined by the main trapping RF field amplitude and the ions mass-to-charge ratio (m\/z). Particular ions in resonance with such an auxiliary applied voltage take up the energy and their amplitude of motion grows. In an ideal quadrupole field, the amplitude of resonating ions grows linearly with time if the resonance voltage is continuously applied. As the amplitude increases, the kinetic energy of resonating ions also increases (i.e., as the square of the amplitude) and thus any collisions that occur with introduced neutral gas molecules or other ions become increasingly energetic. Eventually, the collisions which occur deposit enough energy into the molecular bonds of the resonating ions to cause bonds to break and thus cause fragmentation. The beneficial result of such a method is a desired mass spectrum for analysis.","However, a constraint that has continued to limit mass spectrometer apparatus that utilize such 2D and 3D ion trap mass analyzer instruments is that upon initiating a scan of the contents of the traps, a completion of the initiated scan may be unwarranted based upon information that is obtained during scanning. In particular, there are no commercially available systems in place to direct such a system to automatically stop an MS, (MS)or MS\/MS scan in progress or continue such scans based on interrogated (m\/z) data provided during the scan itself.","Background information on a data dependent system that alternates between a fast scan (i.e., measurement scan) and a slow scan (i.e., a survey scan) based on a pre-scan map, is described and claimed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,837,434, entitled, MASS SPECTROMETRY SYSTEM AND METHOD EMPLOYING MEASUREMENT\/SURVEY SCAN STRATEGY,\u201d issued Jun. 6, 1989, to James, including the following, \u201cA gas chromatography plus mass spectrometry system implements a scan strategy in which each full range scan alternates between a normal measurement mode and a survey mode based on a block\/gap map made during the previous scan. Survey mode is used within regions that were determined in the previous scan to lack signal above a predetermined threshold. Spectral data is generated during measurement mode operation. Each scan serves both measurement and mapping functions in a way that avoids mass filter jumps, since each scan is monotonic over the entire scanning range.\u201d","Background information for a data dependent mass spectrometer system that enables peptidic analysis, is described and claimed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,498,568, entitled, \u201cREAL-TIME ANALYSIS OF MASS SPECTROMETRY DATA FOR IDENTIFYING PEPTIDIC DATA OF INTEREST,\u201d filed Apr. 29, 2005, to Overney et al., including the following, \u201cA mass spectrometry system is described. The mass spectrometry system comprises: (a) a mass spectrometer; and (b) a controller connected to the mass spectrometer. The controller is configured to: (i) direct the mass spectrometer to acquire a precursor ion spectrum of a sample stream; (ii) analyze, in real-time, the precursor ion spectrum to determine whether a first evaluation criterion is satisfied; (iii) if the first evaluation criterion is satisfied, direct the mass spectrometer to acquire a product ion spectrum of the sample stream; (iv) analyze, in real-time, the product ion spectrum to determine whether a second evaluation criterion is satisfied; and (v) if the second evaluation criterion is satisfied, analyze the product ion spectrum to assign an identification to the product ion spectrum. For certain implementations, the controller allows automated, data-dependent acquisition of mass spectrometry data to improve the efficiency at which peptidic data of interest can be acquired.\u201d","Background information for a data dependent mass spectrometer system that provides for selection of various dissociation techniques, is described and claimed in PCT application WO\/2008\/025014 A2, entitled, \u201cDATA-DEPENDENT SELECTION OF DISSOCIATION TYPE IN A MASS SPECTROMETER,\u201d published filed Aug. 25, 2006, to Schwartz et al., including the following, \u201cMethods and apparatus for data-dependent mass spectrometric MS\/MS or MSn analysis are disclosed. The methods may include determination of the charge state of an ion species of interest, followed by automatic selection (e.g., CAD, ETD, or ETD followed by a non-dissociative charge reduction or collision activation) based at least partially on the determined charge state. The ion species of interest is then dissociated in accordance with the selected dissociation type, and an MS\/MS or MSn spectrum of the resultant product ions may be acquired.\u201d","Accordingly, a need exists for a mass spectrometer system that utilizes a data dependent method of altering the acquisition of a given scan by monitoring for ion species of interest during the scan so as to determine whether to continue or terminate the present scan in order to preserve overall cycle time and improve efficiency. The present invention is thus directed to such a need.","Accordingly, the present invention provides for an intra-scan data dependent method to alter specific scan parameters within a mass spectrometer system during the scan. In particular, the present invention provides a method that includes: providing one or more ions in a trapping chamber, the trapping chamber being coupled to the mass spectrometer system; initiating a scan of the trapping chamber using one or more appropriate resolutions to identify one or more ion species of interest resulting from the one or more ions; determining if a user specified input criteria with respect to the ion species of interest requires the initiated scan to be terminated; alternatively continuing the initiated scan at one or more appropriate scanning resolutions based upon said user specified input criteria so as to provide a desired mass spectrum of the one or more ions in the trapping chamber and outputting to a user, the desired mass spectrum representative of the scanned one or more ions within the trapping chamber.","In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, the present invention provides for an automated data dependent spectrometer. In particular, the spectrometer includes an ion trapping chamber configured to receive one or more ions; a controller configured to initiate a mass spectrum scan of the one or more of ions within the ion trapping chamber, the controller additionally configured to identify one or more ion species of interest resulting from the initiated mass spectrum scan and based upon user specified input criteria, terminate the initiated mass spectrum scan but alternatively, continue with the initiated mass spectrum scan if the conditions set by the user specified input criteria requires such a result so as to provide for a desired mass (m\/z) spectrum having one or more appropriate scan resolutions; and a mass spectrum recording and displaying means to indicate data resultant from the terminated scan or the provided desired mass (m\/z) spectrum.","Accordingly, the present invention provides for an apparatus and method of operation that provides for a decision to be made as to altering the scan parameters (e.g., stopping or continuing with the present scan) based upon information acquired during the scan itself so as to save overall cycle time and allow examination of, for example, marker ion ratios for additional peptides that might otherwise be missed.","In the description of the invention herein, it is understood that a word appearing in the singular encompasses its plural counterpart, and a word appearing in the plural encompasses its singular counterpart, unless implicitly or explicitly understood or stated otherwise. Furthermore, it is understood that for any given component or embodiment described herein, any of the possible candidates or alternatives listed for that component may generally be used individually or in combination with one another, unless implicitly or explicitly understood or stated otherwise. Moreover, it is to be appreciated that the figures, as shown herein, are not necessarily drawn to scale, wherein some of the elements may be drawn merely for clarity of the invention. Also, reference numerals may be repeated among the various figures to show corresponding or analogous elements. Additionally, it will be understood that any list of such candidates or alternatives is merely illustrative, not limiting, unless implicitly or explicitly understood or stated otherwise.","In addition, unless otherwise indicated, numbers expressing quantities of ingredients, constituents, reaction conditions and so forth used in the specification and claims are to be understood as being modified by the term \u201cabout.\u201d Accordingly, unless indicated to the contrary, the numerical parameters set forth in the specification and attached claims are approximations that may vary depending upon the desired properties sought to be obtained by the subject matter presented herein. At the very least, and not as an attempt to limit the application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the claims, each numerical parameter should at least be construed in light of the number of reported significant digits and by applying ordinary rounding techniques. Notwithstanding that the numerical ranges and parameters setting forth the broad scope of the subject matter presented herein are approximations, the numerical values set forth in the specific examples are reported as precisely as possible. Any numerical values, however, inherently contain certain errors necessarily resulting from the standard deviation found in their respective testing measurements.","General Description","Data dependent instrument control programs and software applications are crucial to the usefulness with respect to mass spectrometer systems and in particular, with respect to ion traps configured within such systems. Since all of the scan functions for single and tandem mass analysis are a complicated sequence of timed events, computer control of the scan is both vital and an opportunity to provide unique instrument performance. The data dependent scan function for tandem mass analysis is an excellent example of what can be done to automate and efficiently acquire data to solve a complex problem such as peptide identification. Without data dependent scan control and application software to help analyze the data, problems such as, but not limited to, peptide identification are often too slow to be of any real utility.","The present invention, however, provides for an even faster and improved novel method for decreasing analytical analysis of an experimental run when such a run is simply not warranted. The basic concept includes an initiated scan to be implemented once one or more precursor or desired fragmented ions are contained in a trapping chamber (e.g., an ion trap). Thereafter, upon acquiring mass data, i.e., m\/z data, from one or more regions of a mass range, a decision provided by, for example, a control and data system can be made as to whether to continue or terminate the scan based on user input specified criteria.","Specific Description",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["10","10","10","16","17"]},"In addition, the ion traps of the present invention can also be combined with other beneficial features that are known in the industry, such as, but not limited to, Normalized Collision Energy, Stepped Normalized Collision Energy, as well as Automatic gain control (AGC). AGC in particular, includes first injecting ions into the ion trap for some predetermined time using some gating optical element, typically in a pre-scan. A measurement of the resultant signal in the pre-scan is taken, and a calculation is then performed to determine what injection time (i.e. how long the gate is open) is needed to yield a specified \u201ctarget\u201d amount of signal, the target being the optimum signal which avoids saturation or space charge effects in the trap. A useful technique that incorporates such an automatic ion supply control feature is described and claimed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,572,022, entitled \u201cMethod And Apparatus Of Increasing Dynamic Range And Sensitivity Of A Mass Spectrometer,\u201d issued Nov. 5, 1996, to Schwartz et al., the disclosure of which is incorporated be reference in its entirety.","With respect to the example linear trap device shown in , it is known to those of ordinary skill in the art that such a structure often comprises pairs of opposed elongated electrodes aligned across orthogonal X and Y dimensions. Ions are contained in a region within the interior by the application of RF trapping voltages to electrode pairs in combination with an applied axial DC field that collects ions in the interior portions of the ion trap. As part of the configuration, predetermined apertures enable expulsion of ions for subsequent detection. Although quadrupole arrangements are often beneficially utilized, other multipole configurations, such as, for example, hexapoles, octupoles, decapoles, etc., can also be utilized within a mass spectrometer system  that uses the methods of operation of the present invention.","Thus, as part of the mass spectrometer  system, as generally shown in , a sample containing one or more analytes of interest can be ionized via an ion source  using any of the applicable techniques known and understood by those of ordinary skill in the art. Such techniques can include, but are not strictly limited to, Electron Ionization (EI), Chemical Ionization (CI), Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization (MALDI), Electrospray Ionization (ESI), Atmospheric Pressure Chemical Ionization (APCI), Nanoelectrospray Ionization (NanoESI), and Atmospheric Pressure Ionization (API), etc.","The resultant ions are directed via predetermined ion optics  that often can include tube lenses, skimmers, and multipoles selected from radio-frequency RF quadrupole and octopole ion guides, etc., so as to be urged through a series of chambers of progressively reduced pressure that operationally guide and focus such ions to provide good transmission efficiencies. The various chambers communicate with corresponding ports  (represented as arrows in the figure) that are coupled to a set of pumps (not shown) to maintain the pressures at the desired values. The operation of mass spectrometer  is controlled and data is acquired (e.g., by scanning the ion trap) and processed by a control and data system  (a controller) of various circuitry of a known type, which may be implemented as any one or a combination of general or special-purpose processors (digital signal processor (DSP)), firmware, software to provide instrument control and data analysis for mass spectrometers and\/or related instruments, and hardware circuitry configured to execute a set of instructions that embody the prescribed data analysis and control routines of the present invention. Such processing of the data may also include averaging, scan grouping, deconvolution, library searches, data storage, and data reporting.","In addition, such instruction and control functions, as described above, can also be implemented by a mass spectrometer system , as shown in , as provided by a machine-readable medium (e.g., a computer readable medium). A computer-readable medium, in accordance with aspects of the present invention, refers to mediums known and understood by those of ordinary skill in the art, which have encoded information provided in a form that can be read (i.e., scanned\/sensed) by a machine\/computer and interpreted by the machine's\/computer's hardware and\/or software.","Thus, as mass spectral data of a given spectrum is received by a beneficial mass spectrometer  system, as disclosed herein, the information embedded in a computer program of the present invention can be utilized, for example, to extract data from the mass spectral data, which corresponds to a selected set of mass-to-charge ratios. In addition, the information embedded in a computer program of the present invention can be utilized to carry out methods for normalizing, shifting data, or extracting unwanted data from a raw file in a manner that is understood and desired by those of ordinary skill in the art.","As briefly discussed above, the invention disclosed herein provides for a novel and useful extension of a data-dependent mode of operation by being configured to alter the acquisition of a current scan based upon information (i.e., m\/z data) that has been acquired during the scan. Thus, the present invention provides for an even faster and improved novel method for decreasing analytical analysis of an experimental run when such a run is simply not warranted.","In an example method of operation, a user defines the data dependent operation by specifying the measurement input criteria and resultant action criteria, e.g., dissociation type, m\/z range, intensity threshold, charge state (e.g., +1, +2, +2\u22123, etc.), ion marker ratios, resolution, etc. As part of the decision making process, isobaric tagging methods, such as, but not limited to, Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) and\/or iTRAQ reporter ions can often be incorporated with the methods of the present invention for qualification and quantitation of desired molecular species, e.g., peptides labeled with such tags. Thereafter, the selected peptide or protein precursor ions that may have such isobaric tags are often isolated and fragmented within the ion trap  device based upon desired input charge state criteria using any of the known processes selected solely or in combination, as understood by those skilled in the art. For example, dissociation processes can include, but are not strictly limited to, pulsed Q-dissociation (PQD), collision activation dissociation (CAD), infrared multi-photon photo-dissociation (IRMPD), electron transfer dissociation (ETD, described in U.S. Patent Publication No. US2005\/0199804, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein), high energy C-trap dissociation (HCD), and\/or collision-induced dissociation (CID). ETD in particular, is a beneficial technique when used in the present invention because it significantly improves protein characterization, post-translational modification (PTM) analysis and top-down or middle-down sequencing of proteins and peptides.","As an example when using isobaric tagging methods, one or more isobaric labeled peptides are contained in an ion trap and\/or further fragmented using for example, tandem MS operations known to those skilled in the art. A scan can be initiated and after the low mass marker region is acquired (e.g., about the 126 m\/z range up to about the 131 m\/z range for TMT or about the 110 m\/z range up to about the 117 m\/z range for iTRAQ) a decision is made as to whether to continue with the present scan or possibly terminate. The decision can either be made as the scan continues, or alternatively, the scan can be paused while the decision is made. If the marker ion ratios meet user specified criteria, then the scan is directed to continue until completion so as to allow for identification of the molecules of the one or more molecules of interest, e.g., a desired peptide. To further demonstrate the capabilities disclosed herein, if ratios of 10:5:2:1 are recorded, this peptide is of interest and therefore it is deemed beneficial to collect data that enables identification. By contrast, if ratios, such as ratios substantially near 1:1:1:1 are recorded, the peptide is more often not of interest and thus, acquisition of a complete mass range in this example illustration is, depending on the input criteria, deemed unnecessary and thus the scan is often terminated. Such a method of operation saves overall cycle time and allows examination of marker ion ratios for additional peptides that might otherwise be missed.","Another beneficial aspect of the present invention can be found in the analysis of certain peptides of interest that are linked to post translation modification of proteins, such as, for example, glycosylation and sequences which have phosphorylated amino acid residues, e.g., phosphotyrosine, phosphoserine, or phosphothreonine. Phosphotyrosine, in particular, has been shown to be a primary mechanism of signal transduction during normal mitogenesis, cell cycle progression and oncogenic transformation and thus has drawn attention as to studying its presence and abundance in isolated proteins or peptide sequences. Thus, tandem mass spectroscopy techniques such as, but not limited to, LC\/MS\/MS coupled with beneficial dissociation methods that optimize the analysis of such modifications, e.g., electron transfer dissociation (ETD), can be beneficially used to identify and quantify such proteins and peptides with the generated sequence data capable of being searched in one or more sequence databases.","Moreover, similar to the TMT and iTRAQ tagging method discussed above, the identification of such desired protein fragments can also be isotopically labeled in a manner to enable discrimination of the mass data between desired protein samples. The present invention thus can expedite the analysis process of, for example, phosphorylated residues, in a data dependent manner by looking for such signals of scanned ions that indicate its presence and\/or abundance and if certain set criteria is met, pausing or continuing on with the scan at one or more desired resolutions within desired m\/z regions of a mass spectrum, but if not, terminating the scan so as to improve the overall efficiency of the data analysis.","As a particular example illustration as to how the present invention can be utilized in analyzing such proteins, specifically with respect to phosphotyrosine, it is to be noted that after collision activation is utilized to produce desired daughter ions, the phosphotyrosine peptides themselves normally form a characteristic fragment at about m\/z . Thus, after m\/z  is recorded, if it is below a user specified abundance, the remainder of the scan can be terminated because the peptide is not of interest and therefore identification is more often than not, deemed unnecessary.","As noted above, in those situations where implemented low mass reporter ions are potentially obscured or occluded based on the utilized fragmentation process, a system of the present invention can also be beneficially configured to operate using pulsed Q-dissociation (PQD), the technique of which is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,949,743 B1 and of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Generally described, PQD is a technique that eliminates the low mass cut-off concern inherent with all ion traps. This results in extensive coverage for predicted and unpredicted metabolites, and the ability to perform peptide quantification using, for example, iTRAQ labels.","In particular, PQD involves putting one or more precursor ions contained in a trap at a high Q value between about 0.6 up to about 0.8 in conjunction with a short (e.g., about 100 \u03bcs in duration) high amplitude pulse to provide for resonance excitation of desired ions. The ions are held at the high Q for a short period of time (e.g., up to about 100 \u03bcs), which by design enables the kinetic energy of the ions at resonance to be converted into internal energy through collisions, but not long enough for significant dissociation to occur. Thereafter, the precursor ions' Q value is pulsed to a low value by dropping the RF amplitude and allowing such ions to undergo fragmentation at this low Q value. Such a method of activating at high Q values and collecting fragments at low Q values results in an information-rich mass spectrum. Thus, when using iTRAQ\u2122 or TMT marker ions in conjunction with PQD, a broader mass spectrum that includes resultant low mass fragmented ions in addition to ions past the low mass marker region can be collected using the novel variable resolution scanning techniques of the present invention that are described herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["40","210","220","230","10","16","17"]},"In example step , as control and data system , as shown in , is continually processing detected ion species information, a decision is made on the current scan based on user input criteria, as illustrated by decision block , as to whether to abort the scan, or continue.
