{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application is a continuation (and claims the benefit of priority under 35 U.S.C. 120) of U.S. application Ser. No. 10\/835,510, filed on Apr. 28, 2004 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,647,264. The disclosure of the prior application is considered part of (and is incorporated by reference in) the disclosure of this application.","The invention relates to trading systems, particularly financial trading systems.","Electronic equity markets, such as The Nasdaq Stock Market\u00ae collect, aggregate and display trade information to market participants. Market participants initiate trades of securities by sending trade information to the electronic market on which the securities are traded. The trade information includes continuous orders for execution during a market trading session. After the close of a market trading session, a closing price is determined for each security.","Certain investors, including mutual funds and derivative traders, need to execute transactions in a security at the closing price using \u201con-close\u201d orders. Some electronic markets perform a closing process that takes the final trade of a security executed during the trading session as the closing price for that security. Since this closing process is performed without special treatment for on-close orders, an electronic market center does not guarantee that a particular on-close order will trade at the closing price. Without a guarantee from an electronic market center that a particular order will trade at the closing price, investors turn to manual markets or broker-dealers to guarantee them the closing price for their transactions.","In general, in one aspect, the invention features a method for trading a security in an electronic market. The method includes receiving closing orders and orders for the security traded in the electronic market, disseminating an order imbalance indicator indicative of predicted trading characteristics of the security at the close of trading, determining a closing price for the security based on the closing orders and orders, and executing at least some of the closing orders at the determined closing price.","In general, in another aspect, the invention features an electronic market for trading of securities. The electronic market includes a client station for entering a closing order for a security traded in the electronic market, and a server system. The server system includes a queue storing the closing order along with other orders, a process to disseminate an order imbalance indicator indicative of predicted trading characteristics of the security at the close of trading, and a process to determine a closing price for the security based on the stored orders and execute at least some of the orders at the determined closing price.","In general, in another aspect, the invention features a computer program product residing on a computer-readable medium for use in an electronic market for trading of securities comprises instructions for causing a system to receive closing orders and orders for the security traded in the electronic market, disseminate an order imbalance indicator indicative of predicted trading characteristics of the security at the close of trading, determine a closing price for the security based on the closing orders and orders, and execute at least some of the closing orders at the determined closing price.","In general, in another aspect, the invention features a method for trading a security in an electronic market. The method includes receiving closing orders and orders for the security traded in the electronic market, determining a closing price for the security based on the closing orders and orders, the closing price being within a predetermined range of a benchmark value representing market conditions prior to the close of trading, and executing at least some of the closing orders at the determined closing price.","In general, in another aspect, the invention features a system including a server system configured to send an information data stream to a trading system. The data stream includes at least one of an inside match price or a near indicative clearing price.","In general, in another aspect, the invention features a system including a client station coupled to a server system that is part of an electronic venue for trading financial products, and configured to send an order for a security to the server system. The order includes data fields including: a price value, a number of shares value, and an indicator value that indicates the order as an imbalance only order.","Embodiments of the invention may include one or more of the following features.","The closing orders include imbalance only orders.","The method includes modifying a limit price associated with one of the imbalance only orders based on a comparison between the limit price and an inside price.","The closing orders may include limit-on-close orders and\/or market-on-close orders.","The method also includes periodically producing the order imbalance indicator over a series of time periods.","The order imbalance indicator at a first of the series of time periods includes at least one of: an inside match price, a number of shares paired at an inside match price, an on-close order imbalance, a buy\/sell direction of the on-close order imbalance, an indicative clearing price range associated with the first of the series of times, or a percentage by which an indicative price varies from an inside price.","Determining the closing price includes determining a preliminary closing price, comparing the preliminary closing price to a benchmark value representing market conditions prior to the close of trading, and determining the closing price based on the comparison.","The benchmark value includes a volume weighted average of orders executed during a predetermined time period before the close of trading.","The inside match price is selected from an inside bid price, an inside offer price, an inside bid-offer midpoint price, or zero, based on an imbalance of closing orders.","The near indicative clearing price includes a price at which closing orders and continuous orders would execute if paired with each other.","The server system resides in a venue for trading securities electronically.","The venue is an electronic commerce network, an auction, an exchange, or an electronic exchange.","The imbalance only order executes in response to an imbalance in liquidity associated with the electronic venue.","Embodiments of the invention may include one or more of the following advantages.","Closing orders are executed in a single transaction. The information included in the imbalance indicator improves transparency and price discovery. Disseminating the imbalance indicator gives market participants an opportunity to adjust their trading based on the imbalance indicator by adjusting the price and\/or size of existing imbalance only orders, or by submitting additional imbalance only orders. The closing process improves liquidity, reduces risk and reduces costs for investors seeking to trade at the closing price.","Other features and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following description, and from the claims.","Referring to , an electronic market  is shown. The electronic market  includes client stations  in communication with a server system  over a distributed computing network  (e.g., the Internet, an intranet, a local area network, or other similar form of network). A client station  includes a process to send trade information (e.g., continuous orders, closing orders, etc.) entered by a user (e.g., a market participant, a market maker, etc.) to the server system . The server system  collects trade information from the client stations  and enters valid orders into a storage module . An order identifies a security and a number of shares of the security to be traded. A priced buy order includes a bid price at which to buy the shares. A priced sell order includes an offer price at which to sell the shares. The storage module  includes a queue  for each security traded in the market  that stores orders for that security.","The server system  includes a trading module  that executes trades of securities electronically based on the entered orders. After an order is executed or canceled, the order is removed from the storage module . The trading module  also includes a closing process  that runs after the end of a trading session to determine a closing price for each security and execute at least some of the entered orders for a security at the determined closing price. The server system  disseminates information about the market on a data feed  (over the network  or, alternatively, over a separate communication line) to the client stations .","In the electronic market , a user electronically trades with other users (as opposed to trading on a trading floor). Trading can occur over extended periods of time. An example of an electronic market, the Nasdaq Stock Market\u00ae, allows trading during a trading session (i.e., 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. ET). Orders placed and executed during the trading session are \u201ccontinuous orders.\u201d The server system  maintains an \u201cinside bid\u201d price corresponding to the price of the best (i.e., highest) continuous buy order, and an \u201cinside offer\u201d price corresponding to the price of the best (i.e., lowest) continuous sell order, based on the most recently received continuous orders.","Orders placed during the trading session to be executed after the trading session at the closing price are \u201cclosing orders.\u201d Two types of closing orders are \u201cOn-Close\u201d orders and \u201cImbalance Only\u201d (IO) orders. On-Close orders can be un-priced and entered as \u201cmarket-on-close\u201d (MOC) orders, or priced and entered as \u201climit-on-close\u201d (LOC) orders. A LOC buy order includes a buy limit price and a LOC sell order includes a sell limit price. On-Close orders, both MOC and LOC orders, execute at the price determined by the closing process. Thus, LOC buy orders are subject to price improvement (i.e., reduction) if the buy limit price is greater than the determined closing price, and LOC sell orders are subject to price improvement (i.e., increase) if the sell limit price is less than the determined closing price. In one embodiment, On-Close orders can be entered, cancelled, and\/or corrected between 9:30:01 a.m. EST and 3:50:00 p.m., e.g., just after market open and just prior to market close, but are not displayed or disseminated by the server system .","IO orders execute only against any imbalance in liquidity, supplementing the liquidity provided by On-Close orders. IO order types are priced limit orders. The server system  enforces rules for entering or modifying submitted IO orders. For example, the server system  rejects IO orders that are submitted without a price. In one embodiment, IO orders are entered up until 3:59:59, e.g., just prior to market close, but they cannot be cancelled or modified after, e.g., 3:50:00 except to increase the number of shares or to increase the buy limit price or decrease the sell limit price. IO sell orders execute at or above the 4:00:00 inside offer, and IO buy orders execute at or below the 4:00:00 inside bid. Thus, IO buy orders are subject to price improvement (i.e., reduction) if the buy limit price is greater than the 4:00:00 inside bid, and LOC sell orders are subject to price improvement (i.e., increase) if the sell limit price is less than the 4:00:00 inside offer. As with On-Close orders, IO are not displayed or disseminated by the server system .","Referring to , a first exemplary format  for orders includes a field  for entering a name or symbol representing a security, a b\/s field  that represents whether the order is a buy (b) or sell (s) order, a price field , and a size field  that represents the number of shares in the order. The format  also includes a type field . The type field  can have various values representing different types of orders. If the value of the type field  is \u201cMOC\u201d, \u201cLOC\u201d or \u201cIO\u201d, then the order is a closing order. The value of the price field  is interpreted as a limit price for LOC and IO orders. The value of the size field  indicates a number of shares to be traded upon execution of the order. Alternatively, instead of including an explicit type field , the value of the type field  can be implicitly derived from evaluation of other fields.","A second exemplary format  for orders includes an optional relative price field  for specifying a relative limit price for IO orders. An IO order that uses this relative price field  does not include a value in the price field , but instead specifies a limit price as a percentage deviation from a predetermined benchmark price. Orders may include other fields.","Imbalance Indicator","The information disseminated over the data feed  includes an \u201corder imbalance indicator.\u201d The order imbalance indicator includes information about closing orders, as described in more detail below, and the price at which those closing orders would execute at the time the order imbalance indicator is disseminated. For example, the order imbalance indicator is disseminated at predetermined time intervals before the close of the market.","The information included in the order imbalance indicator at a given time, for a given security is based on an \u201corder imbalance\u201d in that exists in the market at that time. The trading module  identifies an order imbalance based on orders in a queue  for a security at a particular time by identifying a number of On-Close buy shares \u201cMB\u201d that are \u201cmarketable\u201d at or above the inside offer (i.e., are MOC or LOC priced at or above the inside offer), and a number of On-Close sell shares \u201cMS\u201d that are \u201cmarketable\u201d at or below the inside bid (i.e., are MOC or LOC priced at or below the inside bid). The trading module  identifies a number of shares of sell closing orders \u201cPS\u201d (On-close and IO orders) that can be paired (or \u201ccrossed\u201d) with the marketable On-Close buy shares, and a number of shares of buy closing orders \u201cPB\u201d (On-close and IO orders) that can be paired with the marketable On-Close sell shares. The order imbalance corresponds to the number of shares of On-Close orders that are not executed when the maximum number of shares of closing orders are paired at the inside \u201cinside match price.\u201d","When MIN(MB,PS)>MIN(MS,PB) the inside match price is the inside offer and there is a \u201cbuy side\u201d order imbalance of MB-PS shares. When MIN(MB,PS)<MIN(MS,PB) the inside match price is the inside bid and there is a \u201csell side\u201d order imbalance of MS-PB shares. The order imbalance can also be calculated as MAX(MB-PS, MS-PB). When the order imbalance is zero (i.e., MB-PS\u22660 and MS-PB\u22660) the inside match price is the \u201cinside bid-offer midpoint\u201d (i.e., the average of the inside bid and the inside offer). If there are no On-Close orders, then the inside match price is zero.","The following information, described in (1)-(5) below, can be included in the order imbalance indicator at a given time, for a given security. The order imbalance indicator can be disseminated as a data stream and have a format that includes at least one of the information fields: PSH, MP, IMB, ISH, IPR, or PVI described below.","(1) Paired Shares (PSH) and Inside Match Price (MP)","The imbalance indicator includes the number of shares (PSH) corresponding to MOC, LOC and IO orders that are eligible to be paired at the current inside match price (MP), and the current inside match price (i.e., the match price at the given time).","(2) Imbalance (IMB) and Imbalance Shares (ISH)","The imbalance indicator includes the number of shares (ISH) corresponding to MOC and LOC orders that are not eligible to be paired at the current inside match price (i.e., the On-Close order imbalance), and a label (IMB) indicating \u201cBuy\u201d for a buy side imbalance, \u201cSell\u201d for a sell side imbalance, \u201cZero Imbalance\u201d for a zero order imbalance (i.e., all On-Close orders are paired), or \u201cNo Imbalance\u201d when there are no On-Close orders. Alternatively, the label IMB can be indicated by numerical values. For example Buy or Sell can be indicated by positive or negative values, and a Zero Imbalance and\/or No Imbalance can be indicated by a value of 0.","(3) Indicative Price Range (IPR)","The imbalance indicator includes an indicative price range for the closing price if the closing were to occur at the given time. The indicative closing price range is bounded on the far side (i.e., the top of the range) by the \u201cfar indicative closing price\u201d at which the MOC, LOC, and IO orders would execute if paired with each other (with no unpaired On-Close orders). The indicative closing price range is bounded on the near side (i.e., the bottom of the range) by the \u201cnear indicative closing price\u201d at which the MOC, LOC, IO and continuous orders (excluding volume that is available only by order delivery) would execute if paired with each other (with no unpaired On-Close orders). For either the near or far indicative closing price calculations, if the On-Close orders cannot be fully paired against offsetting orders, then no indicative closing price exists and the server system  disseminates a \u201cno indicative price\u201d indicator including the phrase \u201cmarket buy\u201d for a buy side imbalance or \u201cmarket sell\u201d for a sell side imbalance, and one or both of the near and far indicative closing prices are listed as zero. If there are no On-Close orders, the near and far indicative closing prices are listed as zero and the \u201cno indicative price\u201d indicator is blank.","(4) Price Variance Indicator (PVI)","The imbalance indicator includes a price variance indicator based on the percent by which the near indicative price varies from the inside bid, if the near indicative price is less than the inside bid, or from the inside offer, if the near indicative price is larger than the inside offer. If the near indicative price is between the inside bid and the inside offer (i.e., within the \u201cinside spread\u201d), then the price variance indicator is zero. The value of the price variance indicator is disseminated in coded form according to the codes listed in Table 1.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"147pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},"TABLE 1"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Code","Value"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"L","<1%\u2009\u2009"]},{"entry":[{},"1","1%"]},{"entry":[{},"2","2%"]},{"entry":[{},"3","3%"]},{"entry":[{},"4","4%"]},{"entry":[{},"5","5%"]},{"entry":[{},"6","6%"]},{"entry":[{},"7","7%"]},{"entry":[{},"8","8%"]},{"entry":[{},"9","9%"]},{"entry":[{},"A","10% to 19.99%"]},{"entry":[{},"B","20% to 29.99%"]},{"entry":[{},"C","30% or greater"]},{"entry":[{},"<space>","Not Calculated"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}},"br":{}},"The imbalance indicator includes the time (HH:MM:SS) when the Imbalance was calculated. The time corresponds to one of a series of times for dissemination of the imbalance indicator. At 3:50:00, the trading module  begins transmitting the order imbalance indicator over the data feed  (e.g., a Nasdaq TotalView\u00ae data feed, or an Application Programming Interface (API) data feed). The imbalance indicator is disseminated beginning at 3:50:00 and thereafter at more frequent intervals as the time to market close decreases: every 30 seconds beginning at 3:50, every 15 seconds beginning at 3:55, every 5 seconds beginning at 3:58, and every second from 3:59 until market close.","Imbalance Indicator Example","For example, at 3:59:00 p.m. the queue  for a security has the

determining the Paired Shares (PSH), the server system  temporarily re-prices (i.e., the queue  for the security stores the original price and a new price is stored in a temporary storage location in the storage module ) IO buy or sell orders that are priced more aggressively than the inside bid or offer, respectively (as described above). In this example, the IO sell order of 1000 shares at $19.98, priced more aggressively than the inside offer of $20.00, is temporarily re-priced to $20.00. The IO orders are potentially re-priced again at the next dissemination of the order imbalance indicator based on the inside bid and offer at the time.","The number of shares of On-Close buy orders MB that are marketable at or above the inside bid are 8,000 (at Market) and 3,000 (at $20.02) totaling 11,000 shares. The number of shares of sell closing orders PS that can be paired with those shares are 5,000 (at Market), 3,000 (at $19.98), and 2,000 (at $20.00; 1,000 of which correspond to the re-priced IO orders) totaling 10,000 shares. So the server system  is able to pair 10,000 shares (PSH) at the $20.00 inside offer, leaving a \u201cBuy\u201d (IMB) imbalance of 1,000 shares (ISH).","The server system  determines the far indicative closing price as the price at which the greatest number of shares of MOC, LOC, and IO orders can be paired with each other. In this example, 11,000 shares can be executed at a price of $20.02. So the far indicative closing price is $20.02","The server system  determines the near indicative closing price as the price at which the greatest number of MOC, LOC, IO and continuous orders can be paired with each other. In this example, for the near indicative closing price, 11,000 shares can be executed at a price of $20.01 or $20.02. The server system  selects the price that leaves the smallest number of unpaired shares, which in this case is $20.01, leaving 4,500 unpaired shares on the sell side. (A price of $20.02 would leave 8,500 unpaired shares on the sell side.) So the near indicative closing price is $20.01.","Closing Process","At or shortly after market close (e.g., at 4:00:00 p.m.) the trading module  performs a closing process . The closing process  determines  a closing price for each security based on the closing orders and continuous orders in the storage module  at the close. After determining the final closing price, the closing process  executes  some or all of those orders at the determined final closing price. After the closing process  concludes (e.g., at approximately 4:00:05 p.m.) the server system  reports the closing orders executed (e.g., in a report to the consolidated tape for Nasdaq securities including the aggregate of shares executed at the closing price) and after hours trading may commence. The closing process  attempts to accomplish three goals, for each security, in decreasing priority: (1) maximize the number of shares executed at the closing price; (2) minimize On-Close order imbalance; and (3) minimize the distance of the closing price from the 4:00:00 inside bid-offer midpoint.","Referring to , the closing process  determines  a final closing price for each security. The closing process  selects  a preliminary closing price that maximizes that number of shares executed. If more than one such price exists, the closing process  selects  a price that minimizes the On-Close order imbalance. If more than one such price exists, the closing process  selects  a price that is closest to the inside bid-offer midpoint at closing.","After selecting a preliminary closing price, the closing process  performs a benchmark threshold test to protect against unusual occurrences (e.g., the closing price discovery mechanism described herein did not function as expected). The closing process  compares  the preliminary closing price of each security to one or more benchmark values representing market conditions approximately five seconds prior to the close. For example, one benchmark value that can be used is the volume weighted average of the orders executed by the trading module  over the period from 3:59:55 to 4:00:00 (Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)). Optionally, the volume weighted average of the inside bid-offer midpoint over the period from 3:59:54 to 3:59:57 (Volume Weighted Average Inside (VWAI)) can be used as a second benchmark value.","If the preliminary closing price for a security is within a predetermined percentage (the \u201cThreshold Percentage\u201d) of the benchmark value (or of any of multiple benchmark values), the closing process  selects  the preliminary closing price as the final closing price for that security. The Threshold Percentage is selected, for example, based on market conditions and past results of the closing process . The server system  publicly publishes the Threshold Percentage (e.g., via the NasdaqTrader\u00ae website). Otherwise, if the preliminary closing price for a security is not within the Threshold Percentage of either the VWAI or the VWAP, the closing process  selects a final closing price for that security that is constrained to be within the Threshold Percentage of either benchmark according to the same three goals: (1) maximize the number of shares executed at the closing price; (2) minimize On-Close order imbalance; and (3) minimize the distance of the closing price from the 4:00:00 inside bid-offer midpoint. The closing process  selects  a closing price within the Threshold Percentage of either benchmark that maximizes that number of shares executed. If more than one such price exists, the closing process  selects  a price that minimizes the On-Close order imbalance. If more than one such price exists, the closing process  selects  a price that is closest to the inside bid-offer midpoint at closing. The closing process  executes  some or all of the orders for each security at the determined final closing price for that security.","Order Execution Priority","If, for a security, the closing process  executes fewer than all of the closing orders and all of the continuous orders that are available for automatic execution, then the closing process  executes orders in the following priority:","(1) MOC orders, with time as the secondary priority (older orders before newer orders);","(2) LOC orders, limit orders, IO orders, displayed quotes and reserve interest that are priced more aggressively than the final closing price, with time as the secondary priority;","(3) LOC orders, IO orders, displayed interest of limit orders, and displayed interest of quotes at the final closing price, with time as the secondary priority;","(4) Reserve interest at the Nasdaq Closing Cross price, with time as the secondary priority.","The remaining unexecuted closing orders for that security are canceled.","Closing Process Example","For example, the continuous and closing orders for a security include following orders at closing (i.e., 4:00:00 p.m.):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00006","num":"00006"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE
