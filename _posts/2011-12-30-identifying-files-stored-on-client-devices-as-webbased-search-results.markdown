title: Identifying files stored on client devices as web-based search results
abstract: Methods for leveraging a user's social network connections to search files stored on client devices are provided. Upon receipt of a search query, it is determined that the searching user is a social network connection of at least one user of a social networking application having files on their client device designated for sharing. Those designated files are searched to determine if any of them match the received search query. Client device files associated with users of the social networking application that have been designated for public sharing also are searched. Any files shared publicly or with social network connections of the sharing user that are stored on a client device and determined to match the received query may be presented to the searching user independent of the algorithmic search results or may be integrated into the algorithmic search results, as desired.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The Internet is an invaluable tool for users to both search and share information. Typically, users perform searches through search engines to find answers to queries, and users also share information online through social network connections. However, searching and sharing through social network connections usually occur, if at all, distinctly from each other, not leveraging the benefits of integrating functionality available in both.","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.","The present invention relates to systems, methods, and computer-readable storage media for, among other things, searching files stored on client devices that are designated for sharing, either publicly or with social network connections of the sharing user. Upon receipt of a search query, it is determined whether the searching user is a social network connection of any users of a social networking application having files on their respective client devices designated for sharing. If it is determined that the searching user has one or more social network connections that have client-device files designated for sharing, those designated files are searched to determine if any of them match the received search query. Client device files associated with users of the social networking application that have been designated for public sharing also are searched. Generally, searching of client-device files is done in addition to determining algorithmic search results. Any files shared publicly or with social network connections of the sharing user that are stored on a client device and determined to match the received query may be presented to the searching user independent of the algorithmic search results or may be integrated into the algorithmic search results, as desired. Thus, the searching and sharing functionality described herein provides an additional source for Web content and an improved way for sharing information by expanding the content that is searchable by a search engine to include shared client device files.","The subject matter of the present invention is described with specificity herein to meet statutory requirements. However, the description itself is not intended to limit the scope of this patent. Rather, the inventor has contemplated that the claimed subject matter might also be embodied in other ways, to include different steps or combinations of steps similar to the ones described in this document, in conjunction with other present or future technologies. Moreover, although the terms \u201cstep\u201d and\/or \u201cblock\u201d may be used herein to connote different elements of methods employed, the terms should not be interpreted as implying any particular order among or between various steps herein disclosed unless and except when the order of individual steps is explicitly described.","Various aspects of the technology described herein are generally directed to systems, methods, and computer-readable storage media for, among other things, searching files stored on client devices that are designated for sharing, either publicly or with social network connections of the sharing user. Upon receipt of a search query, it is determined whether the searching user is a social network connection of any users of a social networking application having files on their respective client devices designated for sharing. If it is determined that the searching user has one or more social network connections that have client-device files designated for sharing, those designated files are searched to determine if any of them match the received search query. Client device files associated with users of the social networking application that have been designated for public sharing also are searched. Generally, searching of client-device files is done in addition to determining algorithmic search results. Any files shared publicly or with social network connections of the sharing user that are stored on a client device and determined to match the received query may be presented to the searching user independent of the algorithmic search results or may be integrated into the algorithmic search results, as desired. Thus, the searching and sharing functionality described herein provides an additional source for Web content and an improved way for sharing information by expanding the content that is searchable by a search engine to include shared client device files.","Accordingly, computer-readable storage media storing computer-usable instructions that, when used by one or more computing devices, cause the one or more computing devices to perform a method for identifying, as search results, files stored on client devices that are designated for sharing are described. The method includes receiving a search query from a searching user and determining that the searching user is a social network connection of at least one sharing user, the social network connection being designated via a social networking application. The at least one sharing user has designated one or more files for sharing with his or her social network connections and the one or more files are stored on a client device associated with the sharing user. The method further includes identifying at least one of the one or more files as matching the received search query.","A system for identifying, as search results, files stored on client devices that are designated for sharing is also described. The system includes a computing device associated with a file service having one or more processors and one or more computer-readable storage media and a data store coupled with the file service, the data store being external to the client device. The file service receives a search query from a searching user and determines that the searching user is a social network connection of at least one sharing user, the social network connection being designated via a social networking application. The at least one sharing user has designated one or more files for sharing with his or her social network connections. The one or more files are stored concurrently on a client device associated with the sharing user and in association with the data store in such a way that changes made to the one or more files at the client device are stored in association with both the client device and the external data store. The file service additional determines that one or more client device files associated with users of the social networking application are designated for public sharing. The file service further identifies at least one file of the one or more files and\/or the one or more client device files as matching the received search query.","Also described is a method for rendering files stored on a client device associated with a sharing user searchable to at least a portion of users of a social networking application. The method includes receiving selection of at least one file stored on the client device associated with the sharing user, receiving a user indication to associate the at least one file stored on the client device with at least one social network connection of the sharing user, and uploading the at least one file to a data store external to the client device and accessible by the social networking application.","Having briefly described an overview of various aspects described herein, an exemplary operating environment for implementation is described below in order to provide a general context for the various aspects. Referring to the figures in general and initially to  in particular, an exemplary operating environment is shown and designated generally as computing device . The computing device  is but one example of a suitable computing environment and is not intended to suggest any limitation as to the scope of use or functionality of the invention.

Upon receipt of a search query, it is determined whether the searching user is a social network connection of any users of a social networking application having files on their respective client devices designated for sharing. If it is determined that the searching user has one or more social network connections that have client-device files designated for sharing, those designated files are searched to determine if any of them match the received search query. Client device files associated with users of the social networking application that have been designated for public sharing also are searched. Generally, searching of client-device files is done in addition to determining algorithmic search results. Any files shared publicly or with social network connections of the sharing user that are stored on a client device and determined to match the received query may be presented to the searching user independent of the algorithmic search results or may be integrated into the algorithmic search results, as desired.","Turning now to , an exemplary computing environment  is depicted for use in searching and sharing files stored on client devices based on social network connections. The computing system environment  is merely an example of one suitable computing system environment and is not intended to suggest any limitation as to the scope of use or functionality of various aspects of the present invention. Neither should the computing system environment  be interpreted as having any dependency or requirement related to any single module\/component or combination of modules\/components illustrated therein.","The computing system environment  generally includes a client computing device , a social networking application , a data store , and a file service  all in communication with one another via a network . The network  may include, without limitation, one or more local area networks (LANs) and\/or wide area networks (WANs). Such networking environments are commonplace in offices, enterprise-wide computer networks, intranets and the Internet. Accordingly, the network  is not further described herein.","One or more of the illustrated components\/modules may be implemented as stand-alone applications. One or more of the illustrated components\/modules may be integrated directly into, for example, the operating system of the client computing device  or the file service . The components\/modules illustrated in  are exemplary in nature and in number and should not be construed as limiting. Any number of components\/modules may be employed to achieve the desired functionality within the scope hereof. Further, components\/modules may be located on any number of servers. By way of example only, the file service  might reside on a server, cluster of servers, or a computing device remote from one or more of the remaining components.","It should be understood that this and other arrangements described herein are set forth only as examples. Other arrangements and elements (e.g., machines, interfaces, functions, orders, and groupings of functions, etc.) can be used in addition to or instead of those shown, and some elements may be omitted altogether. Further, many of the elements described herein are functional entities that may be implemented as discrete or distributed components or in conjunction with other components\/modules, and in any suitable combination and location. Various functions described herein as being performed by one or more entities may be carried out by hardware, firmware, and\/or software. For instance, various functions may be carried out by a processor executing instructions stored in memory.","The client computing device  may include any type of computing device, such as the computing device  described with reference to , for example. By way of example only and not limitation, the client computing device  may be a personal computer, desktop computer, laptop computer, handheld device, mobile handset, consumer electronic device, or the like. It should be noted, however, that the systems and method described herein are not limited to implementation on such computing devices, but may be implemented on any of a variety of different types of computing devices within the scope of hereof.","A user may be associated with a client computing device  as a searching user or sharing user. A sharing user is a user that uses the client computing device  in any way to share files stored in association therewith other users based upon social network connections. For instance, a user may be associated with a personal computer (PC) when the user uses the PC to share files stored on the desktop thereof with at least one other user based upon social network connections. A searching user, on the other hand, is a user that utilizes one client computing device to search files stored, at least in part, in association with another client computing device by inputting a search query, generally into a user interface presented on a screen associated with the requesting client device. A user (searching or sharing) may be associated with a plurality of client devices.","Generally, the client computing device  includes a browser  and a display . The browser , among other things, is configured to render search engine home pages, social networking applications, search results pages, and file upload interfaces in association with the display  of the client computing device . The browser  is further configured to receive user search queries and user selection of files to be uploaded to a data store. Generally the search query input and user file selections are received via one or more user interfaces presented on the display . The browser  is also configured to receive content for presentation on the display , for instance, from the file service . It should be noted that the functionality described herein as being performed by the browser  may be performed by any other application capable of rendering Web content. Any such variations, and any combination thereof, are contemplated to be within the scope hereof.","The social networking application  is configured to facilitate electronic social networking between its users. In this regard, the social networking application  is configured to receive information about a user and maintain such information, for instance, in a social networking data store  associated with the social networking application . This information may be received through the social networking application  from a user associated with the client device . The social networking application  may be further configured to receive search queries to search information in the social networking data store  and to receive, through an upload interface, a user selection of files to be uploaded to the social networking data store .","The social networking application  is configured to permit its users to establish social network connections with other application users. In this way, a user may be connected to another user by a first degree connection (e.g., a \u201cfriend\u201d) meaning that the two users are directly connected with one another. Or, a user may not be directly connected with another user but have a second degree connection (e.g., a \u201cfriend of a friend\u201d) or more remote connection with that user through his\/her first degree connections. A user may also be connected to another user through a group of which both users are members (e.g., \u201cFans of FIFA 2012\u201d).","The data store  is configured to store information for use by one or both of the social networking application  and the file service . Such information may include, without limitation, client-device files of one or more sharing users that have been designated for sharing with social network connections of the respective sharing users, information about social network connections of users of the social networking application , and access permission designations (more fully described below). Files stored on the client device  may be concurrently stored in association with the data store . It will be understood and appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that the information stored in association with the client device  may be configurable in such a way that changes made to the files at the client device  are stored in association with both the client device  and the data store . The files stored in association with the data store  are automatically updated upon the sharing user logging into the client device  on which the files are stored. Pre-determined periodic file updates also may take place. Any such variations, and any combination thereof, are contemplated to be within the scope hereof.","As previously set forth, the data store  is configured to store information about social network connections of users of the social networking application . Such information may include, without limitation, social networking identifiers (e.g., the identity of one or more social networks to which a user belongs, the name of a user's profile page or pages, and a location of a social network's users), social network connections (for instance, member identifiers, groups to which the members respectively belong, and first degree connections of social networking application members, as well as those that are more distant or remote) and user sharing information (e.g., information about whether or not a user has one or more client-device files designated for sharing, types of client devices, and a list of client devices sharing files). It will be understood and appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that the information stored in association with the data store  may be configurable and may include any information relevant to social networking identifiers, social network connections, and user sharing information. The information stored in association with the data store  is configured to be searchable for one or more of the items stored in association therewith.","The content and volume of such information are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention in any way. Further, though illustrated as a single, independent component, the data store  may, in fact, be a plurality of storage devices, for instance a database cluster, portions of which may reside in association with the file service , the social networking application , the client computing device , another external computing device (not shown), and\/or any combination thereof.","The computing system environment  is merely exemplary. While the file service  is illustrated as a single unit, it will be appreciated that the file service  is scalable. For example, the file service  may in actuality include a plurality of computing devices in communication with one another. Moreover, the data store , or portions thereof, may be included within, for instance, the file service  as a computer-storage medium. The single unit depictions are meant for clarity, not to limit the scope hereof.","The file service  is configured to receive and respond to search queries that it receives from components associated with client computing devices, for instance, the browser  associated with the client computing device . Those skilled in the art of the present invention will recognize that aspects of the present invention may be implemented with any number of searching engines or uploading tools. For example, an Internet search engine or a Web upload tool may utilize aspects of the present invention. These search engines and upload tools are well known in the art, and commercially available engines and tools share many similar processes not further described herein.","As shown, the file service  includes a query receiving component , a social connection component , a results component , a permissions component , a rating component , a file receiving component , an Application Programming Interface (API) component , and an uploading component .","The query receiving component  is configured to receive (for instance, via the network ) a search query from a searching user for files that match an input search query. Typically, such a request is received via a browser associated with a client computing device, for instance, the browser  associated with the client computing device . The query receiving component  may receive the search query either from a social networking application  or from a search engine (not shown). The searching user may or may not be engaged in an active session. This is discussed in more detailed below.","Upon receiving a search query, the social connection component  is configured to determine if the searching user is a social network connection of at least one sharing user. Thus, the social connection component  is configured to identify, by querying the data store , sharing users that have designated one or more files stored in association with a client device for sharing with social network connections and to identify social network connections of the sharing users. If the searching user is connected with one or more sharing users through a social network connection, then files designated for sharing may be searched to determine if one or more match the input search query. By way of example, a particular sharing user may share a document stored on the desktop of a client device associated with the sharing user (e.g., \u201cFIFA 12 Cheats and Tips.doc\u201d) with all the members of a social networking application to whom s\/he is connected through a particular group designation (e.g., members of group \u201cFans of FIFA 2012\u201d). If the searching user is a social network connection of the sharing user and the searching user is a member of the \u201cFans of FIFA 2012,\u201d then the file may be searched to determine if it matches the input search query. If, however, the searching user is either not a social network connection of the sharing user or is a social network connection of the sharing user but is not a member of the \u201cFans of FIFA 2012,\u201d the document may not be searched to determine if it matches the input search query.","The social connection component may be associated with a social network application (e.g. social network application ) which may also include information on sharing users that have designated one or more files stored in association with a client device for sharing with social network connections and social network connections of the sharing users (e.g., in social networking data store ). In such instances, rather than identifying information by querying the data store , such information may be garnered by querying the social networking data store  associated with the social networking application . Any such variations, and any combination thereof, are contemplated to be within the scope hereof.","The social connection component  is configured to determine searchable files stored on client devices whether or not the searching user is engaged in an active session with the social networking application . That is, a searching user may be engaged with the social networking application by having a browser window actively logged into the social networking application . A user may also be engaged with the social networking application even without having an active window if s\/he has opted in a previous active session with the social networking application to stay logged into the service even upon closure of the browser. The user also may login to the social networking application using a social networking identifier associated with the user. Any of such variations, and any combination thereof, are contemplated to be within the scope hereof. Whichever way the user establishes engagement with the social networking application, being engaged permits the file service  to access information about the user's social network connections. The social connection component  is further configured to receive the user's social networking identification from the social networking application .","By way of example only, the exemplary social networking application FACEBOOK, INC. of Palo Alto, Calif. employs an \u201cinstant personalization\u201d functionality that enables users of FACEBOOK, INC. to log onto third party websites (e.g., the file service ) with their FACEBOOK identity and access their FACEBOOK identity information from the context of the third party website.","If the searching user is not engaged with the social networking application , the social connection component  may still be configured to search the data store  and determine sharing users having one or more files designated for sharing with everyone\u2014irrespective of social network connection status. For instance, a sharing user may make one or more files stored in association with a client device searchable by everyone (e.g., a group \u201cPublic\u201d). As a result the social network connection would be designated as \u201cPublic.\u201d Thus, the social connection component designates all files shared through a \u201cPublic\u201d social network connection as searchable in response to an input search query.","The results component  is configured to identify one or more files stored on a client device that have been designated by a sharing user for sharing with his or her social network connections that match an input search query. In this regard, the input to the results component  is the search query received (e.g., by the query receiving component ) and the output is a listing of client-device, shared documents (files) that are determined to match the query. Algorithms for identifying search results are known to those of ordinary skill the art and, accordingly, are not further described herein. The results component  further is configured to transmit the files (or descriptors of the files and\/or links thereto) that match the input search query for presentation (e.g., on the display  associated with the client computing device ). Such transmission may be conditioned upon the identified matching files passing through the permissions component , described below.","The permissions component  is configured to determine those matching documents\/files that have been designated by a sharing user for sharing with his or her social network connections that the searching user has permission to access. Such determination may be based upon at least one access permission designation. For instance, a file \u201cFIFA 12 Tips and Cheats.doc\u201d may have the permission \u201cread\/execute\u201d to give the searching user access to the file. Thus, the input to the permissions component  is the results from the results component  and the output is list of files with permissions that allow the searching user access to the files. Types of file permissions and the configuration of file permissions are known to those of ordinary skill in the art and, accordingly, are not further described herein.","The rating component  is a service that is configured to assign a rating to search results that, among other things, allows the results to be ordered in a particular fashion upon presentation (e.g., on the display  associated with the client computing device ). Document ratings may be based on any number of factors including, without limitation, relevance to the search query, number of times the document has been viewed, user-provided ratings of the document, and the like.","In addition to receiving and responding to search queries, the file service  is configured to receive client-device files designated for sharing with social network connections of a sharing user. In this regard, the file receiving component  is configured to receive files associated with a client device (e.g., the client computing device ) that the sharing user has selected for uploading to the data store  (that is, that the sharing user has designated for sharing with at least a portion of his or her social network connections). Typically, the user makes the selection via an upload interface rendered through a browser associated with a search engine home page (not shown) or the social networking application .","The API component  is configured to receive a user indication to associate at least one social network connection with files selected for uploading and received by the file receiving component , where the social network connection is associated with a social networking application. A social network connection is typically associated with a social networking application if the social network connection is available within the application to facilitate communication between users in the application. (e.g., the social network connection \u201cfriend\u201d is associated with FACEBOOK).","The API component  may make a call to an API associated with the social networking data store and retrieves social networking information there from. Such social networking information may include, without limitation, the identity of a social networking application (e.g., FACEBOOK, TWITTER, LINKEDIN) and information associated with the social networking application, for instance, types of social network connections (e.g., friend, Fans of FIFA 2012, Public) and permissions (e.g. read\/execute, full control). The retrieved information may be from a plurality of social networking applications. For instance, the user may select FACEBOOK as the social networking application with the connection \u201cfriend\u201d to associate with a file, and then select, TWITTER, and members of group \u201cFans of FIFA 12\u201d to associate with the same file.","The API component  is further configured receive a user indication to associate access permissions for files identified for sharing. For instance, the file \u201cFIFA 12 Tips and Cheats.doc\u201d may be associated with the social network connection \u201cFans of FIFA 2012,\u201d with the permission to read\/execute and to be shared with social network connections designated via FACEBOOK. Note that any shared file may be associated with a plurality of social networking applications, social network connections, and access permissions.","The upload component  is configured to receive files associated with a social network connection and permissions (e.g. by the API component ) and upload the files to the data store . Files uploaded to the data store  may be stored in association with the client device and concurrently stored in association with the data store  in such a way that any changes made to the files at the client device are stored in association with the file instance in the data store  as well. The uploading component  is further configured to gather and update user sharing information. Typically user client sharing information includes information about whether or not a user is sharing, types of client devices, and a list of client devices sharing files which are all updated in the social networking data stored based on new information. It will be understood and appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that the uploading component  can retrieve and upload user client information stored in association with the data store .","With reference now to , a flow diagram is illustrated showing an exemplary method  for identifying search results based on searching users' social network connections designated via a social networking application. As indicated at block , a search query is received from a searching user. This may be received, for example, by the query receiving component  via a search query input field of a search engine or a social networking application user interface associated with the file service  of . As indicated at block , it is determined that the searching user is a social network connection of at least one sharing user that has designated one or more client-device files for sharing with his or her social network connections. At block  at least one client-device file that has been designated for sharing by a social network connection of the searching user and that matches the received query is identified.","With reference now to , a flow diagram is illustrated showing an exemplary method  for rendering files stored on a client device associated with a sharing user searchable to at least a portion of the sharing user's social network connections designated via a social networking application. As indicated at block , a user selection of at least one file stored on the client device associated with the sharing user is received. This may be received by, for example, by the file receiving component  of  via an upload interface rendered through a browser on either a search engine homepage or a social networking application associated with the file service  of .","As indicated in block  a user indication to associate the at least one file stored on the client device with at least one of the sharing user's social network connections is received (e.g., utilizing the API component ). This may be done, for example, by having the API component call the social networking data store  of  to retrieve social networking information. For instance, the user indication may be a check mark signifying whether to allow or deny associating the at least one social network connection with the at least one file. As described herein above, a file may be associated with a plurality of social network connections and social networking applications. At block  at user indication to associate the at least one file with at least one access permission is received.
