A discussion of prodrugs is provided in T. Higuchi and V. Stella, -(1987) 14 of the A.C.S. Symposium Series, and in , (1987) Edward B. Roche, ed., American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press. The term \u201cprodrug\u201d means a compound (e.g., a drug precursor) that is transformed in vivo to yield a compound of Formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate or solvate of the compound. The transformation may occur by various mechanisms (e.g., by metabolic or chemical processes), such as, for example, through hydrolysis in blood. A discussion of the use of prodrugs is provided by T. Higuchi and W. Stella, \u201cPro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems,\u201d Vol. 14 of the A.C.S. Symposium Series, and in Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design, ed. Edward B. Roche, American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press, 1987.","For example, if a compound of Formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate or solvate of the compound contains a carboxylic acid functional group, a prodrug can comprise an ester formed by the replacement of the hydrogen atom of the acid group with a group such as, for example, (C-C)alkyl, (C-C)alkanoyloxymethyl, 1-(alkanoyloxy)ethyl having from 4 to 9 carbon atoms, 1-methyl-1-(alkanoyloxy)-ethyl having from 5 to 10 carbon atoms, alkoxycarbonyloxymethyl having from 3 to 6 carbon atoms, 1-(alkoxycarbonyloxy)ethyl having from 4 to 7 carbon atoms, 1-methyl-1-(alkoxycarbonyloxy)ethyl having from 5 to 8 carbon atoms, N-(alkoxycarbonyl)aminomethyl having from 3 to 9 carbon atoms, 1-(N-(alkoxycarbonyl)amino)ethyl having from 4 to 10 carbon atoms, 3-phthalidyl, 4-crotonolactonyl, gamma-butyrolacton-4-yl, di-N,N-(C-C)alkylamino(C-C)alkyl (such as \u03b2-dimethylaminoethyl), carbamoyl-(C-C)alkyl, N,N-di(C-C)alkylcarbamoyl-(C1-C2)alkyl and piperidino-, pyrrolidino- or morpholino(C-C)alkyl, and the like.","Similarly, if a compound of Formula (I) contains an alcohol functional group, a prodrug can be formed by the replacement of the hydrogen atom of the alcohol group with a group such as, for example, (C-C)alkanoyloxymethyl, 1-((C-C)alkanoyloxy)ethyl, 1-methyl-1-((C-C)alkanoyloxy)ethyl, (C-C)alkoxycarbonyloxymethyl, N\u2014(C-C)alkoxycarbonylaminomethyl, succinoyl, (C-C)alkanoyl, \u03b1-amino(C-C)alkanyl, arylacyl and \u03b1-aminoacyl, or \u03b1-aminoacyl-\u03b1-aminoacyl, where each \u03b1-aminoacyl group is independently selected from the naturally occurring L-amino acids, P(O)(OH), \u2014P(O)(O(C-C)alkyl)or glycosyl (the radical resulting from the removal of a hydroxyl group of the hemiacetal form of a carbohydrate), and the like.","If a compound of Formula (I) incorporates an amine functional group, a prodrug can be formed by the replacement of a hydrogen atom in the amine group with a group such as, for example, R-carbonyl, RO-carbonyl, NRR\u2032-carbonyl where R and R\u2032 are each independently (C-C)alkyl, (C-C) cycloalkyl, benzyl, or R-carbonyl is a natural \u03b1-aminoacyl or natural \u03b1-aminoacyl, \u2014C(OH)C(O)OYwherein Yis H, (C-C)alkyl or benzyl, \u2014C(OY)Ywherein Yis (C-C) alkyl and Yis (C-C)alkyl, carboxy(C-C)alkyl, amino(C-C)alkyl or mono-N\u2014 or di-N,N\u2014(C-C)alkylaminoalkyl, \u2014C(Y)Ywherein Yis H or methyl and Yis mono-N\u2014 or di-N,N\u2014(C-C)alkylamino morpholino, piperidin-1-yl or pyrrolidin-1-yl, and the like.","One or more compounds of the invention may exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol, and the like, and it is intended that the invention embrace both solvated and unsolvated forms. \u201cSolvate\u201d means a physical association of a compound of this invention with one or more solvent molecules. This physical association involves varying degrees of ionic and covalent bonding, including hydrogen bonding. In certain instances the solvate will be capable of isolation, for example when one or more solvent molecules are incorporated in the crystal lattice of the crystalline solid. \u201cSolvate\u201d encompasses both solution-phase and isolatable solvates. Non-limiting examples of suitable solvates include ethanolates, methanolates, and the like. \u201cHydrate\u201d is a solvate wherein the solvent molecule is HO.","One or more compounds of the invention may optionally be converted to a solvate. Preparation of solvates is generally known. Thus, for example, M. Caira et al., 93(3), 601-611 (2004) describe the preparation of the solvates of the antifungal fluconazole in ethyl acetate as well as from water. Similar preparations of solvates, hemisolvate, hydrates and the like are described by E. C. van Tonder et al, 5(1), article 12 (2004); and A. L. Bingham et al, 603-604 (2001). A typical, non-limiting, process involves dissolving the inventive compound in desired amounts of the desired solvent (organic or water or mixtures thereof) at a higher than ambient temperature, and cooling the solution at a rate sufficient to form crystals which are then isolated by standard methods. Analytical techniques such as, for example I. R. spectroscopy, show the presence of the solvent (or water) in the crystals as a solvate (or hydrate).","\u201cEffective amount\u201d or \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d is meant to describe an amount of compound or a composition of the present invention effective in inhibiting the above-noted diseases and thus producing the desired therapeutic, ameliorative, inhibitory or preventative effect.","The compounds of Formula I can form salts which are also within the scope of this invention. Reference to a compound of Formula I herein is understood to include reference to salts thereof, unless otherwise indicated. The term \u201csalt(s)\u201d, as employed herein, denotes acidic salts formed with inorganic and\/or organic acids, as well as basic salts formed with inorganic and\/or organic bases. In addition, when a compound of Formula I contains both a basic moiety, such as, but not limited to a pyridine or imidazole, and an acidic moiety, such as, but not limited to a carboxylic acid, zwitterions (\u201cinner salts\u201d) may be formed and are included within the term \u201csalt(s)\u201d as used herein. Pharmaceutically acceptable (i.e., non-toxic, physiologically acceptable) salts are preferred, although other salts are also useful. Salts of the compounds of the Formula I may be formed, for example, by reacting a compound of Formula I with an amount of acid or base, such as an equivalent amount, in a medium such as one in which the salt precipitates or in an aqueous medium followed by lyophilization.","Exemplary acid addition salts include acetates, ascorbates, benzoates, benzenesulfonates, bisulfates, borates, butyrates, citrates, camphorates, camphorsulfonates, fumarates, hydrochlorides, hydrobromides, hydroiodides, lactates, maleates, methanesulfonates, naphthalenesulfonates, nitrates, oxalates, phosphates, propionates, salicylates, succinates, sulfates, tartarates, thiocyanates, toluenesulfonates (also known as tosylates,) and the like. Additionally, acids which are generally considered suitable for the formation of pharmaceutically useful salts from basic pharmaceutical compounds are discussed, for example, by P. Stahl et al, Camille G. (eds.) . (2002) Zurich: Wiley-VCH; S. Berge et al, (1977) 66(1) 1-19; P. Gould, (1986) 33 201-217; Anderson et al, (1996), Academic Press, New York; and in (Food & Drug Administration, Washington, D.C. on their website). These disclosures are incorporated herein by reference thereto.","Exemplary basic salts include ammonium salts, alkali metal salts such as sodium, lithium, and potassium salts, alkaline earth metal salts such as calcium and magnesium salts, salts with organic bases (for example, organic amines) such as dicyclohexylamines, t-butyl amines, and salts with amino acids such as arginine, lysine and the like. Basic nitrogen-containing groups may be quarternized with agents such as lower alkyl halides (e.g. methyl, ethyl, and butyl chlorides, bromides and iodides), dialkyl sulfates (e.g. dimethyl, diethyl, and dibutyl sulfates), long chain halides (e.g. decyl, lauryl, and stearyl chlorides, bromides and iodides), aralkyl halides (e.g. benzyl and phenethyl bromides), and others.","All such acid salts and base salts are intended to be pharmaceutically acceptable salts within the scope of the invention and all acid and base salts are considered equivalent to the free forms of the corresponding compounds for purposes of the invention.","Pharmaceutically acceptable esters of the present compounds include the following groups: (1) carboxylic acid esters obtained by esterification of the hydroxy groups, in which the non-carbonyl moiety of the carboxylic acid portion of the ester grouping is selected from straight or branched chain alkyl (for example, acetyl, n-propyl, t-butyl, or n-butyl), alkoxyalkyl (for example, methoxymethyl), aralkyl (for example, benzyl), aryloxyalkyl (for example, phenoxymethyl), aryl (for example, phenyl optionally substituted with, for example, halogen, Calkyl, or Calkoxy or amino); (2) sulfonate esters, such as alkyl- or aralkylsulfonyl (for example, methanesulfonyl); (3) amino acid esters (for example, L-valyl or L-isoleucyl); (4) phosphonate esters and (5) mono-, di- or triphosphate esters. The phosphate esters may be further esterified by, for example, a Calcohol or reactive derivative thereof, or by a 2,3-di(C)acyl glycerol.","Compounds of Formula I, and salts, solvates, esters and prodrugs thereof, may exist in their tautomeric form (for example, as an amide or imino ether). All such tautomeric forms are contemplated herein as part of the present invention.","The compounds of Formula (I) may contain asymmetric or chiral centers, and, therefore, exist in different stereoisomeric forms. It is intended that all stereoisomeric forms of the compounds of Formula (I) as well as mixtures thereof, including racemic mixtures, form part of the present invention. In addition, the present invention embraces all geometric and positional isomers. For example, if a compound of Formula (I) incorporates a double bond or a fused ring, both the cis- and trans-forms, as well as mixtures, are embraced within the scope of the invention.","Diastereomeric mixtures can be separated into their individual diastereomers on the basis of their physical chemical differences by methods well known to those skilled in the art, such as, for example, by chromatography and\/or fractional crystallization. Enantiomers can be separated by converting the enantiomeric mixture into a diastereomeric mixture by reaction with an appropriate optically active compound (e.g., chiral auxiliary such as a chiral alcohol or Mosher's acid chloride), separating the diastereomers and converting (e.g., hydrolyzing) the individual diastereomers to the corresponding pure enantiomers. Also, some of the compounds of Formula (I) may be atropisomers (e.g., substituted biaryls) and are considered as part of this invention. Enantiomers can also be separated by use of chiral HPLC column.","It is also possible that the compounds of Formula (I) may exist in different tautomeric forms, and all such forms are embraced within the scope of the invention. Also, for example, all keto-enol and imine-enamine forms of the compounds are included in the invention.","All stereoisomers (for example, geometric isomers, optical isomers and the like) of the present compounds (including those of the salts, solvates, esters and prodrugs of the compounds as well as the salts, solvates and esters of the prodrugs), such as those which may exist due to asymmetric carbons on various substituents, including enantiomeric forms (which may exist even in the absence of asymmetric carbons), rotameric forms, atropisomers, and diastereomeric forms, are contemplated within the scope of this invention, as are positional isomers (such as, for example, 4-pyridyl and 3-pyridyl). (For example, if a compound of Formula (I) incorporates a double bond or a fused ring, both the cis- and trans-forms, as well as mixtures, are embraced within the scope of the invention. Also, for example, all keto-enol and imine-enamine forms of the compounds are included in the invention.).","Individual stereoisomers of the compounds of the invention may, for example, be substantially free of other isomers, or may be admixed, for example, as racemates or with all other, or other selected, stereoisomers. The chiral centers of the present invention can have the S or R configuration as defined by the 1974 Recommendations. The use of the terms \u201csalt\u201d, \u201csolvate\u201d, \u201cester\u201d, \u201cprodrug\u201d and the like, is intended to equally apply to the salt, solvate, ester and prod rug of enantiomers, stereoisomers, rotamers, tautomers, positional isomers, racemates or prodrugs of the inventive compounds.","The present invention also embraces isotopically-labelled compounds of the present invention which are identical to those recited herein, but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, fluorine and chlorine, such as H, H, C, C, N, O, O, P, P, S, F, and Cl, respectively.","Certain isotopically-labelled compounds of Formula (I) (e.g., those labeled with H and C) are useful in compound and\/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated (i.e., H) and carbon-14 (i.e., C) isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium (i.e., H) may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability (e.g., increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements) and hence may be preferred in some circumstances. Isotopically labelled compounds of Formula (I) can generally be prepared by following procedures analogous to those disclosed in the Schemes and\/or in the Examples hereinbelow, by substituting an appropriate isotopically labelled reagent for a non-isotopically labelled reagent.","Polymorphic forms of the compounds of Formula I, and of the salts, solvates, esters and prodrugs of the compounds of Formula I, are intended to be included in the present invention.","The term \u201cpharmaceutical composition\u201d is also intended to encompass both the bulk composition and individual dosage units comprised of more than one (e.g., two) pharmaceutically active agents such as, for example, a compound of the present invention and an additional agent selected from the lists of the additional agents described herein, along with any pharmaceutically inactive excipients. The bulk composition and each individual dosage unit can contain fixed amounts of the afore-said \u201cmore than one pharmaceutically active agents\u201d. The bulk composition is material that has not yet been formed into individual dosage units. An illustrative dosage unit is an oral dosage unit such as tablets, pills and the like. Similarly, the herein-described method of treating a patient by administering a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention is also intended to encompass the administration of the afore-said bulk composition and individual dosage units.","The compounds of Formula (I), or pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, or esters thereof according to the invention have pharmacological properties; in particular, the compounds of Formula (I) can be nicotinic acid receptor agonists.","The compounds of Formula (I) of the present invention, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, or esters thereof are useful in treating diseases or conditions including dyslipidemia and metabolic syndrome.","The compounds of Formula (I), or pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, or esters thereof, can be administered in any suitable form, e.g., alone, or in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, excipient or diluent in a pharmaceutical composition, according to standard pharmaceutical practice. The compounds of Formula (I), or pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, or esters thereof, can be administered orally or parenterally, including intravenous, intramuscular, interperitoneal, subcutaneous, rectal, or topical routes of administration, or if so selected, by a combination of one or more of the above-shown methods.","Pharmaceutical compositions comprising at least one compound of Formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, ester, or tautomer thereof can be in a form suitable for oral administration, e.g., as tablets, troches, capsules, lozenges, aqueous or oily suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsions, syrups, or elixirs. Oral compositions may be prepared by any conventional pharmaceutical method, and may also contain sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents, and preserving agents.","The amount of compound of Formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, ester, or tautomer thereof, administered to a patient can be determined by a physician based on the age, weight, and response of the patient, as well as by the severity of the condition treated. For example, the amount of compound of Formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, ester, or tautomer thereof, administered to the patient can range from about 0.1 mg\/kg body weight per day to about 60 mg\/kg\/d, preferably about 0.5 mg\/kg\/d to about 40 mg\/kg\/d.","The compounds of Formula (I), or pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, or esters thereof, can also be administered in combination with other therapeutic agents.

of the inventive compounds was determined by following the inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation in cells using the MesoScale Discovery cAMP detection kit following the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells expressing recombinant human nicotinic acid receptor (NAR) were harvested enzymatically, washed 1\u00d7 in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and resuspended in PBS containing 0.5 mM IBMX at 3\u00d710cells\/mL. Ten \u03bcL of cell suspension was added to each well of a 384-well plate which contained 10 \u03bcL of test compounds. Test compounds were diluted with PBS containing 6 \u03bcM of forskolin. Plates were incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature after the addition of cells. Lysis buffer containing cAMP-Tag was added to each well (10 \u03bcL\/well) as per the manufacturer's protocol. Plates were then incubated from 45 minutes to overnight. Prior to reading, 10 \u03bcL of read buffer was added to each well, and the plate was read in a Sector 6000 plate imager. The signal was converted to cAMP concentration using a standard curve run on each plate. Compound ECvalues were determined from concentration gradients of test compounds.","Compounds of Formula (I) of the present invention, and salts, solvates, or esters thereof, have cAMP ECvalues of less than about 10,000 nM, preferably about 1000 nM or less, more preferably about 500 nM or less, even more preferably about 100 nM or less.","Examples 1, 5, 10, 29, 39, 71, 101-116, and 118-135 have cAMP ECvalues of 100 nM or less.","The activity of selected illustrative compounds of the invention as determined using the above-described assay is presented in the following
