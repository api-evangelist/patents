In particular, the invention provides novel small molecules and methods of use of those molecules for controlling bacterial growth and pathogenesis.","Quorum sensing is a process of bacterial cell-cell communication that involves production and detection of secreted signaling molecules called autoinducers (AI). Quorum sensing allows bacteria to collectively regulate gene expression and thereby function as multi-cellular organisms. For example, the bioluminescent Gram-negative quorum-sensing bacterium integrates information from three different diffusible autoinducers that together enable intra- and inter-species communication. The three autoinducers are AI-1 (3-hydroxybutanoyl homoserine lactone), AI-2 ((2S,4S)-2-methyl-2,3,3,4-tetrahydroxytetrahydrofuran-borate), and CAI-1 ((S)-3-hydroxytridecan-4-one). These signals are detected by the sensor-kinase proteins, LuxN, LuxQ, and CqsS, respectively () (Henke, J. M., and Bassler, B. L. (2004b). J Bacteriol 186, 6902-6914). At low cell density, (i.e., in the absence of autoinducers), these sensor kinases autophosphorylate and transfer phosphate to the shared phospho-transfer protein, LuxU. LuxU transfers the phosphoryl-group to the DNA-binding response regulator, LuxO, which activates transcription of genes encoding five redundant small regulatory RNAs called the quorum regulatory RNAs (Qrrs) (). The Qrrs destabilize the mRNA transcript encoding the master quorum-sensing regulator, LuxR. Therefore, under low-cell-density conditions, the bacteria do not display quorum-sensing behaviors. In contrast, at high cell density the three autoinducers accumulate and bind to their cognate receptors. These binding events switch the receptors to phosphatases, resulting in dephosphorylation of LuxO and termination of Qrr production. The luxR transcript is stabilized, leading to LuxR protein production (). LuxR controls the genes in quorum sensing, e.g., genes required for bioluminescence, siderophore production, type III secretion, and metalloprotease production (Fuqua, C., Winans, S. C., and Greenberg, E. P. (1996). Annu Rev Microbiol 50, 727-751; Hammer, B. K., and Bassler, B. L. (2003). Mol Microbiol 50, 101-104; Henke, J. M., and Bassler, B. L. (2004a).

M., and Bassler, B. L. (2005). Annu Rev Cell Dev Biol 21, 319-346).","AI-1 is an acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) type autoinducer and it is the strongest of the three signals and, thus, the major input controlling quorum-sensing-regulated behaviors. Typically, AHL autoinducers are detected by cytoplasmic LuxR-type transcriptional activators (note: these LuxR-type proteins are unrelated to LuxR, ). is unusual because all three of its autoinducers, including AI-1, are detected by membrane-bound sensor-kinase proteins (in the case of AI-2, however, an additional periplasmic binding protein LuxP is required in conjunction with the membrane-bound two-component protein LuxQ). AI-1 is also the defining member of a growing family of recognized AHL type autoinducers that interact with membrane-bound sensor-kinases like LuxN, rather than with cytosolic LuxR-type proteins (Freeman, J. A., et al. (2000). Mol Microbiol 35, 139-149; Jung, K., et al. (2007). J Bacteriol 189, 2945-2948; Timmen, M., et al. (2006). J Biol Chem 281, 24398-24404). There are currently 11 LuxN homologs in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database, but nothing is known about how AHLs interact with this important class of receptors ().","Bacteria that use the AI-1 signaling factor associate with higher organisms, i.e., plants and animals, at some point during their life cycles. Some examples include , and is an opportunistic pathogen in humans with cystic fibrosis. infects certain plants and results in soft rot disease. causes gastrointestinal disease in humans and reportedly produces an autoinducer. synthesizes antibiotics under autoinducer control that block fungus growth in the roots.","Quorum sensing takes place not only among luminous marine bacteria like , but also among pathogenic bacteria where it regulates the production of virulence factors. Thus, it would be an advance to identify compounds useful for controlling pathogenic bacteria, and for augmenting traditional antibiotic treatments.","The present invention provides molecules that can be used to positively and negatively manipulate quorum-sensing-mediated communication to control bacterial behavior. Fifteen small-molecules were identified.","Accordingly, in a first aspect, the invention features a small molecule compound characterized by its ability to bind to LuxN at the autoinducer-1 (AI-1) binding site of LuxN, wherein the compound is not AI-1. The isolated compound is one embodiment of the invention.","In a preferred embodiment, the compound is one of the small molecules from the group consisting of the fifteen structures shown in . The compound is an antagonist of LuxN.","In a related aspect, the invention features a method of disrupting detection of acyl-homoserine lactone autoinducer in Gram-negative bacteria comprising contacting the bacteria with the small molecule compound.","In another related aspect, the invention features a pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, excipient or diluent and one or more of the compounds selected from the group consisting of the fifteen structures shown in .","In a further related aspect, the invention features a method of inhibiting bacterial infection of a host comprising contacting the bacteria with the pharmaceutical composition, wherein the bacteria are Gram-negative quorum sensing bacteria. \u201cContacting the bacteria\u201d is by means of administering the composition to the host, which can be topical administration or administration to the host internally by means known in the art.","In yet another related aspect, the invention features a bacterial biofilm-inhibiting composition comprising one or more compounds selected from the group consisting of the fifteen structures shown in . In a preferred embodiment the composition also comprises DMSO.","In still another related aspect, the invention features a method of controlling growth of quorum sensing Gram-negative bacteria attached to a solid surface, comprising exposing the bacteria to the bacterial biofilm-inhibiting composition.","A related aspect of the invention features a method of preventing biofilm formation on a solid surface comprising administering the bacterial biofilm-inhibiting composition to the surface.","Another aspect of the invention features a method of inhibiting quorum sensing-mediated activity in Gram-negative bacteria comprising contacting the bacteria with the antagonist compound selected from the group consisting of the fifteen structures shown in .","In a preferred embodiment, the quorum sensing-mediated activity is pathogenicity. In another embodiment the bacteria are pathogenic to humans, animals, or plants. In another embodiment the bacteria are pathogenic to marine life. In a particularly preferred embodiment the activity is pathogenicity and the bacterial species is selected from and ","In another preferred embodiment, the activity is bioluminescence, siderophore production, type III secretion, or metalloprotease production.","Another aspect of the invention features a use of one or more of the compounds from the group consisting of the fifteen structures (A-O) in  for preparation of a medicament for treatment of a bacterial infection wherein the bacteria are Gram-negative quorum sensing bacteria.","Yet another aspect of the invention features a medical device that is coated with one or more of the compounds from the group consisting of the fifteen structures (A-O) in . In a preferred embodiment the device is a catheter.","Additional features and advantages of the present invention will be better understood by reference to the drawings, detailed description and examples that follow.","The novel strategies described herein are aimed at interfering with the detection of quorum sensing molecules known as autoinducers. Quorum sensing controls expression of traits essential for bacterial virulence. Quorum sensing plays a vital role in the pathogenicity of many bacteria because the ability to act as a coordinated group is essential for bacteria to successfully infect host organisms. Interference with either the production or the detection of autoinducer molecules can abolish bacterial communication and render bacteria non-pathogenic. Thus, the novel methods of the present invention, which interfere with bacterial detection of autoinducer are important in controlling populations of bacteria.","The present invention identifies fifteen small molecules that disrupt detection of acyl-homoserine lactone-type autoinducer in Gram-negative bacteria and thus inhibit quorum sensing mediated processes (). These molecules antagonize membrane-bound and cytoplasmic autoinducer receptors. As representative of these two groupings of Gram-negative quorum sensing bacteria, the molecules were demonstrated to act in the model bacterial species and Chromobacterium by detecting the quorum sensing mediated activities of bioluminescence and violacein production, respectively. is representative of those bacteria that have membrane bound sensor receptor for the autoinducer. is representative of those bacteria that have cytoplasmic sensor receptor for the autoinducer ().","It is known that inhibitors of quorum sensing function to shut down entire pathogenicity regulons. It has been previously shown that use of bioluminescence as a convenient readout activity is an accurate reporter of the inhibition of all other quorum sensing target genes, e.g., virulence factor production, biofilm genes, type III secretion. Published research of Bassler and others in the field have demonstrated that convenient reporters such as bioluminescence, gfp, or violacein production, are accurate representations of what is happening for all the genes in the regulon.","Nonetheless, pathogenicity was studied in more detail in a model system using as a model of a host animal infected by pathogenic bacteria. was used as a model of pathogenic bacteria capable of quorum sensing-mediated killing of the host. An antagonist molecule identified from a high-throughput chemical library screen protected from quorum sensing-mediated killing by ().","It has previously been shown that the Type III secretion system (TTS) is a quorum sensing mediated activity. TTS systems are specialized secretion apparatuses used by many gram-negative plant and animal pathogens to inject effector virulence factors directly into the cytoplasm of eukaryotic host cells with which they are associated. Once inside the host cell, these effector proteins perform a range of functions that contribute to the propagation of the bacteria. TTS systems have been identified in numerous gram-negative bacterial pathogens, including enteropathogenic and the marine bacteria and . In enterohemorrhagic and enteropathogenic , quorum sensing activates TTS at high cell density (in the presence of autoinducer). In contrast, at high cell density, quorum sensing represses TTS in the marine bacteria and . (Henke, J. M., and Bassler, B. L. (2004a). J Bacteriol 186, 3794-3805).","Thus, the small molecules of the present invention that have been shown to antagonize the LuxN receptor inhibit quorum sensing activity in at high cell density and make the bacterium avirulent because the bacterium needs to express TTS late in infection to result in virulence. In infection, where TTS is required at low cell density, adding the antagonist small molecule causes the bacteria to express virulence traits at high cell density. This will make the bacterium avirulent because the antagonist will cause the bacterium to express, during late infection, the traits (TTS) that are actually needed early in infection, thus providing non-optimal conditions for infection, causing a growth disadvantage, and wasting energy.","Thus, in a further embodiment, the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising the small molecule compounds of the present invention (), or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof, and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants or vehicles. The pharmaceutical composition of the invention can be used to treat infections in a warm-blooded animal caused by microorganisms possessing a quorum-sensing mechanism, which comprises administering to the animal a therapeutically effective amount of the pharmaceutical composition of this invention.","The pharmaceutical compositions can be administered by any mode known in the art, including, for example, oral, nasal, topical (including buccal and sublingual) or parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous and intradermal) administration. A skilled artisan can determine which form of administration is best and the therapeutic amount in a particular case for balancing the dose needed versus periodic delivery.","Oral administration can include solid dosage forms, such as capsules, tablets, pills, powders, tinctures and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound is generally admixed with at least one inert pharmaceutically acceptable carrier such as sucrose, lactose, or starch. Such dosage forms can also comprise additional substances such as lubricating agents, for example, magnesium stearate. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage forms can also comprise buffering agents. Tablets and pills can additionally be prepared with enteric coatings.","Infectious bacteria that use acyl-homoserine lactone quorum sensing strategies to produce virulence include pathogens to humans, animals, and plants. Some pathogens infect marine life and thereafter cause disease in humans who eat or otherwise come into contact with the marine life.","Bacterial infection in humans is facilitated by certain conditions such as burns, wounds, implants or use of a catheter. is one species that may infect wounds. may contaminate shellfish and cause food poisoning. Individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) are plagued by bacterial infection of the lungs. Of the several species of bacteria that infect the lungs, is most problematic.","The invention also provides for a medical device comprising one or more of the compounds shown in , wherein the device is supplemented with the compound(s) and the compound is present in a concentration sufficient to disrupt detection of autoinducer-1. The compounds may be coated on the device. As used herein, the term \u201cmedical device\u201d means a device having surfaces that contact tissue, blood, or other bodily fluids in the course of their operation. This definition includes within its scope, for example, surgical implants, surgical sutures, wound dressings, extracorporeal devices for use in surgery such as blood oxygenators, blood pumps, blood sensors, tubing used to carry blood and the like which contact blood which is then returned to the subject.

The definition also includes within its scope devices for temporary intravascular use such as catheters, guide wires, and the like which are placed into the blood vessels or the heart for purposes of monitoring or repair.","The small molecule compounds of the invention can be used to inhibit bacterial cell growth and biofilm formation on substrates used to manufacture medical devices associated with noninvasive and invasive medical procedures. Such substrates include tubular, sheet, rod and articles of proper shape for use in a number of medical devices such as vascular grafts, aortic grafts, arterial, venous, or vascular tubing, vascular stents, dialysis membranes, tubing or connectors, blood oxygenator tubing or membranes, surgical instruments, ultrafiltration membranes, intra-aortic balloons, stents, blood bags, catheters, sutures, soft or hard tissue prostheses, synthetic prostheses, prosthetic heart valves, tissue adhesives, cardiac pacemaker leads, artificial organs, endotracheal tubes, lenses for the eye such as contact or intraocular lenses, blood handling equipment, apheresis equipment, diagnostic and monitoring catheters and sensors, biosensors, dental devices, drug delivery systems, or bodily implants of any kind. For example, arthroscopic surgery is routinely performed with use of medical devices that minimize the invasiveness of the procedure. Such devices include, for example, ultrathin microfiberoptic endoscopes that offer the laryngologist unique access to the limited spaces of the temporal bone and skull base. In another example, a stent supplemented with a small molecule compound of the invention that deters bacterial infections resulting from the presence of the implanted stent can be constructed. Stents are used to maintain an open lumen in tissues including the tracheo-bronchial system, the biliary hepatic system, the esophageal bowel system, and the urinary tract system. U.S. Pat. No. 5,637,113 issued to Tartaglia, and incorporated herein by reference, teaches a stent with a sheet of polymeric film wrapped around the exterior. With regard to the present invention, the film may be loaded or coated with a small molecule compound or composition of the invention. Alternatively, the material used to manufacture the stent can be impregnated with a small molecule compound or composition of the invention.","A medical device may be further supplemented with, for example, one or more antibodies, analgesics, anticoagulants, anti-inflammatory compounds, antimicrobial compositions, cytokines, drugs, growth factors, interferons, hormones, lipids, demineralized bone or bone morphogenetic proteins, cartilage inducing factors, oligonucleotides polymers, polysaccharides, polypeptides, protease inhibitors, vasoconstrictors or vasodilators, vitamins, minerals, stabilizers and the like. Supplemented, as used herein, includes medical devices that are impregnated, infused, coated, covered, layered, permeated, attached or connected with a small molecule compound or composition of the invention. Methods for immobilizing biomaterials to a medical device are discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,925,552, which is incorporated herein by reference. Additional methods of coating surfaces of medical devices with antimicrobial compositions are taught in U.S. Pat. No. 4,895,566 (a medical device substrate carrying a negatively charged group having a pKa of less than 6 and a cationic antibiotic bound to the negatively charged group); U.S. Pat. No. 4,917,686 (antibiotics are dissolved in a swelling agent which is absorbed into the matrix of the surface material of the medical device); U.S. Pat. No. 4,107,121 (constructing the medical device with ionogenic hydrogels, which thereafter absorb or ionically bind antibiotics); U.S. Pat.

No. 4,952,419 (applying a film of silicone oil to the surface of an implant and then contacting the silicone film bearing surface with antibiotic powders). U.S. Pat. No. 5,902,283 further discloses a method for coating a medical device with an antimicrobial agent such that the agent penetrates the exposed surfaces of the device and is impregnated throughout the material of the device.","It is further envisioned that the small molecule compounds or compositions of the invention can be used to aid wound repair. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,117,485 describes a foaming tissue sealant for treating wounded tissue in a subject. The sealant can be formulated to include a compound or composition of the invention. The sealant is useful for significantly diminishing or preventing blood or fluid loss from injured tissues, organs or blood vessels, while also providing a barrier to infection.","Another quorum sensing activity is biofilm formation. Biofilms are communities of bacterial cells adhered to surfaces. Biofilms are highly problematic in industrial processes such as clogging of cooling towers in manufacturing plants. The novel strategies of the present invention prevent or disrupt biofilms by interfering with quorum sensing.","In another embodiment, the invention provides a method of removing a biofilm from a surface that comprises treating the surface with a compound of the invention. The surface is preferably the inside of an aqueous liquid distribution system, such as a drinking water distribution system or a supply line connected to a dental air-water system, where removal of biofilms can be particularly difficult to achieve. The compound is preferably applied to the surface either alone or together with other materials such as conventional detergents or surfactants.","A further embodiment of the invention is an antibacterial composition comprising a small molecule compound of the invention together with a bacteriocidal agent. In the antibacterial compositions, the compound of the invention helps to remove the biofilm while the bacteriocidal agent kills the bacteria. The antibacterial composition is preferably in the form of a solution or suspension for spraying and\/or wiping on a surface.","In yet another aspect, the invention provides an article coated and\/or impregnated with a compound of the invention in order to inhibit and\/or prevent biofilm formation thereon. The article is preferably composed of plastic with the compound of the invention distributed throughout the material.","It is further envisioned that the small molecule compounds or compositions of the invention can be used to inhibit bacterial cell growth and biofilm formation in or on products or devices used for personal hygiene. Soap, toothpaste, dental floss, laundry detergent or moisturizing lotion are examples of consumer products that would benefit from the inclusion of the small molecule compounds or composition of the invention. In addition, such a compound or composition can be included in a personal hygiene device such as a toothbrush, tongue depressor, or any other such device which comes in contact with a tissue.","Thus, the invention includes introduction of one or more small molecules of the invention into an environment where it is desired to prevent bacteria from acting communally in an undesirable activity such as in production of biofilms or virulence. Introduction of the small molecules of this invention is also contemplated as treatment where undesirable bacterial communities are already established. The particular quantity of the small molecule for prevention or treatment is to be determined experimentally by methods known to those skilled in the art. An example provided herein for guidance involves prevention of virulent bacterial activity in the animal model ","Quorum sensing, a process of bacterial cell-cell communication, relies on production, detection, and response to autoinducer signaling molecules. LuxN, a nine transmembrane domain protein from , is the founding example of membrane-bound receptors for acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) autoinducers. Previously, nothing was known about signal recognition by membrane-bound AHL receptors. Using mutagenesis and suppressor analyses, the AHL-binding domain of LuxN has now been characterized. To extract signaling parameters, a strong LuxN antagonist was exploited, one of the fifteen small-molecule antagonists that were identified. Also identified as antagonists were phenoxyacetamides, e.g., N-cyclopentyl-2-(4-(2-phenylpropan-2-yl)phenoxy) acetamide and N-sec-butyl-2-(4-(2-phenylpropan-2-yl)phenoxy) acetamide.","From membrane-topology analysis, it would appear that LuxN is bound to the bacterial inner-membrane by nine trans-membrane (TM) spanning helices (). From reporter-protein fusion analyses, it would appear that the N-terminus of LuxN is on the periplasmic side of the bacterial inner-membrane, while the histidine-kinase portion of LuxN resides in the cytosol (Jung et al., 2007). Therefore, LuxN contains four periplasmic loops and four cytosolic loops connecting the nine transmembrane domain (TM) segments (). By analogy to homologous membrane-bound sensor kinases, LuxN is believed to assemble into homodimers.","To locate the AI-1 binding domain of LuxN, a genetic screen was performed to identify luxN mutants encoding proteins incapable of properly responding to AI-1 (Example 1). All of the identified amino-acid mutations that affect AI-1 signaling cluster in TM helices near the periplasmic face, or are located within periplasmic loops, indicating that LuxN most likely binds AI-1 on the periplasmic side of the membrane (). The results indicated that the LuxN AI-1 binding domain is composed of TM helices 4, 5, 6, and 7 as well as the intervening periplasmic loops 2 and 3.","The large number of mutations identified in this work that affect AI-1 binding suggest that LuxN makes multiple contacts with AI-1. Further supporting our conclusion that TM4, TM5, TM6, and TM7 and periplasmic loops 2 and 3 encode the AI-1 binding domain of wild-type LuxN, a LuxN homolog was recently discovered that lacks the first 80 amino acids, which encode TM1, TM2, and periplasmic loop 1, indicating that this region of LuxN is dispensable for AI-1 binding and signaling ( and NCBI database). This truncated LuxN homolog retains all of the critical regions identified in our identified AI-1 binding domain, indicating that this LuxN variant can still respond to an autoinducer molecule (). Interestingly, the most highly conserved domain in LuxN is centered at position P226, and contains a PPAL motif that is 100% conserved among all known LuxN homologs (). Both proline residues of this motif were identified as critical for LuxN signaling by our random mutagenesis screen. Therefore, we deduce that the PPAL motif is essential for LuxN signal transduction.","Sequence alignment comparison of LuxN with other LuxN homologs confirmed that the homologs have conserved binding pockets that accommodate an AHL-type ligand and that likewise accommodate the small molecule compounds of this invention (). These small molecules antagonize a broad spectrum of AHL type receptors.","A high-throughput chemical screen was used to identify the set of small molecules that were specifically demonstrated to antagonize the LuxN\/AI-1 interaction in the model system of (Example 4). All of these LuxN antagonist molecules have ICvalues in the low micromolar range, and, based on competition assays and genetic evidence, the most potent LuxN antagonist competes for the AI-1 binding site. These antagonists provided a molecular tool with which to further probe the AI-1 binding pocket and characterize the signaling properties of LuxN.","These are the first antagonist molecules that target an AHL membrane-bound sensor kinase. Importantly, the antagonists identified by this screen are not similar in structure to AI-1 (see, for example, ). Therefore, it is unlikely that rational-design experiments would have predicted these molecules as AHL antagonists. To explore whether the antagonists competed with AI-1 for binding to LuxN, we performed an antagonist-suppressor screen, and identified LuxN* I209F, which is not antagonized by C450-0730 (Example 6). Importantly, this mutation lies on the periplasmic side of TM 6, in the center of the proposed AI-1 binding domain, consistent with the possibility that C450-0730 competes for the AI-1 binding site (though the LuxN* mutation I209F does not affect AI-1 signaling). The AI-1 dose-response curves in the presence of different concentrations of C450-0730 for both wild-type LuxN and LuxN F163A provided a good data collapse indicative of competitive inhibition (). Combined, these results led to the conclusion that the C450-0730 antagonist is competing for the AI-1 binding pocket of LuxN. Because the LuxN* I209F mutation only affects the antagonistic ability of C450-0730, but does not interfere with AI-1 signaling, we deduce that C450-0730 makes at least some contacts with LuxN that are distinct from those made by AI-1.","In order to answer the question whether mutations in LuxN could shift the free-energy bias between receptor kinase and phosphatase states, a model was devised, shown schematically in . We propose that each LuxN can exist in any of four states: kinase (on) or phosphatase (off), with ligand bound or unbound. Receptor activity is determined by the thermal equilibrium among these states, characterized by the free-energy difference \u0192 between the on and off states of LuxN (see Experimental Procedures). Within the model, the measured output, bioluminescence, is the same unknown function off for all strains, reflecting the fact that bioluminescence depends only on receptor activity, which at equilibrium depends only on f. The model predicts that mutations can cause EC50 to increase or decrease depending on the sign of the shift in \u0394\u03b5 the free-energy bias between kinase and phosphatase states. Indeed, the model is nicely supported by the data collapse in , where the bioluminescence for the LuxN F163A mutant collapses well with wild type assuming only a shift in \u0394\u03b5. More generally, we have found that the bioluminescence data for many of our LuxN mutants collapse well with the combined wild-type and LuxN F163A data, allowing us to deduce changed \u0394\u03b5 values and in some cases also changed binding affinities (). This analysis supports a close functional analogy between LuxN and chemotaxis receptors, and suggests the general relevance of two-state, free-energy models for bacterial sensor kinases.","Little was known about how membrane-bound kinase proteins, like LuxN, detect AHLs. Our mutagenesis strategy, showing that LuxN most likely binds AI-1 on the periplasmic side of the membrane, indicates that AI-1 is released from , accumulates in the extracellular space, and subsequently triggers the LuxN quorum-sensing cascade. This mechanism is distinct from the previously characterized LuxR-type AHL-signaling mechanism. Typically, LuxR-type AHL receptors require significant intracellular AHL concentrations for folding. Thus, at low cell densities the LuxR proteins do not fold properly and are degraded, so quorum sensing does not occur. Degradation of the LuxR-type proteins in the absence of the AHL signal is presumed to be a mechanism preventing premature activation of quorum sensing in canonical LuxR-AHL systems. Apparently, has evolved a distinct mechanism to circumvent short circuiting its quorum-sensing pathway, namely by compartmentalizing the cytosolic production of AI-1 in a location inaccessible to the periplasmic sensing domain of LuxN. This spatial uncoupling of AI-1 production from AI-1 binding allows to exclusively monitor extracellular levels of AI-1. It must be noted that has three quorum-sensing circuits, all of which have similar architectures. Thus, all three systems have signal production spatially uncoupled from signal detection ().","Furthermore, through quantitative analysis it was revealed that, unlike the paradigmatic two-state chemotaxis receptors which spend roughly equal time in the active and inactive states for maximum sensitivity to ligand, the quorum-sensing receptor LuxN spends \u02dc96% of its time in the active\/kinase state and requires establishment of a threshold concentration of autoinducer to inactivate it. Remarkably, although the chemotaxis and LuxN receptors are homologous, they solve fundamentally different biological problems by operating in different regimes. Chemotaxis, a system tuned for sensitivity, allows instantaneous alterations in behavior in response to small fluctuations in signal concentration. Quorum sensing, by contrast, a system built to ignore small perturbations, initiates a slow, all-or-nothing commitment program only upon reaching a signal threshold. We suggest that the distinct design properties inherent in the quorum sensing and chemotaxis signaling systems have evolved to optimally solve very different biological problems.","The following examples set forth the general procedures involved in practicing the present invention. To the extent that specific materials are mentioned, it is merely for purposes of illustration and is not intended to limit the invention. Unless otherwise specified, general molecular biology procedures, such as those set forth in Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (1989) (hereinafter \u201cSambrook et al.\u201d) or Ausubel et al. (eds) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley-Sons (1998) (hereinafter \u201cAusubel et al.\u201d) were used.","The aim of this study was to determine how LuxN and AI-1 interact in order to understand how trans-membrane receptors couple AHL signaling to changes in gene expression. However, as is the case for most histidine sensor kinases, the complex trans-membrane topology of LuxN makes direct structural analysis extremely difficult. Therefore, to pinpoint the AI-1 binding site in the periplasmic domain of LuxN, directed mutagenesis of the 1 kb region of luxN encoding the membrane-binding domain was performed using error-prone PCR. The library of luxN mutants generated by this approach was cloned into a version of the luxN gene lacking this region to regenerate full-length luxN. The mutant library was introduced into the double sensor mutant JMH625 (luxN luxQ), which has a bright phenotype because there is no flow of phosphate to LuxO (). The CAI-1-CqsS system is intact in the strain used for this screen. Because saturating levels of CAI-1 are always present in these experiments, CqsS exists as a phosphatase and thus does not contribute in funneling phosphate to LuxO. Thus it is reasonable that when a wild-type copy of luxN is introduced into this strain in the presence of AI-1, it will remain bright because binding of AI-1 to LuxN induces phosphatase activity. However, if a mutant luxN allele encoding a LuxN protein that is incapable of binding or responding to AI-1 is introduced, it will confer a dark phenotype due to high levels of LuxN auto-phosphorylation and phospho-transfer to LuxO ().","Approximately 30,000 luxN mutants were screened for those alleles causing a reduction in bioluminescence. Ten alleles were confirmed to produce dark phenotypes. These luxN genes were sequenced to identify the mutations (Table 2, ). Several candidates contained multiple mutations, and these mutations were uncoupled by site-directed mutagenesis to produce genes encoding LuxN proteins with single amino-acid substitutions (Table 2). Interestingly, in the case of LRS6 two of the uncoupled mutations independently caused dark phenotypes (Table 2). Further analyses were carried out on LuxN mutants containing only single amino-acid changes.","The mutations conferring dark phenotypes cluster to the periplasmic region of TMs 4, 5, 6, and 7 and periplasmic loops 2 and 3 ( circles) suggesting that the AI-1 binding site resides there. To explore this hypothesis further, the 11 available LuxN homologs were compared and every 100% conserved amino acid was replaced as well as the other most highly conserved amino acids within this region with alanine, and were screened as above. This analysis produced an additional 20 mutants defective in response to AI-1. (Table 1, ).","The LRS5 mutation, which confers a dark phenotype, is a single base-pair deletion at position 634 causing a premature stop codon at amino-acid residue 213 (Table 2). This mutation was unexpected because the premature stop codon would lead one to believe that the kinase domain of LuxN should not be synthesized, making it unclear how this mutation could confer a dark phenotype. To investigate this, a FLAG-epitope tag was fused to the C-terminus of this mutant LuxN and the protein was probed by western blot analysis. This analysis indicated that a truncated version of LuxN lacking approximately the first 220 amino acids is synthesized (data not shown). It appears that an alternative ribosome binding site exists downstream of the LRS5 deletion, enabling translation of a truncated form of LuxN. Because this truncation eliminates almost the entire proposed AI-1 binding domain from LuxN, only the cytoplasmic kinase domain is produced which, because it is unable to bind to AI-1, constitutively acts as a kinase causing a dark phenotype.","To characterize the signaling capabilities of the single-amino-acid-substituted LuxN mutants, a series of quantitative phenotypic analyses were carried out. First, we measured bioluminescence in stationary-phase cultures of strains carrying either wild-type luxN or each luxN allele conferring a dark phenotype. The bioluminescence produced by the strain with wild-type luxN was set at 100% (). As negative controls, two luxN mutants harboring wild-type phenotypes (LuxN L138A and LuxN E154Q) which were randomly isolated from the screen were also included in the analysis and they produced the wild-type level of bioluminescence (). By contrast, the LuxN mutants F151A, I153F, F155I, L166R, T214I, F220A, P226T, and S232N exhibited at least an 80% reduction in bioluminescence relative to wild type (). To confirm that the dark phenotypes did not stem from increased LuxN protein levels, FLAG-epitope tags were incorporated at the C-terminus of a representative subset of the LuxN mutants shown in  as well as wild-type LuxN. Western blot showed that there were no differences in protein production (data not shown).","We reasoned that the LuxN mutants conferring dark phenotypes must be acting as kinases at high cell density, resulting in continued flow of phosphate through the quorum-sensing circuit. This in turn, should manifest itself in elevated qrr expression at high cell density (). To test this idea, quantitative real-time PCR was performed and Qrr4 transcript levels were measured in each of the luxN mutant strains described above. As controls, Qrr4 transcript levels were measured in the wild type and the bright control strains, LuxN L138A and LuxN E154Q, and we found that indeed, in these three strains, Qrr4 levels are low, consistent with these LuxN proteins acting as phosphatases at high cell density (). However, the luxN mutants exhibiting dark phenotypes () all have significantly increased Qrr4 transcript levels (10 to 30-fold higher than wild type) (). This result confirms that the decrease in bioluminescence observed in the dark LuxN mutants is the direct result of an alteration in signaling through the LuxN quorum-sensing pathway.","Two possible mechanisms were considered underlying the dark LuxN phenotypes. First, a particular mutation could abolish AI-1 binding. If so, this type of mutation would cause LuxN to act as a kinase at high cell density in the presence of AI-1. Alternatively, a mutation could allow AI-1 binding, but disrupt the ability of LuxN to transduce the signal to the cytoplasm. We first determined which LuxN mutant proteins could bind AI-1 by measuring the AI-1 dose-response of each LuxN missense mutant. For this, strain HLS253 \u0394luxMN, \u0394luxPQ, \u0394luxS was used. HLS253 is constitutively bright because the luxN and luxPQ genes, encoding the quorum-sensing receptors, have been deleted. Also, HLS253 does not produce AI-1 or AI-2, due to the luxM and luxS deletions, respectively. Introduction of a wild-type copy of luxN into HLS253 confers a dark phenotype because, in the absence of AI-1, LuxN acts as a constitutive kinase. However, addition of exogenous AI-1 to HLS253 harboring a wild-type copy of luxN induces bioluminescence. Introduction of a luxN mutant encoding a LuxN protein incapable of binding AI-1 or incapable of signaling the AI-1 binding event to the cytoplasm will confer a dark phenotype to HLS253. And, such defects will cause the LuxN proteins to remain as kinases even in the presence of AI-1. By contrast, if a particular LuxN mutant is introduced that is capable of binding AI-1, even with lower affinity than wild-type LuxN, these LuxN proteins will switch to phosphatase activity following the addition of sufficient AI-1, and bioluminescence will be induced.","To determine AI-1 ECvalues, wild-type LuxN and each LuxN mutant were assayed for response to AI-1 at concentrations ranging from 24 pM to 500 \u03bcM. A subset of the dose-response curves is shown in , and the remainder of the ECdata is provided in Table 1. The ECfor wild-type LuxN binding to AI-1 is 23 nM. The control mutants, LuxN L138A and LuxN E154Q, as expected, have ECvalues of 30 nM and 55 nM, respectively, similar to wild-type LuxN (Table 1). Many of the LuxN mutants have drastically increased ECvalues (Table 1). For example, LuxN I153F, F155A, F162A, T206A, and S232A have ECvalues of 130 nM, 580 nM, 93 \u03bcM, 310 nM, and 400 nM, respectively (). In five cases, LuxN L166R, F202A, S205P, P226T, and E233A, the mutants conferred a dark phenotype to even at 500 \u03bcM AI-1 () and therefore ECvalues were unable to be assigned. Nonetheless, we successfully determined the AI-1 ECvalues for 25 of the 30 LuxN mutants that conferred a dark phenotype. We conclude that LuxN mutant proteins that produce measurable ECvalues, albeit higher than wild type, can bind AI-1 at least with some capacity.","To probe the LuxN\/AI-1 interaction further, small molecules were identified that interfere with quorum sensing by disrupting the binding of AI-1 to LuxN. To do this, a high-throughput chemical screen was carried out using the chemicals collection of the Broad Institute (Massachussetts, USA), which identified small molecules that specifically antagonize LuxN signaling in . The strain, JMH624 \u0394luxPQ, \u0394luxM, which lacks the AI-2 receptor, LuxPQ, as well as the AI-1 synthase, LuxM, was used for the antagonist screen. JMH624 is dark because there is no AI-2 receptor and the lack of AI-1 causes LuxN to act as a kinase (). However, following exogenous addition of 20 nM AI-1, bioluminescence is induced because LuxN switches to phosphatase mode. Potential antagonist molecules were tested for the ability to reduce bioluminescence of JMH624 in the presence of 20 nM AI-1. To eliminate molecules causing general toxicity and those that interfere with luciferase or other downstream components of the quorum-sensing bioluminescence pathway, a second screen was carried out using a \u0394luxN, \u0394luxS control strain, JMH610JMH610 lacks the AI-1 receptor LuxN and the AI-2 synthase, LuxS. In this case, because of the lack of AI-2, LuxQ acts as a kinase, and JMH610 is dark. However, following exogenous addition of AI-2, bioluminescence is induced because LuxQ switches to phosphatase mode (). Any molecule that reduced bioluminescence in both JMH610 in the presence of AI-2 and JMH624 in the presence of AI-1 was eliminated from further analysis. Approximately 35,000 low-molecular-weight compounds were screened for specific inhibition of bioluminescence through the LuxN quorum-sensing pathway; 45 molecules were selected for further analysis, and a representative subset of these molecules with varying levels of antagonistic activity is shown in . For example, molecule C450-0730 has an ICvalue of 2.7 \u03bcM while a weaker antagonist, 3578-0898 has an ICof 62.3 \u03bcM. Interestingly, the molecular cores of two of the strongest LuxN antagonists, C450-0730 and C646-0078, are very similar (). A larger subset of these molecules is shown in .","It was not initially known whether the potent LuxN antagonist, C450-0730, was competing for the LuxN AI-1 binding site. To examine this, AI-1 ECvalues were determined in the presence of 0 \u03bcM, 1 \u03bcM, and 10 \u03bcM C450-0730. Our rational is that, if C450-0730 competes with AI-1 for binding, the AI-1 ECvalue should increase with increasing concentrations of C450-0730. Indeed, this is the case, as the AI-1 ECvalues are 23 nM, 76 nM, and 376 nM at 0 \u03bcM, 1 \u03bcM, and 10 \u03bcM C450-0730, respectively (). Indeed, the AI-1 dose-response curves at these three C450-0730 concentrations can be collapsed onto a single curve, consistent with competitive inhibition ( and Experimental Procedures). The principal underlying the data collapse is that there is a fixed (albeit initially unknown) quantitative relation between measured bioluminescence and the free-energy difference between the active and inactive configurations of LuxN (Keymer et al., 2006). Therefore, all the dose-response curves should reproduce this same relation, i.e. the curves should \u201ccollapse\u201d when bioluminescence is plotted versus free-energy difference. However, to plot the data this way, it is necessary to know how to relate ligand concentrations to free-energy differences, which means that it is necessary to know the ligand dissociation constants Kfor both the active and inactive configurations of LuxN. In practice, we iteratively improve our estimates for Kvalues by attempting to collapse the dose-response curves and infer the true values from the best data collapse. This is a reliable procedure here, since the dose-response curves contain more data than the number of unknown Kvalues. A major benefit of collapsing the data in this way is that it allows us to deduce the state-dependent Kvalues for LuxN from the in vivo data: in the phosphatase (off) state K\u22481 nM, and in the kinase (on) state K\u2248500 nM.","We had reasoned that the dark phenotypes of our LuxN mutants could stem from (i) a defect in the ability to bind AI-1, (ii) a bias favoring the kinase state, (iii) a defect in signaling, or (iv) some combination of the above. The method of data collapse provides a powerful tool to distinguish among these possibilities. For example, consider the case of the mutant LuxN F163A () which has an AI-1 ECvalue 378-fold higher than that of wild-type LuxN and for which dose-response curves were obtained in the presence of 0 \u03bcM, 1 \u03bcM, and 10 \u03bcM of the antagonist C450-0730. First, we were able to collapse the three antagonist dose-response curves using the identical Kas we used to collapse the wild-type LuxN data indicating that LuxN F163A is not defective in its ability to bind AI-1 (eliminating possibility (i)). Second, the LuxN F163A data could all be collapsed onto the wild-type LuxN antagonist curves simply by adjusting the free-energy bias between the kinase (on) and phosphatase (off) states (). This analysis allows us to conclude that LuxN F163A has an increased AI-1 ECvalue exclusively because it has an altered free-energy bias that favors the kinase (on) state, establishing that possibility (ii) accounts for the dark phenotype of this mutant. Similar analysis applied to our other dark mutants reveals examples of the different possibilities and allows us to deduce and quantify the origins of the dark phenotypes.","To better understand the mechanism of C450-0730 interaction with LuxN, a suppressor screen was performed to identify LuxN mutants no longer antagonized by C450-0730. Using error-prone PCR, 2,000 mutants in the luxN N-terminal region were generated and conjugated into the \u0394luxMN \u0394luxPQ \u0394luxS strain, HLS253, and arrayed in 96-well micro-titer plates. As mentioned, HLS253 is constitutively bright due to the absence of the quorum-sensing receptors, LuxN and LuxPQ, and both autoinducer synthases, LuxM and LuxS. To verify our strategy, a wild-type luxN control plasmid was also conjugated into HLS253, which conferred a dark phenotype because wild-type LuxN is a kinase in the absence of AI-L Bioluminescence is restored to HLS253 containing wild-type luxN by the exogenous addition of 100 nM AI-1. We found that 800 nM C450-0730 was required to inhibit bioluminescence of HLS253 carrying wild-type luxN in the presence of 100 nM AI-1. The luxN mutant library was screened in the presence of 100 nM AI-1 and 800 nM C450-0730 for luxN alleles that enabled bioluminescence in HLS253. To eliminate luxN null mutants, the luxN mutant library was also screened in HLS253 in the absence of both AI-1 and C450-0730. The luxN alleles that conferred a bright phenotype in the absence of AI-1 were not examined further. Five LuxN mutant strains, LRS112, LRS311, LRS129, LRS147, and LRS1511 (Table 2) displayed dark phenotypes in the absence of AI-1 and C450-0730, but were bright in the simultaneous presence of AI-1 and C450-0730, suggesting that these LuxN proteins were no longer antagonized by C450-0730. The luxN mutations were sequenced to identify the alleles (Table 2). Interestingly, LuxN G271D was identified twice. From here forward this class of suppressor mutants is referred to as LuxN*.","We speculated that the LuxN* mutants could have increased AI-1 sensitivity or decreased C450-0730 binding ability. To distinguish between these two possibilities, the LuxN* AI-1 ECvalues were determined (). As a reference, the dark mutant LuxN F163A is also included in . The ECvalue of wild-type LuxN is 23 nM, while LuxN* S184N is 11 nM, LuxN* I209F is 39 nM, LuxN* R245L is 4.8 nM, and LuxN* G271D is 3.7 nM (Table 1). Interestingly, three of the four LuxN* mutants, LuxN S184N, R245L, and G271D show increased sensitivity to AI-1, suggesting that these alleles circumvent C450-0730 antagonism through increased AI-1 binding or signaling or via a bias to the phosphatase state of LuxN (see Discussion). However, LuxN* I209F responded more like wild type to AI-1 as indicated by an AI-1 ECvalue of 39 nM (Table 1).","In the reciprocal experiment, we determined the ability of C450-0730 to antagonize the LuxN* mutants. C450-0730 ICvalues were measured by titrating C450-0730 from 0.64 nM to 50 \u03bcM, while keeping the AI-1 concentration constant at 10 nM. The C450-0730 concentration required to inhibit LuxN* G271D, R245L, and S184N was similar to that required to inhibit wild-type LuxN, indicating that the observed \u201cresistance\u201d to C450-0730 was indeed due to increased sensitivity to AI-1. However, a 5-fold higher concentration of C450-0730 was required to antagonize LuxN* I209F. Therefore, the LuxN* I209F mutation appears to affect C450-0730 binding. Because 1209 is located within our proposed AI-1 binding site ( in triangle), and because it also affects C450-0730 antagonistic activity, we propose that C450-0730 could compete for the AI-1 binding site of LuxN. This conclusion is strongly supported by the good data collapse in , which is based on competitive inhibition by C450-0730.","For chemotaxis receptors in , adaptive methylation of specific cytoplasmic residues is known to additively bias receptors toward a kinase-active state. By analogy, we wondered whether some of our single-residue mutations might bias LuxN toward kinase or phosphatase states in an additive manner. To determine whether the LuxN G271D, R245L, and S184N mutants which have lower than wild type AI-1 ECvalues are biased toward the phosphatase state, these mutations were engineered into the LuxN F163A mutant to test if they could shift the high ECof LuxN F163A back toward a low EC. As a reminder, the F163A LuxN mutation has an increased AI-1 ECvalue of 8.7 \u03bcM as compared to 23 nM for wild-type LuxN; therefore, it requires approximately 378 times more AI-1 to switch LuxN F163A into the phosphatase mode than the amount of AI-1 required to switch wild-type LuxN. A double mutant (LuxN F163A\/R245L), a triple mutant (LuxN F163A\/R245L\/S184N), and a quadruple mutant (LuxN F163A\/R245L\/S184N\/G271D) of LuxN were tested for their ability to respond to AI-1 (). The incorporation of each LuxN* mutation into the context of the F163A mutation successively decreased the AI-1 ECvalue approximately 10-fold, while the quadruple mutant had a constitutively bright phenotype (Table 1). From this analysis, we inferred that the LuxN* mutations are additive in their ability to bias LuxN toward the phosphatase mode.","LuxN is the founding member of an increasingly large family of membrane bound homoserine lactone autoinducer binding proteins. In this receptor family, autoinducer binding information is transduced to a DNA binding protein by phosphorylation. There are two quorum sensing mechanisms for homoserine lactone autoinducer detection. First, through membrane bound receptors homologous to 's LuxN (). Second, by cytoplasmic LuxR-type proteins, such as CviR from , in which binding of the homoserine lactone signal allows the LuxR-type receptor protein to fold and bind DNA to alter transcription ().","After having successfully screened for antagonists of LuxN, the membrane bound homoserine lactone receptor, we tested whether these same antagonists could antagonize a cytoplasmic LuxR-type homoserine lactone receptor. We used CviR because inhibition results in loss of purple pigment production (). Five of the LuxN antagonists greatly inhibited the cytoplasmic CviR receptor. These data show that these molecules work on both the outside and the inside of the bacterial cell.","Molecule 4606-4237 allows the CviR protein to fold and bind DNA exactly as does the endogenous homoserine lactone ligand.
