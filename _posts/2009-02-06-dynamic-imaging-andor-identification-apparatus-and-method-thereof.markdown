title: Dynamic imaging and/or identification apparatus and method thereof
abstract: A preferred embodiment comprises a dynamic display based on a program image element which will only generate a preprogrammed image. As an example, the image element may comprise electrically-driven MEMS mirrors. This example may be embedded in an ID card. At the time of issue of the ID card, pixels in the mirror array will be permanently programmed as either ‘alive’ or ‘dead’ in a pattern matching the photo of the person in question. When stimulated, only ‘alive’ pixels will actuate, creating an image for comparison to the adjacent printed photo. Due to its dynamic behavior, delicate mechanical structures, and single-time hard-wiring, duplication of, or tampering with, this secondary dynamic image will be nearly impossible. The ID car is but one exemplary application and other embodiments, applications, and methods are described in the specification and claims.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured, used, and licensed by or for the United States Government.","This invention relates broadly to image retention and more particularly to identification of objects or persons using displays and\/or images.","Photographic identification (ID) cards are widely used by government and private institutions to ensure that the bearer (or subject) of said card matches the identity of whom the rights\/privileges were originally bestowed by the issuer. Traditionally ID cards contain static photographs, possibly covered with lamination or a hologram. The widespread availability and low-cost of such equipment inherently makes these features easy to replicate. RFID tags or computer chips are attractive for embedding further information, but have limited capacity and may be require power hungry readers with maintained databases in order to access\/verify the information. Thus, the last line of defense often remains a simple photo ID which due to recent advances in image quality printing\/lamination, is remarkably easy to duplicate\/replace. Research by the Washington Times\u2122 (16 May 2008) concluded that even the brand new electronic-passport card can \u201cbe copied or altered easily by removing the photograph with solvent and replacing it with one from an unauthorized user.\u201d One example of the immediate danger posed by fake\/forged IDs took place in Baquabah, Iraq on Aug. 23, 2005. A suicide bomber from Al Qaeda in Iraq used a fake ID to enter a dining facility; the ensuing explosion not only destroyed the building, but also killed 2 US personnel while injuring 6 more.","In view of several incidents of false identification resulting in tragic consequences as well as the rise of identity thief in general, there is a growing need for the development of a portable dynamic photo identification system ID card which contains a tamper-resistant\/replication-resistant image or photo. Such cards would have particular appeal in high security and\/or military environments. For example, tamper-resistant IDs could prevent unauthorized personnel from using forged IDs to pass checkpoints or to gain access to airports, bases, secured properties, nuclear facilities, etc.","Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) (also written as micro-electro-mechanical, or MicroElectroMechanical) is the terminology used to describe very small system devices, which according to Wikipedia, generally ranging in size from 20 micrometers (20 millionths of a meter) to a millimeter. In Japan, MEMS devices are also referred to as micromachines, or Micro Systems Technology\u2014MST (in Europe). As used herein, the word MEMS includes micromachines and micro systems technology.","MEMS mirror arrays have been developed for use in projection displays or TV's, but are typically intended for rendering moving images with high refresh rates and continuous control.","In U.S. Pat. No. 4,710,732 ('732 patent), hereby incorporated by reference as though fully rewritten herein, entitled \u201cSpatial Light Modulator and Method,\u201d there is disclosed a spatial light modulator with deflectable metal flaps hinged to conducting posts on a substrate, with the metal flaps and conducting post being connected to addressing circuitry in the substrate. There is no disclosure in the '732 patent of, inter alia, of tamper resistant, single time, hardwired programming circuitry connected to each of the image elements to program the image elements so as to restrict the microelectrical-mechanical device to displaying a predetermined image upon actuation.","U.S. Pat. No. 7,283,112 ('112 patent), entitled \u201cReflective Microelectromechanical Structure (MEMS) Optical Modulator and Optical Display System,\u201d is directed to flat panel displays similar to, for example, liquid crystal displays. The '112 patent discloses a microelectrical mechanical reflector array that includes an array of microelectrical mechanical actuators that support reflectors in alignment with the array of pixel apertures. The array of microelectrical mechanical actuators orient the reflectors selectively to direct the illumination light back through the pixel apertures (to form part of a display image) or against the aperture plate (to be blocked). The illumination light passing back through the pixel apertures pass through the microlens array and a beamsplitter to a display screen. There is no disclosure in the '112 patent of tamper resistant, single time, hardwired programming circuitry connected to the image elements to program the image elements so as to restrict the microelectrical-mechanical device to displaying a predetermined image upon actuation.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,421,013 (hereby incorporated by reference) entitled \u201cTamperproof Wireless Article Including an Antenna,\u201d discloses, inter alia, a wireless ID bag that includes an electronic device mounted on a substrate and connected to an antenna for receiving and transmitting RF signals for communication with a base unit or reader via a radio-frequency (RF) communication link.","U.S. Patent Application No. 2005\/0248827 ('827 Application), hereby incorporated by reference, is directed to, inter alia, flat panel optical display systems with increased image clarity and overall image quality discloses a microelectrical mechanical device comprising (a) a substrate; (b) an arm having a first end anchored to the substrate and a free end extending over the substrate, the arm having a bottom surface facing the substrate and a top surface opposite the bottom surface; (c) a reflector extending over the top surface of the free end of the arm; (d) an electrostatic activation electrode supported by the substrate and facing the bottom surface of the arm, the electrode, when activated by a first voltage, providing an electrical force sufficient to move the free end of the arm; and (e) an electrostatic lock, supported by the substrate and facing the bottom surface of the arm, the lock, when activated by a second voltage, providing an electrical force sufficient to hold the free end of the arm in position. There is no disclosure in the '827 Application of a tamper resistant, single time, hardwired programming circuitry connected to each of the image elements to program the image elements so as to restrict the microelectrical-mechanical device to displaying a predetermined image upon actuation.","As stated in the foregoing, in view of the many security concerns in today's society, there exists a need for a single-time, hard-wire programming, tamper-resistant image device which provides multiple uses including identification.","A preferred embodiment of the present invention prevents photo substitution or alteration through the use of an embedded dynamic photo ID system comprising a MEMS cantilever array. By assembling the image from physically small, moving elements, the MEMS cantilever array cannot be duplicated without significant investments in capital equipment and micro-fabrication expertise\u2014preventing low-level, poorly funded organizations from covertly replacing\/altering the image. Furthermore, the present invention simultaneously takes advantage of economies of scale (like with integrated circuit manufacturing) to keep single element cost down for the producer, with the end user performing a single-time, irreversible programming of each unit.","A preferred embodiment utilizes a series of MEMS devices to project an image. The delicate nature of the physical structures in these dynamic IDs greatly inhibit manual tampering, while their dynamic nature prohibits substitution with a static image (like a printed picture). In contrast to conventional devices, the invention described herein has several distinct advantages, including the following: Dynamic photo IDs (or images) cannot be duplicated with low-cost printing and lamination equipment, significantly raising the capital cost of forgery attempts, (2) Small size and delicacy of components inhibits manual tampering without irreparably damaging image; device performance. No external reader is required for interrogation of embedded photo information as visual inspection using ambient lighting conditions is the intended output, (3) Small mass and movement range requires extremely low amounts of energy to cause desired result (and little control is necessary over the exact angle of deflection), (4) Hard-wired pictures are inherently immune to software\/hacking attacks, (5) Embodiments are also envisioned where optical interrogation from a distance would be advantageous, such as using tailored reflector arrays to serve as visual indicators of sensor outputs, enabling remote sensor interrogation via lasers or optics. Each of the preferred embodiments described in this specification can be implemented separately or in conjunction with each other.","Other uses of this technology could include sensor or data interrogation at either short or large distances by using the reflective nature of the image as a sensor indicator. The technology could also be adapted for novelty items where multiple images appear as a result of various inputs (for example, as force-feedback in physical manipulators\/tools or as low resolution displays on the surface of toys).","These and other aspects of the embodiments of the invention will be better appreciated and understood when considered in conjunction with the following description and the accompanying drawings. It should be understood, however, that the following descriptions, while indicating preferred embodiments of the invention and numerous specific details thereof, are given by way of illustration and not of limitation. Many changes and modifications may be made within the scope of the embodiments of the invention without departing from the spirit thereof, and the embodiments of the invention include all such modifications.","A more complete appreciation of the invention will be readily obtained by reference to the following Description of the Preferred Embodiments and the accompanying drawings in which like numerals in different figures represent the same or corresponding structures or elements. Similar functioning elements are represented using a suffix such as A, B, or C. The representations in each of the figures are diagrammatic and no attempt is made to indicate actual scales or precise ratios. Proportional relationships are shown as approximates.","The embodiments of the invention and the various features and advantageous details thereof are explained more fully with reference to the non-limiting embodiments that are illustrated in the accompanying drawings and detailed in the following description. It should be noted that the features illustrated in the drawings are not necessarily drawn to scale. Descriptions of well-known components and processing techniques are omitted so as to not unnecessarily obscure the embodiments of the invention. The examples used herein are intended merely to facilitate an understanding of ways in which the embodiments of the invention may be practiced and to further enable those of skilled in the art to practice the embodiments of the invention. Accordingly, the examples should not be construed as limiting the scope of the embodiments of the invention.","The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to limit the full scope of the invention. As used herein, the singular forms \u201ca\u201d, \u201can\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will be further understood that the terms \u201ccomprises\u201d and\/or \u201ccomprising,\u201d when used in this specification, specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements, and\/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, and\/or groups thereof.","It will be understood that when an element such as an object, layer, region or substrate is referred to as being \u201con\u201d or extending \u201conto\u201d another element, it can be directly on or extend directly onto the other element or intervening elements may also be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being \u201cdirectly on\u201d or extending \u201cdirectly onto\u201d another element, there are no intervening elements present. It will also be understood that when an element is referred to as being \u201cconnected\u201d or \u201ccoupled\u201d to another element, it can be directly connected or coupled to the other element or intervening elements may be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being \u201cdirectly connected\u201d or \u201cdirectly coupled\u201d to another element, there are no intervening elements present.","It will be understood that, although the terms first, second, etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, components, regions, layers and\/or sections, these elements, components, regions, layers and\/or sections should not be limited by these terms. For example, when referring first and second photons in a photon pair, these terms are only used to distinguish one element, component, region, layer or section from another region, layer or section. Thus, a first element, component, region, layer or section discussed below could be termed a second element, component, region, layer or section without departing from the teachings of the present invention.","Furthermore, relative terms, such as \u201clower\u201d or \u201cbottom\u201d and \u201cupper\u201d or \u201ctop,\u201d may be used herein to describe one element's relationship to other elements as illustrated in the Figures. It will be understood that relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in addition to the orientation depicted in the Figures. For example, if the device in the Figures is turned over, elements described as being on the \u201clower\u201d side of other elements would then be oriented on \u201cupper\u201d sides of the other elements. The exemplary term \u201clower\u201d, can therefore, encompass both an orientation of \u201clower\u201d and \u201cupper,\u201d depending of the particular orientation of the figure. Similarly, if the device in one of the figures is turned over, elements described as \u201cbelow\u201d or \u201cbeneath\u201d other elements would then be oriented \u201cabove\u201d the other elements. The exemplary terms \u201cbelow\u201d or \u201cbeneath\u201d can, therefore, encompass both an orientation of above and below. Furthermore, the term \u201couter\u201d may be used to refer to a surface and\/or layer that is farthest away from a substrate.","Embodiments of the present invention are described herein with reference to cross-section illustrations that are schematic illustrations of idealized embodiments of the present invention. As such, variations from the shapes of the illustrations as a result, for example, of manufacturing techniques and\/or tolerances, are to be expected. Thus, embodiments of the present invention should not be construed as limited to the particular shapes of regions illustrated herein but are to include deviations in shapes that result, for example, from manufacturing. For example, a region or object illustrated as a rectangular will, typically, have tapered, rounded or curved features. Thus, the regions illustrated in the figures are schematic in nature and their shapes are not intended to illustrate the precise shape of a region of a device and are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention.","Unless otherwise defined, all terms (including technical and scientific terms) used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. It will be further understood that terms, such as those defined in commonly used dictionaries, should be interpreted as having a meaning that is consistent with their meaning in the context of the relevant art and will not be interpreted in an idealized or overly formal sense unless expressly so defined herein.","It will also be appreciated by those of skill in the art that references to a structure or feature that is disposed \u201cadjacent\u201d another feature may have portions that overlap or underlie the adjacent feature.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1A","FIG. 1A","FIG. 1","FIG. 1A","FIG. 1","FIG. 3"],"b":["10","2","3","4","5","6","6","2","3","7","2","3","10","10"]},"Depending on the intended application and usage (virtually no work being performed by the actuator, precise control over deflection angle not required), the design space available for actuator implementation becomes quite large. Actuator design may be focused on maximizing deflection angle as a function of applied voltage for a given area. Potential capabilities include mirror deflection angle >45 degrees and power consumption of <1 \u03bcW for a 1 cmarray (\u02dc1-2 \u03bcJ per view). Simulations in  show that basic cantilevers with lengths <200 \u03bcm may be easily achieved sufficient tip angle for easy viewability by correctly choosing the structural layer thickness. For more compact designs, torsional actuators utilizing a cascade of cantilevers may be utilized for their additive angular deflection nature (see ).","Preferred embodiments of the present invention incorporate fault tolerant design techniques. For example, scaling of single actuators towards highly parallel arrays involves consideration of fault tolerant design features so that a single short circuit failure does not render the entire array inoperable. Protective resistor structures may be incorporated periodically to maintain a voltage drop in case of a short (at the expense of increased power consumption).","Hard-wire encoding is a security feature of the preferred embodiment dynamic ID (shown in ) as an image may be hard-wired using segments or thin film fuses  (as shown in ). One of ordinary skill in the art could appreciate that alternatives to the removal of the segments or thin film fuses could be utilized; such as circuit breakers, chemical etching, physical removal, etc. At the time of card issue, a series of current pulses would be sent through the array to destroy thin film resistor interconnects beneath particular pixels , rendering them permanently \u2018dead.\u2019 It is anticipated that the pulse sequence could be carried out on the order of a few seconds with a computer and probe card. By physically destroying the electrical interconnect by a fuse method (or by physical removal of the segment ), reprogramming the pixel could only be accomplished by re-wiring the micron-scale path via focused ion beam (FIB) or another expensive and\/or slow technique. Multiple fuse and interconnect designs may be utilized to ease initial programming while increasing difficulty of later manipulation (like hiding fuses beneath their mirrors to complicate access).","Those skilled in the art of MEMS will recognize that piezoelectric, electromagnetic, thermal, or other common MEMS techniques could be used to generate similar actuation characteristics (as done in MEMS switches etc). Electrostatic actuation is described herein for simplicity of operation\/drive and its inherently low power draw which is attractive for portable applications like ID cards where on-board power solutions are limited. While a cantilever implementation is shown, for example, in , for simplicity, embodiments utilizing other MEMS-type reflectors can be substituted without departing from the spirit of the invention with potential tradeoffs in design, fabrication, performance, and\/or reliability. Among the many possibilities beyond simple cantilevers, though not a complete list, are: doubly-clamped beams, periphery-supported membranes, hinged mirrors, and ribbon diffraction gratings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 1A","b":["2","8","8","8"]},"In the \u201cOFF\u201d position as shown in the top portion of , incident light perpendicular to the base  is reflected back in a direction perpendicular to substrate or base  into the eye of the observer as indicated by the arrows in .

The exact angle of deflection from one \u2018active\u2019 pixel to the next is largely unimportant so long as the reflective state is significantly different from de-activated pixels. Multiple fuses and gate electrodes could be integrated to store\/display multiple images.","It can be appreciate by those of ordinary skill in the art that the X-Y array of pixels may be any number of rows and columns and may be controlled by programming or addressing circuitry; such as, for example, addressing circuitry resembling that disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,710,732, hereby incorporated by reference as though fully rewritten herein.","Another feature which may be implemented in a preferred embodiment of the present invention, as shown in , is the implementation of power sources and dynamic reflector elements into a single, low-profile package (such as an ID card). The potential voltage\/power sources include thermoelectric generators, thin-film batteries, electric generators, or piezoelectric crystals or bi-morphs ( as shown in ). Such technologies could potentially be fabricated on a single substrate or hybrid packaged in a thin profile (mm to sub-mm scale) format, as shown for example in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["20","20","11","20","20","20","20","20"]},"Another feature which may be implemented in a preferred embodiment of the present invention is the use of external inputs to cause a change in applied voltage (or stimulus) to the array. Physical pressure\/force could be used to close a switch to a battery, or deflect static (or resonant) piezoelectric or electric generators. Thermal gradients (from a human, flame, or other heat source) could be directly converted into voltage via the thermoelectric effect. For photo ID's, once the applied voltage reaches a critical level, all \u201cactive\u201d reflector elements will actuate simultaneously, revealing the pre-programmed image.","As an alternative to the powered embodiment of , the battery or power switch  could be replaced by remote actuation by an external device which energizes the pixels to an \u201cON\u201d state using a remote, externally supplied, energy source or signal emitted from a unique signal generator.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":"3"},"Another optional feature which may be implemented in a preferred embodiment of the present invention is to operate a similar reflector array as a remotely interrogated sensor display\/indicator, where a progressively increasing input\/voltage causes successive actuation of reflective elements to indicate the magnitude of the input (see ). Such an embodiment could be easily implemented using geometry of the reflector elements. For example, the successively shorter cantilevers in the figure require different voltage levels for actuation. Remote visual sensor interrogation is achieved by identifying which reflector elements have been actuated because the voltage applied to that array is correlated to the input force magnitude.","Another feature which may be implemented in a preferred embodiment of the present invention is to directly print\/fabricate dynamic reflector elements onto an existing ID substrate. This approach provides further tamper-resistance, as the reflector array on one card cannot simply be \u2018cut out\u2019 and replaced by a different reflector array obtained and programmed separately. Alternatively, the secondary display may be formed by alternative technology (LEDs, LCD's, e-ink, etc.) using general thin display technologies where the image is hard wired with fuses as in the example shown in , or where the image is encrypted in a driver chip also on the card or substrate. The power source (either a thin battery or potentially a piezoelectric or other generator\/scavenger) preferably is embedded in the substrate or card.","Another feature which may be implemented in a preferred embodiment of the present invention is the incorporation of the reflector elements onto a flexible substrate (rather than traditional silicon) to create a flexible display of the type described above. The simplistic design and fabrication of the reflector elements using surface micromachining provides this flexibility in manufacturing, allowing for rigid or flexible, expensive or cheap, substrates depending on application requirements. Flexible implementations may be attractive particularly in a novelty market such as toys, while expensive rigid substrates may be desired for increased complexity or integration of electronics.","Another feature which may be implemented in a preferred embodiment of the present invention is the use of support posts or beams B between said reflector elements to prevent routine handling of the device from collapsing the package into the fragile reflector elements, as shown in .","Photographic identification cards are a nearly universal technique for identity verification. Applications range from limiting personnel access to numerous types of property (rooms, flights, etc) to verifying identity for participation in public, private, or events (like voting, driving, drinking alcohol). The ability to embed a dynamic photograph or image in such cards would provide the user unparalleled security and confidence that the card has not been altered nor forged and remains in its original state for comparison to the bearer of said card. Concepts similar to those presented in the embodiments described herein could also be extended to embedded sensing capability where visual displays correlate directly to sensor input. One possibility would be a self-powered pressure sensor node that causes successive mirrors to pull down with increasing applied force, resulting in an optically interrogated signal directly correlated to the pressure\/force applied to the sensor (see ). Small scale displays on novelty items could easily be envisioned where company logo's and the like are alternately displayed based on simple user inputs like pressure or temperature.","A preferred embodiment of the present invention utilizes the concept of an array of MEMS-type reflectors (or similar devices) to display a hard-wired photo ID (or other image) upon actuation. The reflector array may comprise either single or multiple hard-wired images (or indicator patterns) that are displayed based on a single (or multiple) input(s). The hard-wire encoding of said image through a single-time high current pulse to destroy thin film resistor interconnects is resistant to tampering. At least one preferred embodiment incorporates surface or bulk micro-machinable MEMS reflector arrays where the reflective elements are doubly clamped beams, simply-anchored cantilevers, peripherally supported membranes, hinged mirrors, ribbon diffraction gratings, or other common MEMS elements. At least one preferred embodiment utilizes actuation for moving said MEMS reflectors between two distinctive states simultaneously using an integrated actuation mechanism as depicted in , for example. Although electrostatic actuation may be preferred, other options include piezoelectric, magnetic, thermal, or other common MEMS actuation approaches. The layout of said reflector array in a thin film implementation is particularly an option for incorporation into a slim profile package such as a driver's license, credit card, etc.","An additional optional feature of the present invention is the integration approach for including a thin profile power source for mechanically stimulated generation of actuation signal to said reflector arrays; such as for example, integrated circuits, piezo elements, or thermoelectrics for producing an electrical signal. The reflector array may be fabricated directly onto an ID card (as shown in ) or other substrate to prevent array-swapping. Optionally, the integration of said reflector array  onto either rigid or flexible substrates  such as, for example plastics or reinforced paper, depending on application requirements (such as desire for integrated electronics, tamper resistance, or exceedingly cheap manufacturing). The reflector array  may be adapted as a visual indicator for mechanically or electrically induced sensor output can be remotely interrogated. Moreover, the incorporation of integrated protection features (such as supports or beams B) prevent damage to reflector arrays during packaging\/covering of the device.","As shown in , an embodiment of the present invention may comprise a secondary dynamic display A for secure ID cards based on an array of piezoelectrically-driven MEMS mirrors. At the time of ID card issue, each reflector element in the array will receive an irreversible hard-wire programming by the issuer to encode a pattern of \u2018alive\u2019 and \u2018dead\u2019 pixels that corresponds to the primary photo of the card bearer. Under an applied stimulus (i.e. squeeze a \u2018power button\u2019 ), a voltage is applied to the \u2018alive\u2019 pixels to reveal the encoded image. By comparing the image created by the hard-wired MEMS mirror array with the adjacent printed photo, one can quickly and easily determine if the photo has indeed been tampered with. The security benefits of such an approach are three-fold: (1) Delicate nature of the physical structures makes manual manipulation nearly impossible; (2) Irreversible hard-wiring using thin-film fuses prevent re-programming of the array; and (3) Dynamic behavior prohibits substitution with cheap static images (like a printed picture), significantly raising the capital equipment costs of forgery attempts.","The actuator technology for this dynamic secured ID concept is the use of low power, large displacement, thin film piezoelectric MEMS actuators; such as those used in various PZT MEMS devices, including RF switches (see ), resonators, micro-robotics, and energy harvesters. The actuators are capable of maximizing angular deflection for each pixel to achieve high contrast in the resulting image. Pixel sizes should approach the resolution achieved in many standard printers of 300 dots per inch (nominally \u02dc85 \u03bcm\/pixel), though 150-200 dpi may be sufficient for this \u2018secondary\u2019 display. Given the intended application and usage (no work being performed by the actuator, precise control over deflection angle not required), the design space available for actuator implementation becomes quite large. Actuator design will focus on maximizing deflection angle as a function of applied voltage for a given area. Initial performance targets include mirror deflection angle >45 degrees and power consumption of <1 \u03bcW for a 1 cm2 array (\u02dc1-2 \u03bcJ per view). Simulations in  show that basic cantilevers with lengths <200 \u03bcm should easily achieve sufficient tip angle for easy viewability by correctly choosing the structural layer thickness. For more compact designs, torsional actuators utilizing a cascade of cantilevers actuators may be utilized for their additive angular deflection nature (as shown in ). Moreover, multiple color tones for color images may be produced using mechanical gratings, color filters, or mechanical displacement effects that correlate to the actuator angular tip displacement degrees as depicted in . Such multiple color tones provide additional security in that the angular tip displacement would provide increased protection against modification by those interested in identity theft. Moreover, remote external sensors could be used in conjunction with the embodiments of the present invention to power or detect changes or modifications in the ID card or imaging device.","As shown in , an advantage of the present invention is capability of providing the low profile on-board power source for dynamic ID card implementation. Numerous potential voltage\/power sources may optionally be used, starting with piezoelectric generators (i.e. piezo \u2018button\u2019) and thin-film batteries. Applications will depend in part on power consumption levels and voltage requirements for each chosen format. Optionally, as shown in , an external stimulus of pressure applied between the thumb and forefinger may drive piezo or electric switch requirements.","Additional features may include embedded integration with plastic ID card substrates to prevent original array replacement with another \u2018drop-in\u2019 array; advanced fuse and actuation mechanisms to enable multiple hard-wired images such as front and side-profile shots depending on the stimulus; modified fabrication flows to include supports between pixels to act as \u201ctent posts\u201d that prevent collapse of an overlaid laminate above each mirror; partial-angle actuation techniques to create low-order gray-scale images.","It should be emphasized that the above-described embodiments are merely possible examples of implementations. Many variations and modifications may be made to the above-described embodiments. All such modifications and variations are intended to be included herein within the scope of the disclosure and protected by the following claims.
