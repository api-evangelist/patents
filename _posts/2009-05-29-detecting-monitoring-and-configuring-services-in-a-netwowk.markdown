title: Detecting, monitoring, and configuring services in a netwowk
abstract: A services tool can detect, monitor, and manage software providing services in and for the network. The services tool can identify different types of software that provides services for the network (“services software”) and types of software that provide support (“support software”) to the services software. The services tool can determine configuration data for both the services software and the support software. The services tool can automatically identify when particular services software needs to be linked to particular support software. The services tool can configure the services software and/or support software to link the two according to the rules.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD","DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This invention relates generally to network management.","Most entities such as companies and universities operate large networks of computing systems. These networks are typically made up of a wide variety of computing systems, such as servers providing various services and individual computing systems. As such, the computing systems in the network varying greatly in the hardware and software contained in the computing systems. Additionally, the computing systems in the network are often located in different physical locations. For example, a company may operate a network which spans multiple geographic regions (e.g. cities, countries, continents) and multiple regions in a single geographic region (e.g. multiple office building, different floors in the office building, different offices in the office building).","One or more system administrators are tasked with the job of tracking and maintaining the computing systems in the network. This involves diagnosing and fixing problems in the computing systems, insuring that the systems are properly configured, and the like. This involves also maintaining the programs and applications running in the network. Often, the programs and application are interconnected. For example, the services provided by one program (e.g. email server providing email services) may be supported by another program in the network (e.g. backup server providing email backup). These large networks also tend to grow and change organically over time. New computing systems may be added to the network or computing systems may be removed from the network. Additionally, the computing systems themselves change over time. The computing systems are reconfigured, new hardware and software are added, hardware and software are upgraded, and the like. As such, the administrator of these large networks are presented with a large and every-changing task of tracking the computing systems. Thus, it can be difficult to track and maintain the interdependency of programs and applications running the network.","For simplicity and illustrative purposes, the principles of the present teachings are described by referring mainly to exemplary embodiments thereof. However, one of ordinary skill in the art would readily recognize that the same principles are equally applicable to, and can be implemented in, all types of information and systems, and that any such variations do not depart from the true spirit and scope of the present teachings. Moreover, in the following detailed description, references are made to the accompanying figures, which illustrate specific embodiments. Electrical, mechanical, logical and structural changes may be made to the embodiments without departing from the spirit and scope of the present teachings. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense and the scope of the present teachings is defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.","Embodiments of the present teachings relate to systems and methods for managing a network of computing systems and devices. More particularly, an administrator can utilize a services tool to manage the interdependency of software providing services in the network.","According to embodiments, an administrator system can be configured to include a services tool. The services tool can be configured to detect, monitor, and manage software providing services in and for the network. The services tool can be configured to identify different types of software that provide services for the network (\u201cservices software\u201d) and types of software that provide support (\u201csupport software\u201d) to the services software. The services tool can be configured to determine configuration data for both the services software and the support software.","According to embodiments, the services tool can be configured to automatically identify when particular services software needs to be linked to particular support software. The services tool can be configured to receive rules that define the interdependency of the services software and the support software. The services tool can be configured to identify services software that is not currently linked to the support software according to the rule. The services tool can configure the services software and\/or support software to link the two according to the rules.","By utilizing the services tool, the administrator system can provide robust tools for identifying software in the network whether providing services or supporting other software in the network. Likewise, the administrator tool can automate the process for configuring the services and support software to be properly connected. As such, the services tool can reduce the time and effort of managing the network.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","102","104","100","100"]},"In embodiments, the network system  can include a number of computing systems connected by one or more networks .

The services tool  can be configured to directly query and examine the supervisory host  and the computing systems  in order to determine the services software  and the support software  and the configuration data for the services software  and the support software . To enable this, the services tool  can be configured to include the necessary logic, commands, and protocols to query and to examine each of the supervisory hosts  and the computing systems  in order to determine the services software  and the support software  and the configuration data for the services software  and the support software .","In embodiments, the services tool  can be configured to communicate with other systems in order to determine the services software  and the support software  and the configuration data for the services software  and the support software . The services tool  can be configured communicate with a network management system . The network management system  can be any type of network management application or tool, located separate from or incorporated in the administrator system , to securely communicate with the supervisory hosts  and the computing systems , to monitor the state of the supervisory hosts  and the computing systems , to retrieve and request data from the supervisory hosts  and the computing systems , and to manage and direct the supervisory hosts  and the computing systems .
