{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The subject matter described herein, in general, relates to restricting activity of a communication device and, in particular, relates to locking a communication device for a time period to a particular communication network.","Networked communication is an indispensable means of information exchange in today's society. In a typical networked communication system, remote communication devices communicate via a wired or wireless connection over a network operated by a network service provider. Various network service providers use different methods to authenticate the devices for use over their network.","In a typical networked communication system, such as in a Global System of Mobile (GSM) based mobile communication system, the network service provider gives a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) in the form of an integrated circuit (IC) card to a user. When the communication device initiates a communication request, a unique International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) number, stored in the IC card of the communication device, is transmitted over the network to the network service provider.","Many a times, the network service providers offer a subsidy in the form of subsidized mobile phones to users and price it such that the cost of subsidizing is recovered over a period of time through operating profits earned from service charges. To ensure effective recovery of the subsidy, the communication device is locked to the network service provider for a predetermined time period, i.e., the communication device cannot be used with a different network service provider during the predetermined time period.","In order to unlock the locked communication device, such as upon expiry of the predetermined time period, different unlocking methods are used. In one method, the memory of the communication device is reconfigured using a specialized equipment. In order to carry out such methods, the communication device needs to be physically taken to a service center. In another method, the communication device may include a password protected unlocking module. A password for activating the password protected unlocking module is set by the network service provider. In order to unlock the communication device, the user needs to request for the password from the network service provider.","Thus, all conventionally known unlocking methods usually involve one or more visits to the service center, and lead to wastage of time and cause inconvenience to the user. Also, such unlocking methods requires an action to be carried out by either the user, or the network service provider, or both, thus making the unlocking method time consuming, cumbersome, and results in delays.","Further, some of the locked communication devices are prone to hacking by individuals using methods commonly available over Internet. In this case, the network service provider is unable to effectively recover the cost of subsidizing the communication device.","Described herein is a communication system for implementing virtual locking and unlocking of the communication device. In one embodiment, virtual locking and unlocking methods are implemented such that the communication device can be operated without an IC card, such as a SIM card, during a locked mode of operation. A tool kit of the communication device to house the IC card, referred to as an IC tool kit hereinafter, is used for locking or unlocking the communication device. During the locked mode of operation, the IC tool kit is disabled. Thus, the communication device can be used only on a network of the network service provider based on an equipment identification number of the communication device. During the locked mode, the communication device transmits the equipment identification number to a server of a communication network. The communication network server dynamically allocates an IMSI number in response to the equipment identification number to facilitate the communication process.","The communication device can be unlocked automatically, without any trigger, after expiry of the validity period and the IC tool kit is enabled. After expiry of the validity period, unlocking is implemented automatically, i.e., without requiring an initiation on part of either a user of the communication device or the network service provider. Time period of the validity period is stored in a memory of the communication device.","The disclosed subject matter relates to virtual locking of communication devices. The exemplary methods and systems are described below with reference to communication devices that may be used in any wireless or wired communication system. A communication device, such as a mobile phone, a set top box, and a modem, allows a user to communicate over a wired or wireless network provided by a network service provider. For the purpose of establishing a connection, the communication device is authenticated by the network service provider and thereafter services are made available to the user. As per the business requirements, the network service provider may lock the communication device to its network for a predetermined time period. The predetermined time period is referred to as a validity period hereinafter.","For the purpose of illustration, the network service provider to which the communication device is locked is referred to as a home network service provider. Any different network service provider, other than the home network service provider, has been referred to as a non-home network service provider.","During the validity period, the communication device cannot authenticate itself on the non-home network service provider using the IC card offered by the non-home network service provider. For the purpose, the user of the communication device and the home network service provider may enter into a contract and during the validity period of the contract, the user's communication device is locked to the home network service provider.","One of the methods to lock the communication device to a communication network, which is compatible with the standard(s) promulgated by GSM, includes storing an IMSI number in a memory of the communication device. The IMSI number stored in the memory is the same as the IMSI number stored in the IC card.","In this method, transmission of the IMSI number, for authentication of the communication request, is allowed only after validating the IMSI number stored in the IC card against the IMSI number stored in the memory of the communication device locked to the network service provider. This network bound communication device is also referred to as a locked communication device. As a result, the locked communication device can be used only with the IC card provided by the network service provider. This is usually referred to as an IC card dependent method, since the communication device is locked to the network service provider through the IC card. Other electronic communication devices, such as set top boxes, and wireless modems, also use similar methods to lock the device to a particular service provider.","The subject matter described herein relates to a system and method to restrict functioning of the communication device, such as a mobile phone, to the network of the home network service provider in a way that does not require the IC card to be present inside the communication device. The restriction on the functioning can be made reversible, since the restriction is designed to be withdrawn automatically, i.e., without requiring any initiation from the user or the home network service provider, after expiry of the validity period. Till the expiry of the validity period, the device is locked to the home network service provider. After the expiry of the validity period, the communication device gets automatically unlocked without any intervention from the user or the home network service provider. Thereafter, the user is free to use the communication device with a different IC Card provided by either the home or the non-home network service provider.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","100","102","102","106","104","102"]},"Though the following description has been provided with reference to a cellular communication system as an example, it will be understood that the system  can be implemented in any communication system, such as data communication system, or video communication system, using any communication device.","The network  may be a wired network, a wireless network, or an interconnected hybrid network comprising of wireless and wired networks. The network  may be a dedicated one, i.e., provided and maintained by a single network service provider, or a shared one, i.e., provided and maintained by a number of network service providers. The device  can be used by the user who is a user of at least one of the network service providers operating on the network . In the case of cellular telephony, the device  may communicate over the network  through a multitude of Base Transceiver Stations (BTSs) and Base Station Controllers (BSCs).","The network  is communicatively coupled to a communication server . The communication server , also referred to as server  hereinafter, may be implemented through various computing devices including, but not limited to, a general purpose computing device, multiple networked servers (arranged in clusters or as a server farm), a mainframe, and so forth. The server  may be a dedicated server, for example, provided and maintained by a single service provider, or it may be a shared server, for example, provided and maintained by a number of service providers.","The server  includes a server memory , which stores various modules such as an authentication module , an allocation module , and a server data module . The server memory  can be a combination of any known types of memory systems and a part of the server memory  may be hosted on a computing device that is physically separated from the server .","For the purposes of illustration, consider a cellular telephony system, wherein the device  is a cellular phone, the network  is a shared network monitored by a number of network service providers, and the server  is a server maintained by the home network service provider. In order to establish a connection, for example, to make a voice call or to send a message over the network , the communication device  first transmits the communication request for authentication to the server  of the home network service provider. When the device  is locked to the home network service provider, the device  is not authenticated by any other server that does not belong to the home network service provider.","In the locked mode, in one embodiment, the device  can be authenticated by the server , provided by the home network service provider, without requiring an IC card to be present in the device . For authentication, the device  transmits an equipment identification number (EIN), such as an International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) number, over the network  to the server .","The authentication module  in the server  determines whether the IMEI number corresponds to an equipment that is locked to the home network service provider by comparing the IMEI number with a list of valid IMEI numbers stored in a database of the server data module . On successful authentication, the IMEI number is forwarded to the allocation module  for dynamic allocation of a temporary International Mobiles Subscriber Identity (IMSI) number corresponding to the received IMEI number. Using the IMSI number, the device  is able to communicate successfully over the network .","The allocation module  maps the temporary IMSI number with the IMEI number of the device  based on a list of available IMSI numbers stored in the database of the server data module . For authentication and allocation of the temporary IMSI number, the authentication module  and the allocation module  may use a series of authentication and encryption algorithms known in the art. Once the connection is to be refreshed, a new IMSI number may be allocated to the device  by mapping a new available IMSI number with the IMEI number of the device .","Thus the device  is locked to the home network service provider based on the IMEI number of the device  during the validity period. Further, to ensure that the user does not use any other IC card with the locked device , the IC tool kit required to operate the IC card is blocked. One exemplary mechanism to lock the device  has been explained in detail below with reference to .","Though the above description has been provided with reference to the IMEI number and the temporary IMSI number, it is understood that the system can be implemented using any equipment identification number associated with the device  and any subscriber identification number associated with the home network service provider.","In one implementation, the device  can be locked to the home network service provider such that the locking can be withdrawn automatically after expiry of the validity period, i.e., no action is required on part of either the user or the home network service provider to carry out unlocking. Once locking is automatically withdrawn after expiry of the validity period, the device  can operate with any other IC card in a manner similar to any other conventional communication equipment available in the prior art.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","102","102","202","204","214","216","206"]},"The processor(s)  may include, for example, microprocessors, microcomputers, microcontrollers, digital signal processors, central processing units, state machines, logic circuitries, and\/or any devices that manipulate signals based on operational instructions. Among other capabilities, the processor(s)  are configured to fetch and execute computer-readable instructions stored in the memory .","The interface(s)  may include a variety of software and hardware interfaces, for example, network interfaces like a radio transceiver circuit, user interfaces, such as input\/output systems, application programming interfaces like an internal equipment clock, a calendar etc., or a combination of such interfaces. The interface(s)  facilitate user interaction with the device  as well as reception and transmission of communication signals over the network .","The system memory  may include any computer-readable medium known in the art including, for example, volatile memory (e.g., RAM) and\/or non-volatile memory (e.g., flash, etc.). In one implementation, the system memory  includes a one time programmable module , an equipment data module , and an Operating System (OS)\/Application module .","The one-time-programmable (OTP) module  comprises one time programmable (OTP) memory that stores security data related to the unlocking, of the device . The OTP memory can be a read only memory (ROM) and is well known in the art. The OTP module  protects security data from being hacked into or reprogrammed, and thus ensures that the user abides by the validity period of locking as the data stored in the OTP memory can not be tampered with. The security data may include a time duration or recovery time after which the device  is to be unlocked, a time stamp indicating when the lock was implemented and another time stamp indicating the time when the lock will be disabled. The device  may also store any other data, essential to implement time-based locking\/unlocking of the device . The security data can be stored in an encrypted format in the OTP module .","During operation, the security data is used to determine the current mode of operation, i.e., whether the device  is to be operated in the locked mode or the unlocked mode. The current mode of operation depends on the expiry of the validity period. A representative OTP memory is commercially available and can be obtained from manufacturers such as Matrix Semiconductors Inc. or Analog Devices, Inc. The OTP memory may be programmed using a programming tool to program the OTP memory or programming the OTP memory while manufacturing the communication device, in one implementation.","The equipment data module  stores equipment identity data like the equipment identity number (EIN) related to the device . For example, in case of cellular phones, the equipment data module  may store the IMEI number. The equipment data module  may also include other data required for operation of the device . The OS\/Application module  includes an operating system, utility applications, and user interface applications required for the functioning of the device .","Further, the device  may include the IC tool kit  to enable the usage of the IC card for connection to a communication network once the device  has been unlocked. For the purposes of illustration, the IC tool kit  tool kit can be a combination of hardware interfaces to house an IC card and to read subscriber identity data like a subscriber identity number (SIN) or an IMSI number stored in the IC card.","Further, the device  may also include the PMU  that manages the power supply to the device . The PMU  can be implemented in the form of an entirely hardware embodiment, an entirely software embodiment, or an embodiment containing both hardware and software elements. In one embodiment PMU  comprises a power source. The power source can preferably be any power source, such as battery, capable of supplying the power required by the device .","In the locked mode of operation, the power supply to the IC tool kit  is interrupted by the PMU . Due to interruption in the supply of power, the IC tool kit  is deactivated. In the deactivated state, the functionality provided by the IC tool kit  is not available. As a result, the IC Card inserted in the IC tool kit  can not be used for the purposes of communication. Therefore, in the locked period, the device  transmits the IMEI number from the equipment data module  to the network  for authentication by the home network service provider.","In the unlocked mode of operation, that is, after the expiry of the validity period, the PMU  maintains the required supply of power to the IC tool kit . The supply of power to the IC tool kit  renders it activated. In the activated state, the device  can read the IC card inserted in the IC tool kit . Therefore, the device  can transmit the IMSI number, which is read from the IC card. In another implementation, the device  uses the IMEI number without using the IC tool kit , even in the unlocked mode. This may happen, for example, in a situation where the user wishes to continue with the home network service provider, even after expiry of the validity period.","In one implementation, the PMU  activates or deactivates IC tool kit  by monitoring the power supplied to the IC tool kit . However, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various other measures may be used to activate or deactivate the IC tool kit .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","106","106","302","304","108","110","112","114"]},"The processor(s)  may include, for example, microprocessors, microcomputers, microcontrollers, digital signal processors, central processing units, state machines, logic circuitries, or any other devices that manipulate signals based on operational instructions.

The interface(s)  facilitate maintenance and operator control of the server  as well as reception and transmission of communication signals over the network .","The server memory  may include any computer-readable medium known in the art including, for example, volatile memory (e.g., RAM) and\/or non-volatile memory (e.g., flash, etc.).","The server authentication module , also referred to as an authentication module , is used to authenticate a connection on the basis of identification of data or identity number(s) received over the network . The authentication module  determines whether the identity number received is an equipment identity number (EIN) or a subscriber identity number (SIN), which, as described above, may correspond to whether the device  is operating without the IC card, such as in the locked mode, referred to as IC tool kit deactivated mode hereinafter, or with the IC card in the unlocked mode, referred to as IC tool kit activated mode hereinafter.","After determining the nature of the identity number, the authentication module  authenticates the identity number using a relevant subscriber information database included in the server data module . On authentication, the server allocation module  is used to dynamically allocate the IMSI number to a connection request authenticated via the EIN. The dynamic nature of allocation entails that for a connection to be established, the temporary IMSI number is allocated out of a pool of available IMSI numbers acquired in real-time from a database of the server data module . The temporary IMSI number so allocated can be configured to be valid only for the purpose of a current connection so that subsequent connections carried out under similar conditions may require a different IMSI number being allocated to the same device .","In addition to the above mentioned database, the server data module  may also include databases required for functions like billing, call routing, equipment location identification, and so forth.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","214","214","102"]},"An exemplary method  for activating or deactivating the IC tool kit  is initiated at a process block . The initiation may be a result of events occurring on either the server  or the device . Initiation of the exemplary method  may occur periodically after a week, a month or so. Initiation of the method  may also be initiated as and when the device  is switched on, or the device  avails roaming facility, or the like. Further, the initiation may be a result of a standard operating procedure of the device , for example, during power up, or a result of a user driven event, or a result of a combination of such events.","At block , once the initiation of method  is triggered, the OTP module  is read and date and time values stored in the OTP module  are obtained. At block , current date is obtained. In an exemplary embodiment, current date and time can be obtained from a real time clock in the device  or from the network service provider. At block , the date obtained from the OTP module  and the current date obtained are compared.","At block , expiry of the validity period is assessed and accordingly either step  or step  is executed. In case the outcome of the block  indicates that the validity period has expired, the IC tool kit  is activated at process block . Thereafter, at step , the device  enters the IC tool kit activated mode of operation. This mode of operation of the device may be implemented, for example, through setting of a flag value stored in the system memory .","At block , in case the outcome indicates that the validity period has not expired, the decision block transfers control directly to step . At block , the IC tool kit is deactivated and thereafter at step , the device  enters the IC tool kit deactivated mode. Thus, as long as the device  is in the IC tool kit deactivated mode, the IC tool kit  remains disabled and does not read any IC card inserted therein. During the IC tool kit activated mode, the IC tool kit  of the device  is activated. As illustrated above, the device  will enter the IC tool kit activated mode only after the expiry of the validity period.","In one embodiment, the activation and deactivation of the IC tool kit  is achieved by managing the supply of power to the IC tool kit module . In one embodiment, the OS\/Application module  reads data stored in the OTP module  and checks for the expiry of the Validity Period. Subsequently, in response to the outcome of the checking process, a flag value stored in the system memory  is set. In one embodiment, if the value is set as \u20180\u2019, the OS\/Application module  directs the PMU  to stop the power supply to the IC tool kit , deactivating the IC tool kit . Similarly, if the flag value is set as \u20181\u2019, the OS\/Application module  will direct the PMU  to maintain the power supply to the IC tool kit  so that the IC tool kit  is activated.","Though the above illustration has been described with reference to the control of the PMU  by the OS\/Application module , it is understood that aforementioned implementation of managing the power supply to the IC tool kit  can be implemented in one or more ways.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","102","104","102"]},"Initiation of the exemplary method  occurs at block .
