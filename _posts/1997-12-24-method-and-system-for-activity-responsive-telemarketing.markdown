{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["This application is related to U.S. Patent Application entitled METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR ORIGINATING VOICE CALLS FROM A DATA NETWORK filed Oct. 10, 1997 and assigned Ser. No. 08\/948,975, the specification of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The present invention relates generally to telemarketing and, in particular, to directed telemarketing in response to activity of a potential customer browsing a public server which may be accessed through a data network such as the World Wide Web (WWW).","Telemarketing has matured to a significant industry in which a large number of companies compete for business. Today's telemarketing is based on a strategy of attempting to call qualified prospects at times when they are most likely to be at home. Lists of qualified prospects are often compiled from indirect sources that may poorly reflect past behaviour or may not accurately reflect current buying interests. Besides, qualified prospects are often not at home or are not interested in a sales pitch at the particular time they are called.","Consequently, much inventive ingenuity has been invested in making telemarketing systems more efficient to ensure that a maximum number of calls are handled in any given time period, in order to increase the number of sales opportunities. Such innovations include a system and method for out-dialling telephone calls on a basis which takes into account the availability of agents who are assigned to process telephone calls placed, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,553,133 which issued to Perkins on Sep. 3, 1996. The patent describes a system in which telephone calls are placed ahead of the availability of agents so that the overall productivity of the agents is increased. The number of telephone calls that should be placed is determined in light of the actual measurements of system performance and in light of performance objectives. Determinations are dynamically refined based on measurements of actual agent and telephone call activity provided by the telephone system.","While such innovations ensure that agent time is efficiently used, they do nothing to address the problem of targeting an audience that is interested in the product or service being marketed and available to respond to a call.","In recent years, the World Wide Web (WWW) has provided a constant presence for business which may be visited by potential customers. While the importance of the WWW has been increasingly accepted and tens of thousands of companies now have a presence on it, there is currently no provision to permit those companies to participate in the process of closing a sale. In its current form, the WWW does not support spontaneous behaviour that characterizes impulse buying.","Although recent innovations have provided mechanisms to permit interested individuals to contact company representatives using call request buttons, such as described in applicants' copending patent application described above, such mechanisms are passive and may be ignored by potential customers who would otherwise respond to a more immediate and personal contact.","There therefore exists a need for a method of telemarketing which is responsive to the specific activity of potential customers in order to ensure that effective contact with interested parties having focused attention is achieved.","It is an object of the invention to provide a method and a system for alerting a telemarketing agent of a promotion opportunity in response to activity of a potential customer browsing a public server.","It is a further object of the invention to provide a method and a system for automatically contacting a potential customer in response to activity of the potential customer browsing a public server and alerting a telemarketing agent of a promotion opportunity if the potential customer expresses an interest in communicating with a telemarketing agent.","It is yet a further object of the invention to provide a system for alerting a telemarketing agent of a promotion opportunity, wherein a call is automatically placed to the potential customer when an agent to which an alert message has been sent initiates a call process, the number for placing the call being retrieved automatically from a data terminal of the agent.","It is yet a further object of the invention to provide a method of determining when a telemarketing agent should be alerted to a promotion opportunity by examining the contents of a cookie received from a potential customer's browser.","It is yet a further object of the invention to provide a method of determining when a telemarketing agent should be alerted to a promotion opportunity, wherein if the potential customer refuses cookies, a session information table is maintained respecting the potential customer's session with the public server to determine whether some aspect of the session satisfies a predetermined criteria and the agent is sent an alert if the predetermined criteria is satisfied.","It is yet a further object of the invention to provide a method and an apparatus for automatically compiling a list of potential customers representing promotion opportunities when an agent is not available to receive a promotion opportunity alert in real time.","In accordance with the invention, there is therefore provided a method of alerting a telemarketing agent of a promotion opportunity in response to activity of a potential customer browsing a public server, comprising:\n\n","In accordance with a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of alerting a telemarketing agent of a promotion opportunity in response to a potential customer browsing a public server, comprising:\n\n","The invention further provides a system for alerting a telemarketing agent of a promotion opportunity in response to activity of a potential customer browsing a public server, comprising:\n\n","The invention therefore provides a method and a system of alerting a telemarketing agent of a promotion opportunity in response to activity of a potential customer browsing a public server. For the purposes of this document, the term public server means any server which may be accessed by a person other than the creator of the site supported by the server.","In accordance with the method, software which runs actively on the public server monitors the activity of individuals accessing the public server to determine whether the individual may qualify as a potential customer. If the activity of the individual indicates a potential customer, a message is sent to a telemarketing agent having access to a switched telephone network and to a data network through which messages are sent. On receipt of a message, the telemarketing agent preferably responds by dispatching an invitation to initiate contact to provide the potential customer with information and\/or effect a sale. The invitation may be a text message and associated form to permit the customer to respond with an indication of the type of contact they would prefer. The invitation may also be a multimedia message from the agent, or the like, if sufficient bandwidth is available.","The sending to a potential customer of an invitation to initiate contact may also be an automated process in which the invitation is sent before a telemarketing agent is advised of the presence of the potential customer at the public server. Potential customers who accept an invitation may be added to an agent call queue, from which agents select calls to be completed. If this option is used, the agent's workstation preferably runs a dedicated application which displays the call queue, current call status, call control options, etc.","The method and system in accordance with the invention permits agents to concurrently serve a plurality of public servers. It also obviates any requirement for a centralized call centre with automatic call distributors, etc. Agents may work from home, or be strategically positioned in small or large groups where economical or convenient. The system and method in accordance with the invention may also be used to accumulate potential customer contact lists at times when no agents are on duty. In order to accomplish this, the monitoring means is enabled to display a pop-up window which requests, for example, potential customers for a contact date, time and number at times when all agents are busy or none are available. This information can be stored and made available to agents when they come on duty so that calls are scheduled accordingly.","The methods and system in accordance with the invention also permits businesses to have a personal presence at a WWW site in much the same way as retail outlets maintain sales attendants in their stores. If the system is used in this way, the monitoring means for monitoring the activity of potential customers visiting the public server may be set so that an agent is advised as soon as someone accesses the WWW site, or after they have moved from the home page to any other page on the public server. Other criteria for alerts may also be used. In this mode of operation, the public server projects the \u201cfeel\u201d of a well attended retail store and potential and\/or repeat customers may receive personal attention.","The invention thereby provides a method and system of facilitating telemarketing to ensure efficient utilization of agents and guarantee that agents are contacting interested, focused potential and repeat customers rather than random or near random canvassing of the public at large.","This invention relates to a method and a system of alerting a telemarketing agent of a promotion opportunity in response to activity of a potential customer browsing a public server. The method involves the steps of monitoring the public server to determine if the activity of the potential customer at the public server satisfies a predefined criteria and sending an alert message to the telemarketing agent to advise the telemarketing agent of the promotion opportunity when the activity of the potential customer satisfies the predetermined criteria. The system in accordance with the invention includes software for monitoring the activity of a potential customer visiting at least one public server to access information, software for determining when the activity satisfies a predefined criteria, and software for alerting a telemarketing agent when the activity of a potential customer satisfies the predefined criteria.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"10"},"As shown in , each ISP has an Intranet  which is connected to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN)  in a manner well known in the art, and to the Internet  also in a manner well known in the art. Connected to the PSTN  are a plurality of subscribers. Many of the subscribers access the Internet  by way of an ISP using a dial-up connection to the PSTN . Access to the Internet  through the PSTN is generally accomplished using Personal Computers (PCs) such as a subscriber PC  which is connected to the PSTN  by a telephone line . In the case of that subscriber, only one telephone line  is available which is used for the PC  and the telephone  of the subscriber. Other subscribers may have two lines available such as dataline  which connects PC  to the PSTN  and a telephone line  which connects telephone  to the PSTN . Also connected to the PSTN  is a telemarketer which uses the system in accordance with the invention, generally indicated by reference . In this example, the telemarketer  has a plurality of agents which are furnished with telephones  and PCs . The telephones  are respectively connected to a PBX , which is in turn connected to PSTN  by a trunk group such as an ISDN trunk group, in a manner well known in the art. It should be understood that the telemarketer  need not operate a PBX  with agents geographically co-located. The telemarketing agents may be geographically dispersed. They may be located, for example, in a home or a place of business and may have a Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS) connection to the PSTN, although in accordance with one preferred embodiment of the invention they are preferably connected to a PSTN switching node that supports a warm-line or hot-line service, as will be discussed below.","The system in accordance with the invention typically includes a telemarketing analysis server (TMA)  for analyzing customer activity and sending alert applets to telemarketing agents, a Computer Telephony Integration (CTI) server  for controlling CTI hardware  adapted to receive and to place calls. The system may also include a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) gateway  which permits VoIP sessions to be conducted with potential customers such as a customer having PC  connected to the PSTN  by a single telephone line , as will be explained below in more detail. The system in accordance with the invention monitors access activity on one or more public servers ,  connected to a data network such as the World Wide Web (WWW). The public servers ,  may be connected to an ISP Intranet  or they may be connected with the Internet  in other ways well known in the art.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["38","45","47","32","12","40","44","44","40"]},"ISP  will typically maintain an Operations and Maintenance Server  which may include a billing server  for monitoring telemarketing activity and issuing bills in a manner well known in the art. The OAM server  will likewise typically include a Data Base (DB) server  used for tracking telemarketing firms, their agents, service preferences, etc. The ISP  may also maintain a chat server  to permit text chat sessions to be established between a telemarketer  and a client ,  of a potential customer in a manner well known in the art.","The telemarketer  has PCs  which are preferably equipped with a plurality of functions. When the PC  is operational, it has an active application  which is recognized by the operating system of the PC  to be the active application of the moment. The active application  may be used to supply data to a warm-line function  as will be explained below. The warm-line function  facilitates calling if the Internet Service Provider maintains a CTI server  and CTI hardware  in accordance with the invention. The PC  may receive alert applets, typically Java applets embedded in web pages which permit the telemarketer  to receive promotional opportunity alerts issued by telemarketing analysis server . Alternatively, PC  may run a dedicated application for the same purpose. The telemarketer  may also have a PC  that is equipped with a dedicated application  for displaying a call queue and permitting the telemarketing agent to respond to and control calls to potential customers, as will be explained below with reference to .","The public servers ,  are equipped with WWW pages  which provide information of interest to potential customers, including sales and\/or promotional material. The public servers ,  also include a monitoring function . The monitoring function is constantly active on the public servers , . The monitoring function is enabled to create and update \u201ccookies\u201d which are small data files used to track the activities of potential customers. The cookies can be used to store characteristics of user behaviour such as a previous purchase, the number of repeat visits, the time spent browsing the site, or other aspects of a customer's present or past behaviour. Cookies and their uses are well known in the art and will not be described here except to note that cookies used by the system in accordance with the invention are preferably encrypted to preserve privacy, etc.","Not all potential customers accept cookies from public servers such as public servers , . The monitoring function  is therefore also preferably equipped to monitor session information for those individuals who refuse cookies, as will be explained below with reference to FIG. .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["45","20","45","20","58","45","38","20","45"]},"An activity analysis function on the telemarketing analysis server  is configured to determine that an alert should be sent to a telemarketing agent's PC  when a potential customer visits the public server  twice in one week. On determining that the potential customer using PC  meets a predefined criteria respecting activity of the potential customer, the telemarketing analysis server  prepares an alert message which it forwards over the Internet to the telemarketer's PC . The alert message is displayed as a \u201cscreen pop\u201d or is added to a queue on the telemarketer's PC . On receipt of the alert message, the telemarketer responds with an assistance invitation to the potential customer . The assistance invitation may be, for example, a pop-up text window having prepared text and a form which permits the potential customer to respond with a preference as to how they would like to be served by the telemarketer . Other means, such as recorded voice and\/or live video of the telemarketing agent  could be used providing that bandwidth, etc. permitted.","It is assumed that most installations of the system in accordance with the invention will use assistance invitations in text format such as will be described below with reference to -. Such messaging can be accomplished using Java applets, an \u201chttp push\u201d of a URL specified by the telemarketing agent, or a command sent by the telemarketing agent to the public server ,  to control the next page displayed when a potential customer moves to a next page on the public server , .","In this example, on receipt of the assistance invitation, the potential customer at PC  decides that he would like to speak to a telemarketing agent and responds with a request that the agent please call at the number of his telephone . On receiving the call request, telemarketer  selects a line for the telephone  which sends an off-hook signal to the PBX . In this example, the telemarketer is using a warm-line feature as described in applicant's copending patent application entitled METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR CALL COMPLETION USING INFORMATION RETRIEVED FROM AN OPEN APPLICATION ON A COMPUTING MACHINE, filed concurrently herewith, the specification of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.","Using the warm-line feature, the telemarketing agent  selects the line but does not dial digits. The PBX  is programmed in a manner well known in the art to dial a predefined number if no digits are dialled within a predetermined period of time, say 2-5seconds. The PBX therefore dials the warm-line number which connects the PBX to the CTI hardware  of the CTI server . On receipt of the call, the CTI server , extracts the calling number from Automatic Number Identification (ANI) signaling information, for example, and advises the telemarketing analysis server  that it has received a call from the telemarketing agent. Telemarketing analysis server  checks a table of authenticated, on-line agents to determine whether the call was originated by a valid telemarketing agent, and, if so, to obtain a current IP address for the agent.","Since IP addresses are typically dynamically assigned on log on to an ISP, the IP address of the PC  was stored in the table at the beginning of the session initiated by the telemarketing agent . This may be accomplished in a number of ways. For example, the web browser may have its home page set to the telemarketing analysis server . Therefore, when a telemarketing agent opens the web browser at the beginning of a work shift, for example, the web browser opens the home page on the telemarketing analysis server . Simultaneously, a cookie is passed by the web browser from the telemarketer's PC  to the telemarketing analysis server . The cookie identifies the telemarketing agent and permits the server to capture the current IP address of the PC . The agent is thereafter free to work with the PC  as they wish. Alternatively, a session registration process could be used for the same purpose. In the session registration process, the telemarketing agent logs on to the telemarketing analysis server  using a User ID and a password in a manner well known in the art.","With reference again to , the telemarketing analysis server  formulates a warm-line message which it forwards to the telemarketer's PC  over the Internet. The telemarketer's PC  receives the message transparently. The message is received by the warm-line function  () which is active on the telemarketer's PC . The message requests that the warm-line function  find an open warmline enabled application and request that the warm-line enabled application retrieve information from a current page, the information being a telephone number or some data which may be used as an index to find a telephone number. The warm-line enabled application searches its current page and retrieves the information. If there is ambiguity about the information, the warm-line enabled application may request that the telemarketing agent select the correct information from a displayed list, as is explained fully in applicant's copending application filed concurrently herewith.","The information retrieved by the warm-line enabled application is passed to the warm-line function  which returns it in a message sent over the Internet to the telemarketing analysis server . In this example, the message contains the phone number 613-123-4567 which the telemarketing analysis server  passes to the CTI server . The CTI server  instructs the CTI hardware  to dial the number. On dialling the number, the potential customer, expecting the call, answers telephone . The CTI server  advises the telemarketing analysis server  that the call has been answered and the telemarketing analysis server  instructs the CTI server  to join the two calls which permits a telemarketing agent using telephone  to speak with the potential customer using telephone . The telemarketing analysis server  may, of course, pass the URL of the page which the potential customer is viewing on the public server  to permit the telemarketing agent to be cognizant of the interest of the potential customer. The telemarketing analysis server  may also pass cookie data to the telemarketing agent to inform the agent of the customer's past behaviour, for example a previous purchase. After the conversation has terminated, the potential customer  may, for example, disconnect and the CTI server  responds by sending a disconnect to the PBX  which in turn applies dial tone to the telemarketing agent telephone . It will be understood by those skilled in the art that the disconnect may be initiated at telephone  by the telemarketing agent as well.","As noted above, other call sequences are enabled by the system in accordance with the invention. For example, if the potential customer with a single telephone line  (see ) were to be contacted, it is likely that the potential customer would prefer to communicate with the telemarketing agent using a VoIP connection from the CTI server . In that case, the agent can still use telephone  to ensure better transmission quality and to free up his PC  for other functions such as receiving alert messages, etc. It should also be understood that it is not necessary to use the warm-line feature and that the agent may dial calls manually or use a voice dialling application to initiate calls to potential customers. It should also be understood that call requests received from potential customers can be used to generate calls automatically to free agents or agents predicted to be free by about the time the call is completed. The automatic generation of calls can save telemarketing agent time and enhance productivity.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0058"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 2"],"b":["45","20","45","20","58","45","38","20"]},"In accordance with this embodiment of the invention, when the telemarketing analysis server  determines that the customer has exhibited behaviour which meets a predefined criteria, the telemarketing analysis server  sends a message to the PC  using one of the mechanisms described above, which displays a window on the PC  inviting the potential customer to request personal contact with a telemarketing agent. This embodiment of the invention is particularly useful for WWW sites which receive a large volume of visits by potential customers. By obtaining an assessment of the potential customers' interests using a form displayed in the window prior to alerting a telemarketing agent of the presence of the potential customer at the WWW site, the use of the agent's time can be optimized in handling those potential customers with an interest in seeking further information.","Preferably, the window displayed by the telemarketing analysis server  on the PC  provides a menu of options which permits the potential customer to decline a personal contact; request a personal contact by telephone; request a personal contact by VoIP session; or, send an electronic mail message to a telemarketing agent. The telemarketing analysis server  preferably maintains a list of all agents and their call assignments. If such a list is maintained, the telemarketing analysis server  can personalize the message sent to the potential customer at PC  by inserting the name of the agent in the message sent. Thus a message may be sent such as the messages shown in , , as will be explained below with reference to those figures.","In the example shown in , the potential customer using PC  responds to the telemarketing analysis server  that the potential customer desires a VoIP call from a telemarketing agent. As described above, the telemarketing analysis server  forwards an alert to a PC  of the telemarketing agent . The telemarketing agent may have been selected before the initial communication invitation was sent by the telemarketing analysis server  to the potential customer, as described above. On receipt of the alert, the telemarketing agent  responds by selecting a telephone line which alerts the PBX  of an off-hook condition of telephone . The PBX  responds after a few seconds delay, as described above, by calling a predefined warm-line number. The CTI server  which receives the call advises the telemarketing analysis server  that the call has been received. Telemarketing analysis server  responds by sending a message to PC  requesting that it retrieve information from an open warm-line application, as likewise described above with reference to FIG. .","The PC  retrieves the information and returns it in a message to the telemarketing analysis server . The telemarketing analysis server  examines the information and determines that a VoIP session is to be initiated with the current IP address of the PC . The telemarketing analysis server  therefore instructs the CTI server  to initiate the VoIP session with the PC . Using the VoIP gateway  (see FIG. ), the CTI server  sets up the VoIP session with the PC . When the VoIP session is accepted by the potential customer at PC , the CTI server  advises the telemarketing analysis server  of the acceptance, and the telemarketing analysis server instructs the CTI server  to join the two calls. The VoIP gateway  handles conversion of voice transmission received on the telephone line from telephone  into IP packets transmitted to the PC , and the conversion of IP voice packets received from the PC  to voice transmission format, in a manner well known in the art. After the conversation is completed, the PC  may, for example, send a disconnect signal. On receipt of the disconnect signal, the CTI server  forwards a disconnect signal to the PBX  which in turn applies a dial tone to the line of the telemarketing agent's telephone . As explained above, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the session may be terminated by the telemarketing agent rather than the potential customer.","Using an implementation of the invention as described above with relation to , it is practical and may be preferable to run a dedicated application  (see ) on the PC  of the telemarketer , which permits communication requests to be queued and provides the agent with current call information as well as call control functions.  shows one example of a potential format for a screen display which may be used by the dedicated application running on the PC  of the telemarketing agent . A current call status area  preferably displays each of the following data items: name, URL, potential customer priority, and call duration.","Potential customer priority is derived from cookie data and is preferably maintained by the telemarketing analysis server  although a priority value may also be set by the telemarketing agent , assuming that the telemarketing administrator has given the telemarketing agent  the authority to set priority values. The telemarketing agent  may also change a priority value while the telemarketing agent  is communicating with the customer. Priority values may have a plurality of functions in call control and are valuable, for example, in alerting agents of potential customers with special status. The special status may, for example, relate to frequent buyers, preferred clients, new contacts, or nuisance callers. For example, nuisance callers may be assigned a priority value of 0. Using the embodiment described above with relation to , when the priority value of 0 is displayed, the telemarketing agent can ignore the visit of the potential customer and not send an invitation to initiate communication. Similarly, in the embodiment described with relation to , the telemarketing analysis server  can be programmed to suppress a communications invitation message to any potential customer having a priority value of 0. It will be understood by those skilled in the art that the priority value can provide a useful tool in many other aspects of telemarketing call control.","The priority values stored in cookies may be updated in several ways. For example, they may be updated by the telemarketing analysis server  in response to certain triggers. When a potential client makes a purchase, the purchase may trigger a priority value update. Likewise, a return visit to a web site may trigger an update of the priority value. It is also preferable that telemarketing agents be permitted to update potential customer priority values, or to assign at least certain values. For example, it may be desirable to permit a telemarketing agent to set a potential customer's priority value to indicate a nuisance caller, or the like. The management of potential customer priority values is a matter of design choice.","A dedicated application also provides call control options displayed in an area . Each control option is preferably initiated by a button in a manner well known in the art. Call control options permit a call to be put on hold; to be conferenced; to be transferred; or to be released, all in a manner well known in the art. Certain of the options such as conference and transfer force a display of windows requesting particulars (not illustrated) such as the number(s) to be conferenced, or an agent's number or extension where the call is to be transferred, etc.","The display also preferably includes a call waiting queue which displays all calls currently waiting for the agent. The call waiting queue preferably displays the following: IP address; name, if available; URL of the Web page which the caller was viewing when a communication request was received; a priority value which was described above; and a type of communication requested. As will be understood, the telemarketing agent  may accept the calls in the queue in any order. For example, the telemarketing agent may accept the call from Jane Dove having a priority value of  which indicates, for example, a \u201cplatinum\u201d client over the new contact whose name is unknown. An area  of the dedicated application window permits the telemarketing agent to display the current page being viewed by the potential customer. Other areas may be displayed on the telemarketing window or may overlie another portion of the window. For example, a text chat window may be invoked if the potential customer requests a text chat with the telemarketing agent.","It will be understood by those skilled in the art that the layout of the dedicated application window displayed on PC  is a matter of design choice and that the layout and the contents of the window shown in  is for the purposes of illustration only.","Although calls processed in the example described in relation to  were placed by the telemarketing agents, it should be understood that calls can be completed automatically if a telemarketing agent's queue is empty or is predicted to be empty about the time a call is to be completed. It should be further understood that a common call queue may be used and that a common controller may automatically place and distribute calls as agents are available or predicted to become available. Such call distribution methods and predictive algorithms are well known in the art and are not described here.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0070"},"figref":["FIGS. 6","FIGS. 4"],"i":["a","f ","a","f "],"b":["6","4","38"]},"For example, and show exemplary text messages which may be used to invite a potential customer for which little or no data exists to communicate with the agent. The potential customer is given an opportunity to turn down the invitation, request a text chat, request a web conference, or request a voice call by providing a telephone number. If the telephone number of the party is known, it may be defaulted into the input space provided. Radio buttons permit the potential customer to express their choice.","The application in accordance with the invention also permits telemarketing to be conducted in much the same way that sales agents conduct business in retail outlets, wherein telemarketers are employed by one or more vendors to be available full time. In that instance, the telemarketing agents will become familiar with customers in much the same way as sales agents become familiar with customers in retail outlets. In such circumstances, it is assumed that telemarketing agents will compose spontaneous messages when the presence of the potential customer is detected at the web site. Applying this invention to a more conventional telemarketing environment, it is also possible that the agent could pass on scripted messages or messages selected based on the agent skill set and customer information. It is assumed, of course, that repeat customers will accept cookies and such information as their telephone number and their name will be known to the telemarketing agent, and these examples reflect that.","Customer draw may be enhanced by special messages applicable to specific marketing ploys such as specials on merchandise. shows an example of such an assistance invitation.","It will also be understood by those skilled in the art that the system in accordance with the invention may be used to automatically collect contacts at times when telemarketing agents are not on duty or all agents are occupied. The telemarketing analysis server  can be programmed to send pop-up window applets to potential customers when no agents are available. The telemarketing analysis server  maintains a table of available agents as well as their state of occupation. If no agents are available or all agents are busy, the telemarketing analysis server  may be enabled to send one of a plurality of messages depending on the circumstances. is one example of a message which may be used during off-hours. Any responses are stored in a job file for agents to attend to when they are on duty. A similar message may announce that all sales agents are currently occupied but someone can contact the potential customer as soon as an agent becomes available. Responses in the job file may be prioritized in accordance with any predefined criteria. The response form presented to potential customers may also ask questions which would permit entries in the job file to be prioritized in one or more ways.","It is known that a certain percentage of web browsers will refuse cookies. Behavioural history relating to the potential customer will therefore not be available to the public servers , . In these instances, it is possible to at least track session information. This may be done in one of two ways. Certain browsers support single session cookies which makes session information available to the public server  (see FIG. ). It is also possible to program the monitoring function  on the public server  to store session information in an instance where the potential customer refuses cookies and the potential customer's browser does not support session cookies. An example of such a table is illustrated in FIG. . Using the table shown in , it is possible to determine how much time a potential customer has spent at the public server  and to track the pages being currently viewed. Business decisions respecting when contact becomes worthwhile may then be made and criteria set to reflect those decisions so that an alert message is sent to a telemarketing agent when a customer's behaviour is deemed to indicate an interest in the products or services advertised or promoted by the public server , .","It will be well understood by those skilled in the art that the table shown in  must be regularly maintained in order to limit the number of records it contains. The table is therefore periodically scanned and records are deleted when, for example, more than five minutes have elapsed since a potential customer last accessed to the public server , . The criteria for deleting records from the potential customer activity table is, of course, programmable and will depend on the needs and experience of the operators of a particular public server.","The invention therefore provides a flexible system which permits a novel approach to telemarketing. The system enables a personal presence at a web site in much the same way that a personal presence may be maintained in a retail outlet. The innovative applications of the methods and system in accordance with the invention are limited only by the imagination and skill of users. For example, the system and methods in accordance with the invention may be used for personnel support in a corporate environment. As such, a help server could be monitored to alert support personnel when an employee has spent a predetermined amount of time in a help function. The alert would direct support personnel directly to the individual requiring assistance. Many other applications of the methods and system are also known to be useful and practical.","It will be understood by those skilled in the art that the method in accordance with the invention may be implemented using a system other than the one described above. For example, the Telephony Application Programming Interface (TAPI) is a public domain protocol allowing computers to communicate with switching equipment in a switched telephone network to complete calls using the methods in accordance with the invention. A private domain tool such as Nortel's Compucall\u00ae may also be used to implement the invention in a switched telephone network such as the PSTN.","Although the method and system described above have been described with reference to the WWW only, it should be understood that customer activities such as file transfer protocol (ftp), for example, may be tracked and also serve as a basis for telemarketing agent alerts.","The embodiments of the invention described above are intended to be exemplary only. The scope of the invention is therefore intended to be limited solely by the scope of the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The invention will now be further explained by way of example only and with reference to the following drawings wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIGS. 6","i":["a","f "],"b":"6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 7"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
