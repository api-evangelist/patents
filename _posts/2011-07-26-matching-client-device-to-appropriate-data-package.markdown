title: Matching client device to appropriate data package
abstract: One or more techniques and/or systems are disclosed for matching a client device with an appropriate network service provider data package. A device ID for the client device can be decomposed to one or more device ID ranges in a device decomposition set. One or more ranges of client ID can be assigned to a network service provider data package, which can be decomposed into a set of package decomposition ranges in a package decompositions set. The device decomposition set can be compared to the package decomposition set, and if an intersection is identified between the sets, the network service provider data package can be provided to the client device.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["In a computing environment, a device can utilize software, services and hardware from a variety of providers. For example, a device may comprise hardware components from a first provider, software components from a second provider and services from a third provider. Further, the device may connect to a network service provider that provides data and\/or voice services over a network. One or more of the device providers may wish to allow for a customized user experience, for example, where the device utilizes applications, data, and\/or metadata that is specific to the device, software and\/or services. For example, a network service provider may load a data package onto the device that provides a customized, branded user experience to the user. As an illustrative example, device\/hardware appropriate software (e.g., application plus other data, such as localized names and icons) can be provided by the network service provider that provides device specific data services to a given mobile broadband device.","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.","A network service provider (NSP), such as a mobile network operator (MNO) and\/or mobile virtual network operator (MVNO), can provide customized data packages (e.g., comprising metadata and applications), for example, that may allow a custom, branded experience for their subscribers. In order to deliver an appropriate customized data package (e.g., matched to the client device), a device ID for a client device (e.g., and\/or hardware on a client device, such as a SIM card) can be read and matched with a customized package from a cloud\/network. However, as an example, a second NSP may lease a subset of subscriber identity (e.g., International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI)) ranges (e.g., or other identifiers) from a first NSP. In this example, the device ID for the client device may not be able to be matched against the second NSP subscriber range, as the subset is comprises in the set of ranges assigned to the first NSP.","Accordingly, one or more techniques and\/or systems are disclosed for matching of a particular, specific, customized, etc. operator experience to specific ranges of client IDs, for example, thereby allowing an NSP to provide customized experiences to their customers. The NSP can assign one or more ranges of client IDs to the data package and a device ID can be matched against the assigned ranges. The client ID ranges, for example, can be decomposed into a plurality of package decomposition ranges, and the device ID can be decomposed into one or more device ID ranges. The respective sets of decomposed ranges (e.g., the package decompositions set and the device decomposition set) can be compared to determine if they intersect (e.g., comprise a matching member element). If they intersect, the associated data package can be provided to the client device.","In one embodiment of matching a client device with an appropriate network service provider data package, a device identification (ID) can be received for the client device. Further, a package decomposition set can be received for the network service provider data package, where the package decomposition set comprises one or more ranges of client IDs that are associated with the network service provider data package. Additionally, the device ID can be compared to the package decomposition set, and if at least a portion of the device ID (e.g., and\/or ID for hardware on a client device, such as a SIM card) is comprised in the package decomposition set the network service provider data package can be provided to the client device.","To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, the following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects may be employed. Other aspects, advantages, and novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.","The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are generally used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the claimed subject matter. It may be evident, however, that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.","As provided herein, a method may be devised that provides for matching a client device to an appropriate data package from a network service provider. For example, when the network service provider (NSP) wishes to provide a customized experience for a subscriber of their service the NSP can provide a data package (e.g., comprising applications and\/or metadata) that can be downloaded to the client device. In one embodiment, one or more data packages may be managed by a data service, to which the client device connects. The data service can match the client device to the appropriate data package intended for use by the connecting client device, and the NSP data package can be provided to the client device for download to provide a customized user experience, for example.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","108","110"]},"As an example, a manufacturer or distributor (e.g., network service provider) of a piece of hardware or a device may provide a device data package (e.g., comprising customized metadata and applications) for the device, such as to enable a customized user experience to an end user. Further, in order to match a data package to an appropriate device the data package provider (e.g., manufacturer or distributor) can assign a list of devices (e.g., or pieces of hardware) to the data package using device (e.g., or hardware) IDs. As an illustrative example, the data package provider may include one or more ranges of device identifiers (e.g., client device IDs or client hardware IDs) with the data package, where the data package is intended to be applied to the devices identified by the one or more ranges.","In one embodiment, the device ID for the client device (e.g., and\/or hardware in the client device) can be compared against the one or more ranges of client IDs in the package decomposition set for the network service provider data package. In this embodiment, if the device ID is a member of the package decomposition set, for example, then the network service provider data package may be intended to be used by the client device (e.g., downloaded and installed on the client device). In one embodiment, a decomposition set (e.g., such as the package decomposition set) can comprise a first range of strings that is decomposed into a plurality of second ranges of strings comprised in the first range of strings. It may be appreciated that, as discussed below, at least some of the device ID (e.g., last few digits) may be obscured (e.g., replaced with non-functional alphanumeric characters) to, among other things, facilitate user anonymity.","As an illustrative example, a first range of one hundred to two hundred and fifteen (100-215) comprises second ranges: one hundred to one hundred and ninety nine (100-199), two hundred to two hundred and nine (200-209), and two hundred and ten to two hundred and fifteen (210-215). In this example, the first range (100-215) is decomposed into three second ranges (100-199, 200-209, and 210-215). In one embodiment, the ranges may be expressed as strings, for example, instead of dash-separated numbers. As an illustrative example, the second ranges (100-199, 200-209, and 210-215) may be expressed as: 1XX, 20X, 21X and 215, where the \u201cXs\u201d can indicate a placeholder for a range of integers (e.g., from 00 to 99, 0 to 9, and 0 to 4, respectively).","In one embodiment, a decomposition set (e.g., such as the package decomposition set) can comprise elements comprising strings that represent the second ranges (e.g., 1XX, 20X, 21X and 215). For example, the range of client IDs assigned to the network service provider data package can be decomposed into a plurality of second ranges, which are represented as strings in the package decomposition set for the network service provider data package. In this way, for example, the device ID can also comprise a string (e.g., series of numbers), and it can be compared against the elements of the package decomposition set to determine if the device ID is a member of the package decomposition set. Further, if the device ID is a member the associated network service provider, the data package can be provided to the device associated with the device ID (e.g., to download and provide a customized user experience on the device).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","202"]},"For example, a network service provider, such as a mobile network operator (MNO) or mobile virtual network operator (MVNO), may wish to provide a custom, branded user experience to users of their network (e.g., customers). In this example, the network service provider may have a database of client identifiers, such as a service-subscriber key (e.g., International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI)), that are respectively associated with an end user or device. Further, as an example, one or more desired ranges of the client identifiers (e.g., comprising the set, or subset, of the MNO's client identifiers) can be assigned to a data package that provides the custom, branded user experience.","As an illustrative example, a client identifier may comprise a string 100 222 123456789 (e.g., an IMSI), where the first three digits (100) are a Mobile Country Code (MCC), the second three digits (222) are a Mobile Network Code (MNC), and the last nine digits (123456789) are a Mobile Subscriber Identification Number (MSIN). In this example, the MSIN, when combined with the MCC and MNC, may identify the user and\/or the device that is comprised in the MNO's (e.g., or MVNO's) customer database. Further, in this example, a set (e.g., or subset) of client identifiers comprised in the customer database may comprise a range of 100 222 123400000 to 100 222 123499999, which includes one hundred thousand clients. The range (e.g., or one or more subsets of the range), for example, can be assigned to the desired network service provider data package (e.g., so that devices having device IDs within this range are provided the network service provider data package, which, in turn, may provide a customized user experience on the devices, for example).","It will be appreciated that the one or more ranges of client IDs associated with the network service provider data package is not limited to the embodiments described herein. Any type of identifier that identifies a user or device (e.g., or hardware) associated with the network service provider may be assigned to the network service provider data package. For example, for a code division multiple access (CDMA) based network service provider, a Provider ID (e.g., System Identification Number (SID)) and\/or a Provider Name may be used as a client ID. As another example, for a WiMax based network service provider, a Provider ID, such as a Network Service Provider ID (NSP ID), may be used as a client ID.","In one embodiment, a package decomposition set can be determined using the one or more ranges of client IDs assigned to the network service provider data package. Determining the package decomposition set can comprise decomposing the one or more ranges of client IDs into a set of one or more sub-ranges of data strings or package decomposition ranges comprised in the one or more ranges of client IDs. For example, as described above, the range of one hundred to two hundred and fifteen (100-215) can be decomposed into the sub-ranges one hundred to one hundred and ninety nine (100-199), two hundred to two hundred and nine (200-209), and two hundred and ten to two hundred and fifteen (210-215).","At  in the example embodiment , of , one or more decomposition trees may be created for the one or more ranges of client IDs, and used to decompose the one or more ranges into one or more sub-ranges. As an illustrative example,  is a diagram illustrating an example embodiment  where a range may be decomposed into one or more sub-ranges. In this example , a decomposition tree  can be created for a range comprising ninety-seven to three hundred and three.","In one embodiment, the decomposition tree can comprise a root node , which can comprise a range of client IDs (e.g., 97 to 303). Further, in this embodiment, for a node of the decomposition tree that comprises a range of min to max (inclusive), let a variable value \u201cx\u201d comprise a smallest integer such that: min\u2266x<max; and x comprises a maximum potential number of trailing nines (9s). If both arguments are true, in this embodiment, the node can comprise two children nodes. As an example, in , the range 97-303 of the root node  comprises an integer ninety-nine (99), which is a smallest integer such that 97\u226699<303, and 99 has a maximum potential number of trailing nines (two). Therefore, the root node  can comprise two children nodes  and .","Further, in this embodiment, if the node does comprise two children nodes, a first child node can comprise a range of min to the variable value \u201cx\u201d, and a second child node can comprise a range of x plus one (x+1) to max. As an illustrative example, in , the root node , comprising the range 97-303, comprises two children nodes , . The first child node  comprises the sub-range ninety-seven (min) to ninety-nine (x); and the second child node  comprises the sub-range one-hundred (x+1) to three-hundred and three (max).","Additionally, in this embodiment, if a node does not comprise two child nodes (e.g., min\u2266x<max and\/or x does not have a maximum potential number of trailing 9s), then the node comprises no children nodes. As an illustrative example, in , for node  (e.g., the first child node of the root node ) the range ninety-seven to ninety-nine (97-99) does not comprise an x such that 97\u2266x<99, where x comprises a maximum potential number of trailing 9s (e.g., would need two nines, but x must be either 97 or 98, therefore cannot comprise trailing 9s). Therefore, in this example, the node  cannot comprise two children nodes, and therefore cannot comprise any children nodes (e.g., and therefore comprises a leaf of the decomposition tree).","In the example embodiment , the node  (e.g., the second child node of the root node ) meets the criteria to comprise two children nodes ,  (e.g., x=one ninety-nine (199), where 199 is a smallest integer such that 97\u2266199<303, and 199 has a maximum potential number of trailing nines (two)). Node  does not meet the criteria, whereas node  does comprise the criteria to have two children nodes, namely , . However, in this example, both the nodes  and  do not meet the above described criteria for having children nodes, thereby ending the creation of the decomposition tree (e.g., and the decomposing of the root range 97-303). It will be appreciated that while the maximum potential number of trailing 9s is illustrated as two, a different maximum potential number of trailing 9s is possible. For example, for four digit numbers the maximum potential number of trailing 9s may be three, for five digit numbers the maximum potential number of trailing 9s may be four, etc. Accordingly, any suitable number of trailing 9s is contemplated as falling within the scope of this application, including the appended claims. That is, limitation to merely the examples provided herein is not intended.","Returning to , at , the package decomposition set can be derived from one or more sub-ranges from leaves of the decomposition tree of a range of client IDs. As an illustrative example, in , the leaves of the decomposition tree comprise the nodes , , , and . In this embodiment, the package decomposition set  can comprise the sub-ranges : ninety-seven to ninety-nine (97-99), one-hundred to one hundred and ninety-nine (100-199), two hundred to two hundred and ninety-nine (200-299), and three hundred to three hundred and three (330-303).","Further, the sub-ranges  of the package decomposition set  may be represented as data strings which are representative of package decomposition ranges  that comprise the sub-ranges . For example, one-hundred to one-hundred and ninety-nine (100-199) may be represented as 1XX, where an \u201cX\u201d can comprise a placeholder indicator of a number from zero to nine (0-9) (e.g., as a range). In this example, the package decomposition  set can comprise the representative ranges: 097, 098, 099 (e.g., or 09X with X possibly being indicative of merely 7, 8 or 9), 1XX, 2XX, 300, 301, 302, and 303 (e.g., or 30X with X possibly being indicative of merely 0, 1, 2 or 3).","Returning to , at , an ID for the network service provider (NSP ID), and the package decomposition set can be associated with (e.g., assigned to) the network service provider data package. For example, the NSP ID and package decomposition set can be linked to the data package using a database, or some other data storage container. In this example, the decomposition set may be looked up, such as to compare against a device ID (e.g., to determine if the device ID falls within the package decomposition set such that the data package can be provided to the device (if the device ID falls within the package decomposition set)).","In one embodiment, at , the package decomposition set (e.g., one or more package decomposition ranges thereof) may be encoded, such as to provide security when sending\/receiving the set. A network service provider may wish to protect a list or range of subscriber IDs, for example, to keep competitors from estimating a number of subscribers. In this example, given a decade decomposition set, it may be trivial to estimate the corresponding range of subscriber IDs.","In one embodiment, encoding can comprise hashing at least a portion of the package decomposition set to yield a package hash value. For example, a cryptographically safe hash function may be used to generate package hash values for the package decomposition set. As an illustrative example, the hash function SHA256 may be implemented, where this algorithm can reliably generate encoded strings (e.g., same output every time given same input), can generate different encoded strings for different inputs, and the input cannot be derived from the output encoded string.","In this example, the output of the SHA256 function is an array of 32 bytes. In one embodiment, the output package hash value can be converted to a text string. For example, the array of 32 bytes may be converted to a text string using a standard hexadecimal encoding. Further, in this example, the hexadecimal text string may be used to match against a device ID (e.g., that has also been converted to a hexadecimal text string).","In one embodiment, security of the device ID and\/or privacy concerns about sharing the device ID may be promoted by obscuring at least a portion of the device ID, for example, which may be sent to match against a package decomposition set. For example, one or more of the last Z numbers of the \u201cdevice ID\u201d sent to a server for matching can be obscured, such as by replacing them with a non-functional alphanumeric character. In this embodiment, obscuring can be done to promote user privacy and\/or for added security. As another example, the specific device ID for the client device is not sent, instead, the device ID minus the last two (or other number of) digits (e.g., or with the last two (or other number of) digits obscured) can be sent for matching. Obscuring or removing one or more digits can thus help maintain some level of user anonymity while still allowing a Network Service Provider to provide a customized experience for a set of devices. For example, obscuring or removing the last k digits may help with privacy because if an eavesdropper were to be able to \u201ccrack\u201d hashed IDs that a device sends to a server, all that the eavesdropper would get is the pool of 10ID numbers to which the device belongs. Anonymity is thus preserved essentially by hiding the device in a crowd.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","302"]},"At , the device ID can be decomposed into a device decomposition set, comprising one or more device ID ranges. As an illustrative example,  is a diagram illustrating an example embodiment  where a device ID may be decomposed into one or more ID ranges. In the example embodiment , an example ID number two-hundred and forty-two  can be decomposed to create the device decomposition set .","In one embodiment, the device decomposition set may be determined by decomposing the device ID into multiples of base powers (e.g., powers of ten). For example, as illustrated in , a highest multiple of a base power of ten for the device ID  is ten squared (10). In this embodiment, for example, a first ID decomposition  can comprise 2\u00d710\u2266242<3\u00d710, which comprises an ID range  of two hundred to two hundred and ninety-nine (200-299).","Further, in this embodiment, a second ID decomposition  can comprise a range for the device ID at a base power below that of the first range, for example, (2\u00d710+4\u00d710)\u2266242<(3\u00d710+5\u00d710). In this example, the second ID decomposition  can comprise an ID range  of two-hundred and forty to two-hundred and forty-nine (240-249). Additionally, a third ID decomposition  can comprise a range for the device ID at a base power below that of the second range (e.g., and so-on). For example, a third ID decomposition  can comprise (2\u00d710+4\u00d710+2\u00d710)\u2266242<(3\u00d710+5\u00d710+3\u00d710), which can be comprise an ID range  of two-hundred and forty-two to two-hundred and forty-two (242-242) (e.g., comprising merely the device ID ).","As described above, the respective ID ranges  can be expressed as device ID ranges  using \u201cX\u201d as a placeholder indicator. For example, the ID range  of two hundred to two-hundred and nine-nine can be expressed as a device ID range of 2XX, where the \u201cX\u201ds respectively indicate a range of zero to nine (0-9). Further, in this example, the ID range  of two-hundred and forty to two-hundred and forty-nine can be expressed as a device ID range  of 24X. Additionally, in this example, the ID range  of two-hundred and forty-two to two-hundred and forty-two merely comprises the device ID range  of 242.","Returning to , at , a network operator ID can be appended to respective device ID ranges in the device decomposition set. For example, in a GSM-based network, the network operator ID may comprise the MCC and MNC; in a CDMA, Wifi, and\/or WiMax based networks, a Provider ID may be used for the network operator ID. In one embodiment, the device decomposition set can comprise one or more device ID ranges that respectively comprise a network operator ID for a network service provider associated with the client device, one or more portions of a subscriber ID associated with the client device, and\/or one or more placeholder indicators that represent a device ID range for the client device. In this embodiment, appending the network operator ID to the respective device ID ranges, for example, may facilitate in identifying the appropriate NSP for the client device.","In one embodiment, at , the device decomposition set (e.g., one or more device ID ranges thereof) may be encoded, such as to provide security when sending\/receiving the set. A user of the client device, for example, represented by the device decomposition set may wish to protect their subscriber, for example, to keep malicious users from intercepting sensitive information. In this example, given a device decomposition set, the subscriber ID for the client device may be derived, and potentially misused. Further, in this embodiment, encoding can comprise hashing at least a portion of the device decomposition set to yield a device hash value. For example, a same cryptographically safe hash function may be used to generate the device hash value as was used for encoding the package decomposition set. As an illustrative example, the hash function SHA256 may be implemented for both the device decomposition set and the package decomposition set, such that the resulting hash values can be compared to each other. It will be appreciated, however, that other hash functions can be used for the device decomposition set and\/or the package decomposition set.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","404","400","406"]},"At , the NSP provider for the client device is matched to one or more NSP data packages. For example, a NSP may provide one or more data packages to the data management service to provide to appropriate client devices. In this example, the respective NSP data packages may comprise network operator IDs for the providing NSP (e.g., to identify which NSPs provided which data packages). Further, in this example, the network operator ID for the data package(s) can be matched with the network operator ID associated with the device decomposition set to find one or more appropriate NSP data packages for the client device (e.g., to be examined further to see if the device ID falls within a package decomposition set).","At , a first device ID range from the device decomposition set is used to compare with a package decomposition set, at . As an illustrative example, as illustrated in , the package decomposition set  comprises package decomposition ranges , and the device decomposition set  comprises device ID ranges. In one embodiment, the respective device ID ranges  can be compared to the package decomposition ranges  (e.g., one at a time) to determine if the two sets ,  intersect.","In one embodiment, the first device ID range  compared to the package decomposition set  can comprise the device ID range  having a smallest number of placeholder indicators (e.g., 242). In this embodiment, for example, by starting the comparison from a more specific device ID range and proceeding up to a device ID range having the most placeholder indicators, a more specific match may be identified first. For example, the device ID range of 242 can be compared to the package decomposition set  and determined not to be a member (e.g., no intersection).","Returning to , if no match is found at , the next device ID range is used to compare with the package decomposition set. For example, as illustrated in , the next device ID range 24X can be compared to the package decomposition set  and found not to be a member. This can be repeated up to and through the last device ID range. For example, last device ID range 2XX does match a package decomposition range 2XX in the package decomposition set . If no more device ID ranges are available from the device decomposition set , the example embodiment ends at , for example, and the device decomposition set  may be compared against a second package decomposition set (e.g., or found to have no matching data package, such that no customized user experience would be provided to a user via the mobile device). However, if a device ID range matches a package decomposition range (e.g., 2XX), the device decomposition set and the package decomposition set intersect. At , if an intersection is identified, the data package associated with the matched package decomposition range  from the package decomposition set  is provided to the client device.","A system may be devised for matching a client device to an appropriate data package from a network service provider. For example, a network service provider (NSP) can assign a range of client identifications (IDs) to a custom data package intended for downloading and use by one or more client devices comprised in the client ID range. In one embodiment, when the device ID for a client device matches or falls within a client ID range assigned to a data package, the NSP data package can be provided to the client device for download, and customization, for example.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["700","756","702","704","704","750","756","752","754","752","754"]},"A data package providing component  is operably coupled with the device ID matching component , and configured to provide the network service provider data package  to the client device  if at least a portion of the device ID  is comprised in the package decomposition set .

The encoding component  can comprise a hashing component  configured to determine a hash value for the device ID  and\/or the package decomposition set .

In this example, the network operator ID can be appended to one or more of the device ID ranges in the device decomposition set (e.g., or the entire set). Further, the package matching component  can use the network operator ID associated with the device ID  to identify a data package from a same NSP.","In the example embodiment , the data package providing component  can be configured to provide an appropriate data package , from the one or more network service provider data packages, based at least upon a portion of the device ID  that is matched with an element in the package decomposition set . For example, the package matching component  can identify an appropriate data package for the client device based on a network operator ID for the device (e.g., appended to one or more device ID ranges in the device decomposition set for the device). In this manner, merely a data package from the network upon which the device is operating may be identified (e.g., as opposed to a (potentially incompatible) data package from a different network service provider upon which the device is not operating).
