Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a network-management method and a network-management system for controlling a network that provides various services.","In a certain network configuration, a plurality of nodes (e.g., switches and ATM switches) and cross-connection devices are connected via physical communication lines, and logical paths are established with respect to various services for providing audio, image, and data. In a large-scale network, a plurality of communication-service providers may offer services. In such a case, it is expected to be able to control network with respect to each service or with respect to each communication-service provider.","2. Description of the Related Art","There are various proposed schemes for connecting LANs (local area networks) and WANs (wide area networks) together to create a large-scale network and for controlling the created large-scale network. In general, a large-scale network is implemented by employing multi-vendor network elements. Further, the large-scale network may be managed by a single communication-service provider, or may be created and managed by a plurality of communication-service providers. Against this background, there is a scheme for dividing a large-scale network into segments and giving a hierarchical structure to these segments, allowing each network segment to be displayed separately for management purposes and allowing connections inside each segment to be controlled. An example of such a scheme is disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open Application No. 6-326706, for example.","Another scheme allows only an administrator of a network of a given communication-service provider to store virtual view information in a table form for the purpose of controlling the network. This scheme allows the administrator to attend to network management while insuring overall security between different communication-service providers. An example of such a scheme is disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open Application No. 4-230139.","Further, there is a scheme for controlling network by displaying network nodes on a screen by use of colors for indication of network conditions, interface-connection conditions, and so on, and by providing a beeping function using different beep sounds. When the network fails, a location of the failure is reported to a network administrator by displaying the location in a different color and producing an alarming sound. Also, there is a scheme for controlling network by utilizing GUI (graphical user interface). Icons and pull-down selections are used for obtaining MIB (management information base) information, for example, thereby allowing visual evaluation of current network conditions.","A network uses physical communication lines, switches, ATM switches, etc., to connect between terminals and also between terminals and information providers, and renders various services for transmission of audio data and\/or image data, the Internet, CBR (constant bit rate) transmission, VBR (variable bit rate) transmission, etc. In a related-art network, conditions of physical communication lines and nodes such as switches and ATM switches are displayed on a management screen, thereby allowing a network administrators to spot a network failure. In this configuration, however, network conditions cannot be controlled on a service-wise basis. Further, it is not easy to evaluate whether a spotted network failure severely affects the services.","Settings of connections for providing services are usually made by entering commands. When a network includes multi-vendor network elements, various commands need to be provided so as to cope with each of different network elements. Because of this, it is undesirably difficult to set connections in a service-wise manner.","Accordingly, there is a need for a network-management method and a network-management system which allow control and settings to be easily made with respect to each of different services by providing a physical network structure and a logical network structure on a service-wise basis.","Accordingly, it is a general object of the present invention to provide a network-management method and a network-management device which can satisfy the need described above.","It is another and more specific object of the present invention to provide a network-management method and a network-management system which allow control and settings to be easily made with respect to each of different services by providing a physical network structure and a logical network structure on a service-wise basis.","In order to achieve the above objects according to the present invention, a method of controlling a network, which includes network elements connected via links and provides services, includes the steps of creating view-configuration information based on network-configuration information with respect to each of the services such that the view-configuration information is related to the network-configuration information, and displaying a view based on the view-configuration information with respect to each of the services, the view including both or either one of a physical network configuration of the network and a logical network configuration of the network.","In the method as described above, views including physical network configurations and\/or logical network configurations are presented to a user (i.e., a network administrator or a service administrator) to allow the network to be controlled on a service-wise basis. This is made possible by creating view-configuration information based on network-configuration information with respect to each of the services such that the view-configuration information is related to the network-configuration information. Because of such a configuration, it is possible to detect condition changes simultaneously in a plurality of views when the network-configuration-information has changes in the conditions thereof. This configuration eliminates inconsistency between different views.","The same objects can be achieved by the following system according to the present invention. Namely, a system for controlling a network including network elements and links includes a database which stores network-configuration information and view-configuration information such that the view-configuration information is related to the network-configuration information, a service-management server which attends to registering and updating of the information stored in the database, and defines views of a physical network configuration and a logical network configuration with respect to each of the services based on the view-configuration information stored in the database, a network-management server which collects information on configurations of the network elements and the links as well as information on failures, and informs the service-management server of a change in at least one of the configurations and the failures for a purpose of the updating, and a client which displays both or either one of the physical network configuration and the logical network configuration with respect to the client's own service based on the views defined by the service-management server.","Other objects and further features of the present invention will be apparent from the following detailed description when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.","In the following, embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"The network-management system of  includes a service-management server , a database , NEM (network-management) servers - through -, a VOD (video-on-demand)-service-management client -, an audio-service-management client -, an IP (information provider)-service-management client -, a communication-line-rent-service-management client \u2014, and a network .","The service-management server  includes a view-definition unit -, a logical-network-layout-generation unit -, a connection-setting unit -, a real-time-network-information-update unit -, and a physical-failure-and-logical-failure relating unit -.","The NEM servers - through - collect information about updates of configurations of network elements, links, and the like as well as information about failures by tracking or polling operations, and informs the service-management server  of events that affect network operations. In response, the service-management server  updates the database . Network configuration information about the network  regarding ATM switches, high-speed communication lines, and the like is collected and stored in the database  at the time of a system startup, and is updated as changes are made to the network configuration. Further, one or more views are stored with respect to different service types by a view-creation procedure.","The clients - through - provide a VOD service, an audio service, an IP service, and a communication-line-rent service, respectively. These clients for providing the specific types of services described above are only an example, and other clients for other services can be added to the configuration of .","A view in the present invention refers to a unit of control on a GUI (graphical user interface) of the network-management system. Multiple views refer to views that are presented as if they were provided on separate networks corresponding to different services despite the fact that these services are in reality provided via a single network. A view can be presented in such a fashion as to show both or either one of a logical network configuration and a physical network configuration by finding matches therebetween.","A network administrator or a service administrator selects one or more views from a presented list of views, so that both or either one of the logical network configuration and the physical network configuration are shown on a display screen (not shown) with respect to the one or more selected views. On the presented views, a location of failure and an area that is affected by the failure are shown, and, further, settings of connections can be made. Further, a view that shows all the elements of the network with reference to no hierarchical structure is referred to as a flat view. A view that groups elements according to a region and shows these elements in a framework of a hierarchical structure is referred to as a domain view.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},"In , a physical network  shows a physical configuration of a network. An audio-service view , an Internet-service view , and a VOD-service view  show a physical configuration of a network for providing a corresponding service.","An audio service is provided via a network which includes PBX switches connected via ATM switches, for example. An Internet service is provided via a network in which routers are connected via ATM switches. Further, a VOD service is rendered by using a network in which a VOD server and VOD terminals are connected via ATM switches. A VOD-service administrator, for example, controls the network for providing the VOD service by using the physical network configuration of the VOD-service view  or a logical network configuration that can be presented as appropriate.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 1"],"b":["2","1","3","3","1","3","4","21","5","3","1","1","3"]},"Information about all the network elements (), which are subject to network management, is collected at the time of a system startup. When collecting update information about the network element  or information about a failure, the NEM server  uses an element-type-dependent-conversion function  to convert the collected information to database-registration information . Then, the NEM server  compares the database-registration information  with old database-registration information  by use of a comparison function , and replaces the old database-registration information  with the database-registration information  only if there is a change. Further, the NEM server  sends the database-registration information  to the service-management server . In response, the service-management server  uses a database updating function  to update the database . The database-registration information  is transferred only when service related information collected from the network exhibits a change. This achieves updating of the database  with a small amount of data transfer.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"]},"The service-management server  connected to the database  includes a client manager , a view controller , a user manager , a multi-domain manager , and local-domain managers  through .

Each of the local-domain managers  through  is provided for a network of a different type, and absorbs differences in conditions that differ depending on a network type such as ATM, SONET, SDH, IP, etc.","The multi-domain manager  attends to overall control of the network . The client interface  provides the GUI based on the information obtained from the service-management server . The user manager  of  is used for controlling relations between passwords and views where these passwords are required when a user (network administrator) accesses the GUI.

The network-control terminal , as shown in , presents physical network configuration including the edges and the network elements.

The network administrator can then attend to recovery.","Network elements and\/or network types can be added by modifying the network-configuration information and the view-configuration information, and API (application programming interface) that provides information necessary for a network administrator is defined.

Such modification includes creation\/modification\/deletion of nodes, links, and connections, modification of connection routes, recovery of node failures and port failures, creation\/modification\/deletion of view nodes, view links, view connections, domains, edges, views, service templates, separate-failure definitions, and service-failure definitions, etc.","Multi-vendor network elements include a device having only a single slot to insert a card and a device which can accept two cards. Not only such differences in device structures but also differences in parameter settings attribute to differences between network elements (devices). Further, all the network elements in the network are often not in compliance with the same standards.

In an ATM network, a connection corresponds to a virtual channel, and is represented by VPI\/VCI values. Other types of networks, however, do not employ such representation.
