{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE(S) TO RELATED APPLICATION(S)","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present invention claims priority of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2010-0104145, filed on Oct. 25, 2010, which is incorporated herein by reference.","The present invention relates to a technique for identifying a question type and domain for information searching and question answering for an open web, and more particularly, to a question type and domain identifying apparatus and method for classifying a user's question into a question appropriate for a question and answer and a query appropriate for information searching to identify the user's question, distributing the user's question to question and answer engines of respective domains, and restricting a search target document with a question subject (or question theme) and area information, so as to effectively find an answer to the user's question.","Recently, various types of digital contents have been produced and distributed exponentially with the advancement of web and Internet techniques. Such a change in the environment is creating a huge demand for web searching, and the rapid growth of a global search company such as Google for example is considered to result from properly satisfying search demand for users' web contents in line with the changed environment.","As-well known in the art, a question and answer technique for web searching is a technique in which when a user inputs required information in form of a question in a natural language, a system searches for an answer to the user's question from a document and presents it. This question and answer technique is an application technique that comprehensively employs a natural language processing technique, an information extraction technique, and the like, and it is studied for limited domains and documents due to its level of difficulty. Namely, the conventional method uses a scheme of processing a question for a limited domain with a limited answer type and extracting an answer thereto.","In this regard, various technical developments related to such question and answer were made as text retrieval conference (TREC) established in 1992 created a question and answer track in the late 1990s, but it was mostly limited to Factoid questions and some descriptive questions for limited domains due to a technical limitation. And, in the late 2000s, a technical advancement has been achieved to process even a comprehensive question and answer type for an open domain in the question and answer technique in line with the development of a language processing technique, an information extraction technique, a meaning analysis technique, and the like.","As described above, over the flood of web contents and information growing in arithmetical procession, the existing information searching has a limitation in satisfying users' demands for information, and in order to overcome this, various discussions and techniques for a web environment such as a web 2.0, a semantic web, and the like, are mentioned. However, the eventual purpose of such discussions is how to precisely discover information suitable for the users' demand and favorably present it. As a result, the eventual purpose of the web technique will be a question and answer technique.","Namely, because the conventional method simply processes a question for domains limited to limited answer types and extracts an answer thereto, there is a limitation in satisfying users' demands (e.g., the efficiency of document searching, accuracy of extraction of an answer, etc.) for information searching.","In view of the above, the present invention provides a question type and domain identifying apparatus and method for classifying a user's question into a question appropriate for a question and answer and a query appropriate for information searching to identify the user's question, distributing the user's question to question and answer engines of respective domains, and restricting a search target document with a question subject (or question theme) and area information, to thereby effectively find an answer to the user's question.","In accordance with a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a question type and domain identifying apparatus, the apparatus including:","a question type identifier for recognizing the number of words of a user's question to identify whether or not the user's question is a query for performing information searching or a question for performing a question and answer;","a question domain distributor for distributing one of plural preset domain specialized question and answer engines, as a question and answer engine of the user's question based on the recognized word number; and","a question and answer engine block, including the domain specialized question and answer engines, for selectively performing information searching or a question and answer with respect to the user's question in response to the distribution of the question domain distributor.","In accordance with a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided a question type and domain identifying method, the method including:","recognizing the number of words of a user's question to identify whether or not the user's question is a query for performing information searching or a question for performing a question and answer;","distributing one of plural preset domain specialized question and answer engines, as a question and answer engine of the user's question, based on the recognized word number; and","selectively performing information searching or a question and answer with respect to the user's question by using the domain specialized and question and answer engine distributed as the question and answer engine.","Hereinafter, embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with the accompanying drawings.","In the following description, well-known functions or constitutions will not be described in detail if they would obscure the invention in unnecessary detail. Further, the terminologies to be described below are defined in consideration of functions in the present invention and may vary depending on a user's or operator's intention or practice. Therefore, the definitions should be understood based on all the contents of the specification.","First of all, the present invention approaches various issues to be considered in processing a question in the event of question and answer in an open web environment, and proposes various technical methods appropriate for processing a question in question and answer in a web environment.","First, the most important thing in analyzing a question for open web question and answer is to identify a type of the question. Users express what kind of information they request through questions. Here, the users' request may be a particular answer or a particular document. Namely, when information required by a user is comprehensive information of a particular object, document searching would satisfy the user's request, while when the user requests information regarding the attribute of a particular object, question and answer results would meet the user's request. Thus, more effective information can be provided by identifying a user's request whether or not it is a query or a question and differentiating a processing method. Therefore, it is necessary to identify whether or not a user's question is a query which requires information searching or a question which requires question and answer. To this end, the present invention proposes a technical concept for identifying whether or not a user's question is a query requiring information searching or a question requiring question and answer.","Second, for an open web question and answer including a previously developed domain specialized question and answer engine, it is important to identify through which question and answer engines an answer to a user's question could be effectively presented. For example, for a question related to a travel, a question and answer engine specialized for a travel domain could be able to provide more correct results. Namely, it is considered that distribution of users' questions to question and answer engines specialized for various domains is a key to improvement of the performance of an open web question and answer. Thus, the present invention proposes the technique of distributing a user's question to question and answer engines specialized for various domains.","Third, a document having a high possibility of including an answer is searched in the web environment. However, because numerous documents are distributed in the web, searching every document distributed in the web would be a considerable burden in terms of time. Thus, in the present invention, a method for restricting documents is first performed before a searching operation. Namely, search target documents are restricted on the basis of a question subject identified in a question and area information in the question. To this end, the present invention proposes a scheme for identifying a question subject and identifying various types of area information included in the question.","Namely, as discussed above, the present invention provides a technical method for identifying a question type reflecting the characteristics of an open web question and answer, distributing a question to question-and-answers specialized for domains, and identifying a question subject and area information for document filtering.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"The question type and domain identifying apparatus includes a question type identifier , a question domain distributor , a question-and-answer engine , a contents search filtering engine , and the like.

For these two cases, the user may determine the weight values according to experience.
