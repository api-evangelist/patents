{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","Overview"],"p":["This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/806,341, filed on Mar. 28, 2013, entitled RECOMMENDING RESOURCES TO MEMBERS OF A SOCIAL NETWORK, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","The present disclosure generally relates to providing recommendations using social network service information. More specifically, the present disclosure relates to methods, systems and computer program products for recommending resources to members of a social network.","Online social network services provide users with a mechanism for defining, and memorializing in a digital format, their relationships with other people. This digital representation of real-world relationships is frequently referred to as a social graph. Many social network services utilize a social graph to facilitate electronic communications and the sharing of information between its users or members. For instance, the relationship between two members of a social network service, as defined in the social graph of the social network service, may determine the access and sharing privileges that exist between the two members. As such, the social graph in use by a social network service may determine the manner in which two members of the social network service can interact with one another via the various communication and sharing mechanisms supported by the social network service.","Some social network services aim to enable friends and family to communicate and share with one another, while others are specifically directed to business users with a goal of facilitating the establishment of professional networks and the sharing of business information. For purposes of the present disclosure, the terms \u201csocial network\u201d and \u201csocial network service\u201d are used in a broad sense and are meant to encompass services aimed at connecting friends and family (often referred to simply as \u201csocial networks\u201d), as well as services that are specifically directed to enabling business people to connect and share business information (also commonly referred to as \u201csocial networks\u201d but sometimes referred to as \u201cbusiness networks\u201d or \u201cprofessional networks\u201d).","With many social network services, members are prompted to provide a variety of personal information, which may be displayed in a member's personal web page. Such information is commonly referred to as \u201cpersonal profile information\u201d, or simply \u201cprofile information\u201d, and when shown collectively, it is commonly referred to as a member's profile. For example, with some of the many social network services in use today, the personal information that is commonly requested and displayed as part of a member's profile includes a member's age (e.g., birth date), gender, contact information, home town, address, the name of the member's spouse and\/or family members, a photograph of the member, interests, and so forth. With certain social network services, such as some business network services, a member's personal information may include information commonly included in a professional resume or curriculum vitae, such as information about a person's education, employment history, job skills, professional organizations, and so forth. With some social network services, a member's profile may be viewable to the public by default, or alternatively, the member may specify that only some portion of the profile is to be public by default. As such, many social network services serve as a sort of directory of people to be searched and browsed.","The present disclosure describes methods, systems, and computer program products, which individually provide functionality for recommending resources to members of a social network that enable the members to acquire desired skills. For example, the systems and methods described herein may present recommendations for resources to be used by members in learning about and\/or acquiring a skill, among other things.","In some example embodiments, the systems and methods receive information associated with a skill from a member of a social network, identify members of the social network that are associated with the skill, receive information from the identified members of the social network that identifies one or more resources associated with the skill, and generate a list of recommended resources that is based on the information received from the identified members of the social network.","For example, components of a social network service may access information received from members of a social network that identifies resources associated with a skill and generate a user interface that presents a description of one or more of the identified resources that are associated with the skill, such as books, events, classes, groups, web-based content, and other resources.","Therefore, in some example embodiments, the systems and methods may leverage the vast knowledge contained within a social network service in order to identify resources that may assist a member in acquiring a skill, among other benefits.","In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the various aspects of different embodiments of the present invention. It will be evident, however, to one skilled in the art, that the present invention may be practiced without all of the specific details.","Other advantages and aspects of the inventive subject matter will be readily apparent from the description of the figures that follows.","Suitable System",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"100"},"As shown in , the computing environment  includes a social network service  that is generally based on a three-tiered architecture, consisting of a front-end layer , an application logic layer , and a data layer . The modules, systems, and\/or engines shown in  represent a set of executable software instructions and the corresponding hardware (e.g., memory and processor) for executing the instructions. However, one skilled in the art will readily recognize that various additional functional modules and engines may be used with the social network service  to facilitate additional functionality that is not specifically described herein. Furthermore, the various functional modules and engines depicted in  may reside on a single server computer, or may be distributed across several server computers in various arrangements.","As shown in , the front end layer  includes a user interface module (e.g., a web server) , which receives requests from various client-computing devices, such as member device , over a network , and communicates appropriate responses to the requesting client devices. For example, the user interface module(s)  may receive requests in the form of Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP) requests, or other web-based, application programming interface (API) requests. The client devices  may be executing conventional web browser applications, or applications that have been developed for a specific platform to include any of a wide variety of mobile devices and operating systems.","The network  may be any communications network utilizing any one of a number of well-known transfer protocols (e.g., HTTP). Examples of communication networks include a local area network (\u201cLAN\u201d), a wide area network (\u201cWAN\u201d), the Internet, mobile telephone networks, Plain Old Telephone (POTS) networks, wireless data networks (e.g., Wi-Fi\u00ae and WiMax\u00ae networks), and so on.","As shown in , the data layer  includes several databases, including databases for storing data for various entities of the social graph, such as a member database  of member profile information (e.g., information identifying attributes, skills, and other information for members), and a social graph database , which may include a particular type of database that uses graph structures with nodes, edges, and properties to represent and store data, such as social graph information. Of course, in some example embodiments, any number of other entities might be included in the social graph, and as such, various other databases may be used to store data corresponding with other entities.","In some example embodiments, when a person initially registers to become a member of a social network supported by the social network service , the person will be prompted to provide some personal information, such as his or her name, age (e.g., birth date), gender, interests, contact information, home town, address, the names of the member's spouse and\/or family members, educational background (e.g., schools, majors, etc.), current job title, job description, industry, employment history, skills, proficiencies, qualifications, professional organizations, and so on. This information is stored, for example, as member profile information or data in database .","Once registered, a member may invite other members, or be invited by other members, to connect via the social network service . A \u201cconnection\u201d may require a bi-lateral agreement by the members, such that both members acknowledge the establishment of the connection. Similarly, with some embodiments, a member may elect to \u201cfollow\u201d another member. In contrast to establishing a \u201cconnection\u201d, the concept of \u201cfollowing\u201d another member typically is a unilateral operation, and at least with some embodiments, does not require acknowledgement or approval by the member that is being followed. When one member follows another, the member who is following may receive automatic notifications about various activities undertaken by the member being followed. In addition to following another member, a user may elect to follow a company, a topic, a conversation, a skill, or some other entity, which may or may not be included in the social graph.","The social network service  may provide a broad range of other applications and services that allow members the opportunity to share and receive information, often customized to the interests of the member. For example, in some example embodiments, the social network service  may include a photo sharing application that allows members to upload and share photos with other members. As such, a photograph may be a property or entity included within a social graph.","In some example embodiments, members of a social network service  may be able to self-organize into groups, or interest groups, organized around a subject matter or topic of interest. When a member joins a group, his or her membership in the group may be reflected in the social graph information stored in the social graph database . In some example embodiments, members may subscribe to or join groups affiliated with one or more companies. Thus, membership in a group, a subscription or following relationship with a company or group, as well as an employment relationship with a company, may all be examples of the different types of relationships that may exist between different entities, as defined by the social graph and modelled with the social graph information of the social graph database .","The application logic layer  includes various application server modules , which, in conjunction with the user interface module(s) , generates various user interfaces (e.g., web pages) with data retrieved from various data sources in the data layer . In some example some embodiments, individual application server modules  are used to implement the functionality associated with various applications, services and features of the social network service . For example, a messaging application, such as an email application, an instant messaging application, or some hybrid or variation of the two, may be implemented with one or more application server modules . Similarly, a search engine enabling users to search for and browse member profiles may be implemented with one or more application server modules .","In addition to the various application server modules , the application logic layer  also includes a resource recommendation engine  that presents recommended resources in response to receiving information identifying a skill or skills, such as information received from a member of the social network service  that identifies a skill desired by the member. Of course, other applications or services that utilize the resource recommendation engine  may be separately embodied in their own application server modules .","The resource recommendation engine  may perform one or more algorithmic processes that, in response to receiving input information associated with and\/or identifying a skill (e.g., an attribute, a proficiency, a characteristics, an ability, a qualification, and so on), identify members of the social network service  that are associated with the skill (e.g., members having attributes related to or associated with the skill), receive recommendations for resources (e.g., books, events, web-based content, and so on) from the identified members, and generates a list or collection of the resource recommendations, which may be presented in various configurations via user interfaces provided by the social network service .","As illustrated in , in some example embodiments, the resource recommendation engine  is implemented as a service that operates in conjunction with various application server modules . For instance, any number of individual application server modules  may invoke the functionality of the resource recommendation engine , to include an application server module associated with receiving information from the member device  and\/or an application server module associated with an application to facilitate the viewing of user interfaces presenting resource recommendations. However, in some example embodiments, the resource recommendation engine  may be implemented as its own application server module such that it operates as a stand-alone application or system.","In some example embodiments, the resource recommendation engine  may include or have an associated publicly available Application Programming Interface (API) that enables third-party applications or other applications, algorithms or scripts within the social network service  to invoke the functionality of the resource recommendation engine , among other things.","Thus, in some example embodiments, the resource recommendation engine , either provided by or in collaboration with the social network service , receives a skill as input, leverages information stored by the social network service  (e.g., information stored in member database ) and outputs recommendations that identify resources that may be useful in assisting a member (or other user or viewer) to acquire the skill, among other things.","Examples for Recommending Resources to Members of a Social Network","As described herein, in some example embodiments, the resource recommendation engine  presents recommendations for resources associated with a skill and identified by members of the social network.  is a block diagram illustrating modules of the resource recommendation engine , consistent with some embodiments.","As illustrated in , the resource recommendation engine  includes a variety of functional modules. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the functional modules are implemented with a combination of software (e.g., executable instructions, or computer code) and hardware (e.g., at least a memory and processor). Accordingly, as used herein, in some example embodiments a module is a processor-implemented module and represents a computing device having a processor that is at least temporarily configured and\/or programmed by executable instructions stored in memory to perform one or more of the particular functions that are described herein.","Referring to , the resource recommendation engine  includes a skill reception module , a member identification , a resource reception module , a recommendation module , and a requestor identification module .","In some example embodiments, the skill reception module  is configured and\/or programmed to receive information identifying a skill from a member of a social network. For example, the skill reception module  may receive and\/or access information that is input by a member of the social network.","The received and or accessed input may be any type of information that identifies a skill provided to the resource recommendation engine . Examples of information identifying a skill include information identifying a job title (e.g., \u201cCEO\u201d or \u201cPublisher\u201d), information identifying an occupation (e.g., \u201cActor\u201d), information identifying desired job tasks (e.g., \u201cwrite source code\u201d), information identifying an industry (e.g., \u201ccomputer software\u201d or \u201ceducation\u201d), information identifying a university or degree (e.g., \u201cMaster's degree in Physics\u201d), information identifying a life goal (\u201ca Philanthropist\u201d), information identifying a proficiency (e.g., \u201cHadoop\u201d or \u201cC++\u201d), information identifying a qualification (e.g., \u201cCPA\u201d), information identifying an ability (\u201crun 100 miles\u201d or \u201cbuild webpages\u201d), combinations thereof, and so on. Thus, the received input may be information identifying a specific skill (e.g., \u201cHadoop\u201d or \u201croofing\u201d) and\/or information identifying a general or broad skill (e.g., \u201cprogramming\u201d or \u201ccarpentry\u201d), among other things.","The skill reception module  may also monitor activities associated with the member or connections to the member that are performed within the social network, and extract the skill from the monitored activities. For example, the skill reception module  may monitor member profile information, searches performed by members, content generated and\/or viewed by members, and so on, and extract information identifying skills from the various types of monitored information.","In some example embodiments, the skill reception module  may identify a skill by detecting that a member is viewing a web page associated with the skill, by detecting that a member interacts with a web page describing a job opportunity associated with the skill, and\/or that a member responds to a recommendation to acquire the skill.","In some example embodiments, the member identification module  is configured and\/or programmed to identify members of the social network that are associated with the skill. For example, the member identification module  may identify members of the social network based on profile information (e.g., attributes) associated with the members of the social network, based on activities (e.g., posts, views, searches, and so on) performed by the members of the social network, based on recommendations or endorsements of the members by other members of the social network, and so on. The member identification module  may query various databases of the social network service , such as the member database , in order to identify members associated with the skill.","Therefore, the member identification module  may utilize various different algorithmic processes to identify members of a social network that are associated with skill information, including processes that compare attributes of the members to the skill, among other things. In addition, the member identification module  may compute a metric of a member's expertise, authority, or reputation with respect to a skill.","In some example embodiments, the resource reception module  is configured and\/or programmed to receive information from the identified members of the social network that identify one or more resources associated with the skill. For example, the resource reception module  may present a user interface to the identified members, which facilitates reception of information identifying the resources associated with the skill.","As described herein, the resource recommendation engine  may receive information from members that identifies various types of resources. Example resource types include books and other media (e.g., video, audio, presentations, webpages, and so on), classes and other instructional programs, events (e.g., conferences, seminars, programs, plays, concerts, readings, lectures, and so on), webpages and other online content (e.g., blogs, articles, and so on), groups and organizations, instructors and mentors, downloadable applications, games, and so on. Thus, the resource reception module  may receive information identifying a resource or asset that is associated with a skill and assists in a person learning about, obtaining information about, gaining proficiency or expertise in, obtaining credentials in, and\/or acquiring the skill or related skills, among other things.","In some example embodiments, the recommendation module  is configured and\/or programmed to generate a list of recommended resources that is based on the information received from the identified members of the social network. For example, the recommendation module  may generate a user interface that presents information identifying the recommended resources.","As described herein, the recommendation module  may generate, render, present, and\/or display various different configurations of resource recommendations, such as ranked lists, as well as various interactive and display elements that accompany the resource recommendations.","For example, the recommendation module  may generate a user interface that includes:","Information identifying the resource and information identifying a member of the social network that identified the resource;","Information identifying the resource, information identifying a member of the social network that identified the resource, and information identifying other members of the social network that have endorsed the resource;","Information identifying the resource and an actionable button that facilitates acquisition of the resource by the member of the social network; and\/or","Information identifying the resource and an actionable element that enables viewers of the user interface to provide feedback associated with the resource.","In some example embodiments, the recommendation module  may apply various filters, which may enable presentation of a list of resources of a single type (e.g., a list of only books or events) or a list containing resources of two or more types, among other things.","In some cases, a resource may be associated with a specific time frame. For example, an event may be scheduled at a particular date and time and\/or technical course may be scheduled to begin on a specified date and end on a later specified date. The recommendation module  may apply a temporal filter, for example, to exclude events scheduled in the past, and\/or to include only events scheduled within a time range specified by the user.","In some cases, a resource may be associated with other attributes that affect its suitability for a particular member. For example, an event may occur in a specific location, or a class may be available only to students admitted to or currently attending a specific educational institution, among other things.","The recommendation module  may rank and\/or order the resource recommendations based on a variety of different factors. For example, the recommendation module  may rank recommended resources based on endorsements of the resources by members of the social network and\/or based on attributes associated with members of the social network that identified the resources. In some example embodiments, the recommendation module  may assign to an endorsement of a resource by a member a weight based on a metric of the member's expertise in the relevant skill, and\/or may assign to a resource a score based on the sum of the weights of the endorsers. The recommendation module  may then generate, render, display, and\/or present a user interface that presents descriptions of the recommended resources according to the rankings.","In some example embodiments, a member may choose to provide negative feedback on a resource, with the member's feedback contributing negatively to the score assigned to the resource. The member may provide negative feedback for various reasons, such as: the resource is not relevant to the skill, the resource is of poor quality, the resource is suspected spam or was uploaded due to abuse of the social network service, the resource is no longer available, the resource is not accessible at the specified URL, and so on. The recommendation module  may apply a filter to exclude resources that have received negative feedback, and\/or to exclude resources having scores below a threshold. Thus, the collective expertise of the member community can be used to curate the resource collection, and maintain its quality and relevance over time.","In some example embodiments, the requestor identification module  is configured and\/or programmed to receive and\/or access information characterizing a requesting member (e.g., a requestor or a member that input the skill). For example, the requestor identification module  may receive information identifying certain characteristics of the requesting member (e.g., age, location, title, and so on). The recommendation module , in some example embodiments, may then generate a list of recommended resources that is based on the information characterizing the member of the social network. For example, the recommendation module  may generate a list of recommended resources that includes events to be held in a location at which the requestor lives or webpages associated with people followed by the requestor, among other things.","As described herein, the resource recommendation engine  may perform various methods in order to recommend resources associated with a skill to be acquired by a member of a social network.  is a flow diagram illustrating an example method  for recommending resources associated with a skill, consistent with some embodiments. The method  may be performed by the resource recommendation engine  and, accordingly, is described herein merely by way of reference thereto. It will be appreciated that the method  may be performed on any suitable hardware.","In operation , the resource recommendation engine  receives information associated with a skill from a member of a social network. For example, the skill reception module  may receive input identifying a skill from a member of a social network.","As described herein, in some example embodiments, the skill reception module  may present and\/or receive information via a user interface configured to receive input from the member of the social network.  are display diagrams illustrating user interfaces provided by the resource recommendation engine to receive information associated with a skill, consistent with some embodiments.","For example,  depicts a user interface  that is configured to receive input associated with a skill from a member of a social network or other user. The user interface  includes a graphical element  that includes an input box  configured to receive text-based input from a user that identifies a skill (e.g., \u201cHadoop\u201d), and an actionable button  configured to be selected by the user in order to provide the input to the resource recommendation engine .","As another example,  depicts a user interface  that is configured to receive input associated with a skill from a member of a social network or other user. The user interface  includes a graphical element  that includes an input box  configured to receive text-based input from a user that identifies a skill (e.g., \u201cprogramming\u201d), a drop-down menu  that provides user-selectable options, such as related skills, and an actionable button  configured to be selected by the user in order to provide the input to the resource recommendation engine . For example, the user interface  may receive via the input box  a information identifying a skill of \u201cprogramming,\u201d and present via the drop-down menu  various user-selectable options associated with the skill, such as \u201cC++,\u201d \u201cHadoop,\u201d \u201cWordPress,\u201d and so on.","Referring back to , in operation , the resource recommendation engine  identifies members of the social network that are associated with the skill. For example, the member identification module  may identify members of the social network based on profile information (e.g., attributes) associated with the members of the social network, based on activities (e.g., posts, views, searches, and so on) performed by the members of the social network, and so on.","In operation , the resource recommendation engine  receives information from the identified members of the social network that identifies one or more resources associated with the skill. For example, the resource reception module  may receive information identifying a book, event, webpage, or other resources.","As described herein, in some example embodiments, the resource reception module  may present and\/or receive information via a user interface configured to receive information that identifies resources from members of the social network service .  is a display diagram illustrating a user interface  that receives information from members of a social network that identify resources associated with a skill, consistent with some embodiments.","The user interface  includes various text-based input boxes and\/or drop-down menus configured to receive information associated with a resource to be recommended, such as input boxes and\/or drop-down menus that receive information associated with the name of a resource, information associated with a URL or other location for the resource, information associated with the type of resource, information describing the resource, and so on. In some example embodiments, the user interface  may include additional input elements that receive information associated with other attributes of a resource, such as the date, time, and\/or location of an event, among other things.","In some example embodiments, the resource reception module  may present and\/or receive information via a user interface displayed by or embedded within an external web site or application provided by a third party. For example, the user interface may include an actionable element to associate a resource (e.g., a book, a class, and so on) provided by the third party with one or more skills. The user interface may also include input elements configured to receive other information associated with the resource.","Referring back to , in operation , the resource recommendation engine  generates a list of recommended resources that is based on the information received from the identified members of the social network. For example, the recommendation module  may generate a user interface that presents information identifying the recommended resources, such as one or more user interfaces that display various different configurations of resource recommendations, such as ranked lists, as well as various interactive and display elements that accompany the resource recommendations.  are display diagrams illustrating user interfaces presenting resource recommendations, consistent with some embodiments.","For example,  depicts a user interface  that presents various resource recommendations  associated with input  identifying a skill of \u201cHadoop.\u201d The recommendations include a recommendation  for a book entitled \u201cThe Guide to Hadoop,\u201d a recommendation  for an event entitled \u201cStrata Conference 2013,\u201d and a recommendation  for a website entitled \u201cApache Hadoop.\u201d","As described herein, the user interface  presents information along with the presented resource recommendations, such as information  identifying members that provided a resource recommendation and information  that identifies other members of the social network that have endorsed the resource recommendation, among other things.
