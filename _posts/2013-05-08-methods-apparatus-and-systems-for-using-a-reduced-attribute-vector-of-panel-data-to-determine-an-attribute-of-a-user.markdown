title: Methods, apparatus, and systems for using a reduced attribute vector of panel data to determine an attribute of a user
abstract: Methods, system, and media for scaling a panel of users with known attributes to determine an unknown attribute of a user are disclosed. An unclassified attribute vector of the user may be received. The unclassified attribute vector may comprise first attributes and first attribute values. A reduced attribute vector may be produced using the unclassified attribute vector and a projection matrix. The reduced attribute vector may have fewer attributes than the unclassified attribute vector. A plurality of reduced panel attribute vectors may be produced using a plurality of classified panel attribute vectors of users from the panel and the projection matrix. The reduced panel attribute vectors may have fewer attributes than the classified panel attribute vectors. The unknown attribute of the user may be determined based on the reduced attribute vector, the plurality of reduced panel attribute vectors, and the known attributes.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS"],"p":["Targeting and data collection techniques provide advertisers and other marketing organizations with market segment data related to advertising viewers, including, for example, computer users who view advertising on the World Wide Web (Web) or Internet. For advertising viewers such as Internet users, the available information related to each user depends, for example, on his or her historical Web behavior and, for example, on his or her origin environment, such as the user's computing platform, service provider, country, time of day, etc. A \u201cmarket segment\u201d or \u201csegment\u201d is a subset, or partial portion of a group that can be characterized in some way; a segment may also be a data object describing such a group.","Advertisers and other marketing organizations may create segment definitions to define groups of potential marketing targets (e.g., users) and direct advertising to those groups, such as groups of users on the Internet. \u201cData publishers\u201d (or \u201cdata sellers\u201d) may sell information concerning targets or people, such as Internet users, and their behaviors, which advertisers and other marketing organizations may use to create, for example, behavioral segment definitions. An Internet user may access a Web site of a data publisher, such as a bicycling interest Web site, for example, and be identified as a user \u201cinterested in bicycling.\u201d Other attributes, such as time and location of the person's access, may also be identified. Data publishers may sell the identifying information about users who access their sites and receive income from sales based on this information's use.","User identification (ID) data from data publishers can be used to create segment definitions. In general, segment definitions may be characterized by specific values for available properties. For example, segment definitions might exist for categories such as \u201cGender\u201d, \u201cAge\u201d and \u201cNationality\u201d and one segment combination might be defined with three properties as, \u201cMale, 35-40, European.\u201d Once identified (e.g., from information from a data publisher (data seller)), a user who fits the characteristics of \u201cMale, 35-40, European\u201d can be grouped into and\/or associated with this segment combination. An advertisement can be exposed to (or placed) with users identified with the segment combination, and data can be collected to determine how the users identified with that segment respond. Behavioral segment definitions for \u201cShopping Interest\u201d, \u201cRunning Interest\u201d and \u201cWeb surfing interest\u201d can be defined and Behavioral attributes, such as \u201clikes to shop\u201d, \u201cintensely likes running\u201d or \u201cWeb surfs in the evening\u201d can also be included in segment combinations. Segment combinations can have attributes that are purely behavioral, purely non-behavioral or a mixture of behavioral and non-behavioral.","The efficacy of a given advertisement depends on the match between the content of the advertisement (advertising content) and the market segment to which the content is exposed. In practice, a numeric \u201cconversion ratio\u201d value describes the efficiency or \u201csuccess\u201d relationship between the advertising content and target segment. A high conversion ratio value can show, for example, by various measures or various methods of determining or collecting such data, that a given advertisement or advertising campaign (group of advertisements) is well received by a given target segment.","It is perceived within the advertising and marketing industries that, in general, better and more accurate segment targeting capabilities could improve conversion ratios. High conversion ratios for advertisements, on the Internet and in other advertising venues, such as, e.g., print, outdoor, direct are desirable. Identification, for example, of a large user group with a high response rate to advertising and with members who respond in stable and predictable manners over time is desirable.","With the development of the Internet advertising market, information about the people most likely to visit a website and information about the people most likely to purchase a product from visiting a website is increasingly more valuable. These people may be classified into modeled audience extensions, which defines segments that define users most likely to take certain actions. More accurate and efficient identification of modeled audience extensions can lead to more conversions and better return on investment for advertising money spent.","However, it is difficult to collect comprehensive, meaningful, and useful attribute information for a large number of users with a large number of potential attributes. For example, attribute information may be collected for users while browsing the Internet, in which the number of tracked attributes may be in the millions. A user may have attributes corresponding to visiting one or more websites, the time and date of visiting websites, and whether orders were placed on websites. As a result, it is frequently difficult to ascertain values for all or even a substantial number of the attributes, because users may not have been in situations in which the values could be collected. Similarly, tracking online behavior may yield little or no information about offline information, such as the purchasing habits or attitudes of users when conducting offline transactions.","In general, there is a need for improved techniques for scaling a panel, in the advertising and marketing fields in general and, in particular, with regard to Internet advertising.","Various embodiments are generally directed to scaling a panel to overcome the aforementioned problems.","One embodiment may include a method for scaling a panel of users with known attributes to determine an unknown attribute of a user, the method comprising: receiving, by one or more computers, an unclassified attribute vector of the user, the unclassified attribute vector comprising first attributes and first attribute values;

The rotation or projection matrix may provide information about which attributes are important for classifying similar users. A rotation or projection matrix may be formed by analyzing groups of attributes for one or more users. For example, one group of attributes may include very complete attribute information for a relatively small set of attributes when compared to another group. The other group of attributes may include incomplete attribute information for a larger number of attributes, in which many attribute values are unknown. The resulting rotation or project matrix formed from the analysis of these groups may determine which combination of attributes from both groups are significant for grouping users into meaningful classifications.

For example, an input set of attributes may be received. The input set of attributes may have one or more unknown or unclassified attribute values that are of interest. The values of interest may be determined using one or more of the following steps. The rotation or projection matrix may be applied to the input set of attributes to produce a first dataset (e.g. reduced attribute vector or reduced attribute matrix) that identifies attributes that are useful for classification and their values. The rotation or projection matrix may also be applied to another set of attributes of another group of users to produce a second dataset (e.g. a reduced panel attribute matrix or vectors) that also identifies attributes that are useful for classification and their values, and that also includes values for the attributes of interest.","Then, the first and second datasets may be compared to find one or more users in the second data set that are most similar to a user with an unknown attribute of interest in the first dataset. When the one or more most similar users are identified, their values for the attribute of interest can be evaluated to discover or assign the a value to the previously unknown value of the attribute of interest for the user of interest.

Second, the space has been chosen to maximally explain panel attribute vectors (e.g. ) using a plurality of attribute vectors (e.g. ), even more accurately than using all of  in the neighbor calculations. Third, the reduced space minimizes the appearance of hub users, or frequently found neighbors, by avoiding the curse of dimensionality common in this type of problem. In the case of the sparse CCA, an additional advantage emerges in that the projection matrix (e.g. ) may have many elements equal to zero, which further improves computational efficiency.","In block , software module  may determine the unknown attribute of the user based on the reduced attribute vector, the plurality of reduced panel attribute vectors, and a plurality of known attributes.","In some embodiments, software module  may determine the unknown attribute of the user using a k-nearest neighbors approach.

The number of nearest neighbors, k, may range from 1 to the number of vectors considered. For example, if k=1, only a single nearest neighbor is chosen.","Similarity between the plurality of reduced panel attribute vectors and the reduced attribute vector may be measured using one or more techniques. For example, the similarity may be measured by a distance. A distance may be a Euclidian, Manhattan, cosine similarity, Mahalanobis, or some other distance function. The distance algorithm may be modified by penalizing distances to neighbors by their historical match rate. A numeric or percentage match cap may be placed on a potential neighbor, which removes the potential neighbor from the plurality of reduced panel attribute vectors (e.g. from 300\u00d7500) for some period of time if their match rate exceeds some threshold, e.g. 1% of users in the plurality of reduced attribute vectors (e.g. ). These techniques may be used in combination or alone. Alternatively or additionally, the nearest neighbors may be calculated exactly by brute force, or by any approximate nearest neighbor algorithm where in rare cases, perfect identification of the nearest match is sacrificed for computational efficiency of the search.","Software module  may determine the unknown attribute using one or more known attributes corresponding to the one or more nearest neighbors. The one or more nearest neighbors may vote on the value of the unknown attribute using the values of the plurality of the known attributes.","In some embodiments, a single nearest neighbor may be selected. In this instance, k=1. For example, the single nearest neighbor, e.g., -, may vote for the value of the unknown attribute  using known attribute -, and  would take the value of -.","In some embodiments when multiple nearest neighbors are used (i.e., k>1), one or more voting techniques may be used. The respective votes of the multiple nearest neighbors may be weighted based on the distances each nearest neighbor to the reduced attribute vector. For example, contributions of the neighbors may be weighted, so that the nearer neighbors contribute more to determining the unknown attribute value than the more distant ones. A common weighting scheme is to give each neighbor a weight of 1\/d, where d is the distance to the neighbor, which is a generalization of linear interpolation. However, any weighting scheme and any distance measurement scheme may be used.","After a value of the unknown attribute for a user is determined, the value of the attribute may be given a time-to-live period, after which the value expires. The time-to-live period may begin when the unknown attribute is determined. When the value expires, the unknown attribute may be marked as unknown, null, 0, or any other value to indicate to users or software module  that the value is no longer valid. The time to live period may be chosen based on client interaction. A minimum eligibility time may also be chosen. For example, a user may be eligible to be scored at 2 days with a time-to-live of 5 days.","The process for scaling a panel may be repeated to determine multiple unknown attributes of a user, an unknown attribute for multiple users, or any combination thereof. For example, the process for scaling a panel may be used to overlay one panel onto another so that the plurality of attribute vectors (e.g.  matrix) and the panel attribute vectors (e.g.  matrix) in a first iteration come from two different panels, and the users represented in the reduced panel attribute vectors (e.g. ) is not shared between the two different panels, and the completion of the process to infer attributes for the reduced panel attribute vectors leads to a complete matrix with the combined columns of the plurality of attribute vectors (e.g.  matrix) and the panel attribute vectors (e.g.  matrix) and the combine rows of the plurality of attribute vectors (e.g.  matrix) and the reduced panel attribute vectors (e.g. ). The resulting matrix can then be used as the panel attribute matrix in a second iteration of this process to scale the combined panel to an entire user base for distribution to advertisers and\/or web analytics companies.","In some embodiments, a segment of users may be identified. The segment may be defined by a specific value for one or more attributes, ranges of values of one or more attributes, or any combination thereof. When attributes that define the segment for users are unknown, the process for scaling a panel may be used to determine those unknown attribute values. Then, users that meet the requirements for inclusion into the segment may be added to the segment. If an attribute value of a user expires, and inclusion in the segment requires that attribute value, the user having the expired attribute value may be removed from the segment.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0071"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 8","FIG. 8"],"b":["800","800","810","1","810","810","1","810","800","820","1","820"]},"The users in exemplary attribute matrix  all have the same value for attribute -. As a result, a segment defined by the - attribute having a value of 1 would include the users corresponding to attribute vectors - to -B. The attribute value for - for each user corresponding to vectors - to -B may have been determined by a process for scaling a panel, such as the process described herein. The process may have determined an attribute value for attribute - for more users than the ones that corresponding to vectors - to -B, which may have had different values.
