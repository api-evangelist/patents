{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application is related to, and claims priority from, U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60\/823,870 filed on Aug. 29, 2006, entitled \u201cGraphical User Interface\u201d, the disclosure of which is incorporated here by reference.","Technologies associated with the communication of information have evolved rapidly over the last several decades. Television, cellular telephony, the Internet and optical communication techniques (to name just a few things) combine to inundate consumers with available information and entertainment options. Taking television as an example, the last three decades have seen the introduction of cable television service, satellite television service, pay-per-view movies and video-on-demand. Whereas television viewers of the 1960s could typically receive perhaps four or five over-the-air TV channels on their television sets, today's TV watchers have the opportunity to select from hundreds, thousands, and potentially millions of channels of shows and information. Video-on-demand technology, currently used primarily in hotels and the like, provides the potential for in-home entertainment selection from among thousands of movie titles.","The technological ability to provide so much information and content to end users provides both opportunities and challenges to system designers and service providers. One challenge is that while end users typically prefer having more choices rather than fewer, this preference is counterweighted by their desire that the selection process be both fast and simple. Unfortunately, the development of the systems and interfaces by which end users access media items has resulted in selection processes which are neither fast nor simple. Consider again the example of television programs. When television was in its infancy, determining which program to watch was a relatively simple process primarily due to the small number of choices. One would consult a printed guide which was formatted, for example, as series of columns and rows which showed the correspondence between (1) nearby television channels, (2) programs being transmitted on those channels and (3) date and time. The television was tuned to the desired channel by adjusting a tuner knob and the viewer watched the selected program. Later, remote control devices were introduced that permitted viewers to tune the television from a distance. This addition to the user-television interface created the phenomenon known as \u201cchannel surfing\u201d whereby a viewer could rapidly view short segments being broadcast on a number of channels to quickly learn what programs were available at any given time.","Despite the fact that the number of channels and amount of viewable content has dramatically increased, the generally available user interface, control device options and frameworks for televisions has not changed much over the last 30 years. Printed guides are still the most prevalent mechanism for conveying programming information. The multiple button remote control with up and down arrows is still the most prevalent channel\/content selection mechanism. The reaction of those who design and implement the TV user interface to the increase in available media content has been a straightforward extension of the existing selection procedures and interface objects. Thus, the number of rows in the printed guides has been increased to accommodate more channels. The number of buttons on the remote control devices has been increased to support additional functionality and content handling, e.g., as shown in . However, this approach has significantly increased both the time required for a viewer to review the available information and the complexity of actions required to implement a selection. Arguably, the cumbersome nature of the existing interface has hampered commercial implementation of some services, e.g., video-on-demand, since consumers are resistant to new services that will add complexity to an interface that they view as already too slow and complex.","In addition to increases in bandwidth and content, the user interface bottleneck problem is being exacerbated by the aggregation of technologies. Consumers are reacting positively to having the option of buying integrated systems rather than a number of segregable components. An example of this trend is the combination television\/VCR\/DVD in which three previously independent components are frequently sold today as an integrated unit. This trend is likely to continue, potentially with an end result that most if not all of the communication devices currently found in the household will be packaged together as an integrated unit, e.g., a television\/VCR\/DVD\/internet access\/radio\/stereo unit. Even those who continue to buy separate components will likely desire seamless control of, and interworking between, the separate components. With this increased aggregation comes the potential for more complexity in the user interface. For example, when so-called \u201cuniversal\u201d remote units were introduced, e.g., to combine the functionality of TV remote units and VCR remote units, the number of buttons on these universal remote units was typically more than the number of buttons on either the TV remote unit or VCR remote unit individually. This added number of buttons and functionality makes it very difficult to control anything but the simplest aspects of a TV or VCR without hunting for exactly the right button on the remote. Many times, these universal remotes do not provide enough buttons to access many levels of control or features unique to certain TVs. In these cases, the original device remote unit is still needed, and the original hassle of handling multiple remotes remains due to user interface issues arising from the complexity of aggregation. Some remote units have addressed this problem by adding \u201csoft\u201d buttons that can be programmed with the expert commands. These soft buttons sometimes have accompanying LCD displays to indicate their action. These too have the flaw that they are difficult to use without looking away from the TV to the remote control. Yet another flaw in these remote units is the use of modes in an attempt to reduce the number of buttons. In these \u201cmoded\u201d universal remote units, a special button exists to select whether the remote should communicate with the TV, DVD player, cable set-top box, VCR, etc. This causes many usability issues including sending commands to the wrong device, forcing the user to look at the remote to make sure that it is in the right mode, and it does not provide any simplification to the integration of multiple devices. The most advanced of these universal remote units provide some integration by allowing the user to program sequences of commands to multiple devices into the remote. This is such a difficult task that many users hire professional installers to program their universal remote units.","Some attempts have also been made to modernize the screen interface between end users and media systems. However, these attempts typically suffer from, among other drawbacks, an inability to easily scale between large collections of media items and small collections of media items. For example, interfaces which rely on lists of items may work well for small collections of media items, but are tedious to browse for large collections of media items. Interfaces which rely on hierarchical navigation (e.g., tree structures) may be speedier to traverse than list interfaces for large collections of media items, but are not readily adaptable to small collections of media items. Additionally, users tend to lose interest in selection processes wherein the user has to move through three or more layers in a tree structure. For all of these cases, current remote units make this selection process even more tedious by forcing the user to repeatedly depress the up and down buttons to navigate the list or hierarchies. When selection skipping controls are available such as page up and page down, the user usually has to look at the remote to find these special buttons or be trained to know that they even exist. Accordingly, organizing frameworks, techniques and systems which simplify the control and screen interface between users and media systems as well as accelerate the selection process, while at the same time permitting service providers to take advantage of the increases in available bandwidth to end user equipment by facilitating the supply of a large number of media items and new services to the user have been proposed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/768,432, filed on Jan. 30, 2004, entitled \u201cA Control Framework with a Zoomable Graphical User Interface for Organizing, Selecting and Launching Media Items\u201d, the disclosure of which is incorporated here by reference.","In addition to being able to navigate through and select media items, such as movies, music, photos and personal videos, another feature which is likely to become increasingly popular with consumers is the capability to point at a television and interact with user interface elements displayed thereon via pointing. Pointing provides a powerful interactive tool, familiar to those who have used computers, and avoids the problems with the \u201cup\/down\/left\/right\u201d paradigm described above. The introduction of pointing into user interfaces which enable users to interact with the television and associated devices, will in turn drive demand for new and creative user interface elements.","According to an exemplary embodiment, a television system includes a television, a user interface for controlling output of media via the television, the user interface being displayed on the television and including a channel changing element which overlays video being output on the television, and a pointing device for providing pointing and selection inputs to the user interface by interacting with the channel changing element to enable selection of a new channel for outputting the video.","According to another exemplary embodiment, a method for controlling a television includes displaying a user interface for changing channels on the television, providing input to the user interface by pointing at a user interface element overlaid on video being displayed on the television using a pointing device, and controlling media output on the television based on the input.","According to yet another exemplary embodiment, a television system includes a television, a user interface for controlling output of media via the television, the user interface being displayed on the television and including a user interface view which enables a user to change settings associated with the user interface; and a pointing device for providing pointing and selection inputs to the user interface by interacting with the user interface view to enable selection of settings for the user interface.","According to still another exemplary embodiment, a method for controlling a television includes displaying a user interface for controlling output of media via the television, the user interface being displayed on the television and including a user interface view which enables a user to change settings associated with the user interface, and receiving pointing and selection inputs to the user interface to enable selection of settings for the user interface.","The following detailed description of the invention refers to the accompanying drawings. The same reference numbers in different drawings identify the same or similar elements. Also, the following detailed description does not limit the invention. Instead, the scope of the invention is defined by the appended claims.","In order to provide some context for this discussion, an exemplary aggregated media system  in which the present invention can be implemented will first be described with respect to . Those skilled in the art will appreciate, however, that the present invention is not restricted to implementation in this type of media system and that more or fewer components can be included therein. Therein, an input\/output (I\/O) bus  connects the system components in the media system  together. The I\/O bus  represents any of a number of different of mechanisms and techniques for routing signals between the media system components. For example, the I\/O bus  may include an appropriate number of independent audio \u201cpatch\u201d cables that route audio signals, coaxial cables that route video signals, two-wire serial lines or infrared or radio frequency transceivers that route control signals, optical fiber or any other routing mechanisms that route other types of signals.","In this exemplary embodiment, the media system  includes a television\/monitor , a video cassette recorder (VCR) , digital video disk (DVD) recorder\/playback device , audio\/video tuner  and compact disk player  coupled to the I\/O bus . The VCR , DVD  and compact disk player  may be single disk or single cassette devices, or alternatively may be multiple disk or multiple cassette devices. They may be independent units or integrated together. In addition, the media system  includes a microphone\/speaker system , video camera  and a wireless I\/O control device . According to exemplary embodiments of the present invention, the wireless I\/O control device  is a 3D pointing device. The wireless I\/O control device  can communicate with the entertainment system  using, e.g., an IR or RF transmitter or transceiver. Alternatively, the I\/O control device can be connected to the entertainment system  via a wire. One or more hard drives (or disks)  can be provided for storage of recorded video, music or other media.","The entertainment system  also includes a system controller . According to one exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the system controller  operates to store and display entertainment system data available from a plurality of entertainment system data sources and to control a wide variety of features associated with each of the system components. As shown in , system controller  is coupled, either directly or indirectly, to each of the system components, as necessary, through I\/O bus . In one exemplary embodiment, in addition to or in place of I\/O bus , system controller  is configured with a wireless communication transmitter (or transceiver), which is capable of communicating with the system components via IR signals or RF signals. Regardless of the control medium, the system controller  is configured to control the media components of the media system  via a graphical user interface described below.","As further illustrated in , media system  may be configured to receive media items from various media sources and service providers. In this exemplary embodiment, media system  receives media input from and, optionally, sends information to, any or all of the following sources: cable broadcast , satellite broadcast  (e.g., via a satellite dish), very high frequency (VHF) or ultra high frequency (UHF) radio frequency communication of the broadcast television networks  (e.g., via an aerial antenna), telephone network  and cable modem  (or another source of Internet content). Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the media components and media sources illustrated and described with respect to  are purely exemplary and that media system  may include more or fewer of both. For example, other types of inputs to the system include AM\/FM radio and satellite radio.","More details regarding this exemplary entertainment system and frameworks associated therewith can be found in the above-incorporated by reference U.S. patent application entitled \u201cA Control Framework with a Zoomable Graphical User Interface for Organizing, Selecting and Launching Media Items\u201d. Additionally, the interested reader is also referred to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/437,215, entitled \u201cGlobal Navigation Objects in User Interfaces\u201d, filed on May 19, 2006, the disclosure of which is incorporated here by reference. Alternatively, remote devices and interaction techniques between remote devices and user interfaces in accordance with the present invention can be used in conjunction with other types of systems, for example computer systems including, e.g., a display, a processor and a memory system or with various other systems and applications.","As mentioned in the Background section, remote devices which operate as 3D pointers are of particular interest for the present specification, although the present invention is not limited to systems including 3D pointers. Such devices enable the translation of movement of the device, e.g., linear movement, rotational movement, acceleration or any combination thereof, into commands to a user interface. An exemplary loop-shaped, 3D pointing device  is depicted in , however the present invention is not limited to loop-shaped devices. In this exemplary embodiment, the 3D pointing device  includes two buttons  and  as well as a scroll wheel  (scroll wheel  can also act as a button by depressing the scroll wheel ), although other exemplary embodiments will include other physical configurations. User movement of the 3D pointing device  can be defined, for example, in terms of rotation about one or more of an x-axis attitude (roll), a y-axis elevation (pitch) or a z-axis heading (yaw). In addition, some exemplary embodiments of the present invention can additionally (or alternatively) measure linear movement of the 3D pointing device  along the x, y, and\/or z axes to generate cursor movement or other user interface commands. An example is provided below. A number of permutations and variations relating to 3D pointing devices can be implemented in systems according to exemplary embodiments of the present invention. The interested reader is referred to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/119,663, entitled (as amended) \u201c3D Pointing Devices and Methods\u201d, filed on May 2, 2005, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/119,719, entitled (as amended) \u201c3D Pointing Devices with Tilt Compensation and Improved Usability\u201d, also filed on May 2, 2005, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/119,987, entitled (as amended) \u201cMethods and Devices for Removing Unintentional Movement in 3D Pointing Devices\u201d, also filed on May 2, 2005, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/119,688, entitled \u201cMethods and Devices for Identifying Users Based on Tremor\u201d, also filed on May 2, 2005, and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/480,662, entitled \u201c3D Pointing Devices\u201d, filed on Jul. 3, 2006, the disclosures of which are incorporated here by reference, for more details regarding exemplary 3D pointing devices which can be used in conjunction with exemplary embodiments of the present invention.","According to exemplary embodiments of the present invention, it is anticipated that 3D pointing devices  will be held by a user in front of a display  and that motion of the 3D pointing device  will be translated by the 3D pointing device into output which is usable to interact with the information displayed on display , e.g., to move the cursor  on the display . For example, such 3D pointing devices and their associated user interfaces can be used to make media selections on a television as shown in , which will be described in more detail below. Aspects of exemplary embodiments of the present invention can be optimized to enhance the user's experience of the so-called \u201c10-foot\u201d interface, i.e., a typical distance between a user and his or her television in a living room. For example, interactions between pointing, scrolling, zooming and panning, e.g., using a 3D pointing device and associated user interface, can be optimized for this environment as will be described below, although the present invention is not limited thereto.","Referring again to , an exemplary relationship between movement of the 3D pointing device  and corresponding cursor movement on a user interface will now be described. Rotation of the 3D pointing device  about the y-axis can be sensed by the 3D pointing device  and translated into an output usable by the system to move cursor  along the yaxis of the display . Likewise, rotation of the 3D pointing device  about the z-axis can be sensed by the 3D pointing device  and translated into an output usable by the system to move cursor  along the xaxis of the display . It will be appreciated that the output of 3D pointing device  can be used to interact with the display  in a number of ways other than (or in addition to) cursor movement, for example it can control cursor fading, volume or media transport (play, pause, fast-forward and rewind). Additionally, the system can be programmed to recognize gestures, e.g., predetermined movement patterns, to convey commands in addition to cursor movement. Moreover, other input commands, e.g., a zoom-in or zoom-out on a particular region of a display (e.g., actuated by pressing button  to zoom-in or button  to zoom-out), may also be available to the user.","According to exemplary embodiments of the present invention, user interfaces may use, at least in part, zooming techniques for moving between user interface views. The zooming transition effect can be performed by progressive scaling and displaying of at least some of the UI objects displayed on the current UI view to provide a visual impression of movement of those UI objects away from an observer. In another functional aspect of the present invention, user interfaces may zoom-in in response to user interaction with the user interface which will, likewise, result in the progressive scaling and display of UI objects that provide the visual impression of movement toward an observer. More information relating to zoomable user interfaces can be found in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/768,432, filed on Jan. 30, 2004, entitled \u201cA Control Framework with a Zoomable Graphical User Interface for Organizing, Selecting and Launching Media Items\u201d, and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/829,263, filed on Apr. 9, 2001, entitled \u201cInteractive Content Guide for Television Programming\u201d, the disclosures of which are incorporated here by reference.","Movement within the user interface between different user interface views is not limited to zooming. Other non-zooming techniques can be used, in addition to zooming or as an alternative thereto, to transition between user interface views. For example, panning can be performed by progressive translation and display of at least some of the user interface objects which are currently displayed in a user interface view. This provides the visual impression of lateral movement of those user interface objects to an observer.","Returning now to the application illustrated in , the GUI screen (also referred to herein as a \u201cUI view\u201d, which terms refer to a currently displayed set of UI objects) seen on television  is a home view. In this particular exemplary embodiment, the home view displays a plurality of applications , e.g., \u201cPhotos\u201d, \u201cMusic\u201d, \u201cRecorded\u201d, \u201cGuide\u201d, \u201cLive TV\u201d, \u201cOn Demand\u201d, and \u201cSettings\u201d, which are selectable by the user by way of interaction with the user interface via the 3D pointing device . Such user interactions can include, for example, pointing, scrolling, clicking or various combinations thereof. For more details regarding exemplary pointing, scrolling and clicking interactions which can be used in conjunction with exemplary embodiments of the present invention, the interested reader is directed to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/417,764, entitled \u201cMETHODS AND SYSTEMS FOR SCROLLING AND POINTING IN USER INTERFACE\u201d, to Frank J. Wroblewski, filed on May 4, 2006, the disclosure of which is incorporated here by reference.","Pointing and TV User Interface Elements","As mentioned above, the provision of pointing capability as part of the input paradigm for TV user interfaces will result in new types of user interface elements and functionality which take advantage of this feature, exemplary embodiments of which are described herein. Starting with , another version of the \u201chome\u201d UI view of  is shown. Therein, the circle of initial selection elements in  is expanded to include a selection element for \u201cInternet\u201d and \u201cGames\u201d as compared to the version shown in , any of which can be selected by, for example, pointing to the appropriate selection element and pressing a button on the 3D pointing device . Of particular interest for this discussion are the \u201cLive TV\u201d, \u201cSettings\u201d, and \u201cOn Demand\u201d selection elements ,  and , respectively, illustrated in . Actuation of these selection elements provides one exemplary navigation path in these exemplary embodiments to the various media UI views which include the pointing interactive user interface elements described below, although it will be appreciated that other paths may be followed through the user interface to reach these UI views.","For example, actuating selection element  via 3D pointer  could result in the display of the UI view shown in , e.g., a display of live TV programs on a television. Global navigation icons , described in the above-incorporated by reference patent application, are also available in ghosted image for quick and easy navigation away from the live TV functionality. Therein, a channel changing user interface element  can be displayed when, for example, a user moves a cursor toward the left-hand side of the television. The channel changing user interface element  can be displayed as an overlay on top of the live TV video feed which is ongoing. In this exemplary embodiment, the channel changing user interface element has four tabs , ,  and . Each of these tabbed views of the channel changing user interface element will be described with respect to  respectively.","Beginning with the leftmost tab , this can be the default view of the user interface element when it is actuated and overlaid on top of the live TV or video feed. When selected, tab  provides for selectable channel numbers in numerical order, e.g., from the lowest numbered channel to the highest as shown in the exemplary embodiment of . Additionally, as shown, an alphanumeric identifier can be provided beside the channel number and a title or other indicator of the program which is currently playing on that channel can be provided below. If a user moves the 3D pointing device  to point at one of the channel entries illustrated in the tab  user interface element, and clicks for example a button on the 3D pointing device , the live TV feed will change to the program which is currently being broadcast or streamed on that channel.","If the user points at the tab  and clicks or provides another selection input via the 3D pointing device , then a UI view such as that seen in  can be presented. Therein the user interface provides a listing of available channels which are alphabetical, e.g., alphabetized based upon the call sign or corresponding channel identifier. Again, the user may use this presentation of selectable channels in the same way to change the video source which is providing the video and audio information powering the live TV feed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 4()","FIG. 4()","FIG. 4()"],"b":["406","406","408","400","300","408","400"]},"In addition to channel changing user interface control elements, exemplary embodiments of the present invention provide for other types of user interface elements which take advantage of the pointing capability associated with these systems. For example,  illustrates another exemplary embodiment of wherein live TV is currently being viewed on the television. At the instant captured in this user interface view, all of the existing user interface elements are displayed in a \u201cghost\u201d image, i.e., primarily transparent except for outlines having a translucent quality associated therewith. In this example of , those control elements include the four global navigation elements  described above, as well as live TV widget icons  and . The global navigation buttons are described in the above-incorporated by reference patent application in more detail and are, therefore, not further described here. Of more interest for the present application, are the icons  and  which enable a viewer to selectively activate overlay controls for controlling a live TV feed and\/or providing DVR functionality as software overlays. For example, the icons  and  can generally be displayed in a ghosted form so as to minimize their impact on the underlying live TV feed. If, however, a user moves, for example, a 3D pointing device  such that a cursor (not shown) is positioned over one of the icons  and , the icon will light up or be filled in in order to indicate its selectable status. For example, as shown in , the icon  associated with volume and DVR controls is highlighted as a cursor is in the vicinity thereof. A user may then request that the user interface display the overlay controls, e.g., by pressing the button on the 3D pointing device , hovering the cursor over the icon  for a predetermined period of time, or any other actuation or selection mechanism. When this occurs, then according to exemplary embodiments, a DVR overlay  and volume control overlay  may appear on top of the live TV video feed displayed on the television. An example of this is shown in .","Therein, the DVR overlay controls generally referenced by reference numeral , include a series of five buttons having symbols thereon associated with DVR functionality including, from left to right, a \u201cNext Segment Back\u201d button, a \u201cRewind\u201d button, a \u201cPause\u201d button, a \u201cFast-Forward\u201d button, and a \u201cNext Segment Forward\u201d button. As with the other controls described herein, a user can quickly and easily affect a DVR control on the TV by positioning a cursor (not shown) over any one of these DVR buttons and clicking thereon to issue an instruction to the user interface to perform the associated DVR functionality. The user interface will receive this command, interpret it as a DVR control command and perform the requested task. Similarly, the volume control overlay  illustrated in this exemplary embodiment provides several mechanisms whereby a user can point and click at the television to control the volume associated with the television program being output. For example, a user can drag the volume level indicator  up or down on the corresponding bar to raise or lower the volume accordingly. Similarly, the user may click at any position on the bar to automatically reposition the level indicator  at the point which is clicked on. The user interface will, again, interpret this as a command to adjust the television volume and control the television accordingly.  illustrates the case where a user has positioned a cursor on top of or in the vicinity of the channel changing icon . This, in turn, causes the user interface to highlight the icon  as compare to the global navigation icon  and  which remain in their ghosted form in this example. As mentioned above, highlighting the icon  indicates that it is selectable. The selection or actuation of this particular icon will result in the display of a channel changing overlay on top of the live TV feed. An example of channel changing mechanisms which can be provided as point and click overlays has been described above in .","In addition to providing powerful point and click overlay controls for live TV, the pointing paradigm associated with these exemplary embodiments provides for other ease of navigation type of media controls. Returning briefly to , actuation of the \u201cSettings\u201d icon , may result, for example, in the UI view illustrated in  being displayed. This UI navigational path provides a user with a convenient mechanism for adjusting various settings associated with the user interface and the replay of media. For example, pointing and clicking on the setup wizard icon  may result in the display of a UI view such as that illustrated in . The setup wizard can provide the user with an easy to navigate mechanism for setting up and configuring various aspects of his or her television system using a pointing device. For example, as shown in , the user can point and click on the screen size associated with the television being used in the system. Similarly, in , a user can enter his or her zip code using a numeric keypad displayed on the television to facilitate point and click data entry.","Similarly, returning to , pointing and clicking on the system status icon  may result in, for example, the display of the UI view such as that illustrated in  which provides information associated with the user's system. Alerts may be provided via icon  in  which can result in the display of a UI view such as that shown in . For example,  provides a user selectable, via point and click mechanism, ability to display caller ID on the television screen when a phone call is received.","Actuating the parental controls button  in  may result in the display of various UI views, examples of which are illustrated beginning with . As seen in , this exemplary point and click parental control user interface provides a three tabbed approach. In the first tab, , setup features are provided for point and click manipulation by a user. Parental controls can be temporarily disabled via the counter , by pointing and clicking at the up or down buttons  and , respectively. The status of various types of parental control settings according to these exemplary embodiments are also displayed under the setup tab . For example, parental control settings by rating can be locked or unlocked. These parental controls can be accessed by pointing and clicking on the tab \u201cBy Rating\u201d . Actuating this tab in the parental tab UI view, may result in the display of the UI view such as that illustrated in . Therein, a user can lock or unlock TV programs or movies based upon their rating by pointing and clicking at the ratings illustrated on the screen. Alternatively, a user can lock individual channels by accessing tab . Pointing and clicking at tab  can, for example, result in the display of a UI view like that illustrated in the example of . Therein, a user can point and click at entries associated with individual channels to lock or unlock the controls associated therewith. The user interface will then only permit the channels which are unlocked to be displayed on the television.","Actuating the \u201cFavorites\u201d icon  in  may result in the display of a UI view such as that illustrated in . Therein, a user can point and click at checkboxes associated with individual channels to populate a favorites list. The list can be scrolled using the scroll arrows or bar positioned, in this example, to the right of the channel list. Actuating the \u201cChange PIN\u201d button in  by positioning the cursor thereover and actuating a button on a pointing device, for example, may result in the display of the UI view shown in . Therein, a user is provided with the facility for entering a numerical PIN number.","According to another exemplary embodiment, the live TV feed described earlier with respect to  can be easily paused. For example, the user interface can interpret a point and click on any portion of the live TV feed, e.g., other than the portions associated with overlay controls, as a request to pause the display of the program. This provides the user with a very convenient mechanism for pausing a program's display if, for example, she or he needs to leave the living room.","Systems and methods for processing data according to exemplary embodiments of the present invention can be performed by one or more processors executing sequences of instructions contained in a memory device. Such instructions may be read into the memory device from other computer-readable mediums such as secondary data storage device(s). Execution of the sequences of instructions contained in the memory device causes the processor to operate, for example, as described above. In alternative embodiments, hard-wire circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions to implement the present invention.","Numerous variations of the afore-described exemplary embodiments are contemplated. The above-described exemplary embodiments are intended to be illustrative in all respects, rather than restrictive, of the present invention.
