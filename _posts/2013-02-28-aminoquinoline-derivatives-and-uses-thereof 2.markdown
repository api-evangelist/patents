Currently available pharmacological treatments (e.g., L-DOPA) are largely symptomatic and lose their efficacy over time, with accompanying severe side effects such as dyskinesia. Thus, there is an unmet clinical need to develop mechanism-based and\/or disease-modifying treatments. The orphan nuclear receptor Nurr1 (also known as NR4A2) is essential not only for development and maintenance of mDA neuronsbut also for their protection from inflammation-induced death. Furthermore, previous studies showed decreased Nurr1 expression in postmortem brains of PD patientsand functional mutant forms in rare familial PD cases, strongly suggesting that Nurr1 is a promising target for the development of novel disease-modifying therapeutics for PD. Thus, there is a need in the art for agonists of Nurr1.","In continuation of inventors efforts to develop new structurally diverse molecular scaffolds for the treatment of malaria [Rawat, D. S.

The pharmaceutically acceptable salt form can also initially confer desirable pharmacokinetic properties on the compound that it did not previously possess, and may even positively affect the pharmacodynamics of the compound with respect to its therapeutic activity in the body. An example of a pharmacokinetic property that can be favorably affected is the manner in which the compound is transported across cell membranes, which in turn may directly and positively affect the absorption, distribution, biotransformation and excretion of the compound. While the route of administration of the pharmaceutical composition is important, and various anatomical, physiological and pathological factors can critically affect bioavailability, the solubility of the compound is usually dependent upon the character of the particular salt form thereof, which it utilized. One of skill in the art will appreciate that an aqueous solution of the compound will provide the most rapid absorption of the compound into the body of a subject being treated, while lipid solutions and suspensions, as well as solid dosage forms, will result in less rapid absorption of the compound.","Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include those derived from inorganic acids such as sulfuric, sulfamic, phosphoric, nitric, and the like; and the salts prepared from organic acids such as acetic, propionic, succinic, glycolic, stearic, lactic, malic, tartaric, citric, ascorbic, palmitic, maleic, hydroxymaleic, phenylacetic, glutamic, benzoic, salicyclic, sulfanilic, 2-acetoxybenzoic, fumaric, toluenesulfonic, methanesulfonic, ethane disulfonic, oxalic, isothionic, and the like. See, for example, Berge et al., \u201cPharmaceutical Salts\u201d, 66:1-19 (1977), the content of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. Exemplary salts also include the hydrobromide, hydrochloride, sulfate, bisulfate, phosphate, nitrate, acetate, succinate, valerate, oleate, palmitate, stearate, laurate, benzoate, lactate, phosphate, tosylate, citrate, maleate, fumarate, succinate, tartrate, napthylate, mesylate, glucoheptonate, lactobionate, and laurylsulphonate salts and the like.

Suitable modification to starting materials by methods well known in the art can also be employed. It is noted, however, that the compounds described herein can also be synthesized by other synthetic routes that others may devise.","It will be readily recognized that certain compounds described herein have atoms with linkages to other atoms that confer a particular stereochemistry to the compound (e.g., chiral centers). It is recognized that synthesis of compounds according to the present invention can result in the creation of mixtures of different stereoisomers (enantiomers, diastereomers). Unless a particular stereochemistry is specified, recitation of a compound is intended to encompass all of the different possible stereoisomers.","Various methods for separating mixtures of different stereoisomers are known in the art. For example, a racemic mixture of a compound may be reacted with an optically active resolving agent to form a pair of diastereoisomeric compounds. The diastereomers may then be separated in order to recover the optically pure enantiomers. Dissociable complexes may also be used to resolve enantiomers (e.g., crystalline diastereoisomeric salts). Diastereomers typically have sufficiently distinct physical properties (e.g., melting points, boiling points, solubilities, reactivity, etc.) that they can be readily separated by taking advantage of these dissimilarities. For example, diastereomers can typically be separated by chromatography or by separation\/resolution techniques based upon differences in solubility. A more detailed description of techniques that can be used to resolve stereoisomers of compounds from their racemic mixture can be found in Jean Jacques Andre Collet, Samuel H. Wilen, Enantiomers, Racemates and Resolutions, John Wiley & Sons, Inc. (1981).","The compounds described herein showed significant in vitro\/in vivo activity against , without any toxicity. Accordingly, in one aspect, the compounds disclosed herein are useful for treatment of infectious diseases such as malarial or any other disease in question.","Inventors have discovered that the compounds described herein are also unexpectedly, surprisingly agonists of orphan nuclear receptor Nurr1. Accordingly, the compounds described herein can be administered to a subject as part of a therapeutic application. In general, the method can be characterized as including a step of administering a therapeutically effective amount of the compound to a subject in need thereof.","In one embodiment, the compounds and method disclosed herein can be used in treating a subject for a disease state in which a decreased Nurr1 activity contributes to the pathology or symptomology of the disease. Disease states in which Nurr1 activity is decreased include, but are not limited to, neurodegerartive diseases, inflammation diseases or disorders, restless leg syndrome, and the like. The compounds and methods disclosed herein can also be used in treating a subject for a disease for which a dopamine agonist is a useful treatment, for example restless leg syndrome.","The disclosure also provides a method for causing the differentiation of a stem cell, e.g., a human embryonic stem cell, into a dopaminergic neuron by contacting the stem cell with a compound described herein that is present in an amount sufficient to induce differentiation of the stem cell. Without limitation, the stem cell can be contacted with the compounds described herein in a cell culture e.g., in vitro or ex vivo, or administrated to a subject, e.g., in vivo. In some embodiments of the invention, a compound described herein can be administrated to a subject to treat, prevent, and\/or diagnose neurodegenerative disorders, including those described herein.","The term \u201ccontacting\u201d or \u201ccontact\u201d as used herein in connection with contacting a stem cell includes subjecting the cell to an appropriate culture media which comprises the indicated compound. Where the stem cell is in vivo, \u201ccontacting\u201d or \u201ccontact\u201d includes administering the compound in a pharmaceutical composition to a subject via an appropriate administration route such that the compound contacts the stem cell in vivo.","By \u201can amount sufficient to induce differentiation\u201d of a stem cell is meant the amount of a compound of the invention required to cause an undifferentiated stem cell to differentiate into a desired cell type, e.g., a neuron.","By \u201cdifferentiation\u201d is meant the process whereby an unspecialized stem cell acquires the features of a specialized cell, e.g., a nerve cell. Differentiation can also refer to the restriction of the potential of a cell to self-renew and is generally associated with a change in the functional capacity of the cell. Differentiation of a stem cell can be determined by methods well known in the art, including analysis for cell markers or morphological features associated with cells of a defined differentiated state. Examples of such markers and features include measurement of glycoprotein, alkaline phosphatase, and carcinoembryonic antigen expression, where an increase in any one of these proteins is an indicator of differentiation.","By \u201cstem cell\u201d is meant any cell with the potential to self-renew and, under appropriate conditions, differentiate into a dedicated progenitor cell or a specified cell or tissue. Stem cells can be pluripotent or multipotent. Stem cells include, but are not limited to embryonic stem cells, embryonic germ cells, adult stem cells, and umbilical cord blood cells.","Stem cells are unique cell populations that have the ability to divide (self-renew) for indefinite periods of time, and, under the right conditions or signals, to differentiate into the many different cell types that make up an organism. Stem cells derived from the inner cell mass of the blastocyst are known as embryonic stem (ES) cells. Stem cells derived from the primordial germ cells, and which normally develop into mature gametes (eggs and sperm) are known as embryonic germ (EG) cells. Both of these types of stem cells are known as pluripotent cells because of their unique ability to differentiate into derivatives of all three embryonic germ layers (endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm).","The pluripotent stem cells can further specialize into another type of multipotent stem cell often derived from adult tissues. Multipotent stem cells are also able to undergo selfrenewal and differentiation, but unlike embryonic stem cells, are committed to give rise to cells that have a particular function. Examples of adult stem cells include hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), which can proliferate and differentiate to produce lymphoid and myeloid cell types; bone marrowderived stem cells (BMSC), which can differentiate into adipocytes, chondrocytes, osteocytes, hepatocytes, cardiomyocytes and neurons; neural stem cells (NSC), which can differentiate into astrocytes, neurons, and oligodendrocytes; and peripheral blood stem cells. Multipotent stem cells have also been derived from epithelial and adipose tissues and umbilical cord blood (UCB).","ES cells, derived from the inner cell mass of preimplantation embryos, have been recognized as the most pluripotent stem cell population and are therefore the preferred cell for the methods of the invention. These cells are capable of unlimited proliferation ex vivo, while maintaining the capacity for differentiation into a Wide variety of somatic and extra-embryonic tissues. ES cells can be male Q(Y) or female (XX); female ES cells are preferred.","Multipotent, adult stem cells can also be used in the methods of the invention. Preferred adult stem cells include hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), Which can proliferate and differentiate throughout life to produce lymphoid and myeloid cell types; bone marrow-derived stem cells (BMSC), Which can differentiate into various cell types including adipocytes, chondrocytes, osteocytes, hepatocytes, cardiomyocytes and neurons; and neural stem cells (NSC), Which can differentiate into astrocytes, neurons, and oligodendrocytes. Multipotent stem cells derived from epithelial and adipose tissues and umbilical cord blood cells can also be used in the methods of the invention.","Stem cells can be derived from source, e.g., any mammal including, but not limited to, mouse, human, and primates. Following acquisition of stem cells, these cells can be used directly in the methods disclosed herein. For example, umbilical cord blood cells can be acquired in sufficient quantity to use directly for therapeutic purposes. Alternatively, stem cells can first be expanded in order to increase the number of available cells. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,338,942, content of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Exemplary mouse strains for stem cell preparation include 129, C57BL\/6, and a hybrid strain (Brook et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 94:5709-5712 (1997), Baharvand et al., In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. Anim. 40:76-81 (2004), content of both of which is incorporated herein by reference). Methods for preparing mouse, human, or primate stem cells are known in the art and are described, for example, in Nagy et al., Manipulating the mouse embryo: A laboratory manual, 3rd ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press (2002); Thomson et al., Science 282:1145-1147 (1998), Marshall et al., Methods Mol.

General methods for culturing mouse, human, or primate ES cells from a blastocyst can be found in Appendix C of the NIH report on stem cells entitled Stem Cells: Scientific Progress and Future Research Directions (June 2001), content of which is incorporated herein by reference. For example, in the first step, the inner cell mass of a preimplantation blastocyst is removed from the trophectoderm that surrounds it. (For cultures of human ES cells, blastocysts are generated by in vitro fertilization and donated for research.) The small plastic culture dishes used to grow the cells contain growth medium supplemented with fetal calf serum, and are sometimes coated with a \u201cfeeder\u201d layer of nondividing cells. The feeder cells are often mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells that have been chemically inactivated so they will not divide. Additional reagents, such as the cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), can also be added to the culture medium for mouse ES cells. Second, after several days to a week, proliferating colonies of cells are removed and dispersed into new culture dishes, each of which may or may not contain an MEF feeder layer. If the cells are to be used to human therapeutic purposes, it is preferable that the MEF feeder layer is not included. Under these ex vivo conditions, the ES cells aggregate to form colonies. In the third major step required to generate ES cell lines, the individual, nondifferentiating colonies are dissociated and replated into new dishes, a step called passage. This replating process establishes a \u201cline\u201d of ES cells. The line of cells is termed \u201cclonal\u201d if a single ES cell generates it. Limiting dilution methods can be used to generate a clonal ES cell line. Reagents needed for the culture of stem cells are commercially available, for example, from Invitrogen, Stem Cell Technologies, R&D Systems, and Sigma Aldrich, and are described, for example, in U.S. Patent Publication Nos. 2004\/0235159 and 2005\/0037492 and Appendix C of the NIH report, Stem Cells: Scientific Progress and Future Research Directions, supra.","For in vivo methods, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound described herein can be administered to a subject. Methods of administering compounds to a subject are known in the art and easily available to one of skill in the art.","As one of skill in the art is aware, promoting stem cell differentiation in a subject can lead to treatment, prevention or amelioration of a number of neurodegenerative disorders. By \u201cneurodegenerative disorder\u201d is meant any disease or disorder caused by or associated with the deterioration of cells or tissues of the nervous system. Exemplary neurodegenerative disorders are polyglutamine expansion disorders (e.g., HD, dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy, Kennedy's disease (also referred to as spinobulbar muscular atrophy), and spinocerebellar ataxia (e.g., type 1, type 2, type 3 (also referred to as Machado-Joseph disease), type 6, type 7, and type 17)), other trinucleotide repeat expansion disorders (e.g., fragile X syndrome, fragile XE mental retardation, Friedreich's ataxia, myotonic dystrophy, spinocerebellar ataxia type 8, and spinocerebellar ataxia type 12), Alexander disease, Alper's disease, Alzheimer disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), ataxia telangiectasia, Batten disease (also referred to as Spielmeyer-Vogt-Sjogren-Batten disease), Canavan disease, Cockayne syndrome, corticobasal degeneration, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, ischemia stroke, Krabbe disease, Lewy body dementia, multiple sclerosis, multiple system atrophy, Parkinson's Disease, Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease, Pick's disease, primary lateral sclerosis, Refsum's disease, Sandhoff disease, Schilder's disease, spinal cord injury, spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), SteeleRichardson-Olszewski disease, and Tabes dorsalis.","In some embodiments, the neurodegenerative disease or disorder is Parkinson's Disease.","Methods of diagnosing subjects as having or being at risk of having Parkinson's Disease are well-known in the art. For example, the presence of one or more of the following symptoms can be used as part of a PD diagnosis: trembling, e.g., an involuntary, rhythmic tremor of one arm or one leg; muscular rigidity, stiffness, or discomfort; general slowness in any of the activities of daily living, e.g., akinesia or bradykinesia; difficulty with walking, balance, or posture; alteration in handwriting; emotional changes; memory loss; speech problems; and difficulty sleeping. Review of a subject's symptoms, activity, medications, concurrent medical problems, or possible toxic exposures can be useful in making a PD diagnosis. In addition, a subject can be tested for the presence or absence of genetic mutations that can indicate an increased likelihood of having Parkinson's Disease. For example, the presence of one or more specific mutations or polymorphisms in the NURR1, alpha-synuclein, parkin, MAPT, DJ-1, PINK1, SNCA, NAT2, or LRRK2 genes can be used to diagnose a subject as having or being at risk of having Parkinson's Disease.

As used herein, the term \u201cinflammation\u201d refers to both acute responses (i.e., responses in which the inflammatory processes are active) and chronic responses (i.e., responses marked by slow progression and formation of new connective tissue). Acute and chronic inflammation may be distinguished by the cell types involved. Acute inflammation often involves polymorphonuclear neutrophils; whereas chronic inflammation is normally characterized by a lymphohistiocytic and\/or granulomatous response.","As used herein, the term \u201cinflammation\u201d includes reactions of both the specific and non-specific defense systems. A specific defense system reaction is a specific immune system reaction response to an antigen (possibly including an autoantigen). A non-specific defense system reaction is an inflammatory response mediated by leukocytes incapable of immunological memory. Such cells include granulocytes, macrophages, neutrophils and eosinophils. Examples of specific types of inflammation include, but are not limited to, diffuse inflammation, focal inflammation, croupous inflammation, interstitial inflammation, obliterative inflammation, parenchymatous inflammation, reactive inflammation, specific inflammation, toxic inflammation and traumatic inflammation.","As used herein, the term \u201cpathogen infection\u201d refers to infection with a pathogen. As used herein the term \u201cpathogen\u201d refers to an organism, including a microorganism, which causes disease in another organism (e.g., animals and plants) by directly infecting the other organism, or by producing agents that causes disease in another organism (e.g., bacteria that produce pathogenic toxins and the like).

The genera of Grampositive bacteria include, for example, , and ","As used herein, the term \u201cspecific defense system\u201d is intended to refer to that component of the immune system that reacts to the presence of specific antigens. Inflammation is said to result from a response of the specific defense system if the inflammation is caused by, mediated by, or associated with a reaction of the specific defense system. Examples of inflammation resulting from a response of the specific defense system include the response to antigens such as rubella virus, autoimmune diseases such as lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, Reynaud's syndrome, multiple sclerosis etc., delayed type hypersensitivity response mediated by T-cells, etc. Chronic inflammatory diseases and the rejection of transplanted tissue and organs are further examples of inflammatory reactions of the specific defense system.","As used herein, a reaction of the \u201cnon-specific defense system\u201d is intended to refer to a reaction mediated by leukocytes incapable of immunological memory. Such cells include granulocytes and macrophages.

An anti-inflammation treatment can also mean prolonging survival as compared to expected survival if not receiving treatment. An anti-inflammation treatment can also completely suppress the inflammation response.","One goal of anti-inflammatory treatment is to bring pro-inflammatory mediator levels down to as close to normal as is safely possible. Accordingly, in one embodiment, level of at least one pro-inflammatory mediator in the subject undergoing treatment is reduced by at least 5%, at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, or at least 50% relative to a reference level. A reference level can be the level of the pro-inflammatory mediator in the subject before onset of treatment regime.","The compounds, compositions, and methods disclosed herein can also be used for research purposes for the study of differentiation or development, and for the generation of transgenic animals useful for research purposes.

Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the subject to be treated; each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active compound calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. The specification for the dosage unit forms of the disclosure are dictated by and directly dependent on the unique characteristics of the active compound and the particular therapeutic effect to be achieved, and the limitations inherent in the art of compounding such an active compound for the treatment of individuals. The pharmaceutical compositions can be included in a container, pack, or dispenser together with instructions for administration.","The amount of a compound described herein that can be combined with a carrier material to produce a single dosage form will generally be an effective amount of the compound. A pharmaceutical composition typically contains an amount of at least 0.01 weight % of active ingredient, i.e., a compound of this disclosure, per weight of total pharmaceutical composition. Generally out of one hundred percent, this amount will range from about 0.01% to 99% of the compound, preferably from about 5% to about 70%, most preferably from 10% to about 30%. A weight % is a ratio by weight of active ingredient to total composition. Thus, for example, 0.1 weight % is 0.1 grams of the compound per 100 grams of total composition.","The preparation of pharmaceutical compositions that contain an active component is well understood in the art, for example, by mixing, granulating, or tablet-forming processes. The active therapeutic ingredient is often mixed with excipients that are pharmaceutically acceptable and compatible with the active ingredient. For oral administration, the active agents are mixed with additives customary for this purpose, such as vehicles, stabilizers, or inert diluents, and converted by customary methods into suitable forms for administration, such as tablets, coated tablets, hard or soft gelatin capsules, aqueous, alcoholic, or oily solutions and the like as detailed above.","For intravenous administration, glucuronic acid, L-lactic acid, acetic acid, citric acid or any pharmaceutically acceptable acid\/conjugate base with reasonable buffering capacity in the pH range acceptable for intravenous administration can be used as buffers. Sodium chloride solution wherein the pH has been adjusted to the desired range with either acid or base, for example, hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide, can also be employed. Typically, a pH range for the intravenous formulation can be in the range of from about 5 to about 12.","Subcutaneous formulations can be prepared according to procedures well known in the art at a pH in the range between about 5 and about 12, which include suitable buffers and isotonicity agents. They can be formulated to deliver a daily dose of the active agent in one or more daily subcutaneous administrations. The choice of appropriate buffer and pH of a formulation, depending on solubility of one or more compounds to be administered, is readily made by a person having ordinary skill in the art. Sodium chloride solution wherein the pH has been adjusted to the desired range with either acid or base, for example, hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide, can also be employed in the subcutaneous formulation. Typically, a pH range for the subcutaneous formulation can be in the range of from about 5 to about 12.","Formulations of the invention suitable for oral administration can be in the form of a solid, gel or liquid. For example, the formulation can be in the form of capsules, cachets, pills, tablets, lozenges (using a flavored basis, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth), powders, granules, or as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid, or as an oil-in-water or water-in-oil liquid emulsion, or as an elixir or syrup, or as pastilles (using an inert base, such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia) and\/or as mouth washes and the like. More specific examples of oral tablets include compressed, chewable lozenges and tablets that can be enteric-coated, sugarcoated or film-coated.

The kit can also comprise packaging materials. The packaging material can comprise a container for housing the composition. The kit can also optionally comprise additional components, such as syringes for administration of the composition. The kit can comprise the composition in single or multiple dose forms.","In another embodiment, an article of manufacture is provided that comprises a composition comprising at least one compound disclosed herein in combination with packaging materials. The packaging material can comprise a container for housing the composition. The container can optionally comprise a label indicating the disease state for which the composition is to be administered, storage information, dosing information and\/or instructions regarding how to administer the composition. The kit can also optionally comprise additional components, such as syringes for administration of the composition. The kit can comprise the composition in single or multiple dose forms.","It is noted that the packaging material used in kits and articles of manufacture according to the present invention can form a plurality of divided containers such as a divided bottle or a divided foil packet. The container can be in any conventional shape or form as known in the art which is made of a pharmaceutically acceptable material, for example a paper or cardboard box, a glass or plastic bottle or jar, a re-sealable bag (for example, to hold a \u201crefill\u201d of tablets for placement into a different container), or a blister pack with individual doses for pressing out of the pack according to a therapeutic schedule. The container that is employed will depend on the exact dosage form involved, for example a conventional cardboard box would not generally be used to hold a liquid suspension. It is feasible that more than one container can be used together in a single package to market a single dosage form. For example, tablets can be contained in a bottle that is in turn contained within a box. Typically the kit includes directions for the administration of the separate components. The kit form is particularly advantageous when the separate components are preferably administered in different dosage forms (e.g., oral, topical, transdermal and parenteral), are administered at different dosage intervals, or when titration of the individual components of the combination is desired by the prescribing physician.","One particular example of a kit according to the present invention is a so-called blister pack. Blister packs are well known in the packaging industry and are being widely used for the packaging of pharmaceutical unit dosage forms (tablets, capsules, and the like). Blister packs generally consist of a sheet of relatively stiff material covered with a foil of a preferably transparent plastic material. During the packaging process recesses are formed in the plastic foil. The recesses have the size and shape of individual tablets or capsules to be packed or can have the size and shape to accommodate multiple tablets and\/or capsules to be packed. Next, the tablets or capsules are placed in the recesses accordingly and the sheet of relatively stiff material is sealed against the plastic foil at the face of the foil which is opposite from the direction in which the recesses were formed. As a result, the tablets or capsules are individually sealed or collectively sealed, as desired, in the recesses between the plastic foil and the sheet. Preferably the strength of the sheet is such that the tablets or capsules can be removed from the blister pack by manually applying pressure on the recesses whereby an opening is formed in the sheet at the place of the recess. The tablet or capsule can then be removed via said opening.","Another specific embodiment of a kit is a dispenser designed to dispense the daily doses one at a time in the order of their intended use. Preferably, the dispenser is equipped with a memory-aid, so as to further facilitate compliance with the regimen. An example of such a memory-aid is a mechanical counter that indicates the number of daily doses that has been dispensed. Another example of such a memory-aid is a battery-powered micro-chip memory coupled with a liquid crystal readout, or audible reminder signal which, for example, reads out the date that the last daily dose has been taken and\/or reminds one when the next dose is to be taken.","The compounds described herein can be used or administrated to a subject in combination with another compound, e.g., a pharmaceutically active agent or treatment modality for a particular indication.

Without wishing to be bound by a theory, it is believed that the combination of a compound disclosed herein with a dopamine agonist shows a synergistic effect on stimulating the transcriptional activity through the ligand binding domain of Nurr1 and enhancing the contrasting dual function of Nurr1.","As used herein, the term \u201cdopamine agonist\u201d refers to compounds that activate and\/or stimulate one or more dopamine receptors and\/or increase levels of dopamine (such as L-dopa or drugs which inhibit dopamine metabolism) and\/or stimulate a dopamine signaling pathway and\/or reduce levels of norepinephrine, and\/or inhibit a norepinephrine signaling pathway. The term \u201cdopamine agonist\u201d also includes analogs of dopamine molecules which exhibit at least some biological activity in common with native human dopamine receptors. As such, the term \u201cdopamine agonist\u201d encompasses dopaminergic agents. As used herein the term \u201cdopaminergic agent\u201d refers to compounds which mimic the action of dopamine. Accordingly, the term dopaminergic agent is intended to encompass dopamine, derivatives of dopamine, and compounds which have dopamine like actions on dopamine receptors. Exemplary analogs of dopamine include the ergolines and the aporphines such apomorphine, pergolide, bromocriptine and lisuride). Dopamine agonists are primarily used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease due to their neuroprotective effects on dopaminergic neurons.","Without wishing to be bound by a theory, a dopamine agonist can act via one of several pathways. For example, a dopamine agonist can activate or potentiate D1 dopamine receptors and\/or Dj-like receptors such as D1 and D5 dopamine receptors and\/or D2 dopamine receptors (e.g., D2, D2 short and D2 long receptors, D4, and D4 dopamine receptors) and\/or D3 dopamine receptors and\/or D4 dopamine receptors.

The term \u201cprodrug\u201d as used herein refers to compounds that can be converted via some chemical or physiological process (e.g., enzymatic processes and metabolic hydrolysis) to compound described herein. Thus, the term \u201cprodrug\u201d also refers to a precursor of a biologically active compound that is pharmaceutically acceptable. A prodrug can be inactive when administered to a subject, i.e. an ester, but is converted in vivo to an active compound, for example, by hydrolysis to the free carboxylic acid or free hydroxyl. The prodrug compound often offers advantages of solubility, tissue compatibility or delayed release in an organism. The term \u201cprodrug\u201d is also meant to include any covalently bonded carriers, which release the active compound in vivo when such prodrug is administered to a subject. Prodrugs of an active compound, as described herein, may be prepared by modifying functional groups present in the active compound in such a way that the modifications are cleaved, either in routine manipulation or in vivo, to the parent active compound. Prodrugs include compounds wherein a hydroxy, amino or mercapto group is bonded to any group that, when the prodrug of the active compound is administered to a subject, cleaves to form a free hydroxy, free amino or free mercapto group, respectively. For example, a compound comprising a hydroxy group can be administered as an ester that is converted by hydrolysis in vivo to the hydroxy compound. Suitable esters that can be converted in vivo into hydroxy compounds include acetates, citrates, lactates, tartrates, malonates, oxalates, salicylates, propionates, succinates, fumarates, formates, benzoates, maleates, methylene-bis-b-hydroxynaphthoates, gentisates, isethionates, di-p-toluoyltartrates, methanesulfonates, ethanesulfonates, benzenesulfonates, p-toluenesulfonates, cyclohexylsulfamates, quinates, esters of amino acids, and the like. Similarly, a compound comprising an amine group can be administered as an amide, e.g., acetamide, formamide and benzamide that is converted by hydrolysis in vivo to the amine compound.

Protected derivatives are useful in the preparation of compounds or in themselves can be active. A comprehensive list of suitable protecting groups can be found in T. W. Greene, 3rd edition, John Wiley & Sons, Inc. 1999.","\u201cIsomers\u201d mean any compound having identical molecular formulae but differing in the nature or sequence of bonding of their atoms or in the arrangement of their atoms in space. Isomers that differ in the arrangement of their atoms in space are termed \u201cstereoisomers\u201d. Stereoisomers that are not mirror images of one another are termed \u201cdiastereomers\u201d and stereoisomers that are nonsuperimposable mirror images are termed \u201cenantiomers\u201d or sometimes \u201coptical isomers\u201d. A carbon atom bonded to four nonidentical substituents is termed a \u201cchiral center\u201d. A compound with one chiral center has two enantiomeric forms of opposite chirality. A mixture of the two enantiomeric forms is termed a \u201cracemic mixture\u201d. A compound that has more than one chiral center has 2enantiomeric pairs, where n is the number of chiral centers. Compounds with more than one chiral center may exist as ether an individual diastereomers or as a mixture of diastereomers, termed a \u201cdiastereomeric mixture\u201d. When one chiral center is present a stereoisomer may be characterized by the absolute configuration of that chiral center. Absolute configuration refers to the arrangement in space of the substituents attached to the chiral center. Enantiomers are characterized by the absolute configuration of their chiral centers and described by the R- and S-sequencing rules of Cahn, Ingold and Prelog. Conventions for stereochemical nomenclature, methods for the determination of stereochemistry and the separation of stereoisomers are well known in the art (e.g., see \u201cAdvanced Organic Chemistry\u201d, 4th edition, March, Jerry, John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1992).","The term \u201cenantiomer\u201d is used to describe one of a pair of molecular isomers which are mirror images of each other and non-superimposable. Other terms used to designate or refer to enantiomers include \u201cstereoisomers\u201d (because of the different arrangement or stereochemistry around the chiral center; although all enantiomers are stereoisomers, not all stereoisomers are enantiomers) or \u201coptical isomers\u201d (because of the optical activity of pure enantiomers, which is the ability of different pure enantiomers to rotate planepolarized light in different directions). Enantiomers generally have identical physical properties, such as melting points and boiling points, and also have identical spectroscopic properties. Enantiomers can differ from each other with respect to their interaction with plane-polarized light and with respect to biological activity.","The designations \u201cR\u201d and \u201cS\u201d are used to denote the absolute configuration of the molecule about its chiral center(s). The designations may appear as a prefix or as a suffix; they may or may not be separated from the isomer by a hyphen; they may or may not be hyphenated; and they may or may not be surrounded by parentheses.","The designations or prefixes \u201c(+)\u201d and \u201c(\u2212)\u201d are employed to designate the sign of rotation of plane-polarized light by the compound, with (\u2212) meaning that the compound is levorotatory (rotates to the left). A compound prefixed with (+) is dextrorotatory (rotates to the right).","The term \u201cracemic mixture,\u201d \u201cracemic compound\u201d or \u201cracemate\u201d refers to a mixture of the two enantiomers of one compound. An ideal racemic mixture is one wherein there is a 50:50 mixture of both enantiomers of a compound such that the optical rotation of the (+) enantiomer cancels out the optical rotation of the (\u2212) enantiomer.","The term \u201cresolving\u201d or \u201cresolution\u201d when used in reference to a racemic mixture refers to the separation of a racemate into its two enantiomorphic forms (i.e., (+) and (\u2212); 65 (R) and (S) forms). The terms can also refer to enantioselective conversion of one isomer of a racemate to a product.","The term \u201cenantiomeric excess\u201d or \u201cee\u201d refers to a reaction product wherein one enantiomer is produced in excess of the other, and is defined for a mixture of (+)- and (\u2212)-enantiomers, with composition given as the mole or weight or volume fraction F(+) and F(\u2212) (where the sum of F(+) and F(\u2212)=1). The enantiomeric excess is defined as *F(+)\u2212F(\u2212)* and the percent enantiomeric excess by 100\u00d7*F(+)\u2212F(\u2212)*. The \u201cpurity\u201d of an enantiomer is described by its ee or percent ee value (% ee).","Whether expressed as a \u201cpurified enantiomer\u201d or a \u201cpure enantiomer\u201d or a \u201cresolved enantiomer\u201d or \u201ca compound in enantiomeric excess\u201d, the terms are meant to indicate that the amount of one enantiomer exceeds the amount of the other. Thus, when referring to an enantiomer preparation, both (or either) of the percent of the major enantiomer (e.g. by mole or by weight or by volume) and (or) the percent enantiomeric excess of the major enantiomer may be used to determine whether the preparation represents a purified enantiomer preparation.","The term \u201cenantiomeric purity\u201d or \u201cenantiomer purity\u201d of an isomer refers to a qualitative or quantitative measure of the purified enantiomer; typically, the measurement is expressed on the basis of ee or enantiomeric excess.","The terms \u201csubstantially purified enantiomer,\u201d \u201csubstantially resolved enantiomer\u201d \u201csubstantially purified enantiomer preparation\u201d are meant to indicate a preparation (e.g. derived from non-optically active starting material, substrate, or intermediate) wherein one enantiomer has been enriched over the other, and more preferably, wherein the other enantiomer represents less than 20%, more preferably less than 10%, and more preferably less than 5%, and still more preferably, less than 2% of the enantiomer or enantiomer preparation.","The terms \u201cpurified enantiomer,\u201d \u201cresolved enantiomer\u201d and \u201cpurified enantiomer preparation\u201d are meant to indicate a preparation (e.g. derived from non-optically active starting material, substrates or intermediates) wherein one enantiomer (for example, the R-enantiomer) is enriched over the other, and more preferably, wherein the other enantiomer (for example the S-enantiomer) represents less than 30%, preferably less than 20%, more preferably less than 10% (e.g. in this particular instance, the R-enantiomer is substantially free of the S-enantiomer), and more preferably less than 5% and still more preferably, less than 2% of the preparation. A purified enantiomer may be synthesized substantially free of the other enantiomer, or a purified enantiomer may be synthesized in a stereo-preferred procedure, followed by separation steps, or a purified enantiomer may be derived from a racemic mixture.","The term \u201cenantioselectivity,\u201d also called the enantiomeric ratio indicated by the symbol \u201cE,\u201d refers to the selective capacity of an enzyme to generate from a racemic substrate one enantiomer relative to the other in a product racemic mixture; in other words, it is a measure of the ability of the enzyme to distinguish between enantiomers. A nonselective reaction has an E of 1, while resolutions with E's above 20 are generally considered useful for synthesis or resolution. The enantioselectivity resides in a difference in conversion rates between the enantiomers in question. Reaction products are obtained that are enriched in one of the enantiomers; conversely, remaining substrates are enriched in the other enantiomer. For practical purposes it is generally desirable for one of the enantiomers to be obtained in large excess. This is achieved by terminating the conversion process at a certain degree of conversion.","As used herein, the terms \u201ceffective\u201d and \u201ceffectiveness\u201d includes both pharmacological effectiveness and physiological safety. Pharmacological effectiveness refers to the ability of the treatment to result in a desired biological effect in the patient. Physiological safety refers to the level of toxicity, or other adverse physiological effects at the cellular, organ and\/or organism level (often referred to as side-effects) resulting from administration of the treatment. \u201cLess effective\u201d means that the treatment results in a therapeutically significant lower level of pharmacological effectiveness and\/or a therapeutically greater level of adverse physiological effects. The compounds described herein are effective in treating various types of cancer.","The terms \u201cdecrease\u201d, \u201creduced\u201d, \u201creduction\u201d, \u201cdecrease\u201d or \u201cinhibit\u201d are all used herein generally to mean a decrease by a statistically significant amount. However, for avoidance of doubt, \u201creduced\u201d, \u201creduction\u201d or \u201cdecrease\u201d or \u201cinhibit\u201d means a decrease by at least 10% as compared to a reference level, for example a decrease by at least about 20%, or at least about 30%, or at least about 40%, or at least about 50%, or at least about 60%, or at least about 70%, or at least about 80%, or at least about 90% or up to and including a 100% decrease (e.g. absent level as compared to a reference sample), or any decrease between 10-100% as compared to a reference level.","The terms \u201cincreased\u201d, \u201cincrease\u201d or \u201cenhance\u201d or \u201cactivate\u201d are all used herein to generally mean an increase by a statically significant amount, for the avoidance of any doubt, the terms \u201cincreased\u201d, \u201cincrease\u201d or \u201cenhance\u201d or \u201cactivate\u201d means an increase of at least 10% as compared to a reference level, for example an increase of at least about 20%, or at least about 30%, or at least about 40%, or at least about 50%, or at least about 60%, or at least about 70%, or at least about 80%, or at least about 90% or up to and including a 100% increase or any increase between 10-100% as compared to a reference level, or at least about a 2-fold, or at least about a 3-fold, or at least about a 4-fold, or at least about a 5-fold or at least about a 10-fold increase, or any increase between 2-fold and 10-fold or greater as compared to a reference level.","The term \u201cstatistically significant\u201d or \u201csignificantly\u201d refers to statistical significance and generally means at least two standard deviation (2SD) away from a reference level. The term refers to statistical evidence that there is a difference. It is defined as the probability of making a decision to reject the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is actually true.","As used herein, a \u201csubject\u201d means a human or animal. Usually the animal is a vertebrate such as a primate, rodent, domestic animal or game animal. Primates include chimpanzees, cynomologous monkeys, spider monkeys, and macaques, e.g., Rhesus. Rodents include mice, rats, woodchucks, ferrets, rabbits and hamsters. Domestic and game animals include cows, horses, pigs, deer, bison, buffalo, feline species, e.g., domestic cat, canine species, e.g., dog, fox, wolf, avian species, e.g., chicken, emu, ostrich, and fish, e.g., trout, catfish and salmon. Patient or subject includes any subset of the foregoing, e.g., all of the above, but excluding one or more groups or species such as humans, primates or rodents. In certain embodiments of the aspects described herein, the subject is a mammal, e.g., a primate, e.g., a human. The terms, \u201cpatient\u201d and \u201csubject\u201d are used interchangeably herein. The terms, \u201cpatient\u201d and \u201csubject\u201d are used interchangeably herein. A subject can be male or female.","Preferably, the subject is a mammal. The mammal can be a human, non-human primate, mouse, rat, dog, cat, horse, or cow, but are not limited to these examples. Mammals other than humans can be advantageously used as subjects that represent animal models of human diseases and disorders. In addition, compounds, compositions and methods described herein can be used to treat domesticated animals and\/or pets.","In jurisdictions that forbid the patenting of methods that are practiced on the human body, the meaning of \u201cadministering\u201d of a composition to a human subject shall be restricted to prescribing a controlled substance that a human subject will self-administer by any technique (e.g., orally, inhalation, topical application, injection, insertion, etc.). The broadest reasonable interpretation that is consistent with laws or regulations defining patentable subject matter is intended. In jurisdictions that do not forbid the patenting of methods that are practiced on the human body, the \u201cadministering\u201d of compositions includes both methods practiced on the human body and also the foregoing activities.","As used herein, the term \u201cadminister\u201d refers to the placement of a composition into a subject by a method or route which results in at least partial localization of the composition at a desired site such that desired effect is produced. A compound or composition described herein can be administered by any appropriate route known in the art including, but not limited to, oral or parenteral routes, including intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, transdermal, airway (aerosol), pulmonary, nasal, rectal, and topical (including buccal and sublingual) administration.","Exemplary modes of administration include, but are not limited to, injection, infusion, instillation, inhalation, or ingestion. \u201cInjection\u201d includes, without limitation, intravenous, intramuscular, intraarterial, intrathecal, intraventricular, intracapsular, intraorbital, intracardiac, intradermal, intraperitoneal, transtracheal, subcutaneous, subcuticular, intraarticular, sub capsular, subarachnoid, intraspinal, intracerebro spinal, and intrasternal injection and infusion. In preferred embodiments, the compositions are administered by intravenous infusion or injection.","Administration can also be by transmucosal or transdermal means. For transmucosal or transdermal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally known in the art, and include, for example, for transmucosal administration, detergents, bile salts, and fusidic acid derivatives. Transmucosal administration can be accomplished through the use of nasal sprays or suppositories. For transdermal administration, the compounds are formulated into ointments, salves, gels, or creams as generally known in the art.","The phrase \u201ctherapeutically-effective amount\u201d as used herein means that amount of a compound, material, or composition comprising a compound described herein which is effective for producing some desired therapeutic effect in at least a sub-population of cells in a subject at a reasonable benefit\/risk ratio applicable to any medical treatment. Thus, \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d means that amount which, when administered to a subject for treating a disease, is sufficient to effect such treatment for the disease.","Determination of an effective amount is well within the capability of those skilled in the art. Generally, the actual effective amount can vary with the specific compound, the use or application technique, the desired effect, the duration of the effect and side effects, the subject's history, age, condition, sex, as well as the severity and type of the medical condition in the subject, and administration of other pharmaceutically active agents. Accordingly, an effective dose of compound described herein is an amount sufficient to produce at least some desired therapeutic effect in a subject.","The data obtained from the cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in humans. The dosage of such compounds lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the EDwith little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of use or administration utilized.","The effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose can be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC(i.e., the concentration of the therapeutic which achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture. Levels in plasma can be measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography. The effects of any particular dosage can be monitored by a suitable bioassay. The effective plasma concentration for a compound as disclosed herein can be about 0.01 \u03bcM to about 10 \u03bcM, about 0.2 \u03bcM to about 5 \u03bcM, or about 0.8 to about 3 \u03bcM in a subject, such as a rat, dog, or human.","Generally, the compositions are administered so that a compound of the disclosure herein is used or given at a dose from 1 \u03bcg\/kg to 1000 mg\/kg; 1 \u03bcg\/kg to 500 mg\/kg; 1 \u03bcg\/kg to 150 mg\/kg, 1 \u03bcg\/kg to 100 mg\/kg, 1 \u03bcg\/kg to 50 mg\/kg, 1 \u03bcg\/kg to 20 mg\/kg, 1 \u03bcg\/kg to 10 mg\/kg, 1 \u03bcg\/kg to 1 mg\/kg, 100 \u03bcg\/kg to 100 mg\/kg, 100 \u03bcg\/kg to 50 mg\/kg, 100 \u03bcg\/kg to 20 mg\/kg, 100 \u03bcg\/kg to 10 mg\/kg, 100 \u03bcg\/kg to 1 mg\/kg, 1 mg\/kg to 100 mg\/kg, 1 mg\/kg to 50 mg\/kg, 1 mg\/kg to 20 mg\/kg, 1 mg\/kg to 10 mg\/kg, 10 mg\/kg to 100 mg\/kg, 10 mg\/kg to 50 mg\/kg, or 10 mg\/kg to 20 mg\/kg.

It is to be further understood that the ranges intermediate to those given above are also within the scope of this disclosure, for example, in the range 1 mg\/kg to 10 mg\/kg, for example use or dose ranges such as 2 mg\/kg to 8 mg\/kg, 3 mg\/kg to 7 mg\/kg, 4 mg\/kg to 6 mg\/kg, and the like.","The compounds described herein can be administered at once, or can be divided into a number of smaller doses to be administered at intervals of time. It is understood that the precise dosage and duration of treatment will be a function of the location of where the composition is parenterally administered, the carrier and other variables that can be determined empirically using known testing protocols or by extrapolation from in vivo or in vitro test data. It is to be noted that concentrations and dosage values can also vary with the age of the individual treated. It is to be further understood that for any particular subject, specific dosage regimens can need to be adjusted over time according to the individual need and the professional judgment of the person administering or supervising the administration of the formulations. Hence, the concentration ranges set forth herein are intended to be exemplary and are not intended to limit the scope or practice of the claimed formulations.","The compound can be administered as a single bolus or multiple boluses, as a continuous infusion, or a combination thereof. For example, the compound can be administered as a single bolus initially, and then administered as a continuous infusion following the bolus. The rate of the infusion can be any rate sufficient to maintain effective plasma concentration. Some contemplated infusion rates include from 1 \u03bcg\/kg\/min to 100 mg\/kg\/min, or from 1 \u03bcg\/kg\/hr to 1000 mg\/kg\/hr. Rates of infusion can include 0.2 to 1.5 mg\/kg\/min, or more specifically 0.25 to 1 mg\/kg\/min, or even more specifically 0.25 to 0.5 mg\/kg\/min. It will be appreciated that the rate of infusion can be determined based upon the dose necessary to maintain effective plasma concentration and the rate of elimination of the compound, such that the compound is administered via infusion at a rate sufficient to safely maintain a sufficient effective plasma concentration of compound in the bloodstream.","The terms \u201cco-administration\u201d or the like, as used herein, are meant to encompass administration of the selected therapeutic agents to a single patient, and are intended to include treatment regimens in which the agents are administered by the same or different route of administration or at the same or different time.","Generally, the term \u201ctreatment\u201d or \u201ctreating\u201d is defined as the application or administration of a therapeutic agent to a patient, or application or administration of a therapeutic agent to an isolated tissue or cell line from a patient, said patient having a disease, a symptom of disease or a predisposition toward a disease, with the purpose to cure, heal, alleviate, relieve, alter, remedy, ameliorate, improve or affect the disease, the symptoms of disease or the predisposition toward disease. Thus, treating can include suppressing, inhibiting, preventing, treating, or a combination thereof. Treating refers, inter alia, to increasing time to sustained progression, expediting remission, inducing remission, augmenting remission, speeding recovery, increasing efficacy of or decreasing resistance to alternative therapeutics, or a combination thereof. \u201cSuppressing\u201d or \u201cinhibiting\u201d, refers, inter alia, to delaying the onset of symptoms, preventing relapse to a disease, decreasing the number or frequency of relapse episodes, increasing latency between symptomatic episodes, reducing the severity of symptoms, reducing the severity of an acute episode, reducing the number of symptoms, reducing the incidence of disease-related symptoms, reducing the latency of symptoms, ameliorating symptoms, reducing secondary symptoms, reducing secondary infections, prolonging patient survival, or a combination thereof. In one embodiment the symptoms are primary, while in another embodiment symptoms are secondary. \u201cPrimary\u201d refers to a symptom that is a direct result of a disorder, e.g., diabetes, while, secondary refers to a symptom that is derived from or consequent to a primary cause.

In one embodiment, the symptoms of a disease or disorder are alleviated by at least 5%, at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, or at least 50%.","Specifically, by \u201ctreatment, prevention or amelioration of neurodegenerative disorder\u201d is meant delaying or preventing the onset of such a disorder (e.g. death of motor neurons), at reversing, alleviating, ameliorating, inhibiting, slowing down or stopping the progression, aggravation or deterioration the progression or severity of such a condition. In one embodiment, the symptom of a neurodegenerative disorder is alleviated by at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, or at least 50%. In one embodiment, the symptom of a neurodegenerative disease is alleviated by more than 50%. In one embodiment, the symptom of a neurodegenerative disorder is alleviated by 80%, 90%, or greater.","Efficacy of treatment is determined in association with any known method for diagnosing the disorder. Alleviation of one or more symptoms of the disorder indicates that the compound confers a clinical benefit. Any of the therapeutic methods described to above can be applied to any suitable subject including, for example, mammals such as dogs, cats, cows, horses, rabbits, monkeys, and most preferably, humans.","By \u201cembryonic stem cell\u201d is meant a cell, derived from an embryo at the blastocyst stage, or before substantial differentiation of the cell into the three germ layers, that can selfrenew and displays morphological characteristics of undifferentiated cells, distinguishing them from differentiated cells of embryonic or adult origin. Exemplary morphological characteristics include high nuclear\/cytoplasmic ratios and prominent nucleoli under a microscope. Under appropriate conditions known to the skilled artisan, embryonic stem cells can differentiate into cells or tissues of the three germ layers: endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm.

Similarly, other compounds as depicted in  were also synthesized. The 4-aminoquinoline-pyrimidine conjugates were synthesized using three step procedure as outlined in Scheme 1. The commercially available starting material 4,7-dichloroquinoline (8) was reacted with an excess of aliphatic linear chain diaminoalkanes via SNAr type of reaction in neat conditions as reported in literature to afford substituted 4-aminoquinolines (9a-d) with free terminal amino group in goodto excellent yield [Roepe, P. D. J. Med. Chem. 2008, 51, 3466]. These intermediates (9a-d) on reaction with commercially available 2,4-dichloro-6-methyl-pyrimidine yielded two regioisomersviz 10a-d in major and 11a-d in minor yield. The major regioisomers 10a-d was subjected to nucleophilic substitution with different cyclic secondary amines at an elevated temperature in DMF as solvent, to yield 4-aminoquinoline-pyrimidine conjugates (12a-n) in excellent yield.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0372","num":"0453"},"chemistry":[{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00321","num":"00321"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00321","he":"201.25mm","wi":"75.86mm","file":"US09567316-20170214-C00321.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00322","num":"00322"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00322","he":"82.21mm","wi":"71.46mm","file":"US09567316-20170214-C00322.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}]},"In vitro antimalarial activity of all the conjugates was studied against both CQ-sensitive (D6 clone) and CQ-resistant (W2 clone) strains of while mammalian cell cytotoxicity was determined against Vero, LLC-PK-1, HepG2 cells (Table 6) using procedure as described earlier [Jain, R. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2005, 13, 4458; Khan, I. A. Lipids 2004, 37, 169]. Most of the compounds have shown very promising antimalarial activity. Out of these, eleven compounds (12b-c, 12e-f, 12h-n) have displayed better antimalarial activity (IC50=0.006 \u03bcM to 0.041 \u03bcM) against CQ-sensitive strain, while thirteen compounds (10a, 12b-f, 12h-n) have displayed better antimalarial activity (IC50=0.016 \u03bcM to 0.34 \u03bcM) against CQ-resistant strains of . The selectivity index of antimalarial activity (calculated as a ratio of IC50 for cytotoxicity to Vero cells and IC50 for antimalarial activity) was very high for most of these compounds as compared to standard drug chloroquine (CQ). The activity of (12i, 12j, 12l and 12m) was 7-8 fold higher than CQ and 2 fold higher than artemisinin in CQ-sensitive strain revealing their strong potency. The comparison of antimalarial activity of 10a-d with 12a-n clearly showed that substitution of Cl from compounds 10a-d (IC50=0.15 \u03bcM to 0.46 \u03bcM for CQ-sensitive and 0.34 \u03bcM to 0.74 \u03bcM for CQ-resistant) with secondary amines (12b-f and 12h-n, IC50=0.006 \u03bcM to 0.066 \u03bcM for CQ-sensitive and 0.016 \u03bcM to 0.211 \u03bcM for CQ-resistant) improves antimalarial activity of these compounds. The comparison of antimalarial activity of two groups of regioisomers 10a-d (IC50=0.15 \u03bcM to 0.46 \u03bcM for CQ-sensitive and 0.34 \u03bcM to 0.74 \u03bcM for CQ-resistant) and 11a-d (IC50=0.16 \u03bcM to 0.27 \u03bcM for CQ-sensitive and 0.56 \u03bcM to 0.1.24 \u03bcM for CQ-resistant) clearly indicates that both the regioisomers displayed more or less similar potency against both the strains of . These results indicate that the point of attachment of the spacer to the pyrimidine nucleus may not have a great impact on activity profile. For a particular amino substituted 4-aminoquinoline-pyrimidine hybrids (12a-d or 12e-h or 12i-1), structure activity relationship (SAR) study demonstrated no obvious trend of activity with increasing or decreasing carbon spacer from C2 to C6 but changing the amino groups for a particular C2 (12e, 12i), C3 (12b, 12f, 12j, 12m), C4 (12c, 12k, 12n) or C6 (12d, 12h, 12l) spacer changes the activity significantly in a decreasing order of 4-ethyl piperazine>4-methyl piperazine>morpholine>piperidine.","Among the most active compounds (12b-12f, 12h-12n), although 12d, 12h, and 12l showed toxicity to all the three cell lines (VERO, LLC-PK-1, and HepG2) but their selectivity index of antimalarial activity was considerably high (Table 7). In general, the cytotoxicity of the most of the conjugates was at much higher concentrations than the concentrations responsible for their antimalarial activity. Some of the hybrids were not cytotoxic at all up to the highest tested concentration of 60 \u03bcM indicating their high selectivity index of antimalarial activity versus cytotoxicity to mammalian cells.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0375","num":"0456"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00006","num":"00006"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"378pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 6"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"In-vitro antimalarial activity of 4-aminoquinoline-pyrimidine hybrids"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"70pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},{"i":"P. falciparum "},{"i":"P. falciparum"}]},{"entry":["Comp.

A Nurr1-expression plasmid, pSV40Nurr1, was kindly provided by Dr Orla M. Conneely at Baylor College of Medicine (Houston, Tex., USA). Full-length mouse Nurr1cDNA was amplified by RT-PCR from pSV40Nurr1 using forward 5\u2032-GCTTTCAAGCTTATGCCTTGTGTTCAGGCGCAGTATGG-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO: 1) and reverse 5\u2032-GTCAATCTCGAGGAAAGGTAAGGTGTCCAGGAAAAG-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO: 2) oligonucleotides. The amplified PCR fragment was cut with Hind III and Xho I and then cloned into the plasmid pCDNA3.1\/myc-His (Invitrogen), resulted in the expression of a C-terminal myc-tagged fusion protein and named with pCMVNurr1-myc. The NM 1 LBD fragment from amino acid position 328 to amino acid position 598 was PCR-amplified and subcloned into pZeoSV (Invitrogen) containing the GAL4 DNA binding domain. The Nur77 LBD (aa 354-598), glucocorticoid receptor-a (GR\u03b1) LBD (aa 522-777), liver X receptor-a (LXR\u03b1) LBD (aa 207-447), retinoid X receptor (RXR) LBD (aa 223-462), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-a (PPAR\u03b1) LBD (aa 201-467), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-g(PPAR\u03b3) LBD (aa 209-476) were amplified by PCR and subcloned to pZeoSV GAL containing the GAL4 DNA binding domain. The reporter plasmid, p8xGAL-Luc, was constructed by cloning synthetic oligonucleotides to generate 8 tandem repeat GAL4 binding sites (5\u2032-CTCGGAGGACAGTACTCCG-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO: 3))upstream of the luciferase in pGV-B2 (Toyo Ink) plasmid. 4 copies of NL3 (5\u2032-GATCGAAAACAAAAGGTCACTTAC-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO: 4); bold indicates a consensus NBRE motif)were inserted into upstream of the minimal promoter of TATA-Luciferase, resulting in p4x(NL3)-Luc. Mouse SRC-1 and human SRC-3 cDNAs were amplified by PCR using pYX-mSRC1 (Open Biosystem, MMM1013-9498102) and pCR-TOPO hSRC3 (Open Biosystem, MHS4426-99625636) as a template, respectively. Amplified cDNAs were subcloned into pCMV 2B (Stratagene) and resulted in the expression of an NH2-terminal flag-tagged fusion protein. The VP16\/SRC1 and VP16\/SRC3 hybrid were constructed by inserting the transactivation domain of the VP16 protein upstream of SRC1 and SRC3, respectively.

The recombinant proteins were purified by Ni-NTA column chromatography (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The integrity of all sequences was verified by DNA sequence analyses.","Transfection and Compound Screening.","Human neuroblastoma SK-N-BE(2)C cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. All culture media contained 100 units\/ml penicillin and 100 \u03bcg\/ml streptomycin. For transfection, cells were plated at 1.5\u00d710cells\/well in the DMEM media without antibiotic into 24-well plates 1 day prior to transfection. Transfections were carried out by the Lipofectamine plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacture's protocol. Total DNA amount was 0.5 \u03bcg per well with 0.1 \u03bcg of pRSV-\u03b2-gal as an internal control. 6 hours after transfection, compounds in the DMEM media with 1% charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum was added and incubated overnight. Cells from each well were lysed with 100 \u03bcl of lysis buffer, which contains 25 mM Tris-phosphate (pH 7.8), 2 mM DTT, 2 mM CDTA (1,2-diaminocyclohexane-N,N,N\u2032,N\u2032-tetraacetic acid), 10% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100. Then equal volume of firefly luciferase substrate was added and the luciferase activity was measured using a Luminometer plate reader and normalized for beta-galactosidase activity.","Western Blotting.","Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and harvested in a solution containing 1% Triton X-100, 20 mM Tris (pH7.6), 150 mM sodium chloride, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonylfluride (PMSF). The cell suspension was sonicated and boiled in an equal volume of SDS-sample buffer. Samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-ECL, Amersham). After blocking, the membrane was incubated with primary antibodies diluted in PBS containing 0.1% BSA. The following primary antibodies were used: rabbitanti-Nurr1 (Santa Cruz; 1:3000), mouse anti-myc (Roche; 1:3000), mouse anti-flag (Roche 1:3000), rabbit anti-caspase3 (Cell Signalling; 1:1000), and mouse anti-actin (Sigma 1:5000). The membrane was incubated with 1:3000-dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody (Amersham). Detection was achieved using an enhanced-chemiluminescent substrate (Amersham).","Immunoprecipitation Analysis.","Cells were disrupted in lysis buffer containing 20 mM Tris (pH7.6), 100 mM sodium chloride, 0.5% NP-40, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM PMSF, 1\u00d7 protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). One \u03bcg of anti-flag previously absorbed for 4 hours with protein-Aagarose (Upstate) were added to media and cell lysates, and incubated for 16 hours at 4\u00b0 C. Pellets were collected by centrifugation for 5 minutes and washed 3 times with lysis buffer. The immunoprecipitated proteins were released from protein-A by boiling 5 minutes in SDS-sample buffer. Samples were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and subjected to western blotting assay using mouse anti-myc antibodies.","BIAcore Analysis.","Binding experiments were performed with the surface Plasmon Resonance-based biosensor instrument BIAcore 3000 (BIAcore AB, Uppsala). Immobilization of the purified proteins on the sensor surface was performed following the standard amine coupling procedure according to manufacturer's instructions. The final immobilization response of each protein was 6000 resonance units. A reference surface was generated simultaneously under the same conditions with BSA and used as a blank to correct for instrument and buffer artifacts. AQ and kanamycin were injected at variable concentrations at 20 \u03bcl\/min flow rate, and binding to the protein immobilized on the chip was monitored in real-time. Each sensorgram consists of an association phase (60-160 sec), reflecting binding of the injected AQ to the protein, followed by a dissociation phase (after 160 sec), during which the running buffer is passed over the chip and the bound AQ is being washed off the protein surface. Binding data were analyzed using the BIAcore 3000 CONTROL\u00ae software and the BIAEVALUATION\u00ae software.","Fluorescence Quenching Assay.","Fluorescence spectra were measured using a SHIMADZU fluorescence spectrophotometer (model RF-5310PC, SHIMADZU). The proteins (15 ng\/\u03bcl) were incubated with different concentrations of AQ or kanamycin (0.1 nM, 1 nM, 10 nM, 100 nM and 1 \u03bcM in PBS buffer, pH7.0). Protein quenching was monitored at 25\u00b0 C. by using 5 nm of excitation and 5 nm of emission slit-width. The excitation wavelength was 280 nm, and the emission spectra were measured between 290 and 430 nm.","Filter binding assay. Aliquots (100 \u03bcl) of an assay mixture containing 0.32 \u03bcM Nurr-LBD and 3.9-1000 nM [H]-CQ (Moravek Biochemicals, CA) in binding buffer (25 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.2)) were incubated at 4\u00b0 C. for overnight. Non-specific binding was determined in parallel in the presence of a 1000-fold molar excess of unlabeled CQ. GF\/C filters were wet with in binding buffer and placed on a 48-place filter manifold. 100 \u03bcl of assay mixture containing the [H]-CQ and Nurr1-LBD was applied on the surface of the filter. Filters were washed with 4\u00d7100 ml binding buffer, dried, and mixed with 5 ml Scintiverse BD (Fisher) and radioactivity was determined in a Beckman LS6000SC liquid scintillation counter. For competition assay, reactions containing 0.32 \u03bcM Nurr-LBD, 500 nM [H]-CQ and various concentrations of the competitor were incubated at 4\u00b0 C. for overnight. The mixture was applied to GF\/C filter and filter was washed and counted as described above.","Dopamine-Uptake Assay.","For measuring [H]Dopamine uptake following 6-OHDA treatment in the presence or absence of AQ, DA neurons were rinsed with Krebs Ringers solution, incubated in Krebs Ringers solution containing 1 mM ascorbate, 2 mM \u03b2-alanine, 100 \u03bcM pargyline at 37\u00b0 C. for 5 min in a humidified 5% COatmosphere, and further incubated with 25 nM [H]Dopamine (45 Ci\/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia) for 15 min. Control DA neurons were treated with the above medium in the presence of a dopamine uptake blocker, 10 \u03bcM mazindol (Sigma). Cells were then washed with ice-cold Krebs Ringers solution and lysed with 0.5 M NaOH. Radioactivity was quantified by a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman, Fullerton, Calif.).","Cell Culture and Drug Treatments.","PC12 cells were initially incubated at a density of 2\u00d710cells in poly-D-lysine-coated 24-well dishes and subsequently switched to serum-free N-2-defined medium containing 6-OHDA with or without AQ. Cell viabilities were determined by the conventional MTT reduction assay. After incubation for indicated times, cells were treated with the MTT solution (final concentration, 1 mg\/ml, Sigma) for 1 h. Formazan grains formed in intact cells were solubilized with MTT Solubilization. Solution containing 10% Triton X-100 plus 0.1 N HCl in anhydrous isopropanol for 24 h and then absorbance at 570 nm was measured with amicroplate reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, Calif.).","To prepare primary cultures of DA neurons, the ventral mesencephalon was removed from 14 day gestation Sprague Dawley rat embryo (Charles River, Cambridge, Mass.). Tissues were incubated with 0.01% trypsin in MEM (MEM, Invitrogen) for 10 min at 37\u00b0 C. and triturated using a constricted Pasteur pipette. DA neurons were plated at 1.0\u00d710cells per 9 mm diameter glass cover slip precoated with 100 \u03bcg\/ml poly-D-lysine (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) and 4 \u03bcg\/ml laminin (Invitrogen). DA neurons were maintained at 37\u00b0 C. in a humidified 5% COatmosphere in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% FBS (Hyclone), 2 mM glutamine and 6.0 g\/l glucose. At 5 or 6 days in vitro, DA neurons were washed with MEM and treated with various experimental reagents for the time periods indicated. Reagents used were 6-OHDA (Sigma), N-acetyl-cysteine, N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (Z-VAD-fmk; Enzyme Systems Products, Livermore, Calif.). BV-2 cells, a microglial-like mouse cell line, were thawed and passaged until logarithmic growth was achieved. Cell cultures were maintained in 6-well culture plate (Corning Costar, Corning, N.Y.) at a concentration of 1.0\u00d710cells per well, in the growth medium consisting of DMEM (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone) heat inactivated at 56\u00b0 C. for 30 min, 2 mM L-glutamine (Sigma) and 1\u00d7 Pen-Strep (Invitrogen). To begin the experiment, BV-2 cells were washed with DMEM and treated with LPS (Sigma) in the presence or absence of AQ (Sigma). The plates were at 37\u00b0 C. in an atmosphere of 5% CO\/95% air for the listed period of time. Cells from each single well were withdrawn for RNA extraction.","Neural precursor cells (NPCs) from dissection of rat embryos days 14 cortices (E14) were proliferated in N2 medium supplemented with 20 ng\/mL basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn., USA). Following 3-4 days of bFGF-expansion, NPCs were dissociated in Ca\/Mg-free Hank's balanced salt solution (CMF-HBSS, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) and re-plated onto coverslips (12 mm diameter; Carolina Biological Supply Company, Burlington, N.C.) at 32,000 cells\/coverslip pre-coated with poly-L-ornithine (PLO; 15 mg\/ml, Sigma, St Louis, Mo.) at 37\u00b0 C. overnight followed by fibronectin (FN; 1 mg\/ml, Sigma) overnight. Prior to drug treatment, NPCs were transduced with Nurr1-expressing retrovirus of MOI 5 in the presence of polybrene (1 \u03bcg\/ml, Sigma), cultured overnight in N2, and then differentiated. Getting started chemical treatment (every day for 2 hours), bFGF was not added anymore.","Immunocytochemistry and Immunohistochemistry.","Cells were fixed in 4% papraformaldehyde (PFA) for 20 min, washed and then incubated with blocking buffer [PBS, 10% goat serum (Invitrogen), 0.3% Triton X-100 (Sigma)] for 1 hour. Cells were then incubated overnight at 4\u00b0 C. with primary antibodies with the primary antibody in PBS containing 1% normal goat serum and 0.1% Triton X-100. A rabbit polyclonal anti-TH antibody (1:500; Pel-Freez, Rogers, Ark.) was used as a primary antibody. Following washes with PBS, appropriate fluorescence-tagged secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, Pa.) were used for visualization. Stained samples were mounted in VECTASHIELD with DAPI mounting solution (Vector Laboratories INC., Burlingame, Calif.) and photographed using epifluorescence microscope (Leica). The animals were euthanized by anesthesia with pentobarbital (3 ml\/kg), and then transcardially perfused with 4% PFA in a 0.05M phosphate buffer (PB). Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence assay were performed as previously described, on free-floating cryomicrotome-cut sections (40 \u03bcm thick) that encompassed the entire brain. After their incubation with 3% HOin 0.05M PBS, followed by 0.3% Triton X-100 and 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in 0.05M PBS, the sections were stained overnight at 4\u00b0 C. with a primary antibody. The ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, Calif., USA) was used as a secondary antibody. After the tissue was washed three times in 0.05M PBS, followed by 0.3% Triton X-100 and 1% BSA in 0.05M PBS, the sections were stained overnight at 4\u00b0 C. with primary antibodies. The following primary antibodies were used: mouse anti-Iba-1 (Abcam; 1:500), goat anti-FoxA2 (SCBT; 1:200), sheep anti-tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) (Pel-Freez; 1:200), rabbit anti-TH (Pel-Freez 1:200), goat anti-FoxA2 (Millipore; 1:200), and sheep anti-AADC (Millipore; 1:500). The tissues were washed three times in PBS and incubated for 2 h with the secondary fluorescence-conjugated goat anti-mouse and rabbit antibody (DAKO, Denmark, Cy3, FITC, both dilutions at 1:1,000) and tissues were washed and mounted in Vectorshield. All tissue samples were additionally counterstained with DAPI. Tissues were visualized using fluorescence microscopy. Every 6section of rat brains was assayed to count immunoreactive cells using the Image J (version 1.42q, National Institutes of Health, USA) and Stereo Investigator and software (Microbright Field, Williston, Vt.). The protection percentage of total TH cells in the lesioned hemisphere of each rat brain was calculated by dividing total TH cells in the intact hemisphere of each rat brain and multiplying 100.","Semi-quantitative and quantitative RT-PCR analyses. Total RNA was extracted by single step preparation using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions.

The rats were anesthetized with Ketamine[4.5 mg\/kg, intraperitoneal (i.p.)] mixed with Rumpun (1.5 mg\/kg, i.p.) and given a unilateral stereotaxic injection of 6-OHDA (20 \u03bcg\/5 \u03bcl with 0.2 mg\/ml L-ascorbic acid; Sigma, St. Louis, Mo., USA) or the same volume of the vehicle (L-ascorbic acid) into their right striatum using coordinates relative to the bregma and dura (A\/P, 0.7; L\/M, \u22122.6; D\/V, \u22124.5) according to the atlas of Paximos and Watsonat the rate of 1 \u03bcl\/min using a 26-gauge Hamilton microsyringe. Following infusion, the cannula was kept in place for 5 min to minimize backflow before being slowly retracted. The use of animals was in accordance with McLean's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and followed National Institutes of Health guide lines. In our preliminary experiments, we tested different doses (1, 5, and 20 mg\/kg) of both AQ and CQ and found that AQ at 20 mg\/kg exhibited most prominent effects. Thus, we used this condition for more systematic in vivo experiments.","Assay for the Neuroprotective Effects of AQ in the 6-OHDA-Lesioned Rat Model.","One day before modeling PD, rats were randomly assigned to two groups: saline group (n=6) and AQ-treatment group (n=8). AQ-treatment group received an i.p. injection of 20 mg\/kg of AQ twice one day before 6-OHDA injection. After 6-OHDA injection, animals were given either AQ or saline twice per day for 13 days (in total, 2 weeks of AQ injection including one day of AQ injection before the PD modeling). For the behavioral functional assay, rotation behavior was measured for 90 min following intraperitoneal injection of 5 mg\/kg amphetamine (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.), using automatized rotameter system (Med Associate Inc., St. Albans, Vt., USA)\u2032. Ipsilateral rotations were measured at 4 and 6 weeks post 6-OHDA letioning.","Abnormal Involuntary Movements (AIMs) Behavior in 6-OHDA-Lesioned Rats.","To test dyskinesia-like involuntary behaviors, AIMs test was performed at the two time points, immediately after two weeks of drug injection (2 weeks post 6-OHDA lesion; n=6), and one month after two weeks of drug injection (6 weeks post 6-OHDA lesion; n=6) Saline- and L-DOPA (8 mg\/kg for two weeks; n=6) treatment was used as negative and positive control of AIMs behavior, respectively. The following behavioral tests were all videotaped and scored at a later date by two investigators blind to the animals' treatment. Rats were monitored for four types of AIMs; Axial (dystonic posturing of neck and torso twisted toward the side of the body contralateral to the lesion), Forelimb (contralateral forelimb movements that are \u201crapid\u201d and \u201cpurposeless\u201d), Orolingual (repetitive jaw openings and tongue protrusions), and Locomoter (walking in a contralateral circular motion) AIMs. Rats were observed for 2 minutes at every 20 minute mark within a 2 hour period. During the 1minute, each AIMs behavior was monitored and scored with 0-4 scale (0: no abnormal behavior at all; 1: present for less than 50% of observation time; 2: present for over 50% of observation time; 3: present for the entire observation period but interrupted by external stimulus; 4: present for the entire observation period and not interrupted by external stimulus). The AIMs scores for the 2 hour period in each category were summed (maximum score is 24).","Behavioral Studies in ak\/ak Mice.","Either 20 mg\/kg of AQ (AQ group) or the saline (Saline group) was intraperitoneally injected (I.P.) twice per day for two weeks. 8 mg\/kg of L-DOPA (L-DOPA group) in 0.5% DMSO was injected (I.P.) once per day for two weeks. The L-DOPA group was given 12.5 mg\/kg benserazide 20 min prior to administration of L-DOPA.","Behavioral Experimental Groups and Behavioral Testing Design:","Each ak mouse was randomly assigned into one of three experiment groups, (1) saline group (negative control; n=8), (2) L-DOPA group (positive control; n=8), (3) AQ group (n=10). Each WT or rdl mouse was randomly divided into two groups, (1) saline group (n=8) and (2) AQ group (n=10). Pole Test, Challenging Beam Traversal Test, and Cylinder Test were performed at two time points, immediately and one month after two weeks of either AQ or saline injection. Each mouse ran each task twice. Rota rod test was performed immediately after two weeks of either drug or saline injection. Acclimation and data recording process were identical to the rat study described above. All tasks were performed as described previouslyand the short description of each task is as follows.","Pole Test:","A vertical wooden pole 50 cm in length and 1 cm in diameter was used for Pole Test. Each mouse was gently placed head upwards on top of the pole which is placed on each animal's home cage. Each mouse ran tree trials per session during 2 training sessions. On the testing day, mice ran three trials. Two parameters (the meantime to orient downward and the total travel mean time) were used for the statistical analysis.","Challenging Beam Traversal Test:","A 1 m length of plastic beam was used for Challenging Beam Traversal Test. The starting width of the beam was 3.5 cm and it gradually narrowed in 1 c increments to 0.5 cm at the other end site of the beam Animals were trained to walk from the wide end to the other end for 2 sessions, three trials per session before testing. A mesh grid was removed during the training period. On the testing day, a mesh grid (1 cm square) covering the beam surface was equipped leaving a \u22121 cm room between the grid and the beam surface. On the testing day, mice ran three trials. Two parameters (the mean number of steps taken by each animal and the mean time to traverse across three trials) were collected and used for statistical analysis.","Cylinder Test:","A small transparent cylinder (height, 15.5 cm; diameter, 12.7 cm) was used to evaluate somatosensory motor function. Mice were placed in the cylinder and their rears were counted for 5 minutes. The forelimb touching the Plexiglas wall (a vertical movement) is defined as a full rear. The mean number of forelimb use was calculated for the statistical analysis. Each mouse ran Cylinder task for one session and no training sessions were necessary.","Rota Rod Test:","The Rota rod equipment (Med-Associates, Inc, Albans, Vt., USA) was used to measure motor coordination. The Rota rod is accelerated from 4 to 40 revolutions per minute (RMs) over 4 min. The mean latency to fall off from the Rota rod was measured for the statistical analysis. Each mouse runs 3 consecutive trials daily with 10 min interval between trials for 3 consecutive sessions.","Statistical Methods","Statistical analyses were conducted using the statistical Analysis System (Version 9.1; SAS institute, Cary, N.C.). Performance measures of in vitro outcomes, cell counting, and behavioral outcomes were analyzed using the PROC TTEST, ANOVA, MIXED or GLIMMIX program, a generalized linear mixed models procedure for conducting repeated measures analyses followed by LSD (Fisher's least significant difference) post-hoc tests (LSD is a default post-hoc test provided in SAS). Means were calculated for each animal for each testing condition, defined by the following variables (where appropriate): Treatment (AQ, L-Dopa, or saline) and Time (2, 4, or 6 weeks after 6-OHDA lesion).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0442","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0024","list-style":"none"},"li":["1.

Here we show successful identification of Nurr1 agonists that share an identical chemical scaffold and stimulate the transcriptional activity through binding to the ligand-binding domain. Remarkably, they also enhanced the contrasting dual functions of Nurr1 and improved behavioral deficits in animal models of PD.","PD, primarily caused by selective degeneration of midbrain dopamine (mDA) neurons, is the most prevalent movement disorder, affecting 1-2% of the global population over the age of 65. Currently available pharmacological treatments (e.g., L-DOPA) are largely symptomatic and lose their efficacy over time, with accompanying severe side effects such as dyskinesia. Thus, there is an unmet clinical need to develop mechanism-based and\/or disease-modifying treatments. The orphan nuclear receptor Nurr1 (also known as NR4A2) is essential not only for development and maintenance of mDA neuronsbut also for their protection from inflammation-induced death. Furthermore, previous studies showed decreased Nurr1 expression in postmortem brains of PD patientsand functional mutant forms in rare familial PD cases, strongly suggesting that Nurr1 is a promising target for the development of novel disease-modifying therapeutics for PD. To address this possibility, we established efficient high-throughput assay systems based on Nurr1's ability to directly activate TH promoter function. Using these cell-based assay systems, we screened a library composed of 960 FDA-approved drugs and successfully identified three hit compounds, i.e., two antimalarial drugs amodiaquine (AQ) and chloroquine (CQ) and the pain drug glafenine. Surprisingly, all three compounds share an identical chemical scaffold, 4-amino-7-chloroquinoline, suggesting a structure-activity relationship (SAR) ().","In inventors' previously reported assays using the reporter construct p4xNL3-Luc, containing four copies of the NBRE-like NL3 motif residing in the TH promoter, AQ and CQ activated luciferase reporter activity up to approximately 3-fold in a dose-dependent manner (). In the present study the inventors focused on AQ and CQ since glafenine showed a weaker activity (approximately 1.6-fold). To investigate whether AQ and CQ activate Nurr1 function through its ligand binding domain (LBD) or DNA binding domain (DBD), the inventors next generated additional reporter constructs in which the yeast transcription factor GAL4's DBD is fused to either Nurr1 LBD or DBD (pSVGAL-Nand pSVGAL-N). Notably, AQ and CQ stimulated Nurr1's transcriptional activity through its LBD (), while no response was observed when GAL4 or GAL4-Nurr1 DBD was used. AQ and CQ induced Nurr1 LBD-based reporter activity up-to 15- and 10-fold with an ECof approximately 20 and 50 \u03bcM, respectively ().","To test if AQ and CQ act through Nurr1, the inventors treated cells with Nurr1-specific siRNA. Nurr1 siRNA, but not scrambled RNAs, reduced luciferase activation by >60%, suggesting that transcriptional activation by AQ and CQ is indeed through modulation of Nurr1 function (). The inventors next tested if various quinoline compounds have similar Nurr1-activating function. Remarkably, none of these compounds showed any detectable transactivation function in a wide range of concentrations (). Since only AQ and CQ contain the 4-amino-7-chloroquinoline entity, these results further support its SAR. In addition, AQ and CQ were unable to induce the transcriptional activity of other nuclear receptors (NRs), showing high selectivity ().","A crucial mechanism of NRs is the recruitment of transcriptional coregulators as seen with steroid receptor coactivators (SRCs). To test if AQ and CQ modulate Nurr1's interaction with SRC, a co-immunoprecipitation assay was performed. We found that Nurr1's weak interactions with SRC-1 and SRC-3 were significantly enhanced by AQ and CQ (). We next tested the effects of AQ and CQ on Nurr1 transcriptional function following SRC-1 or SRC-3 overexpression. While SRC-1\/SRC-3 overexpression itself did not greatly influence Nurr1 function, AQ and CQ further enhanced Nurr1's transcriptional function in the presence of SRC-1\/SRC-3 overexpression (), suggesting that AQ and CQ induce Nurr1's trans activation function through its Nurr1 LBD by facilitating the recruitment of coactivators like SRC-1\/SRC-3.","To investigate whether AQ and CQ physically interact with Nurr1's LBD, the inventors purified the Nurr1 LBD polypeptide (amino acid 328-598) and analyzed their physical binding using the Biacore S51 SPR sensor, which has a higher sensitivity and improved fluidics, enabling the monitoring of small signal changes derived from binding of compounds to proteins.","As shown in , AQ specifically bound to Nurr1-LBD in a dose-dependent manner but not to the LBDs of other NRs such as Nur77 or RXR. Next, we performed fluorescence quenching analysis. The Nurr1-LBD displayed maximal fluorescence at 336 nm whereas AQ itself had no fluorescence at this wavelength. When the Nurr1-LBD was incubated with increasing amounts of AQ, fluorescence intensity gradually decreased (). In contrast, Nur77-LBD and RXR-LBD's fluorescence emission was not quenched by AQ over a wide range of concentrations (). In addition, the inventors performed a radioligand binding assay using [H]-CQ. The [H]-CQ showed saturable binding to Nurr1-LBD with a dissociation constant (K) of 0.27 \u03bcM and a maximal binding capacity (B) of 13.9 \u03bcM (). Furthermore, competition-binding assay showed that unlabeled AQ\/CQ can compete for binding with [H]-CQ with K, values of 246 and 88 nM for AQ and CQ, respectively (). As expected, unlabeled primaquine which couldn't enhance the Nurr1 transcriptional function () was unable to compete. Together, these data strongly suggest that AQ\/CQ activate Nurr1 function via direct and specific binding to Nurr1's LBD.","We next sought to test whether these compounds exhibit biological effects on mDA neurons in more physiological contexts. First, we tested if they can increase the generation of TH neurons and\/or expression of mDA-specific genes during in vitro differentiation of neural stem cells. We found that AQ enhanced Nurr1's function both in terms of the number of TH neurons generated from neural stem cells and mRNA expression levels of the TH, dopamine transporter (DAT), vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT), and aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) genes (). In vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay clearly showed that Nurr1 was recruited to both NL1 and NL3 sites of the TH promoter in AQ- and CQ-treated cells, suggesting that Nurr1 is directly involved in AQ- and CQ-mediated induction of TH expression (). Second, we found that AQ and CQ significantly inhibit neurotoxin (6-OHDA)-induced death in primary DA neurons, as examined by the number of TH neurons () and DA uptake (). The neuroprotective effect of AQ and CQ was also observed in rat PC12 cells (). Since Nurr1 has opposite transrepression activity in microglia and astrocytes, the inventors also analyzed the effect of AQ on expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes in primary microglia derived from P1 rat brains. When these cells were treated with the inflammation-inducing lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 10 ng\/ml) for 8 hrs, expression of all cytokine genes tested (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 and iNOS) was dramatically induced (). Remarkably, AQ treatment prominently reduced the expression of all these genes in a dose dependent manner (>10-fold). AQ and CQ showed very similar effects for repressing these cytokine genes in both primary microglia and BV-2 microglial cell line (). Taken together, our data show that AQ and CQ are able to enhance the contrasting dual roles of Nurr1: (1) they increase Nurr1's transactivation of mDA-specific genes in mDA neurons and (2) they also further enhance Nurr1's transrepression of pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression in microglia.","The above findings prompted the inventors to test whether these compounds can ameliorate motor behavior deficits by neuroprotective mechanism(s) in PD animal models. Toward this goal, we tested the effects of AQ administration in an animal model of PD, 6-OHDA lesioned rats. Rats with unilateral intrastriatal 6-OHDA lesion were administered with saline or AQ for two weeks, starting from 1 day prior to intrastriatal 6-OHDA lesion (). As expected, amphetamine administration produced rotation behavior toward the lesion side in control rats, when measured at 4 and 6 weeks post 6-OHDA lesion, indicating unilateral damage to the right striatum (). Remarkably, AQ administration significantly ameliorated 6-OHDA-induced rotation behavior at 4 and 6 weeks post 6-OHDA lesion (p<0.06 and p<0.0003, respectively). Immunohistochemistry of the substantia nigra (SN) and the striatum (STR) of these animals showed that AQ-treated rats retained a significant number of TH cells in the lesion side SN while saline-treated control rats lost the great majority of TH cells (). Similarly, abundant TH fibers were spared in the STR of AQ-treated brains while they were mostly lost in the STR of control brains To quantitatively analyze these data, TH cells in the SN were stereologically counted in a blind manner. As shown in , the number of TH neurons in the lesion side of AQ-treated rats was approximately 60% of those from the intact side at 6 weeks post 6-OHDA lesion (p<0.0003), whereas it remained less than 20% in saline-treated animals. Importantly, these spared TH cells co-expressed other DA markers such as FoxA2 and AADC (). The inventors also examined microglial activation by immunohistochemistry of the microglial marker Iba-1. As shown in , microglial activation was prominently observed in the ipsilateral SN and STR regions of 6-OHDA lesioned rats. In contrast, following AQ treatment, the numbers of Iba-1 microglia in the ipsilateral SN and STR regions decreased to the levels of the contralateral sides, indicating a robust suppression of neuroinflammation by Nurr1 activation. Without wishing to be bound by a theory, it is believed that Nurr1-based neuroprotective mechanism, unlike the L-dopa treatment, may not trigger dyskinesia-like side effects. To address this, the inventors tested if AQ treatment triggers abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs), well validated dyskinesia-like behaviors. Toward this end, the inventors measured AIM scores such as axial, limb, locomotive, and orolingual dyskinesias. In L-DOPA-treated rats (8 mg\/kg for two weeks prior to scoring; ). The animals showed dramatically increased AIMs scores (F=33, p<0.0001), classified as the axial, limb, locomotive, and orolingual dyskinesias (). In contrast, both saline- and AQ-treated 6-OHDA rats did not show any detectable AIMs behavior.","The inventors next tested if AQ treatment can also improve motor dysfunction in the aphakia mouse (ak\/ak), that was shown to be a valid mouse model of PD. Since the great majority of A9 dopamine neurons (>80%) are selectively degenerated in the SN of the ak\/ak mouse starting from birth, it can be considered to be a severe PD situation. Following 2 weeks of AQ treatment, the inventors performed a battery of behavioral tests sensitive to nigrostriatal impairment. Remarkably, the inventors discovered that ak\/ak mice's motor deficits were significantly improved in all these tests (i.e., Pole, Challenging Beam, Cylinder, and Rotarod tests) by AQ treatment (). Notably, there was no group difference between AQ- and L-DOPA treated animals indicating that AQ had similar effects as L-DOPA treatment on functional recovery in most tests, except the Cylinder test, in which L-DOPA treatment dramatically induced rearing activity, as previously reported. The number of TH neurons was not detectably altered in the AQ-treated ak\/ak mice (data not shown). In contrast, the inventors observed robust microglial activation as examined by activated microglial marker CD11b in the SN, which was reduced to the level of wild type mice (). Thus, albeit no increased TH neurons in the SN, suppression of activated microglia appears to improve motor deficits in ak\/ak mice.","In summary, using the novel high throughput cell-based assay described herein, the inventors identified two small molecules, AQ and CQ, which can activate Nurr1 through direct interaction with its LBD. Furthermore, AQ administration significantly improved motor impairments in 6-OHDA lesioned rodent models of PD without dyskinesia-like side effects. The data presented herein shows that these compounds enhanced the contrasting dual functions of Nurr1-activation of mDA neuron-specific function (e.g., TH expression) and repression of microglial activation and neurotoxic cytokine gene expression\u2014leading to a significant neuroprotective effect in a rodent model of PD. These findings are surprising because Nurr1 lacks a \u2018classical\u2019 binding pocket due to the presence of bulky hydrophobic side chain residues, and is thought to be a ligand-independent and constitutively active NR. However, certain ligands are able to \u201cworm\u201d their way into the interior of proteins and to squeeze into buried LBD by inducing or exploiting transient conformational changes, thus creating a cavity, suggesting the possibility that Nurr1 may become an \u201cadopted\u201d NR. Notably, based on selective binding to neuromelanin of an MPTP metabolite, a previous study demonstrated that administration of CQ to monkeys protected them from MPTP-induced parkinsonian motor abnormalities. Our findings are in line with this study showing CQ's neuroprotective effect in a rodent or monkey model, and further suggest the involvement of additional and\/or alternate mechanisms related to Nurr1 activation. Taken together, our results provide a preclinical \u201cproof-of-concept\u201d that Nurr1 could serve as a valid target for further development of mechanism-based, disease-modifying therapeutics of PD.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0454","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0025","list-style":"none"},"li":["1.
