{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","BRIEF SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Distributed computer systems have the capability of sharing resources. \u201cClustering\u201d generally refers to a computer system organization where multiple computing platforms, or nodes, are networked together to cooperatively perform computer tasks.","Generally, software is utilized in a computer system pursuant to a license. Such licenses generally impose restrictions on its use, such as limiting the number of computers that may run the software or limiting the number of users that may utilize the software. For example, in some cases, a unique encrypted key either accompanies the software product or is distributed separately as a part of a purchase of the software product. The software may prompt for and match various criteria against encoded information in the key. In a clustered network environment, the licensed software product oftentimes must be managed across the various nodes of the cluster, which may be time-consuming and\/or require special administrative operations.","According to one aspect of the present disclosure a method and technique for product license management in a clustered environment having a plurality of nodes is disclosed. The method includes unlocking a product on a first node of the plurality of clustered nodes; responsive to unlocking the product on the first node, indicating an unlocked status of the product on a shared storage device accessible to the plurality of clustered nodes; and transmitting a self-unlock message from the first node to remaining nodes of the cluster to enable the remaining nodes of the cluster to self-unlock the product on the respective remaining nodes based on the status indication of the shared storage device.","Embodiments of the present disclosure provide a method, system and computer program product for product license management in a clustered environment having a plurality of nodes. For example, in some embodiments, the method and technique includes unlocking a product on a first node of the plurality of clustered nodes, responsive to unlocking the product on the first node, indicating an unlocked status of the product on a shared storage device accessible to the plurality of clustered nodes; and transmitting a self-unlock message from the first node to remaining nodes of the cluster to enable the remaining nodes of the cluster to self-unlock the product on the respective remaining nodes based on the status indication of the shared storage device. The method and technique enables product unlocking pursuant to a licensing scheme to be issued from one node of the clustered network such that product unlocking permeates to the remaining nodes on the cluster without external assistance from a user or administrator.","As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, aspects of the present disclosure may be embodied as a system, method or computer program product.

Unlock logic , key logic  and cluster device manager  may comprise software, logic and\/or executable code for performing various functions as described herein (e.g., residing as software and\/or an algorithm running on a processor unit, hardware logic residing in a processor or other type of logic chip, centralized in a single integrated circuit or distributed among different chips in a data processing system). For example, in some embodiments, unlock logic  may comprise an application programming interface (API) for unlocking product  and\/or checking the unlocked status of product , and key logic  may comprise an object file that provides an API for creating and\/or generating a unique key and encrypting the key. Key logic may be provided on respective nodes ,  and  based on the acquisition and\/or compliance with various license terms (e.g., loaded onto a respective node in response to the purchase or acquisition of a license). Thus, in some embodiments, key logic is linked to a particular instance of product , respectively, such that, responsive to a request to unlock a respective product , key logic generates a unique encrypted key and passes the key to respective unlock logic .
