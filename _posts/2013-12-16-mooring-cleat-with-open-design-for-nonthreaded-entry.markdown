title: Mooring cleat with open design for non-threaded entry
abstract: A mooring cleat with open design for restraining a line and for attaching a free end of the line, the mooring cleat having an overlapping horn design with an angled slot that allows a line/rope into the device at any desired position along the line, wherein the cleat restrains the line against static pull in nearly any three-dimensional direction.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The following description was made in the performance of official duties by employees of the Department of the Navy, and, thus the claimed invention may be manufactured, used, licensed by or for the United States Government for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon.","The following description relates generally to a mooring cleat with open design for restraining a line and for attaching a free end of the line, the mooring cleat having an overlapping horn design with an angled slot that allows a line\/rope into the device at any desired position along the line, wherein the cleat restrains the line against static pull in nearly any three-dimensional direction.","Mooring fittings can be fabricated from many different materials and may take many different forms. These fittings guide and secure lines\/ropes for vessels during different types of operations, such as mooring, anchoring, towing, rafting, and servicing etc.  is a prior art illustration of known mooring chock devices , , and . Chock devices are typically used as feed-through devices for lines which are then fed to another device for fixed attachment. Chock  for example, includes a closed loop hole through which a line is threaded. Depending on the length of the line, this process can be time consuming. Chocks  and  each includes an opening that allows any part of the line to be placed within the restraint area, so that the entire line does not have to be threaded through the device, thereby saving time. However, with designs similar to chock , the line may escape the device when there is vertical movement via the opening . The chock  embodiment, which includes a slanted opening  (shown clearly in the top view section of ) is successful at preventing the line from escaping in the vertical direction.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0005","num":"0004"},"figref":"FIG. 1B","b":["20","22","24","26","20","22","24","26"]},"While chock fittings are available and can be used for restraining in the vertical direction, there is a need for a device that accomplishes both the attachment of the free\/bitter end and restraint of the line without the need to feed the line through. The installation of multiple fittings increases the complexity and cost associated with deck fittings. Installing both cleats and chocks precludes installation of a single fitting in an optimum location, such as on centerlines or amidships.","In one aspect, the invention is a mooring cleat with open design for restraining a line\/rope and for attaching a free end of the line\/rope. The mooring cleat has an elongated base plate, and a first horn extending vertically from the elongated base plate. The first horn has a first substantially cylindrical bottom portion extending vertically from the elongated base, and a first elongated top portion attached to the first substantially cylindrical bottom portion. The first elongated top portion has a front end and a rear end, and the first elongated top portion extends parallel to a longitudinal axis X. The mooring cleat also includes a second horn extending vertically from the elongated base plate, the second horn having a second substantially cylindrical bottom portion extending vertically from the elongated base. The second elongated top portion is attached to the second substantially cylindrical bottom portion, the second elongated top portion having a front end and a rear end. The second elongated top portion extends parallel to the longitudinal axis X, wherein the first elongated top portion and the second elongated top portion extend towards each other so that respective front ends of the first elongated top portion and the second elongated top portion overlap in a non-contacting manner, having an angled slot therebetween.","In another aspect, the invention is a boat having a hull body with a gunwale. In this aspect, the boat also includes a mooring cleat with open design for restraining a line and for attaching a free end of the line. The mooring cleat is attached at the gunwale. The mooring cleat has an elongated base plate, and a first horn extending vertically from the elongated base plate. The first horn has a first substantially cylindrical bottom portion extending vertically from the elongated base, and a first elongated top portion attached to the first substantially cylindrical bottom portion. The first elongated top portion has a front end and a rear end, and the first elongated top portion extends parallel to a longitudinal axis X. The mooring cleat also includes a second horn extending vertically from the elongated base plate, the second horn having a second substantially cylindrical bottom portion extending vertically from the elongated base. The second elongated top portion is attached to the second substantially cylindrical bottom portion, the second elongated top portion having a front end and a rear end.

As seen from the side view, the combination of the substantially concave shape of the first and second substantially cylindrical bottom portions (, ), the elongated base plate , and the overlapping first and second elongated top portions (, ), produces the opening , which from the side view is a closed loop opening. Essentially, the closed loop side view is the view seen by a line  threaded into the opening .

Thus, the overlapping horn design allows a line in the orientation of line , passing thorough the cleat  to be restrained against a static pull in nearly any three-dimensional direction.
