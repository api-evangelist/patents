title: Interface between web applications for text messaging and packet-switched networks
abstract: Systems and methods are disclosed for interfacing SMS/MMS web applications with packet-switched networks. One embodiment comprises a system that handles a Mobile Terminated (MT) text message from a web application to a packet-switched network. The system receives a send command for the MT text message from the web application. The send command is based on a standard used by the web application, such as Parlay X. The system converts the send command for the MT text message to a SIP send request, and transmits the SIP send request for the MT text message to a packet-switched network for delivery to a recipient.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS","EXAMPLES"],"p":["The invention is related to the field of communications and, in particular, to interfacing text messaging web applications with packet-switched networks that use Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).","Text messaging has become a popular mode of communication in many mobile (or wireless) networks. One example of text messaging is Short Message Service (SMS), which is a set of communication protocols allowing the exchange of short text messages (i.e., 160 characters or less) between devices. While the term \u201ctext message\u201d traditionally referred to text-only messages sent using SMS, it has been extended to include multimedia messages, such as images, video, sound content, etc. The multimedia messages may be sent using Multimedia Message Service (MMS) protocol. Often times, mobile users more frequently use text messaging for communication than voice calls.","Although text messaging is traditionally thought of as two mobile devices exchanging text messages, there may be web-based applications that allow an end user to send or receive text messages. For example, an end user may access a web site that provides a page for sending\/receiving text messages. Through the web page, the end user may enter a message intended for a recipient and a telephone number for the recipient. The web-based application then generates a send request for the text message using an Application Programming Interface (API) defined for web-based services.","Organizations have defined standard APIs for web-based applications to use when sending\/receiving text messages. One standard is Parlay X SMS Web Service for SMPP. Parlay X SMS Web Service for SMPP provides operations for sending an SMS message to a network, monitoring the delivery status of a sent SMS message, and asynchronously receiving notification of message delivery status. Parlay X SMS Web Service for SMPP interacts with a native SMPP network to send\/receive SMS messages.","Another standard is Parlay X SMS Web Service for Parlay. Parlay X SMS Web Service for Parlay provides operations for sending an SMS message to the network, monitoring the delivery status of a sent SMS message, and asynchronously receiving notification of message delivery status. Parlay X SMS Web Service for Parlay interacts with a Parlay gateway using a Parlay Connector to send\/receive SMS messages to\/from a network.","Unfortunately, the standard APIs presently defined for web services do not provide enough flexibility for today's evolving networks.","Embodiments described herein provide a system, such as an API, that interfaces SMS\/MMS web applications with packet-switched networks. The system is able to translate messages from a web application to Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) that is used within the packet-switched network for SMS\/MMS messaging. Also, the system is able to translate SIP messages from the packet-switched network to the standard used by the web application, such as from SIP to Parlay X. By converting between the standard used by a web application and SIP, text messages may be exchanged directly between the web application and the packet-switched network. This advantageously improves how web-based text messaging may be implemented in evolving networks, such as IMS networks or LTE networks.","One embodiment comprises a system that handles a Mobile Terminated (MT) text message from a web application to a packet-switched network. The system includes an interface operable to receive a send command for the MT text message from the web application. The send command is based on a standard used by the web application, such as Parlay X. The system further includes a controller operable to convert the send command for the MT text message to a SIP send request. The interface is further operable to transmit the SIP send request for the MT text message to a packet-switched network for delivery to a recipient.","In another embodiment, the system is able to handle a Mobile Originated (MO) text message from the packet-switched network to the web application. The interface is operable to receive a SIP send request for the MO text message from the packet-switched network. The controller is further operable to convert the SIP send request for the MO text message to a receive command based on the standard used by the web application. The interface is further operable to transmit the receive command for the MO text message to the web application.","Other exemplary embodiments may be described below.","The figures and the following description illustrate specific exemplary embodiments of the invention. It will thus be appreciated that those skilled in the art will be able to devise various arrangements that, although not explicitly described or shown herein, embody the principles of the invention and are included within the scope of the invention. Furthermore, any examples described herein are intended to aid in understanding the principles of the invention, and are to be construed as being without limitation to such specifically recited examples and conditions. As a result, the invention is not limited to the specific embodiments or examples described below, but by the claims and their equivalents.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","110","130","120","110","130","130","130","140","130","140"]},"Web application  is able to exchange text messages with UE  with the assistance of conversion system . Conversion system  acts to translate function calls, operations, or commands used by web application  to requests\/responses used in packet-switched network , and vice-versa. Conversion system  may be thought of as an Application Programming Interface (API), as it converts standardized commands from web application  to a signaling protocol used in packet-switched network . In this embodiment, the signaling protocol used in packet-switched network  is Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). The standard used by web application  may vary, but one example of the standard may be Parlay X.","Conversion system  includes an interface  and a controller . Interface  comprises any device or component that communicates with web application  and\/or other web applications not shown. Interface  is also able to communicate with packet-switched network  through a signaling protocol used within packet-switched network  (i.e., SIP). Controller  comprises any device or component that translates messages between a standard used by web application  and the signaling protocol used in packet-switched network .","Assume that a user of web application  creates a text message intended for UE . This is referred to as a Mobile Terminated (MT) or Application Originated (AO) text message. When this occurs, web application  generates a function call, operation, or command for sending the MT text message based on the standard it is using. For example, if web application  uses Parlay X, then web application  may use a \u201cSendSms\u201d command that encapsulates the MT text message as a command for sending the MT text message. The command for sending the MT text message is referred to herein generally as a send command. Web application  then transmits the send command to conversion system .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","110","140","200","120"]},"In step , interface  receives the send command for the MT text message from web application . In step , controller  converts the send command in the standard used by web application  to a SIP send request. The SIP send request is used for sending the MT text message in packet-switched network . One example of the SIP send request is a SIP MESSAGE that encapsulates the MT text message, and is used for transporting a text message within packet-switched network . In order to perform the conversion, controller  may store a table that maps the standardized commands from the standard used by web application  to SIP Methods. The table may also map fields from the standardized commands (e.g., source address, terminating address, message type, etc) to fields in a SIP message. Controller  may use this table to convert the send request from web application  to the SIP send request.","In step , interface  transmits the SIP send request to packet-switched network  so that the MT text message may be delivered to its intended recipient, which is UE . It is presumed that packet-switched network  uses SIP to transport text messages. Thus, the appropriate node in packet-switched network  may attempt delivery of the MT text message to UE  without conversion to another protocol.","A similar process as above is used for delivering a text message from UE  to web application . Assume that an end user of UE  creates a text message intended for web application . This is referred to as a Mobile Originated (MO) or Application Terminated (AT) text message. When this occurs, a text message application in UE  generates a SIP send request for sending the MO text message, such as a SIP MESSAGE. UE  then transmits the SIP send request to conversion system .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","140","110","302","122","140","304","124","110","110","110","110","110","306","122","110","110","110"]},"When MT and MO text messages are sent as described in the above embodiments, there may be additional communications exchanged to indicate whether the text messages are successfully delivered. These communications may be referred to as notifications, acknowledgements, status messages, etc. Conversion system  is able to translate these additional communications in a similar manner as described above.  illustrate conversion of communications that carry status information for text message delivery. There may be additional communications sent to exchange the status information between web application  and packet-switched network  than those described in . More detailed message diagrams are provided in .","When packet-switched network  receives a SIP send request for a MT text message (see step  of ), packet-switched network  attempts to deliver the MT text message to UE . If delivery of the MT text message is successful or fails, packet-switched network  generates a SIP status message that includes status information for the delivery of the MT text message. The SIP status message may comprise another SIP MESSAGE, a SIP NOTIFY, or a SIP response such as a SIP 7xx message.

Moreover, explicit use of the term \u201cprocessor\u201d or \u201ccontroller\u201d should not be construed to refer exclusively to hardware capable of executing software, and may implicitly include, without limitation, digital signal processor (DSP) hardware, a network processor, application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) or other circuitry, field programmable gate array (FPGA), read only memory (ROM) for storing software, random access memory (RAM), non volatile storage, logic, or some other physical hardware component or module.","Also, an element may be implemented as instructions executable by a processor or a computer to perform the functions of the element. Some examples of instructions are software, program code, and firmware. The instructions are operational when executed by the processor to direct the processor to perform the functions of the element. The instructions may be stored on storage devices that are readable by the processor. Some examples of the storage devices are digital or solid-state memories, magnetic storage media such as a magnetic disks and magnetic tapes, hard drives, or optically readable digital data storage media.","Although specific embodiments were described herein, the scope of the invention is not limited to those specific embodiments.
