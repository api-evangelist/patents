{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This invention was made with government support under Contract No. HR0011-09-3-0002, awarded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. The government has certain rights in the invention.","The present application contains some common subject matter with copending and commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/905,891, titled \u201cApparatus for Performing SERS\u201d, filed on Oct. 15, 2010, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties.","Detection and identification or at least classification of unknown substances has long been of great interest and has taken on even greater significance in recent years. Among advanced methodologies that hold a promise for precision detection and identification are various forms of spectroscopy, especially those that employ Raman scattering. Spectroscopy may be used to analyze, characterize and even identify a substance or material using one or both of an absorption spectrum and an emission spectrum that results when the material is illuminated by a form of electromagnetic radiation (for instance, visible light). The absorption and emission spectra produced by illuminating the material determine a spectral \u2018fingerprint\u2019 of the material. In general, the spectral fingerprint is characteristic of the particular material or its constituent elements facilitating identification of the material. Among the most powerful of optical emission spectroscopy techniques are those based on Raman scattering.","Raman scattering optical spectroscopy employs an emission spectrum or spectral components thereof produced by inelastic scattering of photons by an internal structure of the material being illuminated. These spectral components contained in a response signal (for instance, a Raman signal) may facilitate determination of the material characteristics of an analyte species including identification of the analyte.","The Raman signal level or strength may be significantly enhanced by using a Raman-active material (for instance, Raman-active surface), however. For instance, the Raman scattered light generated by a compound (or ion) adsorbed on or within a few nanometers of a structured metal surface can be 10-10times greater than the Raman scattered light generated by the same compound in solution or in the gas phase. This process of analyzing a compound is called surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (\u201cSERS\u201d). In recent years, SERS has emerged as a routine and powerful tool for investigating molecular structures and characterizing interfacial and thin-film systems, and even enables single-molecule detection.","For simplicity and illustrative purposes, the present disclosure is described by referring mainly to an example thereof. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present disclosure. It will be readily apparent however, that the present disclosure may be practiced without limitation to these specific details. In other instances, some methods and structures have not been described in detail so as not to unnecessarily obscure the present disclosure.","Throughout the present disclosure, the terms \u201ca\u201d and \u201can\u201d are intended to denote at least one of a particular element. As used herein, the term \u201cincludes\u201d means includes but not limited to, the term \u201cincluding\u201d means including but not limited to. The term \u201cbased on\u201d means based at least in part on. In addition, the term \u201clight\u201d refers to electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths in the visible and non-visible portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, including infrared and ultra-violet portions of the electromagnetic spectrum.","Disclosed herein are an apparatus and a method for fabricating the apparatus. The apparatus includes a plurality of nano-fingers having different physical characteristics with respect to each other. The different physical characteristics include, for instance, different heights or lengths, different diameters, different compositions, etc. The differences in physical characteristics generally enable the apparatus to be implemented in various applications, including, fluid moving in microfluidic channels, molecule detection, etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 1A","FIG. 1A","FIG. 1A"],"b":["100","100","100"]},"According to an example, the apparatus  is to be used in sensing applications, for instance, to detect a molecule in an analyte sample with a relatively high level of sensitivity. For instance, the apparatus  may be employed in surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), enhanced fluorescence, enhanced luminescence, etc., types of applications. In other examples, the apparatus  is to be used in various other types of applications, such as to move a relatively small amount of fluid.","The apparatus  is depicted as including a substrate  supporting a plurality of nano-fingers . The substrate  generally comprises any suitable material to support the nano-fingers , such as, glass, plastic, polymer, SiO, AlO, metal, etc. The nano-fingers  may be attached to the surface of the substrate  through any suitable attachment mechanism. For instance, the nano-fingers  may be grown directly on the substrate  surface through use of various suitable nano-structure growing techniques. As another example, the nano-fingers  may be integrally formed with the substrate . In this example, for instance, a portion of the material from which the substrate  is fabricated may be etched or otherwise processed to form the nano-fingers . In a further example, a separate layer of material may be adhered to the substrate  surface and the separate layer of material may be etched or otherwise processed to form the nano-fingers .","The nano-fingers  are formed of a relatively flexible material to enable the nano-fingers  to be laterally bendable, for instance, to enable free ends of the nano-fingers  to move toward each other, as discussed in greater detail herein below. Examples of suitable materials for the nano-fingers  include polymer materials, such as, polysiloxane, polyacrylate, polyimide, polyethylene, polypropelene, etc., or any combination thereof, metallic materials, such as, gold, silver, aluminum, etc., semiconductor materials, etc., and combinations thereof. In various examples, the nano-fingers  may be fabricated through a nanoimprinting or embossing process in which a template of relatively rigid pillars is employed in a multi-step imprinting process on a polymer matrix to form the nano-fingers . Various other processes, such as, etching, and various techniques used in the fabrication of micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) and nano-electromechanical systems (NEMS) may also be used to fabricate the nano-fingers .","A nano-finger  may be defined as an elongated, nanoscale structure having a length (or height) that exceeds by more than several times a nanoscale cross sectional dimension (for instance, width) taken in a plane perpendicular to the length (for instance, length>3\u00d7width). In general, the length is much greater than the width or cross sectional dimension to facilitate bending of the nano-finger  laterally onto one or more neighboring nano-fingers . In some examples, the length exceeds the cross sectional dimension (or width) by more than a factor of about 5 or 10. For example, the width may be about 100 nanometers (nm) and the height may be about 500 nm. In another example, the width at the base of the nano-finger  may range between about 10 nm and about 1 micron (\u03bcm) and the length may range between about 50 nm and 2 \u03bcm. In other examples, the nano-finger  is sized based upon the types of materials used to form the nano-finger . Thus, for instance, the more rigid the material(s) used to form the nano-finger , the less the width of the nano-finger  may be to enable the nano-finger  to be laterally collapsible. In further examples, the nano-finger  may form ridges in which two of three dimensions (for instance length and height) exceed by more than several times a nanoscale cross sectional dimension (for instance, width). According to particular examples, the nano-fingers  may equivalently be referenced as nanopoles or nanopillars without departing from a scope of the apparatus .","As shown in , the nano-fingers  are arranged in an ordered array on the substrate . In this regard, the nano-fingers  may be distributed in a substantially uniform density on the substrate . Alternatively, however, at least some of the nano-fingers  may be randomly distributed on the substrate  to thereby vary the density of the nano-fingers  on the substrate . In any regard, and as discussed in greater detail herein below, the nano-fingers  are arranged with respect to each other such that the free ends of at least two neighboring nano-fingers  are able to touch each other when the nano-fingers  are in a collapsed state. By way of particular example, the neighboring nano-fingers  are positioned between about 10 to 500 nm apart from each other.","The nano-fingers  have been depicted as having substantially cylindrical cross-sections. It should, however, be understood that the nano-fingers  may have other shaped cross-sections, such as, for instance, oval, polygonal, rectangular, square, triangular, etc. In addition, or alternatively, the nano-fingers  may be formed with one or more features, such as, notches, bulges, etc., to substantially cause the nano-fingers  to be inclined to collapse in a particular direction. Thus, for instance, two or more adjacent nano-fingers  may include the one or more features to increase the likelihood that the nano-fingers  collapse toward each other. According to an example, the nano-fingers  are fabricated to be in the collapsed state under normal conditions and to be in an erect state when a stimuli is applied to the nano-fingers . According to another example, the nano-fingers  are fabricated to become collapsed when a stimuli is applied to the nano-fingers . Various manners in which the nano-fingers  may be moved between the collapsed and erect states are described in greater detail herein below.","According to an example, and as shown in , the tips of the nano-fingers  each include Raman-active material . The Raman-active material  may be formed of a collection of atoms or atom clusters. In addition, the Raman-active material  may have a rough surface or a relatively smooth surface. Moreover, the Raman-active material  may have various other shapes than those depicted in . For instance, the Raman-active material  may have relatively straight edges, remain within outer perimeters of the nano-fingers , etc.","It should also be noted that examples of the apparatus  are not limited to atoms or atom clusters disposed over just the tips of the nano-fingers . In other examples, the atoms or atom clusters of may be disposed over part of or nearly the entire surface of the nano-fingers . In any regard, the atoms or atom clusters may be deposited onto at least the free ends of the nano-fingers  through, for instance, physical vapor deposition (PVD), chemical vapor deposition (CVD), sputtering, etc., of metallic material, or self-assembly of pre-synthesized nano-particles. By way of example, the angle at which the atoms or atom clusters are deposited onto the free second ends of the nano-fingers  may be controlled to thereby substantially control the deposition of the atoms or atom clusters.","In some examples, a surface of the nano-fingers  and\/or the Raman-active material  may be functionalized to facilitate adsorption of the analyte. For example, the tips or free ends of the nano-fingers  in a vicinity thereof (not illustrated) may be functionalized with a binding group to facilitate binding with a specific target analyte species. The functionalized surface (that is, either a surface of the nano-finger  itself and\/or the Raman-active material  may provide a surface to which a particular class of analytes is attracted and may bond or be preferentially adsorbed. The functionalized surface may selectively bond with protein, DNA or RNA, biological or inorganic species, for example.","The Raman-active material  may comprise a metal, such as, gold, silver, copper, platinum, aluminum, etc., or a combination of these metals in the form of alloys, or other suitable material that is able to support surface plasmons for field enhancement for Raman scattering. In addition, the Raman-active material  may be multilayer structures, for example, 10 to 100 nm silver layer with 1 to 50 nm gold over-coating, or vice versa. In addition, or alternatively, the Raman-active material  may be further coated with a thin dielectric layer, or functional coating, such as ALD-grown silicon oxide or aluminum oxide, titanium oxide, etc. By definition herein, a Raman-active material is a material that supports surface plasmons and facilitates Raman scattering from an analyte adsorbed on or near a surface layer of the material during Raman spectroscopy.","Turning now to , there is shown a cross-sectional view along a line A-A, shown in , of the apparatus , in accordance with an example. As shown therein, adjacent pairs of the nano-fingers  are depicted as being collapsed toward each other, such that, the tips of some of the nano-fingers , and more particularly, some of the Raman-active material  are in contact with each other. In addition, a first set  of nano-fingers  is depicted as having a different physical characteristic than a second set  of nano-fingers . More particularly, the nano-fingers  in the first set  are depicted as having a relatively shorter length than the nano-fingers  in the second set . According to a particular example, the difference in length is greater than or equal to about 50 nm.","Turning now to , there is shown a cross-sectional view along a line A-A, shown in , of the apparatus , in accordance with another example. As shown in , the apparatus  includes a third set  of nano-fingers  and a fourth set  of nano-fingers , in addition to the first and second sets  and . The nano-fingers  in the third set  are depicted as being relatively longer than the nano-fingers  in the first and second sets  and . In addition, the nano-fingers  in the fourth set  are depicted as being relatively longer than the nano-fingers  in the third set . According to a particular example, the differences in lengths between the nano-fingers  in each of the respective sets - are greater than or equal to about 50 nm.","As also shown in , the nano-fingers  in each of the sets - are arranged in a predefined pattern. The predefined pattern is depicted as a repeating pattern composed of the nano-fingers  arranged in order of increasing height from left to right. Thus, for instance, the repeating pattern may be implemented to extend outward from a substantially central location of the substrate  to form concentric circles of the repeating pattern. According to other examples, the nano-fingers  may be arranged in different configurations on the substrate  according to their respective lengths. Examples of suitable configurations of the nano-fingers  having the 2 dimensional length modulation may include, for instance, holographic gratings, Fresnel lens, plasmonic nanostructures useful for laser light-beam conditioning, antenna, optical interconnects, etc.","Although  depict the tips of two adjacent nano-fingers  having the same lengths being in contact with each other, it should be understood that the tips of a larger number of adjacent nano-fingers  may be in contact with each other, as may occur when a number of adjacent nano-fingers  collapse in multiple directions. In addition, it should be understood that the tips of adjacent nano-fingers  and\/or the Raman-active material  included on the tips of the adjacent nano-fingers  having different lengths may be in contact with each other without departing from a scope of the apparatus .","Turning now to , there is shown a cross-sectional view along a line A-A, shown in , of the apparatus , in accordance with a further example. As shown therein, adjacent pairs of the nano-fingers  are depicted as being collapsed toward each other, such that, the tips of some of the nano-fingers , and more particularly, some of the Raman-active material  are in contact with each other. In addition, a first set  of nano-fingers  is depicted as having a different physical characteristic than a second set  of nano-fingers . More particularly, the nano-fingers  in the first set  are depicted as having a relatively larger diameter than the nano-fingers  in the second set . According to a particular example, the difference in diameter is above about 50 nm. In addition, the nano-fingers  in the first and second sets may be arranged in any of a variety different configurations on the substrate .","Although not explicitly shown, the various sets of nano-fingers  depicted in  may include other types of physical characteristic differences. For instance, one set of the nano-fingers  may have a different cross-sectional shape than another set of the nano-fingers . As another example, one set of the nano-fingers  may have a different physical composition as compared with the physical composition of another set of the nano-fingers . As a further example, the sets of nano-fingers  may have multiple different physical characteristics with respect to each other.","The differences in physical characteristics between the nano-fingers  may also cause the various nano-fingers  to move from the collapsed state to the erect state or from the erect state to the collapsed state under application of different stimuli. For example, application of a first stimulus may cause the nano-fingers  in the first set ,  to move from the collapsed state to the erect state, while the nano-fingers  in the second set ,  remain in the collapsed state. In this example, a second stimulus may be applied to the apparatus  to cause the nano-fingers  in the second set ,  to move from the collapsed state to the erect state. Examples of suitable stimuli include, for instance, various combinations or concentrations of chemicals designed to interact differently with the nano-fingers  in the different sets - of nano-fingers . Other examples of suitable stimuli include, for instance, fluids at different temperatures, in which the nano-fingers  in the different sets - are to move as their temperatures change. Further examples of suitable stimuli include, for instance, introduction of electric currents and\/or electrostatic charges on the nano-fingers . Still further examples of suitable stimuli include, for instance, introduction of a fluid and evaporation of the fluid, which may cause the nano-fingers  in the different sets - to be drawn together at different rates due to differences in their flexibilities.","According to an example, at least one fluid supply source may be provided to apply the stimuli onto the nano-fingers . Thus, for instance, the fluid supply source may be positioned to deliver a predetermined fluid onto the nano-fingers , in which the predetermined fluid is known to interact with the nano-fingers  to cause the nano-fingers  to move from a collapsed state to an erect state and\/or from an erect state to a collapsed state. In this example, the fluid supply source may supply different fluids or fluids having different compositions or characteristics onto the nano-fingers , in which the fluids interact with the nano-fingers  in the different sets - in different manners. Thus, for instance, a first fluid may cause the nano-fingers  in the first set ,  to become erect, while being unable to cause the nano-fingers  in the other sets -,  to become erect. In addition, a second fluid may separately be introduced that may cause the nano-fingers  in at least one of the other sets -,  to become erect.","With reference to , there is shown a system  for applying an electrostatic charge on the nano-fingers , according to an example. The system  is depicted as including a voltage source , an electrically conductive source , and the apparatus  of . The system  may, however, include additional components or the components depicted therein may be modified or removed without departing from a scope of the system . Various manners in which the system , and variants thereof, may be implemented to apply electrostatic charges to move the nano-fingers  between collapsed and erect states are described in greater detail in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/905,891.","The voltage source  may comprise any suitable source from which alternating current (AC) or direct current (DC) voltage may be received. The electrically conductive source  may comprise any suitable component through the AC or DC voltage may be applied in relatively close proximity to the nano-fingers . Thus, for instance, the electrically conductive source  may comprise an electrode or wire positioned in relatively close proximity, without contacting, the nano-fingers . According to another example, the substrate  comprises the electrically conducive source .","The voltage source  is depicted in  as being activated or in an on state and is thus depicted as applying a voltage through the electrically conductive source  or the substrate . The application of the voltage through the electrically conductive source  is depicted as generating an electrostatic charge  onto the Raman-active material , thereby causing the Raman-active material  to become electrostatically charged with the same polarity. The Raman-active material  disposed on the ends of adjacent nano-fingers  thus repel each other, causing the nano-fingers  to be substantially erect.","According a particular example, the voltage source  may apply different levels of voltage across the electrically conductive source  to thereby vary the level of the electrostatic charge . In one regard, the different electrostatic charge  levels may affect the nano-fingers  in the different sets - differently. For instance, a lower electrostatic charge  level may cause the nano-fingers  in the first set ,  to become erect, while being unable to cause the nano-fingers  in the other sets -,  to become erect, so they remain in the collapsed state. In addition, a higher electrostatic charge  level may be applied to cause the remaining sets -,  of nano-fingers  to also become erect. In one regard, therefore, the nano-fingers  in the different sets - may be controllably and sequentially manipulated. In the event that the nano-fingers  are arranged, for instance, as depicted in , the sequential manipulation of the nano-fingers  in the different sets - may cause a fluid surrounding the nano-fingers  to be moved in a desired direction. In this regard, the apparatus  may be employed to move fluid, for instance, in a microfluidic channel.","According to an example, when the nano-fingers  are in substantially erect states, the free ends of the nano-fingers , and thus, the Raman-active material , are in a substantially spaced arrangement with respect to each other. The gaps between the free ends (Raman-active material ) may be of sufficiently large size to enable a liquid to be supplied in the gaps. In addition, the gaps may be of sufficiently small size to enable the free ends (Raman-active material ) of the nano-fingers  in each of the clusters  to move toward each other as the liquid evaporates, through, for instance, capillary forces applied on the free ends as the liquid dries. The free ends of adjacent ones of the nano-fingers  may also move toward each other, for instance, when application of the electrostatic charge  is ceased.","An analyte to be tested using the apparatus  may be included in the liquid to thus enable molecules from the analyte to be trapped between the tips (and\/or the Raman-active material ). Other non-limiting examples, such as e-beam, ion-beam, magnetic, mechanical force, thermal effect, or electric charge effect, may also be utilized to cause the ends of the nano-fingers  to move toward each other. In addition, the tips of the nano-fingers , and\/or the Raman-active material  of respectively adjacent nano-fingers  may contact each other and remain in contact with each other through van der Waals interactions between those elements.","With reference now to , there is shown a block diagram of a surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) system , according to an example. It should be understood that the system  depicted in  may include additional components and that some of the components described herein may be removed and\/or modified without departing from a scope of the system . It should also be understood that the components depicted in  are not drawn to scale and thus, the components may have different relative sizes with respect to each other than as shown therein.","As shown in , the SERS system  includes the apparatus  depicted in , an illumination source , and a detector . The SERS system  may, however, include any of the other apparatuses  depicted in  or an apparatus having a different configuration. In any regard, the apparatus  is depicted as including a first set  of nano-fingers  and a second set  of nano-fingers , in which the nano-fingers  in the second set  are longer than the nano-fingers  in the first set .","As also shown in , the nano-fingers  are depicted as being in the collapsed state. As discussed above, as the ends of the nano-fingers  move toward each other, analyte molecules  may become trapped between two or more of the contacting nano-fingers . In addition, the analyte molecules  may become trapped between nano-fingers  in respective sets  and  as depicted in .","The illumination source  is to emit an electromagnetic radiation, such as, visible light, onto the free ends of the nano-fingers , as represented by the arrow . By way of example, the illumination source  may comprise a laser that illuminates the free ends of the nano-fingers  with visible light. The electromagnetic radiation  is intended to cause the analyte molecules  to produce Raman scattered light as represented by the arrow . In addition, the detector  is positioned to detect the Raman scattered light  emitting from the analyte molecule(s) .","The Raman-active material  located near or adjacent to the analyte molecule(s)  may enhance the production of Raman scattered light from the analyte molecule(s)  by concentrating or otherwise enhancing an electromagnetic field in a vicinity of the analyte molecule(s) . The collapsing of two or more of the nano-fingers  upon each other to trap the analyte molecule(s)  may substantially increase the likelihood that the analyte molecule(s)  will be positioned near or in contact with some Raman-active material . In this regard, the likelihood that an analyte molecule(s)  will produce relatively strong Raman scattered light will thus also be increased. Thus, through implementation of the system , the detector  may receive a relatively stronger Raman scattered light signal  from the illuminated analyte molecule(s)  as compared with conventional SERS systems.","In addition, analyte molecules  trapped or positioned adjacent to Raman-active material  at different heights with respect to the substrate  may emit Raman scattered light at different intensities. As such, for instance, by illuminating analyte molecules  at different heights simultaneously, a substantially optimal illumination intensity may be obtained to thereby increase the likelihood that an analyte molecule(s)  will produce a relatively strong Raman scattered light . In one regard, the system  enables the simultaneous testing of nano-fingers  having different heights instead of having to perform multiple different tests using apparatuses having different nano-finger  heights. In another regard, the nano-fingers  may be arranged according to their varying heights, for instance, as shown in FIG. D, to cause the Raman scattered light  to be directed toward a particular direction and\/or to be focused.","The detector  is to convert the Raman scattered light  emitted from the analyte molecule(s)  into electrical signals that may be processed to identify, for instance, the analyte. In some examples, the detector  is to output the electrical signals to other components (not shown) configured to process the electrical signals. In other examples, the detector  is equipped with processing capabilities to identify the analyte.","According to an example, the apparatus  includes the illumination source  and the detector , for instance, integrated onto a single chip. In this example, the apparatus  provides a relatively compact solution that may be implemented efficiently for a relatively large sensing area.","Turning now to , there is shown a flow diagram of a method  for fabricating an apparatus, for instance, the apparatus  of , according to an example. It should be understood that the method  may include additional processes and that some of the processes described herein may be removed and\/or modified without departing from a scope of the method . In addition, although particular reference is made herein to the apparatus  in implementing the method , it should be understood that the method  may be implemented through use of a differently configured apparatus without departing from a scope of the method .","At block , a pattern of the first set  of the plurality of nano-fingers  and of the second set  of the plurality of nano-fingers  is generated. The generation of the pattern may also include generation of placement for the nano-fingers  in additional sets , , , . In any regard, the pattern may be generated so that the nano-fingers  in the first set  are to be particularly positioned on the substrate  with respect to the nano-fingers  in the second set . The pattern may form, for instance, holographic gratings, Fresnel lens, plasmonic nanostructures useful for laser light-beam conditioning, antenna, optical interconnects, etc., on the substrate .","At block , the first set  of nano-fingers  and the second set  of nano-fingers  are formed on the substrate  according to the pattern determined at block . According to an example, a template or mold defining the determined pattern and the different physical characteristics of the different sets - of the nano-fingers  may be formed and transferred to the substrate . As another example, the nano-fingers  may be formed with the same physical characteristics and a masking and etching operation may be implemented on the respective nano-fingers  to vary the physical characteristics of the nano-fingers  to have the desired physical characteristics and arrangement on the substrate . In this regard, nano-fingers  having different physical characteristics with respect to each other may be fabricated on the substrate .","Alternatively, however, the first set  of nano-fingers  and the second set  of nano-fingers  may be formed on the substrate  in a substantially random manner. In this example, the determination of the pattern at block  may be omitted and the nano-fingers  having the first physical characteristic and the nano-fingers  having the second physical characteristic may be formed to be interspersed with each other on the substrate .","In any regard, and according to an example, a nanoimprinting technique or a roll-to-roll process may be implemented to form the nano-fingers  having the different physical characteristics with respect to each other on the substrate . In this example, a template may be formed through photolithography or other advanced lithography with a desired patterning and physical characteristic modulations of the first and second sets ,  of nano-fingers . More particularly, for instance, the desired patterns may be designed on a mold, by E-beam lithography, photolithography, laser interference lithography, FIB (Focused Ion Beam), self-assembly of spheres, etc. In addition, the pattern may be transferred onto silicon, glass, or polymer substrate (PDMS, Polyethylene terephthalate, polyimide, polycarbonate, etc.). In other examples, the nano-fingers  may be formed in the predetermined arrangement through implementation of any suitable fabrication process.","At block , Raman-active material  is applied on the tips of the nano-fingers , for instance, by depositing atoms or atom clusters of the Raman-active material. The Raman-active material atoms or atom clusters may be deposited onto the tips of the nano-fingers  through, for instance, physical vapor deposition (PVD), chemical vapor deposition (CVD), sputtering, etc., of the Raman-active material, or self-assembly of pre-synthesized nano-particles. In certain examples in which the apparatus  is to be implemented as a fluid moving device and not an apparatus for certain sensing applications as discussed in greater detail herein above, block  may be omitted.","At block , the nano-fingers  are caused to collapse upon each other in any of the manners discussed above. According to an example, prior to collapsing of the nano-fingers , an analyte  () is introduced onto the apparatus . In this example, the nano-fingers  may be caused to collapse upon each other to thereby trap molecules of the analyte  between respective ones of the Raman-active material . Alternatively, the nano-fingers  may be caused to collapse upon each other prior to introduction of the analyte . In any regard, a detection operation may be performed on the analyte  using the apparatus  as discussed above with respect to .","As also discussed in greater detail herein above, at block , the nano-fingers  in the first set  may be caused to collapse independently of the nano-fingers  in the second set . More particularly, for instance, the nano-fingers  in the first set  may collapse under application of different stimuli as compared with the nano-fingers  in the second set . In this regard, the apparatus  may be implemented as a fluid moving device in a microfluidic channel.","Although described specifically throughout the entirety of the instant disclosure, representative examples of the present disclosure have utility over a wide range of applications, and the above discussion is not intended and should not be construed to be limiting, but is offered as an illustrative discussion of aspects of the disclosure.","What has been described and illustrated herein is an example along with some of its variations.
