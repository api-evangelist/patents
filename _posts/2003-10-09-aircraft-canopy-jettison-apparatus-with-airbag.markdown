title: Aircraft canopy jettison apparatus with airbag
abstract: A method of removing a canopy from a cockpit of an aircraft comprising providing an airbag in the cockpit adjacent the canopy; inflating the airbag; and as the airbag inflates, applying a force to the canopy from the inflating airbag to thereby jettison the canopy.

The three ways are rocket motors, canopy thruster(s), and canopy fragilization. All three have advantages and disadvantages that dictate the effectiveness of a pilot's safe egress from an aircraft.","Many older military aircraft still in service use a canopy thruster in combination with mechanical linkages to remove the canopy from an aircraft. Some of the limitations of using a canopy thruster have been seen over the past few years. Timing is a key factor to ensuring the successful egress of aircrew from an aircraft. The use of mechanical linkages to assist in the removal has a strong dependence on the resilience of these linkages. The failure of one part in the series of linkages can cause the canopy to remain attached to the aircraft or cause a delay in the timing of events and possible injury to the aircrew.","Canopy jettison by way of rocket motors is currently used in military aircraft. One problem with using rocket motors is the extreme amounts of noise generated, which can damage an aircrew's hearing. Another problem with using rocket motors is the proximity of the rocket plume to the aircrew, which can cause serious injury to the aircrew.","Canopy fragilization has recently been incorporated into new aircraft designs over the past decade as a means for canopy removal during an emergency egress situation. One disadvantage of canopy fragilization is the use of explosives, in close proximity to the aircrew, to blow the transparent glass out of the canopy's metal frame. One concern when using this method is the likelihood of fragments hitting the aircrew. Another disadvantage is the noise that may be encountered due to the proximity of the aircrew to the explosive charge. One key factor to a successful disintegration of the transparent glass is in the determination of how much explosive material is needed to fragment the transparent part of the canopy into small pieces.","The present invention uses airbag technology to perform and\/or assist in the work function of canopy removal for an aircraft during an emergency egress. In general, the airbag system comprises an inflatable airbag and a cartridge actuated device (CAD). The operation of the airbag starts by the initiation of the CAD. The CAD outputs gas that inflates the airbag. As the airbag begins to inflate, it forces the canopy open. Given the proper placement of the airbag, the distributed force applied to the canopy causes the canopy to be jettisoned from the aircraft. The airbag may be fixed to the airframe, canopy or ejection seat. The adaptability of an airbag system allows for an upgrade of existing aircraft's egress system; thereby serving to improve or solve escape path clearance related issues.","The invention will be better understood, and further objects, features, and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00019","num":"00019"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIGS. 1 and 2","FIG. 2","FIGS. 1 and 2"],"b":["10","12","1","1","2"],"sub":"x","ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul200001","list-style":"none"},"li":["A: the axis of rotation point for the canopy.","A: the reaction force in the positive x-direction.

This allows for a faster canopy removal time. A comparison of equations 4 and 8 from , respectively, shows that \u03b1is greater than \u03b1. Thus, the angular acceleration of the canopy  with the airbag is faster than the angular acceleration of the canopy  without the airbag. The total momentum that is being applied to the canopy  is greater than that for canopy . The increased momentum causes an increase in the overall distance relative to the starting position.","The size and shape of the airbag is dependent upon the space limitations inside the cockpit. In general, the amount of force required to jettison a canopy of a given shape, size, and weight determines the size and shape of the airbag. The position of the airbag in the cockpit depends on the best mounting surface available on the inside of the cockpit. For example, the airbag may be fixed to the airframe, canopy or ejection seat.  is a perspective view of a cockpit portion of an aircraft  with the fuselage skin removed for clarity.
