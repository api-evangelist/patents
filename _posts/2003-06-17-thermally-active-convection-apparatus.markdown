No. 6,904,956.","N\/A.","N\/A.","N\/A.","(1) Field of the Invention.","This invention pertains to apparatus and methods for abstracting heat from a substance.","More particularly, the invention pertains to an improved apparatus and method which utilizes a matrix comprised of liquids and solids to abstract, over an extended period of time, heat from a substance.","In a further respect, the invention pertains to an improved apparatus of the type described which utilizes a plurality of heat transfer elements having three dimensional parity.","In another respect, the invention pertains to an improved heat abstracting apparatus of the type described which convects heat along paths intermediate spaced apart heat transfer elements.","In still a further respect, the invention pertains to an improved apparatus and method of the type described in which heat transfer elements are shaped to absorb heat along vertical and lateral paths.","In still another respect, the invention pertains to an improved simplified method of manufacturing a heat transfer device.","In yet a further respect, the invention pertains to an improved heat abstracting apparatus of the type described which provides efficient transfer using a single heat transfer element\u2014liquid interface.","(2) Description of Related Art including information disclosed under 37 CFR 1.97 and 1.98.","So called \u201ccold packs\u201d are well known and typically, for example, comprise pliable, hollow, vinyl containers filled with a gelatin. In use, the cold pack is frozen and is placed against an individual's neck or other part of the individual's body to cool the individual. One such conventional cold pack is marketed under the trademark \u201cTHERAPAC\u201d and comprises a twelve inch-by-twelve inch two ply vinyl container filled with a white odorless insoluble gelatin. Another conventional cold pack is marketed under the trademark \u201cCOLPAC\u201d and comprises a twelve inch-by-twelve inch single ply polymer container filled with a gray odorless soluble gelatin. Such conventional cold packs are widely disseminated and effectively absorb heat. One principal disadvantage of such cold packs is that they have a relatively short-lived ability to stay cold. For example, when the THERAPAC and COLPAC cold packs noted above are removed from a freezer, the temperature on the outer surface of the cold pack can be five degrees F. After about an hour, the temperature can be about forty-five to fifty degrees F. After about two hours, the temperature on the outer surface of the cold packs can be about fifty-two to fifty-eight degrees F. After about three hours, the temperature can be about sixty-five to seventy degrees F. Consequently, after only an hour the temperature of the outer surface of each of the cold packs is well above freezing.","Accordingly, it would be highly desirable to provide an improved cold pack which would, after being exposed to ambient temperature, maintain a low temperature for an extended period of time.","Therefore, it is a principal object of the invention to provide an improved apparatus for abstracting heat from a solid, liquid, gas or other substance.","A further object of the instant invention is to provide an improved cold pack which will maintain a cold temperature for an extended period of time after being exposed to a temperature greater than that of the cold pack.","Another object of the invention is to provide an improved method for manufacturing a cold pack.","Still a further object of the invention is to provide a heat transfer device that facilitates conforming the device to the contour of the body.","Still another object of the invention is to provide an improved heat transfer device with a module matrix that facilitates folding the device and partitioning the device.","Briefly, in accordance with the invention, I provide an improved heat transfer device for use in contacting and drawing heat away from a substance. The heat transfer device includes a hollow primary container including a wall, and a first liquid housed in the container; and, includes at least one hollow auxiliary container in the first liquid and including a wall, and a second liquid housed in the auxiliary container.

The method includes the steps of providing a heat transfer device. The heat transfer device includes a hollow primary container including a wall, and a first liquid housed in the container. The primary container also includes at least one hollow auxiliary container in the first liquid. The auxiliary container includes a wall, and a second liquid housed in the auxiliary container.

The first direction is substantially normal to the second direction.","In yet another embodiment of the invention, I provide an improved two phase single wall heat transfer device for use in contacting and drawing heat away from a substance. The heat transfer device includes an outer wall circumscribing and enclosing an inner space; a plurality of spaced apart hollow fluid containers mounted in said inner space above said outer wall, each of said containers including a top and at least one side; a floor interconnecting the hollow fluid tight containers; a first heat-exchange composition in the inner space contacting each of the fluid containers and comprising a liquid which undergoes a change of state from the liquid phase to the solid phase at a selected temperature of transformation; a second heat-exchange composition in each of said hollow containers comprising a liquid which undergoes a change of state from the liquid phase to the solid phase at a selected temperature of transformation; the wall, floor, and fluid containers being shaped and dimensioned such that heat absorbed through the wall by the first heat-exchange composition is carried by convection intermediate the hollow fluid containers and into contact with the sides of the containers and with the floor.","In yet a further embodiment of the invention, I provide an improved two phase single wall heat transfer device for use in contacting and drawing heat away from a substance. The heat transfer device includes an outer wall circumscribing and enclosing an inner space; a plurality of hollow fluid containers mounted in the inner space; a first heat-exchange composition in the inner space contacting each of the fluid containers and comprising a liquid which undergoes a change of state from the liquid phase to the solid phase at a selected temperature of transformation; a second heat-exchange composition in each of hollow containers comprising a liquid which undergoes a change of state from the liquid phase to the solid phase at a selected temperature of transformation; and, a pump for circulating the first heat-exchange composition into contact with the fluid containers.","In still yet another embodiment of the invention I provide an improved pliable two phase single wall heat transfer device for use in contacting and drawing heat away from a substance. The heat transfer device comprises an outer wall circumscribing and enclosing an inner space; a plurality of spaced apart hollow fluid tight containers connected to a portion of the wall, extending from the wall into the inner space, and including rounded bottoms to faciliate folding adjacent ones of the fluid containers against one another;a first heat-exchange composition in the inner space contacting each of the fluid tight containers and comprising a liquid which undergoes a change of state from the liquid phase to the solid phase at a selected temperature of transformation; and, a second heat-exchange composition in each of the hollow containers comprising a liquid which undergoes a change of state from the liquid phase to the solid phase at a selected temperature of transformation.","In yet still a further embodiment of the invention, I provide an improved method for manufacturing a two phase single wall bi-directional heat transfer device for use in contacting and drawing heat away from a substance. The improved method includes the steps of providing a first sheet of pliable material; forming a pan with the sheet of material, the pan including a peripheral lip extending around the pan; charging the pan with a first heat-exchange composition comprising a liquid which undergoes a change of state from the liquid phase to the solid phase at a selected temperature of transformation; providing a second sheet of pliable material; forming a module matrix with the second sheet of material, the module matrix including a peripheral edge and including a plurality of modules each with a bottom and an open top; placing the module matrix in the pan such that the bottom of each module extends into the first heat-exchange composition; administering a second heat-exchange composition to each of the modules comprising a liquid which undergoes a change of state from the liquid phase to the solid phase at a selected temperature of transformation liquid; and, sealing the first composition in the pan and the second composition in the module matrix.","In another embodiment of the invention I provide an improved pliable two phase single wall heat transfer device for use in contacting and drawing heat away from a substance. The heat transfer device comprises an outer wall circumscribing and enclosing an inner space; a plurality of spaced apart hollow fluid tight containers connected to a portion of the wall, extending from the wall into the inner space, and including rounded bottoms to faciliate folding adjacent ones of the fluid containers against one another; a first heat-exchange composition in the inner space contacting each of the fluid tight containers and comprising a liquid which undergoes a change of state from the liquid phase to the solid phase at a selected temperature of transformation; and, a second heat-exchange composition in each of the hollow containers comprising a liquid which undergoes a change of state from the liquid phase to the solid phase at a selected temperature of transformation. A plurality of channels interconnects pairs of the hollow containers to promote the flow of liquid therebetween.","Turning now to the drawings, which depict the presently preferred embodiments of the invention for the purpose of illustrating the practice thereof and not by way of limitation of the scope of the invention, and in which like reference characters refer to corresponding elements throughout the several views,  illustrates a heat transfer device generally identified by reference character . Device  includes a spherical hollow primary container having a wall  including spherical outer surface  and spherical inner surface . A liquid  is housed inside the primary container. At least one auxiliary spherical hollow container  is in and free to move and circulate about the reservoir formed by liquid . Each hollow container  includes a spherical wall  having a spherical outer surface  and a spherical inner surface . A liquid  is housed inside each auxiliary container . Liquid  has a lower (cooler) freezing point than liquid , and preferably, but not necessarily, has a freezing point lower than the coldest temperatures found in conventional household or commercial freezers. By way of example, and not limitation, liquid  presently comprises propylene glycol and liquid  comprises water. Liquid  preferably has a freezing point greater or equal to the coldest temperature found in conventional household or commercial freezers.","Other examples of compositions that can be utilized as liquid  or liquid  include aqueous solutions of ethyl alcohol, methyl alcohol, PRESTONE, iso-propyl alcohol, and glycerol. Magnesium chloride, sodium chloride, and calcium chloride brines can be utilized. Refrigerants which can be utilized as liquid  include ammonia, ethyl chloride, and methyl chloride.","The wall  is preferably, although not necessarily, fabricated from a pliable vinyl or other pliable material so that wall  will conform to a part of an individual's body or will conform to some other object that is contacted by heat transfer device . Similarly, the wall  is preferably, although not necessarily, fabricated from a pliable vinyl or other pliable material so that wall  will conform to a part of an individual's body or will conform to some other object. As would be appreciated by those of skill in the art, device  and walls  and  need not be spherical and can be made to have any desired shape, contour, and dimension. Walls  and  need not be pliable and can be substantially rigid.","In use of the heat transfer device , device  is placed in a freezer. Liquid , being water, freezes. Liquid , being propylene glycol, does not freeze. After liquid  freezes, device  is removed from the freezer and placed against a portion  of an individual's body or against some other object or substance so that device  absorbs heat H. Heat is absorbed through wall  and into liquid  by the transfer of kinetic energy from particle to particle. When heat is absorbed by liquid , liquid  has a non-uniform temperature, i.e., liquid near wall  is warmer and has a greater enthalpy than liquid farther away from wall . If liquid near wall  has a different temperature, the density of the liquid near wall  is different than the density of cooler liquid farther away from wall . This density differential, along with the force of gravity, causes circulation and movement of liquid . When, during this circulation and movement, warmed liquid  passes by and contacts an auxiliary spherical hollow container , heat is absorbed through wall  and into frozen liquid  by the transfer of kinetic energy from particle to particle.","The heat transfer device of  is identical to that of  except that auxiliary containers  are connected in a chain to each other and to the inner surface of wall  by links , , and , respectively. This chain can be slack so that containers  can, to a degree, move about in liquid , or, the chain can be substantially rigid so it maintains its shape and dimension even if pliable wall  is displaced.","The heat transfer device of  is identical to that of  except that auxiliary containers  are removed and replaced by an elongate hollow auxiliary container  having a cylindrical wall  with a cylindrical outer surface  and a cylindrical inner surface . Container  is filled with a liquid  which, like liquid , has a freezing point which is greater (warmer) than that of liquid .","In another embodiment of the invention, liquids  and\/or  have a freezing point which is less than that of liquid . This embodiment of the invention is particularly desirable if liquid , when frozen, is malleable or is readily broken into pieces which permit a pliable wall  to be displaced and manipulated like the pliable rubber wall of a hot water bottle can be manipulated when the water bottle is filled with water","In a further embodiment of the invention, liquids  and\/or  have a freezing point equivalent to that of liquid .","The use of the devices of  is comparable to that of the heat transfer device of . In , auxiliary containers  absorb heat from liquid . In , auxiliary container  absorbs heat from liquid .","The ratio of the mass of liquid  with respect to the mass of liquid  (or ) in a device  can vary as desired, but is presently preferably about 1:1. As the mass of liquid  with respect to the mass of liquid  increases, the heat absorbing capacity of liquid  increases, but there is less of liquid  to circulate to containers  heat which is absorbed from wall . It is believed that if the mass of liquid  greatly exceeds that of liquid  (e.g., the ratio of liquid  to liquid  is, for example, 8:1), then heat will tend to be absorbed directly by containers  instead of first being absorbed by liquid  and transferred to containers . This would defeat a primary feature of the invention. The use of liquid  to circulate heat to containers  is believed central to the invention and is believed, at least in part, responsible for why the heat transfer apparatus of the invention stays cool for unusually long periods of time. The ratio of liquid  to liquid  is preferably, but not necessarily, in the range of 3:1 to 1:3, most preferably in the range of 2:1 to 1:2.","The materials utilized to construct walls  and  and  affect the rate of heat transfer. Thicker walls normally transfer heat at a slower rate; thinner walls at a faster rate. While polymer material is desirable in walls , ,  because pliable polymer materials are readily available, incorporating metal or other materials which facilitate the transfer of heat is also desirable.","When a device  is placed in a freezer to solidify liquid , liquid  can have a composition which permits it to turn to a gel, but preferably does not solidify. It is preferred that liquid  remain a liquid or become a gel so that device  remains pliable after being frozen. Similarly, when liquid  is frozen, it may turn to a gel and may not completely solidify.","The following example is given by way of demonstration and not limitation of the scope of the invention.","The following were obtained:\n\n","Cold packs A, B, C were all placed at the same time in a freezer. After several hours, cold packs A, B, C were removed at the same time from the freezer and placed on a flat table top in a room. The room temperature was eighty degrees and was maintained at eighty degrees while the following measurements were made. Measurements were made when the cold packs were removed from the freezer and at hourly intervals thereafter up to four hours. Each time measurements were taken, a measurement was taken on the outer surface of each cold pack and on the interior of each cold pack. The results are summarized below in Tables I and II.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0068"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE I"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Surface Temperature Measurements of Cold Packs A, B, C"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"175pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"Temperature Measurements (Degrees F.)"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"6"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Cold Pack","At removal","1 hour","2 hours","3 hours","4 hours"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"6"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["A","5","48","56","72","77"]},{"entry":["B","5","47","55","73","80"]},{"entry":["C","10","39","39","40","42"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0069"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE II"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Interior Temperature Measurements of Cold Packs A, B, C"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"175pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"Temperature Measurements (Degrees F.)"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"6"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Cold Pack","At removal","1 hour","2 hours","3 hours","4 hours"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"6"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["A","0","47","55","65","75"]},{"entry":["B","0","49","57","65","75"]},{"entry":["C","15","15","32","34","36"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"The above results demonstrate that the cold pack of the invention (identified as \u201cC\u201d) remained much colder for much longer than the conventional cold packs identified as \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d. These results were surprising and unexpected and are believed to demonstrate the utility and novelty of the heat transfer device of the invention.","Another heat transfer device of the invention is illustrated in  and is generally indicated by reference character . Device  includes outer wall . The material(s) used to fabricate wall  can vary as desired. Wall  presently preferably comprises a pliable water impermeable material like rubber or plastic. Wall  circumscribes and encloses inner space . Cylindrical hollow fluid containers  and  are mounted in inner space . The shape and dimension of each container ,  can vary as desired. Each container  is fluid tight and completely encloses a space . Each container  partially encloses a space  and opens into the lower portion of inner space  in . Each container  can be mounted on floor  in an inverted configuration in which space  opens into the upper portion\u2014instead of the lower portion\u2014of space . Each container  includes a top  and side . The thickness of top  and side  can vary as desired to vary the ability of heat to traverse and pass through top  and side .","Containers ,  are mounted on a floor  that extends across and bifurcates inner space  into two separate chambers or spaces. The outer peripheral edge of floor  is attached to wall . A first heat-exchange composition  is in the upper chamber created in space  by floor . A second heat-exchange composition  is in the lower chamber created in space  by floor . Floor  and containers  and  prevent composition  from intermixing with composition , and vice-versa. If desired, floor  can be perforated to allow the flow of fluid  into fluid , and vice-versa.","The freezing point of composition  can vary as desired and can be equal to that of composition , greater than that of composition , or less than that of composition . In one presently preferred embodiment, the freezing point of composition  is lower than that of composition . Composition  can be the same as composition . It is presently preferred, although not necessary, that compositions  and  be in a liquid phase when heated to normal room temperature of 76 degrees F.; that composition  freeze at temperatures in the range of fifteen degrees Fahrenheit to thirty-two degrees Fahrenheit; and, that composition  freeze at temperatures less than fifteen degrees Fahrenheit. In this configuration, composition  normally freezes when placed in a conventional residential freezer while composition  does not. Since composition  then remains in a liquid state and since wall  normally is pliable, wall  and composition  can readily conform to a surface (i.e., the body of a human being or other animal) even if composition  is, when frozen, rigid.","A third heat-exchange chemical composition can be in space  in each fluid tight container . The third composition can be a gas, liquid, or solid and can have any desired phase transformation temperatures. Practically speaking, however, the third composition is, as are the first and second heat-exchange compositions, preferably a fluid at room temperature because the heat-exchange compositions preferred in the practice of the invention either remain in a fluid form or transform between only two phases, the liquid phase and the solid phase of the heat-exchange composition. Gases have minimal thermal capacity and ordinarily are difficult to transform into liquids or solids at normal ambient, freezing or heating temperatures.","When the upper portion of wall  in  is placed against a substance having a temperature cooler than that of an aqueous liquid composition , heat from composition  travels outwardly through wall  causing the temperature of the portion of composition  adjacent wall  to cool. When the composition  cools, the density of the cooled liquid increases, causing the liquid to move downwardly under gravity in a convection current in the direction of arrow A.","When the lower portion of wall  in  is placed against a substance having a temperature warmer than that of a liquid composition , heat from the substance is absorbed by composition  through the lower portion of wall . The warmed portion of composition  typically carries the heat by convection upwardly in the direction indicated by arrow B. Fluid circulating in the manner indicated by arrows A and B travels adjacent the sides ,  and tops ,  of containers  and , permitting heat to travel through the containers between compositions  and . The shape and configuration of containers  and  is important in this respect. A plurality of spaced apart containers  and  is preferred because the upstanding sides ,  significantly increase the surface area available to compositions  and . Further, when sides  and  are substantially normal to floor  and top  or , heat can be absorbed substantially vertically through a top ,  or floor  in the direction indicated by arrow C and can be absorbed substantially laterally through a side  and . A side ,  is substantially normal to floor  or top, ,  if the side is at an angle in the range of sixty to one-hundred and twenty degrees, preferably in the range of seventy-five to one-hundred and five degrees, to floor  or top , . In , sides  and  are normal to tops ,  and floor . Another reason containers  and  are preferred is that when fluid flows between containers  and  or into a container , turbulent flow and eddy currents are believed more likely to occur, particularly if the distance between adjacent containers is one inch or less. Turbulent flow and eddy currents facilitate the intermixing of warmed fluid  (or ) with cooler fluid  (or ). This intermixing of fluid  having different temperatures facilitates the efficient transfer of heat from a substance to fluid  and from fluid  either through containers ,  to composition  or to a third composition in spaces  in containers . Heat can also, if desired, transfer from composition  to fluid  in the event that composition  is used to absorb heat.","Another preferred feature of containers  and  is that each container have substantial dimensional parity. Dimension parity is important because it slows the absorption of heat by the container  and . Slowing the absorption of heat tends to extend the useful life of device  as a cooling device. If containers  and  do not have dimensional parity and instead take on the configuration of a sheet or panel, the composition in each container ,  tends to more rapidly absorb heat. A container ,  has dimensional parity when the height and width of a cross-section taken through the center (or estimated center) of the container and normal to the length (i.e., normal to the greatest dimension of the container) are substantially equal. The height and width of such a cross-section of the container are substantially equal when the ratio of the height to the width is in the range of 5:1 to 1:5, preferably 3:1 to 1:3. A sphere has substantial dimensional parity because the height and width of a cross-section through the center of the sphere are equal, i.e., are each equal the diameter of the sphere. Therefore, for a sphere, the ratio of the height of the cross-section to the width of the cross-section is 1:1. A cube has substantial dimensional parity because the ratio of the height to the width of a cross-section that passes through the center of the cube, passes through four of the corners of the cube, and is normal to a centerline passing through two corners of the cube is 1:1.","A parallelepiped that is 4 cm high, 6 cm wide, and 8 cm long has substantial dimensional parity because the ratio of height to the width of a cross-section taken through the center and normal to the longitudinal centerline of the parallelepiped 1:1.5.","A parallelepiped which is in the shape of a panel and has a length of 8 cm, height of 4 cm, and a width of 0.5 cm does not have substantial dimensional parity because the ratio of the height to the width of a cross-section taken through the center and normal to the longitudinal centerline of the parallelepiped is 8:1 (i.e., is 4 to 0.5). This parallelepiped would, because of its narrow width, more rapidly absorb heat and dissipate the thermal absorption capacity of the composition in or comprising the parallelepiped.","When the side ,  and top ,  of a container ,  are thin-walled, i.e., are less than about two millimeters (mm) thick (i.e., having a thickness of two mm plus or minus 10%), and have a substantially uniform thickness (i.e., the thickness of the side(s), top, and, if appropriate, bottom, walls at all points varies by no more than about two millimeters), then the outer dimensions of the container provide a good indication of whether the container has substantial dimensional parity. If, however, the thickness of a wall(s) of the container is greater than about two mm and\/or the thickness of the walls is not substantially uniform, then the outer dimensions of the container may not provide a good indication of whether the container has substantial dimensional parity, and the configuration of the space , A inside the container ,  needs to be taken into account to determine if there is substantial dimensional parity. The same criteria used to evaluate the dimensional parity of the outside shape and dimension of a container ,  can be utilized to evaluate the dimensional parity of the space , A inside a container , . If the space , A is the shape of a cube, then the space has dimensional parity. If the space , A is the shape of a sphere, then the space has dimensional parity. If the space , A is the shape of a parallelepiped having a length of 8 cm, a height of 4 cm, and a width of 0.5, then the space does not have substantial dimensional parity. In , containers  and  are not thin-walled. Since, however, the cross-sections of the spaces inside containers  and  have the shape of a cube, containers  and  have substantial dimensional parity. The heat transfer container illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 2,595,328 to Bowen does not appear to have substantial dimensional parity.","Another heat transfer device  is illustrated in  and is similar to heat transfer device . A particular advantage of device  is that it only requires outer liquid impermeable wall  and does not require a floor  because containers , ,  are connected to a portion of wall  and extend into space. This makes device  inexpensive to manufacture. Each container , ,  includes a fluid tight wall , a top , and a bottom that comprises a portion of wall . The inner space  of each container includes a heat-exchange composition . Inner space  is circumscribed and enclosed by wall  and includes heat-exchange composition . The freezing point of composition  can be greater than, less than, or equal to the freezing point of composition . In one presently preferred embodiment, the freezing point of composition  is a higher temperature than the freezing point of composition .","The distance, indicated by arrows E, between an adjacent pair of containers  can vary as desired, as can the height, indicated by arrows F, and the width, indicated by arrows G, of a container . To facilitate the transfer of heat between compositions  and , it is preferred that a plurality of containers  be provided. As the number of containers  increases, the available surface area increases. By way of example, and not limitation, containers  presently preferably have a width G in the range of one-quarter to one inch, and a height G in the range of one-quarter to one inch. This distance E between adjacent containers is in the range of one-quarter to three-quarters of an inch. Arrows H to K in  illustrate possible liquid flow paths. Liquid traveling along these flow paths transports heat by convection away from wall  toward containers , , .","Heat transfer device  in  includes parallelepiped wall  circumscribing and enclosing inner spaces  and  and hollow fluid tight containers ,  mounted on wall . A heat-exchange fluid or solid is in each container , . Rectangular plate  separates spaces  and . Pump  circulates a heat-exchange liquid. The liquid flows out of space  in the direction of arrows , through pump , and back into space  in the direction of travel indicated by arrows . Liquid flowing into space  flows through perforations  back into space .","Heat transfer device  in  includes outer wall . Walls ,  normally, but not necessarily, are liquid impermeable. Hollow fluid tight containers , ,  are housed within wall , are mounted on wall , and extend into the inner space circumscribed by wall  in the same manner that containers , ,  are attached to wall  and extend into space  in . The inner space circumscribed by wall  is filled with a first heat-exchange composition. Each container  to  is filled with a second heat-exchange composition. When the first heat-exchange composition is in a fluid phase, pump  circulates the first heat-exchange composition. The first heat-exchange composition exits pump  and travels through conduit  in the manner indicated by arrows M, N, O. The upper arm  of conduit  is perforated such that fluid exits arm  under pressure in the direction indicated by arrow P. The perforations are shaped and spaced to facilitate a uniform rate of dispersal of fluid out of arm  along the length of arm , or along a selected portion of the length of arm . The first heat-exchange composition flows around and between containers , ,  in the manner indicated by arrows Q, R, S and re-enters pump , which again directs the composition into conduit  under pressure.","Walls  and  and  and , floor , and containers , , , , , , , , ,  can be rigid or flexible or pliable, elastic or non-elastic, porous or non-porous, fluid tight or not fluid tight, have one or more layers, and can be constructed from any desired material including, without limitation, resin, metal, glass, concrete, plaster, porcelain, and paper.","As earlier noted, fluid can be circulated in the heat transfer device of the invention by convection and by the use of a pump. Fluid can also be circulated by shaking the heat transfer device and by, when the outer wall , , ,  is pliable, manually kneading or displacing the wall to move the heat-exchange composition ,  in the device.","As will be appreciated by those of skill in the art, in  either the top or bottom of wall  can be placed against a surface to be heated or cooled. In , only containers  or only containers  can, if desired, be utilized and mounted on floor .","In one embodiment of the invention, the containers  in  each are cylindrically shaped, are of equivalent shape and dimension, have a diameter and height of about one-half inch, are equidistant from other adjacent containers, and are spaced apart about one-half inch in a checker board array similar to that shown in .","In , containers ,  approximately double the surface area exposed to composition . If containers ,  are not utilized and floor  is a flat, continuous member extending completely across device , then the surface area exposed to composition  is about equal to the sum of the area of the tops ,  of the containers ,  and the area of the portions of floor  extending intermediate containers ,  in the manner shown in . When containers ,  are utilized, the surface area exposed to composition  equals the sum of the area of tops ,  plus the area of the portions of floor  extending intermediate containers ,  plus the sum of the cylindrical surface areas of each side , . 100% of the surface area of each container  is in contact with composition . All of the surface area of each container  is in contact with composition  excepting the circular base, which is in contact with composition . The proportion of the surface area of each container ,  in contact with composition  or  is in the range of 20% to 100%, preferably in the range of 55% to 100%, most preferably in the range of 70% to 100%. In U.S. Pat. No. 2,595,328 to Bowen, only 50% of each receptacle  is in contact with material  positioned above receptacle . The more desirable embodiments of the invention illustrated in  herein utilize containers ,  having well over 50% of the containers in contact with composition  and\/or .","The use of containers , , , etc. that remain in fixed position comprises one preferred embodiment of the invention because the containers , ,  are prevented from bunching together. This insures that the heat transfer characteristics of the heat transfer device remain fixed and more evenly distributed throughout the device.","Another important feature of the invention is the proportion of the surface area of floor  (or of the bottom area of a wall  on which containers , ,  are mounted in ) intermediate containers ,  with respect to the surface area of floor  occupied by the base of each container , . This is important because there must be sufficient space intermediate containers ,  to permit fluid to circulate in the manner indicated by arrows A and B (and arrows H to K in ) so heat can be transferred through floor  to fluid  and\/or through walls  and  to fluid  or to fluid in spaces . U.S. Pat. No. 2,595,328 discloses a heat transfer device which has little floor space (zones 9 in Bowen) and, consequently, which permits little lateral heat transfer and little heat transfer through zones 9. The ratio of the surface area of floor  intermediate containers ,  to the surface area of the bases of containers ,  (where in  the surface area of each base of a cylindrical containers ,  is equal to the surface area of the top ,  of the container) is in the range of 1:3.5 to 10:1, preferably 1:2 to 10:1.","Similarly the proportion of the surface area of containers ,  that permits lateral heat transfer D is important in the practice of the invention. The proportion of the surface area of the side(s) of a container ,  to the total surface area of the container is in the range of 1:4 to 10:1. The receptacles  in U.S. Pat. No. 2,595,328 to Bowen are not constructed to significantly utilize lateral heat transfer. The total surface area of container  herein includes the area of top  plus the area of side . The total surface area of container  includes the surface area of circular top , the surface area of cylindrical side , and the area of the circular base of container . If the proportion of the surface area of the side(s) of a container ,  with respect to the total surface area of the container is too great (i.e., is, for example, 12:1), then it is likely the container is either losing dimensional parity or is so tall that it interferes with proper fluid circulation. Similarly if the proportion of the surface area of the side(s) of a container ,  with respect to the total surface area of the container is too small (i.e., is for example 1:6), then it is also likely the container is losing dimensional parity and\/or is so short that the lateral heat absorption D is adversely affected.","In one preferred embodiment of the invention, fluid  has a lower freezing point than the fluid in containers . For example, fluid  is glycol and the fluid  in containers  is water. Device  is placed in a conventional residential freezer in a refrigerator. Fluid  freezes. Fluid  does not. The upper portion of wall  in  is placed against the back of the neck of an individual. Since fluid  is in a liquid state, fluid  and the upper portion of pliable wall  readily conform to the shape of individual's neck (or shoulder, or arm, etc.). Fluid  absorbs heat. Convection currents H to K carry heat toward containers . The shape and dimension and spacing of containers  cause turbulent flow and eddy current when the convection currents flow into, past, and between containers . Frozen fluid  absorbs heat. Eventually a large enough quantity of heat is absorbed to cause frozen fluid  to undergo a phase transformation from a solid to a liquid.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0092","num":"0094"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["70","70","73","72","71"]},"Pan  includes bottom  and includes outer parallel elongate planar lips or edges  and  and includes inner parallel inset elongate planar lips or edges . The construction of lips or edges , ,  is similar to the construction of lips or edges A, A, A and B in pan A in . The construction of pan  is similar to that of pan A.","Module matrix  includes a plurality of modules , , , . In  there are sixteen equal sized modules  in an upper left hand quadrant I, sixteen equal sized modules  in an upper right hand quadrant II, sixteen modules  in a lower left hand quadrant III, and sixteen modules  in a lower right hand quadrant IV. The shape and dimension of each module can, if desired, vary. However, in  each module , , ,  has an equivalent shape and dimension. Adjacent modules  in the upper left hand quadrant are spaced equal distances apart, as are adjacent modules  to  in the remaining three quadrant illustrated in . If desired, module matrix  can, and likely would, include additional modules, preferably, but not necessarily, in sub-matrix groupings of four by four (or sixteen total) modules.","One particular advantage of module matrix  is that each quadrant I, II, III, IV of sixteen modules is spaced apart from any adjacent modules such that the distance indicated by arrows D and D is greater than the distance D between modules in a quadrant. This facilitates folding or cutting device  along axis X and\/or Y.","Another advantage of module matrix  is that each module  to  has a semi-spherical, cylindrical, semi-ellipsoidal, semi-spheroidal or other arcuate bottom like modules A in . Providing modules  to  with arcuate bottoms faciliates pliably bending or deforming device  in the manner indicated by arrows  and  in  for heat transfer device . The arcuate bottoms of each module  to  also facilitate the flow of fluid around the bottoms.","The peripheral edges of seal layer  are fixedly sealingly connected to lips ,  to seal liquid (not visible in ) that fills pan  and surrounds modules , , ,  and that fills each module , , , . Layer  is sealingly affixed to edges  and  in the same manner that layer A is affixed to edges A and A in .","While distance D can vary as desired, D is presently preferably in the range of 16 mm to 24 mm. The distance D, D, D between a pair of adjacent modules  in a quadrant can vary but is presently preferably eight millimeters to twelve millimeters. The diameter or width W () of a module can vary but is presently preferably in the range of 20 mm to 40 mm. The depth D () of a module is preferably equal to or about equal to the width of the module. The bottom C () of a module can contact or need not contact the bottom , A of a pan , A.","A procedure for fabricating a heat transfer device similar to that depicted in  is illustrated  and A to C.","In , a deformable pliable sheet A of a polymer or some other material is provided along with a mold .

A follower  is also provided to assist sheet A in contouring to surface A. After suction is applied to draw air in the direction of arrow L and follower  is simultaneously moved downwardly in the direction of arrow T, sheet A contours to inner surface A in the manner illustrated in B and a pan A is formed.","In , pan A includes bottom A, includes elongate, parallel spaced apart inset edges A and B, and includes elongate, parallel, spaced apart outer edges A and A.","In , follower  has been removed and nozzle  is utilized to inject fluid into pan A to form a reservoir .","The module matrix A produced using the steps illustrated in  is inserted in pan A in .","In , a deformable pliable sheet A of a polymer or some other material is provided along with a mold .

After the module matrix A is inserted in pan A in the manner illustrated in , a layer A is applied to seal the fluid reservoirs ,  to complete the production of a heat transfer device in accordance with the invention. Layer A is continuously sealed to outer edges A and A.","If desired, module matrix A can be inserted in the pan A of  before each module A is charged with fluid to form reservoirs . Or, a auxiliary layer similar to layer A can be applied to module matrix A before matrix A is inserted in pan A. This auxiliary layer would seal fluid reservoirs  in the matrix A. After this sealed matrix A is inserted in pan A, then layer A is applied to seal matrix A and reservoir  in pan A.","As earlier discussed, the fluid in reservoirs  normally preferably has a different freezing tempering than the fluid in reservoir .","In , the fluid in pan  and the fluid in each module  to  has been omitted for the sake of clarity.
