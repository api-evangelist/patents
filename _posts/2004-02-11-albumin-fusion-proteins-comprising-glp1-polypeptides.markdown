Host cells transformed with the polynucleotides encoding therapeutic albumin fusion proteins are also encompassed by the invention, as are methods of making the albumin fusion proteins of the invention using these polynucleotides, and\/or host cells.","Human serum albumin (HSA, or HA), a protein of 585 amino acids in its mature form (as shown in  (SEQ ID NO:1038)), is responsible for a significant proportion of the osmotic pressure of serum and also functions as a carrier of endogenous and exogenous ligands. At present, HA for clinical use is produced by extraction from human blood. The production of recombinant HA (rHA) in microorganisms has been disclosed in EP 330 451 and EP 361 991.","Therapeutic proteins in their native state or when recombinantly produced, such as interferons and growth hormones, are typically labile molecules exhibiting short shelf-lives, particularly when formulated in aqueous solutions. The instability in these molecules when formulated for administration dictates that many of the molecules must be lyophilized and refrigerated at all times during storage, thereby rendering the molecules difficult to transport and\/or store. Storage problems are particularly acute when pharmaceutical formulations must be stored and dispensed outside of the hospital environment.","Few practical solutions to the storage problems of labile protein molecules have been proposed. Accordingly, there is a need for stabilized, long lasting formulations of proteinaceous therapeutic molecules that are easily dispensed, preferably with a simple formulation requiring minimal post-storage manipulation.","The present invention encompasses albumin fusion proteins comprising a Therapeutic protein (e.g., a polypeptide, antibody, or peptide, or fragment or variant thereof) fused to albumin or a fragment (portion) or variant of albumin.

Therapeutic proteins encompassed by the invention include but are not limited to, proteins, polypeptides, peptides, antibodies, and biologics. (The terms peptides, proteins, and polypeptides are used interchangeably herein.) It is specifically contemplated that the term \u201cTherapeutic protein\u201d encompasses antibodies and fragments and variants thereof.

In a further embodiment, the beta-1\/alpha D hybrid is fused wherein the N-terminal portion corresponds to amino acids 1\u201373 of interferon beta-1 and the C-terminal portion corresponds to amino acids 74\u2013167 of interferon alpha D. For example, this beta-1\/alpha D hybrid would comprise an amino acid sequence: MSYNLLGFLQRSSNFQCQKLLWQLNGRLEYCLKDRMNFDIPEEIKQLQQFQKEDAAL TIYEMLQNIFAIFRQDSSAAWDEDLLDKFCTELYQQLNDLEACVMQEERVGETPLMN XDSILAVKKYFRRITLYLTEKKYSPCAWEVVRAEIMRSLSLSTNLQERLRRKE (SEQ ID NO:2130), wherein X is A or V. These hybrids are further described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,758,428, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","In another embodiment, the interferon hybrid portion of the interferon hybrid albumin fusion protein comprises an interferon alpha-interferon beta hybrid (herein referred to as a alpha-beta hybrid). For example, the alpha-beta hybrid portion of the interferon hybrid albumin fusion protein consists, or alternatively comprises, of interferon alpha D (also referred to as interferon alpha-1) fused to interferon beta-1. In a further embodiment, the alpha D\/beta-1 hybrid is fused wherein the N-terminal portion corresponds to amino acids 1\u201373 of interferon alpha D and the C-terminal portion corresponds to amino acids 74\u2013166 of interferon beta-1.

These hybrids are further described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,758,428, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","In further embodiments, the interferon hybrid portion of the interferon hybrid albumin fusion proteins may comprise additional combinations of alpha-alpha interferon hybrids, alpha-beta interferon hybrids, and beta-alpha interferon hybrids. In additional embodiments, the interferon hybrid portion of the interferon hybrid albumin fusion protein may be modified to include mutations, substitutions, deletions, or additions to the amino acid sequence of the interferon hybrid. Such modifications to the interferon hybrid albumin fusion proteins may be made, for example, to improve levels of production, increase stability, increase or decrease activity, or confer new biological properties.","The above-described interferon hybrid albumin fusion proteins are encompassed by the invention, as are host cells and vectors containing polynucleotides encoding the polypeptides. In one embodiment, a interferon hybrid albumin fusion protein encoded by a polynucleotide as described above has extended shelf life. In an additional embodiment, a interferon hybrid albumin fusion protein encoded by a polynucleotide described above has a longer serum half-life and\/or more stabilized activity in solution (or in a pharmaceutical composition) in vitro and\/or in vivo than the corresponding unfused interferon hybrid molecule.","In another non-limiting example, a \u201cTherapeutic protein\u201d is a protein that has a biological activity, and in particular, a biological activity that is useful for treating, preventing or ameliorating a disease. A non-inclusive list of biological activities that may be possessed by a Therapeutic protein includes, enhancing the immune response, promoting angiogenesis, inhibiting angiogenesis, regulating endocrine function, regulating hematopoietic functions, stimulating nerve growth, enhancing an immune response, inhibiting an immune response, or any one or more of the biological activities described in the \u201cBiological Activities\u201d section below and\/or as disclosed for a given Therapeutic protein in Table 1 (column 2).","As used herein, \u201ctherapeutic activity\u201d or \u201cactivity\u201d may refer to an activity whose effect is consistent with a desirable therapeutic outcome in humans, or to desired effects in non-human mammals or in other species or organisms. Therapeutic activity may be measured in vivo or in vitro. For example, a desirable effect may be assayed in cell culture. As an example, when EPO is the Therapeutic protein, the effects of EPO on cell proliferation as described in Example 8 may be used as the endpoint for which therapeutic activity is measured. Such in vitro or cell culture assays are commonly available for many Therapeutic proteins as described in the art. Examples of assays include, but are not limited to those described herein in the Examples section or in the \u201cExemplary Activity-Assay\u201d column (column 3) of Table 1.","Therapeutic proteins corresponding to a Therapeutic protein portion of an albumin fusion protein of the invention, such as cell surface and secretory proteins, are often modified by the attachment of one or more oligosaccharide groups. The modification, referred to as glycosylation, can dramatically affect the physical properties of proteins and can be important in protein stability, secretion, and localization. Glycosylation occurs at specific locations along the polypeptide backbone. There are usually two major types of glycosylation: glycosylation characterized by O-linked oligosaccharides, which are attached to serine or threonine residues; and glycosylation characterized by N-linked oligosaccharides, which are attached to asparagine residues in an Asn-X-Ser or Asn-X-Thr sequence, where X can be any amino acid except proline. N-acetylneuramic acid (also known as sialic acid) is usually the terminal residue of both N-linked and 0-linked oligosaccharides. Variables such as protein structure and cell type influence the number and nature of the carbohydrate units within the chains at different glycosylation sites. Glycosylation isomers are also common at the same site within a given cell type.","For example, several types of human interferon are glycosylated. Natural human interferon-\u03b12 is O-glycosylated at threonine 106, and N-glycosylation occurs at asparagine 72 in interferon-\u03b114 (Adolf et al., J. Biochem 276:511 (1991); Nyman T A et al., J. Biochem 329:295 (1998)). The oligosaccharides at asparagine 80 in natural interferon-\u03b21\u03b1 may play an important factor in the solubility and stability of the protein, but may not be essential for its biological activity. This permits the production of an unglycosylated analog (interferon-\u03b21b) engineered with sequence modifications to enhance stability (Hosoi et al., J. Interferon Res. 8:375 (1988; Karpusas et al., Cell Mol Life Sci 54:1203 (1998); Knight, J. Interferon Res. 2:421 (1982); Runkel et al., Pharm Res 15:641 (1998); Lin, Dev. Biol. Stand. 96:97 (1998)). Interferon-\u03b3 contains two N-linked oligosaccharide chains at positions 25 and 97, both important for the efficient formation of the bioactive recombinant protein, and having an influence on the pharmacokinetic properties of the protein (Sareneva et al., Eur. J. Biochem 242:191 (1996); Sareneva et al. Biochem J. 303:831 (1994); Sareneva et al., J. Interferon Res. 13:267 (1993)). Mixed O-linked and N-linked glycosylation also occurs, for example in human erythropoietin, N-linked glycosylation occurs at asparagine residues located at positions 24, 38 and 83 while O-linked glycosylation occurs at a serine residue located at position 126 (Lai et al., J. Biol. Chem. 261:3116 (1986); Broudy et al., Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 265:329 (1988)).","Glycosylation of EPO albumin fusion proteins may influence the activity and\/or stability of the EPO albumin fusion proteins. The EPO portion of the albumin fusion protein may contain 3 N-linked sites for glycosylation, each of which can carry one tetra-antennary structure. When the EPO albumin fusion protein is glycosylated, the half-life of the molecule may be increased. In one embodiment, the EPO albumin fusion protein is glycosylated. In another embodiment, the EPO albumin fusion protein is hyperglycosylated.","One type of sugar commonly found in oligosaccharides is sialic acid. Each tetra-antennary structure of the N-linked glycosylation sites of EPO may carry four sialic acid residues. Accordingly, in a preferred embodiment, the EPO albumin fusion protein is glycosylated with a carbohydrate group containing sialic acid. In an additional embodiment, the EPO albumin fusion protein comprises a fully sialylated EPO protein containing four sialic acid residues per tetra-antennerary structure per site with a molar ratio of sialic acid to protein 12:1 or greater. In alternative embodiments, the EPO albumin fusion protein comprises a hypersialylated EPO protein wherein one, two, or three sialic acid residues are attached at each tetra-antennerary structure per site with a molar ratio of sialic acid to protein less than 12:1.","Two types of sialic acid that may be used in the sialylation of the EPO albumin fusion protein are N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) or N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc). In a preferred embodiment, hypersialylated EPO albumin fusion proteins contain Neu5Ac. More preferably, the total sialic acid content of hypersialylated EPO albumin fusion proteins is at least 97% Neu5Ac. Most preferred are EPO albumin fusion protein structures with little or no Neu5Gc.","Preferably, the albumin EPO fusion protein has at least 4 moles of sialylation, and more preferably, at least 8\u20139 moles of sialylation. An additional embodiment comprises an albumin EPO fusion protein with 4 moles of sialylation, 5 moles of sialylation, 6 moles of sialylation, 7 moles of sialylation, 8\u20139 moles of sialylation, 8 moles of sialylation, 9 moles of sialylation, 10 moles of sialylation, 11 moles of sialylation, or 12 moles of sialylation.","The degree of sialylation of a protein changes the charge of the protein and its retention time on a chromatography column. Therefore, certain chromatography steps used in the purification process may be used to monitor or enrich for hypersialylated EPO albumin fusion proteins. In a preferred embodiment, the amount of sialylation may be monitored by HPLC chromatography. In an additional embodiment, steps in the purification process of EPO albumin fusions may be used to enrich for hypersialylated EPO albumin fusion proteins. In a preferred embodiment the purification steps that may be used to enrich for hypersialylated EPO albumin fusion proteins comprise the butyl-sepharose FF purification step to remove virus particles by high ammonium salt and the hydroxyapatite chromatography at pH 6.8 for the final purification step.","Therapeutic proteins corresponding to a Therapeutic protein portion of an albumin fusion protein of the invention, as well as analogs and variants thereof, may be modified so that glycosylation at one or more sites is altered as a result of manipulation(s) of their nucleic acid sequence, by the host cell in which they are expressed, or due to other conditions of their expression. For example, glycosylation isomers may be produced by abolishing or introducing glycosylation sites, e.g., by substitution or deletion of amino acid residues, such as substitution of glutamine for asparagine, or unglycosylated recombinant proteins may be produced by expressing the proteins in host cells that will not glycosylate them, e.g. in or glycosylation-deficient yeast. These approaches are described in more detail below and are known in the art.","Therapeutic proteins, particularly those disclosed in Table 1, and their nucleic acid and amino acid sequences are well known in the art and available in public databases such as Chemical Abstracts Services Databases (e.g., the CAS Registry), GenBank, and subscription provided databases such as GenSeq (e.g., Derwent). Exemplary nucleotide sequences of Therapeutic proteins which may be used to derive a polynucleotide of the invention are shown in column 7, \u201cSEQ ID NO:X,\u201d of Table 2. Sequences shown as SEQ ID NO:X may be a wild type polynucleotide sequence encoding a given Therapeutic protein (e.g., either full length or mature), or in some instances the sequence may be a variant of said wild type polynucleotide sequence (e.g., a polynucleotide which encodes the wild type Therapeutic protein, wherein the DNA sequence of said polynucleotide has been optimized, for example, for expression in a particular species; or a polynucleotide encoding a variant of the wild type Therapeutic protein (i.e., a site directed mutant; an allelic variant)). It is well within the ability of the skilled artisan to use the sequence shown as SEQ ID NO:X to derive the construct described in the same row. For example, if SEQ ID NO:X corresponds to a full length protein, but only a portion of that protein is used to generate the specific CID, it is within the skill of the art to rely on molecular biology techniques, such as PCR, to amplify the specific fragment and clone it into the appropriate vector.","Additional Therapeutic proteins corresponding to a Therapeutic protein portion of an albumin fusion protein of the invention include, but are not limited to, one or more of the Therapeutic proteins or peptides disclosed in the \u201cTherapeutic Protein X\u201d column of Table 1 (column 1), or fragment or variable thereof.","Table 1 provides a non-exhaustive list of Therapeutic proteins that correspond to a Therapeutic protein portion of an albumin fusion protein of the invention, or an albumin fusion protein encoded by a polynucleotide of the invention. The first column, \u201cTherapeutic Protein X,\u201d discloses Therapeutic protein molecules that may be followed by parentheses containing scientific and brand names of proteins that comprise, or alternatively consist of, that Therapeutic protein molecule or a fragment or variant thereof. \u201cTherapeutic protein X\u201d as used herein may refer either to an individual Therapeutic protein molecule, or to the entire group of Therapeutic proteins associated with a given Therapeutic protein molecule disclosed in this column. The \u201cBiological activity\u201d column (column 2) describes Biological activities associated with the Therapeutic protein molecule. Column 3, \u201cExemplary Activity Assay,\u201d provides references that describe assays which may be used to test the therapeutic and\/or biological activity of a Therapeutic protein:X or an albumin fusion protein comprising a Therapeutic protein X (or fragment thereof) portion.

The first column, \u201cFusion No.\u201d gives a fusion number to each polynucleotide. Column 2, \u201cConstruct ID\u201d provides a unique numerical identifier for each polynucleotide of the invention. The Construct IDs may be used to identify polynucleotides which encode albumin fusion proteins comprising, or alternatively consisting of, a Therapeutic protein portion corresponding to a given Therapeutic Protein:X listed in the corresponding row of Table 1 wherein that Construct ID is listed in column 5. The \u201cConstruct Name\u201d column (column 3) provides the name of a given albumin fusion construct or polynucleotide.","The fourth column in Table 2, \u201cDescription\u201d provides a general description of a given albumin fusion construct, and the fifth column, \u201cExpression Vector\u201d lists the vector into which a polynucleotide comprising, or alternatively consisting of, a nucleic acid molecule encoding a given albumin fusion protein was cloned. Vectors are known in the art, and are available commercially or described elsewhere. For example, as described in the Examples, an \u201cexpression cassette\u201d comprising, or alternatively consisting of, one or more of (1) a polynucleotide encoding a given albumin fusion protein, (2) a leader sequence, (3) a promoter region, and (4) a transcriptional terminator, may be assembled in a convenient cloning vector and subsequently be moved into an alternative vector, such as, for example, an expression vector including, for example, a yeast expression vector or a mammalian expression vector. In one embodiment, for expression in , an expression cassette comprising, or alternatively consisting of, a nucleic acid molecule encoding an albumin fusion protein is cloned into pSAC35. In another embodiment, for expression in CHO cells, an expression cassette comprising, or alternatively consisting of, a nucleic acid molecule encoding an albumin fusion protein is cloned into pC4. In a further embodiment, a polynucleotide comprising or alternatively consisting of a nucleic acid molecule encoding the Therapeutic protein portion of an albumin fusion protein is cloned into pC4:HSA. In a still further embodiment, for expression in NS0 cells, an expression cassette comprising, or alternatively consisting of, a nucleic acid molecule encoding an albumin fusion protein is cloned into pEE12. Other useful cloning and\/or expression vectors will be known to the skilled artisan and are within the scope of the invention.","Column 6, \u201cSEQ ID NO:Y,\u201d provides the full length amino acid sequence of the albumin fusion protein of the invention. In most instances, SEQ ID NO:Y shows the unprocessed form of the albumin fusion protein encoded\u2014in other words, SEQ ID NO:Y shows the signal sequence, a HSA portion, and a therapeutic portion all encoded by the particular construct. Specifically contemplated by the present invention are all polynucleotides that encode SEQ ID NO:Y. When these polynucleotides are used to express the encoded protein from a cell, the cell's natural secretion and processing steps produces a protein that lacks the signal sequence listed in columns 4 and\/or 11 of Table 2. The specific amino acid sequence of the listed signal sequence is shown later in the specification or is well known in the art. Thus, most preferred embodiments of the present invention include the albumin fusion protein produced by a cell (which would lack the leader sequence shown in columns 4 and\/or 11 of Table 2). Also most preferred are polypeptides comprising SEQ ID NO:Y without the specific leader sequence listed in columns 4 and\/or 11 of Table 2. Compositions comprising these two preferred embodiments, including pharmaceutical compositions, are also preferred. Moreover, it is well within the ability of the skilled artisan to replace the signal sequence listed in columns 4 and\/or 11 of Table 2 with a different signal sequence, such as those described later in the specification to facilitate secretion of the processed albumin fusion protein.","The seventh column, \u201cSEQ ID NO:X,\u201d provides the parent nucleic acid sequence from which a polynucleotide encoding a Therapeutic protein portion of a given albumin fusion protein may be derived. In one embodiment, the parent nucleic acid sequence from which a polynucleotide encoding a Therapeutic protein portion of an albumin fusion protein may be derived comprises the wild type gene sequence encoding a Therapeutic protein shown in Table 1. In an alternative embodiment, the parent nucleic acid sequence from which a polynucleotide encoding a Therapeutic protein portion of an albumin fusion protein may be derived comprises a variant or derivative of a wild type gene sequence encoding a Therapeutic protein shown in Table 1, such as, for example, a synthetic codon optimized variant of a wild type gene sequence encoding a Therapeutic protein.","The eighth column, \u201cSEQ ID NO:Z,\u201d provides a predicted translation of the parent nucleic acid sequence (SEQ ID NO:X). This parent sequence can be a full length parent protein used to derive the particular construct, the mature portion of a parent protein, a variant or fragment of a wildtype protein, or an artificial sequence that can be used to create the described construct. One of skill in the art can use this amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:Z to determine which amino acid residues of an albumin fusion protein encoded by a given construct are provided by the therapeutic protein. Moreover, it is well within the ability of the skilled artisan to use the sequence shown as SEQ ID NO:Z to derive the construct described in the same row. For example, if SEQ ID NO:Z corresponds to a full length protein, but only a portion of that protein is used to generate the specific CID, it is within the skill of the art to rely on molecular biology techniques, such as PCR, to amplify the specific fragment and clone it into the appropriate vector.","Amplification primers provided in columns 9 and 10, \u201cSEQ ID NO:A\u201d and \u201cSEQ ID NO:B\u201d respectively, are exemplary primers used to generate a polynucleotide comprising or alternatively consisting of a nucleic acid molecule encoding the Therapeutic protein portion of a given albumin fusion protein. In one embodiment of the invention, oligonucleotide primers having the sequences shown in columns 9 and\/or 10 (SEQ ID NOS:A and\/or B) are used to PCR amplify a polynucleotide encoding the Therapeutic protein portion of an albumin fusion protein using a nucleic acid molecule comprising or alternatively consisting of the nucleotide sequence provided in column 7 (SEQ ID NO:X) of the corresponding row as the template DNA.

Further polypeptides encompassed by the invention are polypeptides encoded by polynucleotides which hybridize to the complement of a nucleic acid molecule encoding an albumin fusion protein of the invention under stringent hybridization conditions (e.g., hybridization to filter bound DNA in 6\u00d7 Sodium chloride\/Sodium citrate (SSC) at about 45 degrees Celsius, followed by one or more washes in 0.2\u00d7SSC, 0.1% SDS at about 50\u201365 degrees Celsius), under highly stringent conditions (e.g., hybridization to filter bound DNA in 6\u00d7 sodium chloride\/Sodium citrate (SSC) at about 45 degrees Celsius, followed by one or more washes in 0.1\u00d7SSC, 0.2% SDS at about 68 degrees Celsius), or under other stringent hybridization conditions which are known to those of skill in the art (see, for example, Ausubel, F. M. et al., eds., 1989 , Green publishing associates, Inc., and John Wiley & Sons Inc., New York, at pages 6.3.1\u20136.3.6 and 2.10.3). Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention.","By a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence at least, for example, 95% \u201cidentical\u201d to a query amino acid sequence, it is intended that the amino acid sequence of the subject polypeptide is identical to the query sequence except that the subject polypeptide sequence may include up to five amino acid alterations per each 100 amino acids of the query amino acid sequence. In other words, to obtain a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence at least 95% identical to a query amino acid sequence, up to 5% of the amino acid residues in the subject sequence may be inserted, deleted, or substituted with another amino acid. These alterations of the reference sequence may occur at the amino- or carboxy-terminal positions of the reference amino acid sequence or anywhere between those terminal positions, interspersed either individually among residues in the reference sequence or in one or more contiguous groups within the reference sequence.","As a practical matter, whether any particular polypeptide is at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% identical to, for instance, the amino acid sequence of an albumin fusion protein of the invention or a fragment thereof (such as a Therapeutic protein portion of the albumin fusion protein or an albumin portion of the albumin fusion protein), can be determined conventionally using known computer programs. A preferred method for determining the best overall match between a query sequence (a sequence of the present invention) and a subject sequence, also referred to as a global sequence alignment, can be determined using the FASTDB computer program based on the algorithm of Brutlag et al. (Comp. App. Biosci. 6:237\u2013245 (1990)). In a sequence alignment the query and subject sequences are either both nucleotide sequences or both amino acid sequences. The result of said global sequence alignment is expressed as percent identity. Preferred parameters used in a FASTDB amino acid alignment are: Matrix=PAM 0, k-tuple=2, Mismatch Penalty=1, Joining Penalty=20, Randomization Group Length=0, Cutoff Score=1, Window Size=sequence length, Gap Penalty=5, Gap Size Penalty=0.05, Window Size=500 or the length of the subject amino acid sequence, whichever is shorter.","If the subject sequence is shorter than the query sequence due to N- or C-terminal deletions, not because of internal deletions, a manual correction must be made to the results. This is because the FASTDB program does not account for N- and C-terminal truncations of the subject sequence when calculating global percent identity. For subject sequences truncated at the N- and C-termini, relative to the query sequence, the percent identity is corrected by calculating the number of residues of the query sequence that are N- and C-terminal of the subject sequence, which are not matched\/aligned with a corresponding subject residue, as a percent of the total bases of the query sequence. Whether a residue is matched\/aligned is determined by results of the FASTDB sequence alignment. This percentage is then subtracted from the percent identity, calculated by the above FASTDB program using the specified parameters, to arrive at a final percent identity score. This final percent identity score is what is used for the purposes of the present invention. Only residues to the N- and C-termini of the subject sequence, which are not matched\/aligned with the query sequence, are considered for the purposes of manually adjusting the percent identity score. That is, only query residue positions outside the farthest N- and C-terminal residues of the subject sequence.","For example, a 90 amino acid residue subject sequence is aligned with a 100 residue query sequence to determine percent identity. The deletion occurs at the N-terminus of the subject sequence and therefore, the FASTDB alignment does not show a matching\/alignment of the first 10 residues at the N-terminus. The 10 unpaired residues represent 10% of the sequence (number of residues at the N- and C-termini not matched\/total number of residues in the query sequence) so 10% is subtracted from the percent identity score calculated by the FASTDB program. If the remaining 90 residues were perfectly matched the final percent identity would be 90%. In another example, a 90 residue subject sequence is compared with a 100 residue query sequence. This time the deletions are internal deletions so there are no residues at the N- or C-termini of the subject sequence which are not matched\/aligned with the query. In this case the percent identity calculated by FASTDB is not manually corrected. Once again, only residue positions outside the N- and C-terminal ends of the subject sequence, as displayed in the FASTDB alignment, which are not matched\/aligned with the query sequence are manually corrected for. No other manual corrections are to made for the purposes of the present invention.","The variant will usually have at least 75% (preferably at least about 80%, 90%, 95% or 99%) sequence identity with a length of normal HA or Therapeutic protein which is the same length as the variant. Homology or identity at the nucleotide or amino acid sequence level is determined by BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) analysis using the algorithm employed by the programs blastp, blastn, blastx, tblastn and tblastx (Karlin et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87: 2264\u20132268 (1990) and Altschul, J. Mol. Evol. 36: 290\u2013300 (1993), fully incorporated by reference) which are tailored for sequence similarity searching.","The approach used by the BLAST program is to first consider similar segments between a query sequence and a database sequence, then to evaluate the statistical significance of all matches that are identified and finally to summarize only those matches which satisfy a preselected threshold of significance. For a discussion of basic issues in similarity searching of sequence databases, see Altschul et al., (Nature Genetics 6: 119\u2013129 (1994)) which is fully incorporated by reference. The search parameters for histogram, descriptions, alignments, expect (i.e., the statistical significance threshold for reporting matches against database sequences), cutoff, matrix and filter are at the default settings. The default scoring matrix used by blastp, blastx, tblastn, and tblastx is the BLOSUM62 matrix (Henikoff et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89: 10915\u201310919 (1992), fully incorporated by reference). For blastn, the scoring matrix is set by the ratios of M (i.e., the reward score for a pair of matching residues) to N (i.e., the penalty score for mismatching residues), wherein the default values for M and N are 5 and \u22124, respectively. Four blastn parameters may be adjusted as follows: Q=10 (gap creation penalty); R=10 (gap extension penalty); wink=1 (generates word hits at every winkposition along the query); and gapw=16 (sets the window width within which gapped alignments are generated). The equivalent Blastp parameter settings were Q=9; R=2; wink=1; and gapw=32. A Bestfit comparison between sequences, available in the GCG package version 10.0, uses DNA parameters GAP=50 (gap creation penalty) and LEN=3 (gap extension penalty) and the equivalent settings in protein comparisons are GAP=8 and LEN=2.","The polynucleotide variants of the invention may contain alterations in the coding regions, non-coding regions, or both. Especially preferred are polynucleotide variants containing alterations which produce silent substitutions, additions, or deletions, but do not alter the properties or activities of the encoded polypeptide. Nucleotide variants produced by silent substitutions due to the degeneracy of the genetic code are preferred. Moreover, polypeptide variants in which less than 50, less than 40, less than 30, less than 20, less than 10, or 5\u201350, 5\u201325, 5\u201310, 1\u20135, or 1\u20132 amino acids are substituted, deleted, or added in any combination are also preferred. Polynucleotide variants can be produced for a variety of reasons, e.g., to optimize codon expression for a particular host (change codons in the human mRNA to those preferred by a bacterial host, such as, yeast or ).","In a preferred embodiment, a polynucleotide of the invention which encodes the albumin portion of an albumin fusion protein is optimized for expression in yeast or mammalian cells. In a further preferred embodiment, a polynucleotide of the invention which encodes the Therapeutic protein portion of an albumin fusion protein is optimized for expression in yeast or mammalian cells. In a still further preferred embodiment, a polynucleotide encoding an albumin fusion protein of the invention is optimized for expression in yeast or mammalian cells.","In an alternative embodiment, a codon optimized polynucleotide which encodes a Therapeutic protein portion of an albumin fusion protein does not hybridize to the wild type polynucleotide encoding the Therapeutic protein under stringent hybridization conditions as described herein. In a further embodiment, a codon optimized polynucleotide which encodes an albumin portion of an albumin fusion protein does not hybridize to the wild type polynucleotide encoding the albumin protein under stringent hybridization conditions as described herein. In another embodiment, a codon optimized polynucleotide which encodes an albumin fusion protein does not hybridize to the wild type polynucleotide encoding the Therapeutic protein portion or the albumin protein portion under stringent hybridization conditions as described herein.","In an additional embodiment, a polynucleotide which encodes a Therapeutic protein portion of an albumin fusion protein does not comprise, or alternatively consist of, the naturally occurring sequence of that Therapeutic protein. In a further embodiment, a polynucleotide which encodes an albumin protein portion of an albumin fusion protein does not comprise, or alternatively consist of, the naturally occurring sequence of albumin protein. In an alternative embodiment, a polynucleotide which encodes an albumin fusion protein does not comprise, or alternatively consist of, the naturally occurring sequence of a Therapeutic protein portion or the albumin protein portion.","Naturally occurring variants are called \u201callelic variants,\u201d and refer to one of several alternate forms of a gene occupying a given locus on a chromosome of an organism. (Genes II, Lewin, B., ed., John Wiley & Sons, New York (1985)). These allelic variants can vary at either the polynucleotide and\/or polypeptide level and are included in the present invention. Alternatively, non-naturally occurring variants may be produced by mutagenesis techniques or by direct synthesis.","Using known methods of protein engineering and recombinant DNA technology, variants may be generated to improve or alter the characteristics of the polypeptides of the present invention. For instance, one or more amino acids can be deleted from the N-terminus or C-terminus of the polypeptide of the present invention without substantial loss of biological function. As an example, Ron et al. (J. Biol. Chem. 268: 2984\u20132988 (1993)) reported variant KGF proteins having heparin binding activity even after deleting 3, 8, or 27 amino-terminal amino acid residues. Similarly, Interferon gamma exhibited up to ten times higher activity after deleting 8\u201310 amino acid residues from the carboxy terminus of this protein. (Dobeli et al., J. Biotechnology 7:199\u2013216 (1988).)","Moreover, ample evidence demonstrates that variants often retain a biological activity similar to that of the naturally occurring protein. For example, Gayle and coworkers (J. Biol. Chem. 268:22105\u201322111 (1993)) conducted extensive mutational analysis of human cytokine IL-1a. They used random mutagenesis to generate over 3,500 individual IL-1a mutants that averaged 2.5 amino acid changes per variant over the entire length of the molecule. Multiple mutations were examined at every possible amino acid position. The investigators found that \u201c[m]ost of the molecule could be altered with little effect on either [binding or biological activity].\u201d In fact, only 23 unique amino acid sequences, out of more than 3,500 nucleotide sequences examined, produced a protein that significantly differed in activity from wild-type.","Furthermore, even if deleting one or more amino acids from the N-terminus or C-terminus of a polypeptide results in modification or loss of one or more biological functions, other biological activities may still be retained. For example, the ability of a deletion variant to induce and\/or to bind antibodies which recognize the secreted form will likely be retained when less than the majority of the residues of the secreted form are removed from the N-terminus or C-terminus. Whether a particular polypeptide lacking N- or C-terminal residues of a protein retains such immunogenic activities can readily be determined by routine methods described herein and otherwise known in the art.","Thus, the invention further includes polypeptide variants which have a functional activity (e.g., biological activity and\/or therapeutic activity). In one embodiment, the invention provides variants of albumin fusion proteins that have a functional activity (e.g., biological activity and\/or therapeutic activity) that corresponds to one or more biological and\/or therapeutic activities of the Therapeutic protein corresponding to the Therapeutic protein portion of the albumin fusion protein. In another embodiment, the invention provides variants of albumin fusion proteins that have a functional activity (e.g., biological activity and\/or therapeutic activity) that corresponds to one or more biological and\/or therapeutic activities of the Therapeutic protein corresponding to the Therapeutic protein portion of the albumin fusion protein. Such variants include deletions, insertions, inversions, repeats, and substitutions selected according to general rules known in the art so as have little effect on activity. Polynucleotides encoding such variants are also encompassed by the invention.","In preferred embodiments, the variants of the invention have conservative substitutions. By \u201cconservative substitutions\u201d is intended swaps within groups such as replacement of the aliphatic or hydrophobic amino acids Ala, Val, Leu and Ile; replacement of the hydroxyl residues Ser and Thr; replacement of the acidic residues Asp and Glu; replacement of the amide residues Asn and Gln, replacement of the basic residues Lys, Arg, and His; replacement of the aromatic residues Phe, Tyr, and Trp, and replacement of the small-sized amino acids Ala, Ser, Thr, Met, and Gly.","Guidance concerning how to make phenotypically silent amino acid substitutions is provided, for example, in Bowie et al., \u201cDeciphering the Message in Protein Sequences: Tolerance to Amino Acid Substitutions,\u201d Science 247:1306\u20131310 (1990), wherein the authors indicate that there are two main strategies for studying the tolerance of an amino acid sequence to change.","The first strategy exploits the tolerance of amino acid substitutions by natural selection during the process of evolution. By comparing amino acid sequences in different species, conserved amino acids can be identified. These conserved amino acids are likely important for protein function. In contrast, the amino acid positions where substitutions have been tolerated by natural selection indicates that these positions are not critical for protein function. Thus, positions tolerating amino acid substitution could be modified while still maintaining biological activity of the protein.","The second strategy uses genetic engineering to introduce amino acid changes at specific positions of a cloned gene to identify regions critical for protein function. For example, site directed mutagenesis or alanine-scanning mutagenesis (introduction of single alanine mutations at every residue in the molecule) can be used. See Cunningham and Wells, Science 244:1081\u20131085 (1989). The resulting mutant molecules can then be tested for biological activity.","As the authors state, these two strategies have revealed that proteins are surprisingly tolerant of amino acid substitutions. The authors further indicate which amino acid changes are likely to be permissive at certain amino acid positions in the protein. For example, most buried (within the tertiary structure of the protein) amino acid residues require nonpolar side chains, whereas few features of surface side chains are generally conserved. Moreover, tolerated conservative amino acid substitutions involve replacement of the aliphatic or hydrophobic amino acids Ala, Val, Leu and Ile; replacement of the hydroxyl residues Ser and Thr; replacement of the acidic residues Asp and Glu; replacement of the amide residues Asn and Gln, replacement of the basic residues Lys, Arg, and His; replacement of the aromatic residues Phe, Tyr, and Trp, and replacement of the small-sized amino acids Ala, Ser, Thr, Met, and Gly. Besides conservative amino acid substitution, variants of the present invention include (i) polypeptides containing substitutions of one or more of the non-conserved amino acid residues, where the substituted amino acid residues may or may not be one encoded by the genetic code, or (ii) polypeptides containing substitutions of one or more of the amino acid residues having a substituent group, or (iii) polypeptides which have been fused with or chemically conjugated to another compound, such as a compound to increase the stability and\/or solubility of the polypeptide (for example, polyethylene glycol), (iv) polypeptide containing additional amino acids, such as, for example, an IgG Fc fusion region peptide. Such variant polypeptides are deemed to be within the scope of those skilled in the art from the teachings herein.","For example, polypeptide variants containing amino acid substitutions of charged amino acids with other charged or neutral amino acids may produce proteins with improved characteristics, such as less aggregation. Aggregation of pharmaceutical formulations both reduces activity and increases clearance due to the aggregate's immunogenic activity. See Pinckard et al., Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2:331\u2013340 (1967); Robbins et al., Diabetes 36: 838\u2013845 (1987); Cleland et al., Crit. Rev. Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems 10:307\u2013377 (1993).","In specific embodiments, the polypeptides of the invention comprise, or alternatively, consist of, fragments or variants of the amino acid sequence of an albumin fusion protein, the amino acid sequence of a Therapeutic protein and\/or human serum albumin, wherein the fragments or variants have 1\u20135, 5\u201310, 5\u201325, 5\u201350, 10\u201350 or 50\u2013150, amino acid residue additions, substitutions, and\/or deletions when compared to the reference amino acid sequence. In preferred embodiments, the amino acid substitutions are conservative. Nucleic acids encoding these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention.","The polypeptide of the present invention can be composed of amino acids joined to each other by peptide bonds or modified peptide bonds, i.e., peptide isosteres, and may contain amino acids other than the 20 gene-encoded amino acids. The polypeptides may be modified by either natural processes, such as post-translational processing, or by chemical modification techniques which are well known in the art. Such modifications are well described in basic texts and in more detailed monographs, as well as in a voluminous research literature. Modifications can occur anywhere in a polypeptide, including the peptide backbone, the amino acid side-chains and the amino or carboxyl termini. It will be appreciated that the same type of modification may be present in the same or varying degrees at several sites in a given polypeptide. Also, a given polypeptide may contain many types of modifications. Polypeptides may be branched, for example, as a result of ubiquitination, and they may be cyclic, with or without branching. Cyclic, branched, and branched cyclic polypeptides may result from posttranslation natural processes or may be made by synthetic methods. Modifications include acetylation, acylation, ADP-ribosylation, amidation, covalent attachment of flavin, covalent attachment of a heme moiety, covalent attachment of a nucleotide or nucleotide derivative, covalent attachment of a lipid or lipid derivative, covalent attachment of phosphotidylinositol, cross-linking, cyclization, disulfide bond formation, demethylation, formation of covalent cross-links, formation of cysteine, formation of pyroglutamate, formylation, gamma-carboxylation, glycosylation, GPI anchor formation, hydroxylation, iodination, methylation, myristylation, oxidation, pegylation, proteolytic processing, phosphorylation, prenylation, racemization, selenoylation, sulfation, transfer-RNA mediated addition of amino acids to proteins such as arginylation, and ubiquitination.

Sci. 663:48\u201362 (1992)).","Functional Activity","\u201cA polypeptide having functional activity\u201d refers to a polypeptide capable of displaying one or more known functional activities associated with the full-length, pro-protein, and\/or mature form of a Therapeutic protein. Such functional activities include, but are not limited to, biological activity, antigenicity [ability to bind (or compete with a polypeptide for binding) to an anti-polypeptide antibody], immunogenicity (ability to generate antibody which binds to a specific polypeptide of the invention), ability to form multimers with polypeptides of the invention, and ability to bind to a receptor or ligand for a polypeptide.","\u201cA polypeptide having biological activity\u201d refers to a polypeptide exhibiting activity similar to, but not necessarily identical to, an activity of a Therapeutic protein of the present invention, including mature forms, as measured in a particular biological assay, with or without dose dependency. In the case where dose dependency does exist, it need not be identical to that of the polypeptide, but rather substantially similar to the dose-dependence in a given activity as compared to the polypeptide of the present invention (i.e., the candidate polypeptide will exhibit greater activity or not more than about 25-fold less and, preferably, not more than about tenfold less activity, and most preferably, not more than about three-fold less activity relative to the polypeptide of the present invention).","In preferred embodiments, an albumin fusion protein of the invention has at least one biological and\/or therapeutic activity associated with the Therapeutic protein portion (or fragment or variant thereof) when it is not fused to albumin.","The albumin fusion proteins of the invention can be assayed for functional activity (e.g., biological activity) using or routinely modifying assays known in the art, as well as assays described herein. Additionally, one of skill in the art may routinely assay fragments of a Therapeutic protein corresponding to a Therapeutic protein portion of an albumin fusion protein, for activity using assays referenced in its corresponding row of Table 1 (e.g., in column 3 of Table 1). Further, one of skill in the art may routinely assay fragments of an albumin protein corresponding to an albumin protein portion of an albumin fusion protein, for activity using assays known in the art and\/or as described in the Examples section below.","For example, in one embodiment where one is assaying for the ability of an albumin fusion protein to bind or compete with a Therapeutic protein for binding to an anti-Therapeutic polypeptide antibody and\/or anti-albumin antibody, various immunoassays known in the art can be used, including but not limited to, competitive and non-competitive assay systems using techniques such as radioimmunoassays, ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay), \u201csandwich\u201d immunoassays, immunoradiometric assays, gel diffusion precipitation reactions, immunodiffusion assays, in situ immunoassays (using colloidal gold, enzyme or radioisotope labels, for example), western blots, precipitation reactions, agglutination assays (e.g., gel agglutination assays, hemagglutination assays), complement fixation assays, immunofluorescence assays, protein A assays, and immunoelectrophoresis assays, etc. In one embodiment, antibody binding is detected by detecting a label on the primary antibody. In another embodiment, the primary antibody is detected by detecting binding of a secondary antibody or reagent to the primary antibody. In a further embodiment, the secondary antibody is labeled. Many means are known in the art for detecting binding in an immunoassay and are within the scope of the present invention.","In a preferred embodiment, where a binding partner (e.g., a receptor or a ligand) of a Therapeutic protein is identified, binding to that binding partner by an albumin fusion protein which comprises that Therapeutic protein as the Therapeutic protein portion of the fusion can be assayed, e.g., by means well-known in the art, such as, for example, reducing and non-reducing gel chromatography, protein affinity chromatography, and affinity blotting. See generally, Phizicky et al., Microbiol. Rev. 59:94\u2013123 (1995). In another embodiment, the ability of physiological correlates of an albumin fusion protein to bind to a substrate(s) of the Therapeutic polypeptide corresponding to the Therapeutic protein portion of the fusion can be routinely assayed using techniques known in the art.","In an alternative embodiment, where the ability of an albumin fusion protein to multimerize is being evaluated, association with other components of the multimer can be assayed, e.g., by means well-known in the art, such as, for example, reducing and non-reducing gel chromatography, protein affinity chromatography, and affinity blotting. See generally, Phizicky et al., supra.","In preferred embodiments, an albumin fusion protein comprising all or a portion of an antibody that binds a Therapeutic protein, has at least one biological and\/or therapeutic activity (e.g., to specifically bind a polypeptide or epitope) associated with the antibody that binds a Therapeutic protein (or fragment or variant thereof) when it is not fused to albumin. In other preferred embodiments, the biological activity and\/or therapeutic activity of an albumin fusion protein comprising all or a portion of an antibody that binds a Therapeutic protein is the inhibition (i.e., antagonism) or activation (i.e., agonism) of one or more of the biological activities and\/or therapeutic activities associated with the polypeptide that is specifically bound by antibody that binds a Therapeutic protein.","Albumin fusion proteins comprising at least a fragment or variant of an antibody that binds a Therapeutic protein may be characterized in a variety of ways.

In ELISAs the albumin fusion protein does not have to be conjugated to a detectable compound; instead, a second antibody (which recognizes albumin fusion protein) conjugated to a detectable compound may be added to the well. Further, instead of coating the well with the antigen, the albumin fusion protein may be coated to the well. In this case, the detectable molecule could be the antigen conjugated to a detectable compound such as an enzymatic substrate (e.g., horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase).

Such fragments may be of 10 or more amino acids in length or may include about 15, 20, 25, 30, 50, or more contiguous amino acids from the HA sequence or may include part or all of specific domains of HA. For instance, one or more fragments of HA spanning the first two immunoglobulin-like domains may be used. In a preferred embodiment, the HA fragment is the mature form of HA.","The albumin portion of the albumin fusion proteins of the invention may be a variant of normal HA. The Therapeutic protein portion of the albumin fusion proteins of the invention may also be variants of the Therapeutic proteins as described herein.

Thus an albumin fusion protein of the invention may contain at least a fragment or variant of a Therapeutic protein, and\/or at least a fragment or variant of an antibody that binds a Therapeutic protein.","Antibody Structure and Background","The basic antibody structural unit is known to comprise a tetramer. Each tetramer is composed of two identical pairs of polypeptide chains, each pair having one \u201clight\u201d (about 25 kDa) and one \u201cheavy\u201d chain (about 50\u201370 kDa). The amino-terminal portion of each chain includes a variable region f about 100 to 110 or more amino acids primarily responsible for antigen recognition. The carboxy-terminal portion of each chain defines a constant region primarily responsible for effector function. Human light chains are classified as kappa and lambda light chains. Heavy chains are classified as mu, delta, gamma, alpha, or epsilon, and define the antibody's isotype as IgM, IgD, IgG, IgA, and IgE, respectively. See generally, Chapters 3\u20135 (Paul, W., ed., 4th ed. Raven Press, N.Y. (1998)) (incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes). The variable regions of each light\/heavy chain pair form the antibody binding site.","Thus, an intact IgG antibody has two binding sites. Except in bifunctional or bispecific antibodies, the two binding sites are the same.","The chains all exhibit the same general structure of relatively conserved framework regions (FR) joined by three hypervariable regions, also called complementarity determining regions or CDRs. The CDR regions, in general, are the portions of the antibody which make contact with the antigen and determine its specificity. The CDRs from the heavy and the light chains of each pair are aligned by the framework regions, enabling binding to a specific epitope. From N-terminal to C-terminal, both light and heavy chains variable regions comprise the domains FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3 and FR4. The variable regions are connected to the heavy or light chain constant region. The assignment of amino acids to each domain is in accordance with the definitions of Kabat (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1987 and 1991)), or Chothia & Lesk J . 196:901\u2013917 (1987); Chothia et al. 342:878\u2013883 (1989).","As used herein, \u201cantibody\u201d refers to immunoglobulin molecules and immunologically active portions of immunoglobulin molecules, i.e., molecules that contain an antigen binding site that specifically binds an antigen (e.g., a molecule containing one or more CDR regions of an antibody). Antibodies that may correspond to a Therapeutic protein portion of an albumin fusion protein include, but are not limited to, monoclonal, multispecific, human, humanized or chimeric antibodies, single chain antibodies (e.g., single chain Fvs), Fab fragments, F(ab\u2032) fragments, fragments produced by a Fab expression library, anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) antibodies (including, e.g., anti-Id antibodies specific to antibodies of the invention), and epitope-binding fragments of any of the above (e.g., VH domains, VL domains, or one or more CDR regions).","Antibodies that Bind Therapeutic Proteins","The present invention encompasses albumin fusion proteins that comprise at least a fragment or variant of an antibody that binds a Therapeutic Protein (e.g., as disclosed in Table 1) or fragment or variant thereof.","Antibodies that bind a Therapeutic protein (or fragment or variant thereof) may be from any animal origin, including birds and mammals.

For example, monoclonal antibodies can be produced using hybridoma techniques including those known in the art and taught, for example, in Harlow et al., Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2nd ed. 1988); Hammerling, et al., in: Monoclonal Antibodies and T-Cell Hybridomas 563\u2013681 (Elsevier, N.Y., 1981) (said references incorporated by reference in their entireties). The term \u201cmonoclonal antibody\u201d as used herein is not limited to antibodies produced through hybridoma technology. The term \u201cmonoclonal antibody\u201d refers to an antibody that is derived from a single clone, including any eukaryotic, prokaryotic, or phage clone, and not the method by which it is produced.","Methods for producing and screening for specific antibodies using hybridoma technology are routine and well known in the art. In a non-limiting example, mice can be immunized with a Therapeutic protein or fragment or variant thereof, an albumin fusion protein, or a cell expressing such a Therapeutic protein or fragment or variant thereof or albumin fusion protein. Once an immune response is detected, e.g., antibodies specific for the antigen are detected in the mouse serum, the mouse spleen is harvested and splenocytes isolated. The splenocytes are then fused by well known techniques to any suitable myeloma cells, for example cells from cell line SP20 available from the ATCC. Hybridomas are selected and cloned by limited dilution. The hybridoma clones are then assayed by methods known in the art for cells that secrete antibodies capable of binding a polypeptide of the invention. Ascites fluid, which generally contains high levels of antibodies, can be generated by immunizing mice with positive hybridoma clones.","Accordingly, the present invention provides methods of generating monoclonal antibodies as well as antibodies produced by the method comprising culturing a hybridoma cell secreting an antibody wherein, preferably, the hybridoma is generated by fusing splenocytes isolated from a mouse immunized with an antigen of the invention with myeloma cells and then screening the hybridomas resulting from the fusion for hybridoma clones that secrete an antibody able to bind a polypeptide of the invention.","Another well known method for producing both polyclonal and monoclonal human B cell lines is transformation using Epstein Barr Virus (EBV). Protocols for generating EBV-transformed B cell lines are commonly known in the art, such as, for example, the protocol outlined in Chapter 7.22 of Current Protocols in Immunology, Coligan et al., Eds., 1994, John Wiley & Sons, NY, which is hereby incorporated in its entirety by reference. The source of B cells for transformation is commonly human peripheral blood, but B cells for transformation may also be derived from other sources including, but not limited to, lymph nodes, tonsil, spleen, tumor tissue, and infected tissues. Tissues are generally made into single cell suspensions prior to EBV transformation. Additionally, steps may be taken to either physically remove or inactivate T cells (e.g., by treatment with cyclosporin A) in B cell-containing samples, because T cells from individuals seropositive for anti-EBV antibodies can suppress B cell immortalization by EBV.","In general, the sample containing human B cells is innoculated with EBV, and cultured for 3\u20134 weeks. A typical source of EBV is the culture supernatant of the B95-8 cell line (ATCC #VR-1492). Physical signs of EBV transformation can generally be seen towards the end of the 3\u20134 week culture period. By phase-contrast microscopy, transformed cells may appear large, clear, hairy and tend to aggregate in tight clusters of cells. Initially, EBV lines are generally polyclonal. However, over prolonged periods of cell cultures, EBV lines may become monoclonal or polyclonal as a result of the selective outgrowth of particular B cell clones. Alternatively, polyclonal EBV transformed lines may be subcloned (e.g., by limiting dilution culture) or fused with a suitable fusion partner and plated at limiting dilution to obtain monoclonal B cell lines. Suitable fusion partners for EBV transformed cell lines include mouse myeloma cell lines (e.g., SP2\/0, X63-Ag8.653), heteromyeloma cell lines (human x mouse; e.g, SPAM-8, SBC-H20, and CB-F7), and human cell lines (e.g., GM 1500, SKO-007, RPMI 8226, and KR-4). Thus, the present invention also provides a method of generating polyclonal or monoclonal human antibodies against polypeptides of the invention or fragments thereof, comprising EBV-transformation of human B cells.","Antibody fragments which recognize specific epitopes may be generated by known techniques. For example, Fab and F(ab\u2032)2 fragments of the invention may be produced by proteolytic cleavage of immunoglobulin molecules, using enzymes such as papain (to produce Fab fragments) or pepsin (to produce F(ab\u2032)2 fragments). F(ab\u2032)2 fragments contain the variable region, the light chain constant region and the CH1 domain of the heavy chain.","For example, antibodies that bind to a Therapeutic protein can also be generated using various phage display methods known in the art. In phage display methods, functional antibody domains are displayed on the surface of phage particles which carry the polynucleotide sequences encoding them. In a particular embodiment, such phage can be utilized to display antigen binding domains expressed from a repertoire or combinatorial antibody library (e.g., human or murine). Phage expressing an antigen binding domain that binds the antigen of interest can be selected or identified with antigen, e.g., using labeled antigen or antigen bound or captured to a solid surface or bead. Phage used in these methods are typically filamentous phage including fd and M13 binding domains expressed from phage with Fab, Fv or disulfide stabilized Fv antibody domains recombinantly fused to either the phage gene III or gene VIII protein. Examples of phage display methods that can be used to make antibodies that bind to a Therapeutic protein include those disclosed in Brinkman et al., J. Immunol. Methods 182:41\u201350 (1995); Ames et al., J. Immunol. Methods 184:177\u2013186 (1995); Kettleborough et al., Eur. J.

For example, techniques to recombinantly produce Fab, Fab\u2032 and F(ab\u2032)2 fragments can also be employed using methods known in the art such as those disclosed in PCT publication WO 92\/22324; Mullinax et al., BioTechniques 12(6):864\u2013869 (1992); and Sawai et al., AJRI 34:26\u201334 (1995); and Better et al., Science 240:1041\u20131043 (1988) (said references incorporated by reference in their entireties).","Examples of techniques which can be used to produce single-chain Fvs and antibodies include those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,946,778 and 5,258,498; Huston et al., Methods in Enzymology 203:46\u201388 (1991); Shu et al., PNAS 90:7995\u20137999 (1993); and Skerra et al., Science 240:1038\u20131040 (1988). For some uses, including in vivo use of antibodies in humans and in vitro detection assays, it may be preferable to use chimeric, humanized, or human antibodies. A chimeric antibody is a molecule in which different portions of the antibody are derived from different animal species, such as antibodies having a variable region derived from a murine monoclonal antibody and a human immunoglobulin constant region. Methods for producing chimeric antibodies are known in the art. See e.g., Morrison, Science 229:1202 (1985); Oi et al., BioTechniques 4:214 (1986); Gillies et al., (1989) J. Immunol. Methods 125:191\u2013202; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,807,715; 4,816,567; and 4,816,397, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Humanized antibodies are antibody molecules from non-human species antibody that binds the desired antigen having one or more complementarity determining regions (CDRs) from the non-human species and a framework regions from a human immunoglobulin molecule. Often, framework residues in the human framework regions will be substituted with the corresponding residue from the CDR donor antibody to alter, preferably improve, antigen binding. These framework substitutions are identified by methods well known in the art, e.g., by modeling of the interactions of the CDR and framework residues to identify framework residues important for antigen binding and sequence comparison to identify unusual framework residues at particular positions. (See, e.g., Queen et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,585,089; Riechmann et al., Nature 332:323 (1988), which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.) Antibodies can be humanized using a variety of techniques known in the art including, for example, CDR-grafting (EP 239,400; PCT publication WO 91\/09967; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,225,539; 5,530,101; and 5,585,089), veneering or resurfacing (EP 592,106; EP 519,596; Padlan, Molecular Immunology 28(4\/5):489\u2013498 (1991); Studnicka et al., Protein Engineering 7(6):805\u2013814 (1994); Roguska. et al., PNAS 91:969\u2013973 (1994)), and chain shuffling (U.S. Pat. No. 5,565,332).","Completely human antibodies are particularly desirable for therapeutic treatment of human patients. Human antibodies can be made by a variety of methods known in the art including phage display methods described above using antibody libraries derived from human immunoglobulin sequences. See also, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,444,887 and 4,716,111; and PCT publications WO 98\/46645, WO 98\/50433, WO 98\/24893, WO 98\/16654, WO 96\/34096, WO 96\/33735, and WO 91\/10741; each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","Human antibodies can also be produced using transgenic mice which are incapable of expressing functional endogenous immunoglobulins, but which can express human immunoglobulin genes. For example, the human heavy and light chain immunoglobulin gene complexes may be introduced randomly or by homologous recombination into mouse embryonic stem cells. Alternatively, the human variable region, constant region, and diversity region may be introduced into mouse embryonic stem cells in addition to the human heavy and light chain genes. The mouse heavy and light chain immunoglobulin genes may be rendered non-functional separately or simultaneously with the introduction of human immunoglobulin loci by homologous recombination. In particular, homozygous deletion of the JH region prevents endogenous antibody production. The modified embryonic stem cells are expanded and microinjected into blastocysts to produce chimeric mice. The chimeric mice are then bred to produce homozygous offspring which express human antibodies. The transgenic mice are immunized in the normal fashion with a selected antigen, e.g., all or a portion of a polypeptide of the invention. Monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen can be obtained from the immunized, transgenic mice using conventional hybridoma technology. The human immunoglobulin transgenes harbored by the transgenic mice rearrange during B cell differentiation, and subsequently undergo class switching and somatic mutation. Thus, using such a technique, it is possible to produce therapeutically useful IgG, IgA, IgM and IgE antibodies. For an overview of this technology for producing human antibodies, see Lonberg and Huszar, Int. Rev. Immunol. 13:65\u201393 (1995). For a detailed discussion of this technology for producing human antibodies and human monoclonal antibodies and protocols for producing such antibodies, see, e.g., PCT publications WO 98\/24893; WO 92\/01047; WO 96\/34096; WO 96\/33735; European Patent No. 0 598 877; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,413,923; 5,625,126; 5,633,425; 5,569,825; 5,661,016; 5,545,806; 5,814,318; 5,885,793; 5,916,771; 5,939,598; 6,075,181; and 6,114,598, which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. In addition, companies such as Abgenix, Inc. (Freemont, Calif.) and Genpharm (San Jose, Calif.) can be engaged to provide human antibodies directed against a selected antigen using technology similar to that described above.","Completely human antibodies which recognize a selected epitope can be generated using a technique referred to as \u201cguided selection.\u201d In this approach a selected non-human monoclonal antibody, e.g., a mouse antibody, is used to guide the selection of a completely human antibody recognizing the same epitope. (Jespers et al., Bio\/technology 12:899\u2013903 (1988)).","Polynucleotides Encoding Antibodies","The invention further provides polynucleotides comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding an antibody and fragments thereof. The invention also encompasses polynucleotides that hybridize under stringent or alternatively, under lower stringency hybridization conditions, e.g., as defined supra, to polynucleotides that encode an antibody, preferably, that specifically binds to a Therapeutic protein, and more preferably, an antibody that binds to a polypeptide having the amino acid sequence of a \u201cTherapeutic protein:X\u201d as disclosed in the \u201cSEQ ID NO:Z\u201d column of Table 2.","The polynucleotides may be obtained, and the nucleotide sequence of the polynucleotides determined, by any method known in the art. For example, if the nucleotide sequence of the antibody is known, a polynucleotide encoding the antibody may be assembled from chemically synthesized oligonucleotides (e.g., as described in Kutmeier et al., BioTechniques 17:242 (1994)), which, briefly, involves the synthesis of overlapping oligonucleotides containing portions of the sequence encoding the antibody, annealing and ligating of those oligonucleotides, and then amplification of the ligated oligonucleotides by PCR.","Alternatively, a polynucleotide encoding an antibody may be generated from nucleic acid from a suitable source. If a clone containing a nucleic acid encoding a particular antibody is not available, but the sequence of the antibody molecule is known, a nucleic acid encoding the immunoglobulin may be chemically synthesized or obtained from a suitable source (e.g., an antibody cDNA library, or a cDNA library generated from, or nucleic acid, preferably poly A+ RNA, isolated from, any tissue or cells expressing the antibody, such as hybridoma cells selected to express an antibody) by PCR amplification using synthetic primers hybridizable to the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 ends of the sequence or by cloning using an oligonucleotide probe specific for the particular gene sequence to identify, e.g., a cDNA clone from a cDNA library that encodes the antibody. Amplified nucleic acids generated by PCR may then be cloned into replicable cloning vectors using any method well known in the art (See Example 107).","Once the nucleotide sequence and corresponding amino acid sequence of the antibody is determined, the nucleotide sequence of the antibody may be manipulated using methods well known in the art for the manipulation of nucleotide sequences, e.g., recombinant DNA techniques, site directed mutagenesis, PCR, etc. (see, for example, the techniques described in Sambrook et al., 1990, Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, 2d Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. and Ausubel et al., eds., 1998, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, NY, which are both incorporated by reference herein in their entireties), to generate antibodies having a different amino acid sequence, for example to create amino acid substitutions, deletions, and\/or insertions.","In a specific embodiment, the amino acid sequence of the heavy and\/or light chain variable domains may be inspected to identify the sequences of the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) by methods that are well know in the art, e.g., by comparison to known amino acid sequences of other heavy and light chain variable regions to determine the regions of sequence hypervariability. Using routine recombinant DNA techniques, one or more of the CDRs may be inserted within framework regions, e.g., into human framework regions to humanize a non-human antibody, as described supra. The framework regions may be naturally occurring or consensus framework regions, and preferably human framework regions (see, e.g., Chothia et al., J. Mol. Biol. 278: 457\u2013479 (1998) for a listing of human framework regions). Preferably, the polynucleotide generated by the combination of the framework regions and CDRs encodes an antibody that specifically binds a polypeptide of the invention. Preferably, as discussed supra, one or more amino acid substitutions may be made within the framework regions, and, preferably, the amino acid substitutions improve binding of the antibody to its antigen. Additionally, such methods may be used to make amino acid substitutions or deletions of one or more variable region cysteine residues participating in an intrachain disulfide bond to generate antibody molecules lacking one or more intrachain disulfide bonds. Other alterations to the polynucleotide are encompassed by the present invention and within the skill of the art.","In addition, techniques developed for the production of \u201cchimeric antibodies\u201d (Morrison et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 81:851\u2013855 (1984); Neuberger et al., Nature 312:604\u2013608 (1984); Takeda et al., Nature 314:452\u2013454 (1985)) by splicing genes from a mouse antibody molecule of appropriate antigen specificity together with genes from a human antibody molecule of appropriate biological activity can be used. As described supra, a chimeric antibody is a molecule in which different portions are derived from different animal species, such as those having a variable region derived from a murine mAb and a human immunoglobulin constant region, e.g., humanized antibodies.","Alternatively, techniques described for the production of single chain antibodies (U.S. Pat. No. 4,946,778; Bird, Science 242:423\u201342 (1988); Huston et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:5879\u20135883 (1988); and Ward et al., Nature 334:544\u201354 (1989)) can be adapted to produce single chain antibodies. Single chain antibodies are formed by linking the heavy and light chain fragments of the Fv region via an amino acid bridge, resulting in a single chain polypeptide. Techniques for the assembly of functional Fv fragments in may also be used (Skerra et al., Science 242:1038\u20131041 (1988)).","Recombinant Expression of Antibodies","Recombinant expression of an antibody, or fragment, derivative or analog thereof, (e.g., a heavy or light chain of an antibody or a single chain antibody), requires construction of an expression vector containing a polynucleotide that encodes the antibody. Once a polynucleotide encoding an antibody molecule or a heavy or light chain of an antibody, or portion thereof (preferably containing the heavy or light chain variable domain), of the invention has been obtained, the vector for the production of the antibody molecule may be produced by recombinant DNA technology using techniques well known in the art. Thus, methods for preparing a protein by expressing a polynucleotide containing an antibody encoding nucleotide sequence are described herein. Methods which are well known to those skilled in the art can be used to construct expression vectors containing antibody coding sequences and appropriate transcriptional and translational control signals. These methods include, for example, in vitro recombinant DNA techniques, synthetic techniques, and in vivo genetic recombination. The invention, thus, provides replicable vectors comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding an antibody molecule of the invention, or a heavy or light chain thereof, or a heavy or light chain variable domain, operably linked to a promoter. Such vectors may include the nucleotide sequence encoding the constant region of the antibody molecule (see, e.g., PCT Publication WO 86\/05807; PCT Publication WO 89\/01036; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,122,464) and the variable domain of the antibody may be cloned into such a vector for expression of the entire heavy or light chain.","The expression vector is transferred to a host cell by conventional techniques and the transfected cells are then cultured by conventional techniques to produce an antibody. Thus, the invention includes host cells containing a polynucleotide encoding an antibody of the invention, or a heavy or light chain thereof, or a single chain antibody, operably linked to a heterologous promoter. In preferred embodiments for the expression of double-chained antibodies, vectors encoding both the heavy and light chains may be co-expressed in the host cell for expression of the entire immunoglobulin molecule, as detailed below.","A variety of host-expression vector systems may be utilized to express the antibody molecules of the invention. Such host-expression systems represent vehicles by which the coding sequences of interest may be produced and subsequently purified, but also represent cells which may, when transformed or transfected with the appropriate nucleotide coding sequences, express an antibody molecule of the invention in situ. These include but are not limited to microorganisms such as bacteria (e.g., ) transformed with recombinant bacteriophage DNA, plasmid DNA or cosmid DNA expression vectors containing antibody coding sequences; yeast (e.g., ) transformed with recombinant yeast expression vectors containing antibody coding sequences; insect cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors (e.g., baculovirus) containing antibody coding sequences; plant cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors (e.g., cauliflower mosaic virus, CaMV; tobacco mosaic virus, TMV) or transformed with recombinant plasmid expression vectors (e.g., Ti plasmid) containing antibody coding sequences; or mammalian cell systems (e.g., COS, CHO, BHK, 293, 3T3 cells) harboring recombinant expression constructs containing promoters derived from the genome of mammalian cells (e.g., metallothionein promoter) or from mammalian viruses (e.g., the adenovirus late promoter; the vaccinia virus 7.5K promoter). Preferably, bacterial cells such as , and more preferably, eukaryotic cells, especially for the expression of whole recombinant antibody molecule, are used for the expression of a recombinant antibody molecule. For example, mammalian cells such as Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO), in conjunction with a vector such as the major intermediate early gene promoter element from human cytomegalovirus is an effective expression system for antibodies (Foecking et al., Gene 45:101 (1986); Cockett et al., Bio\/Technology 8:2 (1990)).","In bacterial systems, a number of expression vectors may be advantageously selected depending upon the use intended for the antibody molecule being expressed. For example, when a large quantity of such a protein is to be produced, for the generation of pharmaceutical compositions of an antibody molecule, vectors which direct the expression of high levels of fusion protein products that are readily purified may be desirable. Such vectors include, but are not limited, to the expression vector pUR278 (Ruther et al., EMBO J. 2:1791 (1983)), in which the antibody coding sequence may be ligated individually into the vector in frame with the lac Z coding region so that a fusion protein is produced; pIN vectors (Inouye & Inouye, Nucleic Acids Res. 13:3101\u20133109 (1985); Van Heeke & Schuster, J. Biol. Chem. 24:5503\u20135509 (1989)); and the like. pGEX vectors may also be used to express foreign polypeptides as fusion proteins with glutathione S-transferase (GST). In general, such fusion proteins are soluble and can easily be purified from lysed cells by adsorption and binding to matrix glutathione-agarose beads followed by elution in the presence of free glutathione. The pGEX vectors are designed to include thrombin or factor Xa protease cleavage sites so that the cloned target gene product can be released from the GST moiety.","In an insect system, nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV) is used as a vector to express foreign genes. The virus grows in cells. The antibody coding sequence may be cloned individually into nonessential regions (for example the polyhedrin gene) of the virus and placed under control of an AcNPV promoter (for example the polyhedrin promoter).","In mammalian host cells, a number of viral-based expression systems may be utilized. In cases where an adenovirus is used as an expression vector, the antibody coding sequence of interest may be ligated to an adenovirus transcription\/translation control complex, e.g., the late promoter and tripartite leader sequence. This chimeric gene may then be inserted in the adenovirus genome by in vitro or in vivo recombination. Insertion in a nonessential region of the viral genome (e.g., region E1 or E3) will result in a recombinant virus that is viable and capable of expressing the antibody molecule in infected hosts. (e.g., see Logan & Shenk, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81:355\u2013359 (1984)). Specific initiation signals may also be required for efficient translation of inserted antibody coding sequences. These signals include the ATG initiation codon and adjacent sequences. Furthermore, the initiation codon must be in phase with the reading frame of the desired coding sequence to ensure translation of the entire insert. These exogenous translational control signals and initiation codons can be of a variety of origins, both natural and synthetic. The efficiency of expression may be enhanced by the inclusion of appropriate transcription enhancer elements, transcription terminators, etc. (see Bittner et al., Methods in Enzymol. 153:51\u2013544 (1987)).","In addition, a host cell strain may be chosen which modulates the expression of the inserted sequences, or modifies and processes the gene product in the specific fashion desired. Such modifications (e.g., glycosylation) and processing (e.g., cleavage) of protein products may be important for the function of the protein. Different host cells have characteristic and specific mechanisms for the post-translational processing and modification of proteins and gene products. Appropriate cell lines or host systems can be chosen to ensure the correct modification and processing of the foreign protein expressed. To this end, eukaryotic host cells which possess the cellular machinery for proper processing of the primary transcript, glycosylation, and phosphorylation of the gene product may be used. Such mammalian host cells include but are not limited to CHO, VERY, BHK, Hela, COS, MDCK, 293, 3T3, WI38, and in particular, breast cancer cell lines such as, for example, BT483, Hs578T, HTB2, BT20 and T47D, and normal mammary gland cell line such as, for example, CRL7030 and Hs578Bst.","For long-term, high-yield production of recombinant proteins, stable expression is preferred. For example, cell lines which stably express the antibody molecule may be engineered. Rather than using expression vectors which contain viral origins of replication, host cells can be transformed with DNA controlled by appropriate expression control elements (e.g., promoter, enhancer, sequences, transcription terminators, polyadenylation sites, etc.), and a selectable marker. Following the introduction of the foreign DNA, engineered cells may be allowed to grow for 1\u20132 days in an enriched media, and then are switched to a selective media. The selectable marker in the recombinant plasmid confers resistance to the selection and allows cells to stably integrate the plasmid into their chromosomes and grow to form foci which in turn can be cloned and expanded into cell lines. This method may advantageously be used to engineer cell lines which express the antibody molecule. Such engineered cell lines may be particularly useful in screening and evaluation of compounds that interact directly or indirectly with the antibody molecule.","A number of selection systems may be used, including but not limited to the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (Wigler et al., Cell 11:223 (1977)), hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (Szybalska & Szybalski, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 48:202 (1992)), and adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (Lowy et al., Cell 22:817 (1980)) genes can be employed in tk-, hgprt- or aprt-cells, respectively. Also, antimetabolite resistance can be used as the basis of selection for the following genes: dhfr, which confers resistance to methotrexate (Wigler et al., Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77:357 (1980); O'Hare et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 78:1527 (1981)); gpt, which confers resistance to mycophenolic acid (Mulligan & Berg, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 78:2072 (1981)); neo, which confers resistance to the aminoglycoside G-418 Clinical Pharmacy 12:488\u2013505; Wu and Wu, Biotherapy 3:87\u201395 (1991); Tolstoshev, Ann. Rev. Pharmacol.

Biochem. 62:191\u2013217 (1993); May, 1993, TIB TECH 11(5):155\u2013215 (1993)); and hygro, which confers resistance to hygromycin (Santerre et al., Gene 30:147 (1984)). Methods commonly known in the art of recombinant DNA technology may be routinely applied to select the desired recombinant clone, and such methods are described, for example, in Ausubel et al. (eds.), Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, NY (1993); Kriegler, Gene Transfer and Expression, A Laboratory Manual, Stockton Press, NY (1990); and in Chapters 12 and 13, Dracopoli et al. (eds), Current Protocols in Human Genetics, John Wiley & Sons, NY (1994); Colberre-Garapin et al., J. Mol. Biol. 150:1 (1981), which are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.","The expression levels of an antibody molecule can be increased by vector amplification (for a review, see Bebbington and Hentschel, The use of vectors based on gene amplification for the expression of cloned genes in mammalian cells in DNA cloning, Vol. 3. (Academic Press, New York, 1987)). When a marker in the vector system expressing antibody is amplifiable, increase in the level of inhibitor present in culture of host cell will increase the number of copies of the marker gene. Since the amplified region is associated with the antibody gene, production of the antibody will also increase (Crouse et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 3:257 (1983)).","Vectors which use glutamine synthase (GS) or DHFR as the selectable markers can be amplified in the presence of the drugs methionine sulphoximine or methotrexate, respectively. An advantage of glutamine synthase based vectors are the availability of cell lines (e.g., the murine myeloma cell line, NS0) which are glutamine synthase negative. Glutamine synthase expression systems can also function in glutamine synthase expressing cells (e.g. Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells) by providing additional inhibitor to prevent the functioning of the endogenous gene. A glutamine synthase expression system and components thereof are detailed in PCT publications: WO87\/04462; WO86\/05807; WO89\/01036; WO89\/10404; and WO91\/06657 which are incorporated in their entireties by reference herein. Additionally, glutamine synthase expression vectors that may be used according to the present invention are commercially available from suppliers, including, for example Lonza Biologics, Inc. (Portsmouth, N.H.). Expression and production of monoclonal antibodies using a GS expression system in murine myeloma cells is described in Bebbington et al., 10:169(1992) and in Biblia and Robinson . 11:1 (1995) which are incorporated in their entireties by reference herein.","The host cell may be co-transfected with two expression vectors of the invention, the first vector encoding a heavy chain derived polypeptide and the second vector encoding a light chain derived polypeptide. The two vectors may contain identical selectable markers which enable equal expression of heavy and light chain polypeptides. Alternatively, a single vector may be used which encodes, and is capable of expressing, both heavy and light chain polypeptides. In such situations, the light chain should be placed before the heavy chain to avoid an excess of toxic free heavy chain (Proudfoot, Nature 322:52 (1986); Kohler, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77:2197 (1980)). The coding sequences for the heavy and light chains may comprise cDNA or genomic DNA.","Once an antibody molecule of the invention has been produced by an animal, chemically synthesized, or recombinantly expressed, it may be purified by any method known in the art for purification of an immunoglobulin molecule, for example, by chromatography (e.g., ion exchange, affinity, particularly by affinity for the specific antigen after Protein A, and sizing column chromatography), centrifugation, differential solubility, or by any other standard technique for the purification of proteins. In addition, the antibodies that bind to a Therapeutic protein and that may correspond to a Therapeutic protein portion of an albumin fusion protein of the invention or fragments thereof can be fused to heterologous polypeptide sequences described herein or otherwise known in the art, to facilitate purification.","Modifications of Antibodies","Antibodies that bind a Therapeutic protein or fragments or variants can be fused to marker sequences, such as a peptide to facilitate purification. In preferred embodiments, the marker amino acid sequence is a hexa-histidine peptide, such as the tag provided in a pQE vector (QIAGEN, Inc., 9259 Eton Avenue, Chatsworth, Calif., 91311), among others, many of which are commercially available. As described in Gentz et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:821\u2013824 (1989), for instance, hexa-histidine provides for convenient purification of the fusion protein. Other peptide tags useful for purification include, but are not limited to, the hemagglutinin tag (also called the \u201cHA tag\u201d), which corresponds to an epitope derived from the influenza hemagglutinin protein (Wilson et al., Cell 37:767 (1984)) and the \u201cflag\u201d tag.","The present invention further encompasses antibodies or fragments thereof conjugated to a diagnostic or therapeutic agent. The antibodies can be used diagnostically to, for example, monitor the development or progression of a tumor as part of a clinical testing procedure to, e.g., determine the efficacy of a given treatment regimen. Detection can be facilitated by coupling the antibody to a detectable substance. Examples of detectable substances include various enzymes, prosthetic groups, fluorescent materials, luminescent materials, bioluminescent materials, radioactive materials, positron emitting metals using various positron emission tomographies, and nonradioactive paramagnetic metal ions. The detectable substance may be coupled or conjugated either directly to the antibody (or fragment thereof) or indirectly, through an intermediate (such as, for example, a linker known in the art) using techniques known in the art. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,741,900 for metal ions which can be conjugated to antibodies for use as diagnostics according to the present invention. Examples of suitable enzymes include horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, beta-galactosidase, or acetylcholinesterase; examples of suitable prosthetic group complexes include streptavidin\/biotin and avidin\/biotin; examples of suitable fluorescent materials include umbelliferone, fluorescein, fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine, dichlorotriazinylamine fluorescein, dansyl chloride or phycoerythrin; an example of a luminescent material includes luminol; examples of bioluminescent materials include luciferase, luciferin, and aequorin; and examples of suitable radioactive material include 125I, 131I, 111In or 99Tc. Other examples of detectable substances have been described elsewhere herein.","Further, an antibody of the invention may be conjugated to a therapeutic moiety such as a cytotoxin, e.g., a cytostatic or cytocidal agent, a therapeutic agent or a radioactive metal ion, e.g., alpha-emitters such as, for example, 213Bi. A cytotoxin or cytotoxic agent includes any agent that is detrimental to cells. Examples include paclitaxol, cytochalasin B, gramicidin D, ethidium bromide, emetine, mitomycin, etoposide, tenoposide, vincristine, vinblastine, colchicin, doxorubicin, daunorubicin, dihydroxy anthracin dione, mitoxantrone, mithramycin, actinomycin D, 1-dehydrotestosterone, glucocorticoids, procaine, tetracaine, lidocaine, propranolol, and puromycin and analogs or homologs thereof. Therapeutic agents include, but are not limited to, antimetabolites (e.g., methotrexate, 6-mercaptopurine, 6-thioguanine, cytarabine, 5-fluorouracil decarbazine), alkylating agents (e.g., mechlorethamine, thioepa chlorambucil, melphalan, carmustine (BSNU) and lomustine (CCNU), cyclothosphamide, busulfan, dibromomannitol, streptozotocin, mitomycin C, and cis-dichlorodiamine platinum (II) (DDP) cisplatin), anthracyclines (e.g., daunorubicin (formerly daunomycin) and doxorubicin), antibiotics (e.g., dactinomycin (formerly actinomycin), bleomycin, mithramycin, and anthramycin (AMC)), and anti-mitotic agents (e.g., vincristine and vinblastine).","The conjugates of the invention can be used for modifying a given biological response, the therapeutic agent or drug moiety is not to be construed as limited to classical chemical therapeutic agents. For example, the drug moiety may be a protein or polypeptide possessing a desired biological activity. Such proteins may include, for example, a toxin such as abrin, ricin A, pseudomonas exotoxin, or diphtheria toxin; a protein such as tumor necrosis factor, alpha-interferon, \u03b2-interferon, nerve growth factor, platelet derived growth factor, tissue plasminogen activator, an apoptotic agent, e.g., TNF-alpha, TNF-beta, AIM I (See, International Publication No. WO 97\/33899), AIM II (See, International Publication No. WO 97\/34911), Fas Ligand (Takahashi et al., ., 6:1567\u20131574 (1994)), VEGI (See, International Publication No. WO 99\/23105), a thrombotic agent or an anti-angiogenic agent, e.g., angiostatin or endostatin; or, biological response modifiers such as, for example, lymphokines, interleukin-1 (\u201cIL-1\u201d), interleukin-2 (\u201cIL-2\u201d), interleukin-6 (\u201cIL-6\u201d), granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (\u201cGM-CSF\u201d), granulocyte colony stimulating factor (\u201cG-CSF\u201d), or other growth factors.","Antibodies may also be attached to solid supports, which are particularly useful for immunoassays or purification of the target antigen. Such solid supports include, but are not limited to, glass, cellulose, polyacrylamide, nylon, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride or polypropylene.","Techniques for conjugating such therapeutic moiety to antibodies are well known.

Such assays are routine and well known in the art (see, e.g., Ausubel et al, eds, 1994, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vol. 1, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety). Exemplary immunoassays are described briefly below (but are not intended by way of limitation).","Immunoprecipitation protocols generally comprise lysing a population of cells in a lysis buffer such as RIPA buffer (1% NP-40 or Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.01 M sodium phosphate at pH 7.2, 1% Trasylol) supplemented with protein phosphatase and\/or protease inhibitors (e.g., EDTA, PMSF, aprotinin, sodium vanadate), adding an antibody of the invention or albumin fusion protein of the invention comprising at least a fragment or variant of an antibody that binds a Therapeutic protein (or fragment or variant thereof) to the cell lysate, incubating for a period of time (e.g., 1 to 4 hours) at 40 degrees C., adding protein A and\/or protein G sepharose beads (or beads coated with an appropriate anti-idiotypic antibody or anti-albumin antibody in the case when an albumin fusion protein comprising at least a fragment or variant of a Therapeutic antibody) to the cell lysate, incubating for about an hour or more at 40 degrees C., washing the beads in lysis buffer and resuspending the beads in SDS\/sample buffer. The ability of the antibody or albumin fusion protein of the invention to immunoprecipitate a particular antigen can be assessed by, e.g., western blot analysis. One of skill in the art would be knowledgeable as to the parameters that can be modified to increase the binding of the antibody or albumin fusion protein to an antigen and decrease the background (e.g., pre-clearing the cell lysate with sepharose beads). For further discussion regarding immunoprecipitation protocols see, e.g., Ausubel et al, eds, 1994, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vol. 1, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York at 10.16.1.","Western blot analysis generally comprises preparing protein samples, electrophoresis of the protein samples in a polyacrylamide gel (e.g., 8%\u201320% SDS-PAGE depending on the molecular weight of the antigen), transferring the protein sample from the polyacrylamide gel to a membrane such as nitrocellulose, PVDF or nylon, blocking the membrane in blocking solution (e.g., PBS with 3% BSA or non-fat milk), washing the membrane in washing buffer (e.g., PBS-Tween 20), applying the antibody or albumin fusion protein of the invention (diluted in blocking buffer) to the membrane, washing the membrane in washing buffer, applying a secondary antibody (which recognizes the albumin fusion protein, e.g., an anti-human serum albumin antibody) conjugated to an enzymatic substrate (e.g., horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase) or radioactive molecule (e.g., P or I) diluted in blocking buffer, washing the membrane in wash buffer, and detecting the presence of the antigen.

In ELISAs the antibody or albumin fusion protein does not have to be conjugated to a detectable compound; instead, a second antibody (which recognizes the antibody or albumin fusion protein, respectively) conjugated to a detectable compound may be added to the well. Further, instead of coating the well with the antigen, antibody or the albumin fusion protein may be coated to the well. In this case, the detectable molecule could be the antigen conjugated to a detectable compound such as an enzymatic substrate (e.g., horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase). One of skill in the art would be knowledgeable as to the parameters that can be modified to increase the signal detected as well as other variations of ELISAs known in the art.

The affinity of the antibody or albumin fusion protein of the invention for a specific protein, antigen, or epitope and the binding off-rates can be determined from the data by Scatchard plot analysis. Competition with a second protein that binds the same protein, antigen or epitope as the antibody or albumin fusion protein, can also be determined using radioimmunoassays. In this case, the protein, antigen or epitope is incubated with an antibody or albumin fusion protein of the invention conjugated to a labeled compound (e.g., H or I) in the presence of increasing amounts of an unlabeled second protein that binds the same protein, antigen, or epitope as the albumin fusion protein of the invention.","In a preferred embodiment, BLAcore kinetic analysis is used to determine the binding on and off rates of antibody or albumin fusion proteins of the invention to a protein, antigen or epitope.

In addition, it may be desirable to introduce the pharmaceutical compounds or compositions of the invention into the central nervous system by any suitable route, including intraventricular and intrathecal injection; intraventricular injection may be facilitated by an intraventricular catheter, for example, attached to a reservoir, such as an Ommaya reservoir. Pulmonary administration can also be employed, e.g., by use of an inhaler or nebulizer, and formulation with an aerosolizing agent.","In a specific embodiment, it may be desirable to administer the pharmaceutical compounds or compositions of the invention locally to the area in need of treatment; this may be achieved by, for example, and not by way of limitation, local infusion during surgery, topical application, e.g., in conjunction with a wound dressing after surgery, by injection, by means of a catheter, by means of a suppository, or by means of an implant, said implant being of a porous, non-porous, or gelatinous material, including membranes, such as sialastic membranes, or fibers. Preferably, when administering a protein, including an antibody, of the invention, care must be taken to use materials to which the protein does not absorb.","In another embodiment, the compound or composition can be delivered in a vesicle, in particular a liposome (see Langer, Science 249:1527\u20131533 (1990); Treat et al., in Liposomes in the Therapy of Infectious Disease and Cancer, Lopez-Berestein and Fidler (eds.), Liss, New York, pp. 353\u2013365 (1989); Lopez-Berestein, ibid., pp. 317\u2013327; see generally ibid.)","In yet another embodiment, the compound or composition can be delivered in a controlled release system. In one embodiment, a pump may be used (see Langer, supra; Sefton, CRC Crit. Ref. Biomed. Eng. 14:201 (1987); Buchwald et al., Surgery 88:507 (1980); Saudek et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 321:574 (1989)). In another embodiment, polymeric materials can be used (see Medical Applications of Controlled Release, Langer and Wise (eds.), CRC Pres., Boca Raton, Fla. (1974); Controlled Drug Bioavailability, Drug Product Design and Performance, Smolen and Ball (eds.), Wiley, New York (1984); Ranger and Peppas, J., Macromol. Sci. Rev. Macromol. Chem. 23:61 (1983); see also Levy et al., Science 228:190 (1985); During et al., Ann. Neurol. 25:351 (1989); Howard et al., J. Neurosurg. 71:105 (1989)). In yet another embodiment, a controlled release system can be placed in proximity of the therapeutic target, e.g., the brain, thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose (see, e.g., Goodson, in Medical Applications of Controlled Release, supra, vol. 2, pp. 115\u2013138 (1984)).","Other controlled release systems are discussed in the review by Langer (Science 249:1527\u20131533 (1990)).","In a specific embodiment where the compound of the invention is a nucleic acid encoding a protein, the nucleic acid can be administered in vivo to promote expression of its encoded protein, by constructing it as part of an appropriate nucleic acid expression vector and administering it so that it becomes intracellular, e.g., by use of a retroviral vector (see U.S. Pat. No. 4,980,286), or by direct injection, or by use of microparticle bombardment (e.g., a gene gun; Biolistic, Dupont), or coating with lipids or cell-surface receptors or transfecting agents, or by administering it in linkage to a homeobox-like peptide which is known to enter the nucleus (see e.g., Joliot et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88:1864\u20131868 (1991)), etc. Alternatively, a nucleic acid can be introduced intracellularly and incorporated within host cell DNA for expression, by homologous recombination.","The present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions. Such compositions comprise a therapeutically effective amount of a compound, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In a specific embodiment, the term \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable\u201d means approved by a regulatory agency-of the Federal or a state government or listed in the U.S. Pharmacopeia or other generally recognized pharmacopeia for use in animals, and more particularly in humans. The term \u201ccarrier\u201d refers to a diluent, adjuvant, excipient, or vehicle with which the therapeutic is administered. Such pharmaceutical carriers can be sterile liquids, such as water and oils, including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable or synthetic origin, such as peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil and the like. Water is a preferred carrier when the pharmaceutical composition is administered intravenously. Saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions can also be employed as liquid carriers, particularly for injectable solutions. Suitable pharmaceutical excipients include starch, glucose, lactose, sucrose, gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica gel, sodium stearate, glycerol monostearate, talc, sodium chloride, dried skim milk, glycerol, propylene, glycol, water, ethanol and the like. The composition, if desired, can also contain minor amounts of wetting or emulsifying agents, or pH buffering agents. These compositions can take the form of solutions, suspensions, emulsion, tablets, pills, capsules, powders, sustained-release formulations and the like. The composition can be formulated as a suppository, with traditional binders and carriers such as triglycerides. Oral formulation can include standard carriers such as pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharine, cellulose, magnesium carbonate, etc. Examples of suitable pharmaceutical carriers are described in \u201cRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences\u201d by E. W. Martin. Such compositions will contain a therapeutically effective amount of the compound, preferably in purified form, together with a suitable amount of carrier so as to provide the form for proper administration to the patient. The formulation should suit the mode of administration.","In a preferred embodiment, the composition is formulated in accordance with routine procedures as a pharmaceutical composition adapted for intravenous administration to human beings. Typically, compositions for intravenous administration are solutions in sterile isotonic aqueous buffer. Where necessary, the composition may also include a solubilizing agent and a local anesthetic such as lignocaine to ease pain at the site of the injection. Generally, the ingredients are supplied either separately or mixed together in unit dosage form, for example, as a dry lyophilized powder or water free concentrate in a hermetically sealed container such as an ampoule or sachette indicating the quantity of active agent. Where the composition is to be administered by infusion, it can be dispensed with an infusion bottle containing sterile pharmaceutical grade water or saline. Where the composition is administered by injection, an ampoule of sterile water for injection or saline can be provided so that the ingredients may be mixed prior to administration.","The compounds of the invention can be formulated as neutral or salt forms. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include those formed with anions such as those derived from hydrochloric, phosphoric, acetic, oxalic, tartaric acids, etc., and those formed with cations such as those derived from sodium, potassium, ammonium, calcium, ferric hydroxides, isopropylamine, triethylamine, 2-ethylamino ethanol, histidine, procaine, etc.","The amount of the compound of the invention which will be effective in the treatment, inhibition and prevention of a disease or disorder associated with aberrant expression and\/or activity of a Therapeutic protein can be determined by standard clinical techniques. In addition, in vitro assays may optionally be employed to help identify optimal dosage ranges. The precise dose to be employed in the formulation will also depend on the route of administration, and the seriousness of the disease or disorder, and should be decided according to the judgment of the practitioner and each patient's circumstances. Effective doses may be extrapolated from dose-response curves derived from in vitro or animal model test systems.","For antibodies, the dosage administered to a patient is typically 0.1 mg\/kg to 100 mg\/kg of the patient's body weight. Preferably, the dosage administered to a patient is between 0.1 mg\/kg and 20 mg\/kg of the patient's body weight, more preferably 1 mg\/kg to 10 mg\/kg of the patient's body weight. Generally, human antibodies have a longer half-life within the human body than antibodies from other species due to the immune response to the foreign polypeptides. Thus, lower dosages of human antibodies and less frequent administration is often possible. Further, the dosage and frequency of administration of antibodies of the invention may be reduced by enhancing uptake and tissue penetration (e.g., into the brain) of the antibodies by modifications such as, for example, lipidation.","Diagnosis and Imaging","Labeled antibodies and derivatives and analogs thereof that bind a Therapeutic protein (or fragment or variant thereof) (including albumin fusion proteins comprising at least a fragment or variant of an antibody that binds a Therapeutic protein), can be used for diagnostic purposes to detect, diagnose, or monitor diseases, disorders, and\/or conditions associated with the aberrant expression and\/or activity of Therapeutic protein. The invention provides for the detection of aberrant expression of a Therapeutic protein, comprising (a) assaying the expression of the Therapeutic protein in cells or body fluid of an individual using one or more antibodies specific to the polypeptide interest and (b) comparing the level of gene expression with a standard gene expression level, whereby an increase or decrease in the assayed Therapeutic protein expression level compared to the standard expression level is indicative of aberrant expression.","The invention provides a diagnostic assay for diagnosing a disorder, comprising (a) assaying the expression of the Therapeutic protein in cells or body fluid of an individual using one or more antibodies specific to the Therapeutic protein or albumin fusion proteins comprising at least a fragment of variant of an antibody specific to a Therapeutic protein, and (b) comparing the level of gene expression with a standard gene expression level, whereby an increase or decrease in the assayed Therapeutic protein gene expression level compared to the standard expression level is indicative of a particular disorder. With respect to cancer, the presence of a relatively high amount of transcript in biopsied tissue from an individual may indicate a predisposition for the development of the disease, or may provide a means for detecting the disease prior to the appearance of actual clinical symptoms. A more definitive diagnosis of this type may allow health professionals to employ preventative measures or aggressive treatment earlier thereby preventing the development or further progression of the cancer.","Antibodies of the invention or albumin fusion proteins comprising at least a fragment of variant of an antibody specific to a Therapeutic protein can be used to assay protein levels in a biological sample using classical immunohistological methods known to those of skill in the art (e.g., see Jalkanen et al., J. Cell. Biol. 101:976\u2013985 (1985); Jalkanen et al., J. Cell. Biol. 105:3087\u20133096 (1987)). Other antibody-based methods useful for detecting protein gene expression include immunoassays, such as the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the radioimmunoassay (RIA). Suitable antibody assay labels are known in the art and include enzyme labels, such as, glucose oxidase; radioisotopes, such as iodine (125I, 121I), carbon (14C), sulfur (35S), tritium (3H), indium (112In), and technetium (99Tc); luminescent labels, such as luminol; and fluorescent labels, such as fluorescein and rhodamine, and biotin.","One facet of the invention is the detection and diagnosis of a disease or disorder associated with aberrant expression of a Therapeutic protein in an animal, preferably a mammal and most preferably a human. In one embodiment, diagnosis comprises: a) administering (for example, parenterally, subcutaneously, or intraperitoneally) to a subject an effective amount of a labeled molecule which specifically binds to the polypeptide of interest; b) waiting for a time interval following the administering for permitting the labeled molecule to preferentially concentrate at sites in the subject where the Therapeutic protein is expressed (and for unbound labeled molecule to be cleared to background level); c) determining background level; and d) detecting the labeled molecule in the subject, such that detection of labeled molecule above the background level indicates that the subject has a particular disease or disorder associated with aberrant expression of the therapeutic protein. Background level can be determined by various methods including, comparing the amount of labeled molecule detected to a standard value previously determined for a particular system.","It will be understood in the art that the size of the subject and the imaging system used will determine the quantity of imaging moiety needed to produce diagnostic images. In the case of a radioisotope moiety, for a human subject, the quantity of radioactivity injected will normally range from about 5 to 20 millicuries of 99 mTc. The labeled antibody, antibody fragment, or albumin fusion protein comprising at least a fragment or variant of an antibody that binds a Therapeutic protein will then preferentially accumulate at the location of cells which contain the specific Therapeutic protein. In vivo tumor imaging is described in S. W. Burchiel et al., \u201cImmunopharmacokinetics of Radiolabeled Antibodies and Their Fragments.\u201d (Chapter 13 in Tumor Imaging: The Radiochemical Detection of Cancer, S. W. Burchiel and B. A. Rhodes, eds., Masson Publishing Inc. (1982)).","Depending on several variables, including the type of label used and the mode of administration, the time interval following the administration for permitting the labeled molecule to preferentially concentrate at sites in the subject and for unbound labeled molecule to be cleared to background level is 6 to 48 hours or 6 to 24 hours or 6 to 12 hours. In another embodiment the time interval following administration is 5 to 20 days or 5 to 10 days.","In an embodiment, monitoring of the disease or disorder is carried out by repeating the method for diagnosing the disease or disease, for example, one month after initial diagnosis, six months after initial diagnosis, one year after initial diagnosis, etc.","Presence of the labeled molecule can be detected in the patient using methods known in the art for in vivo scanning. These methods depend upon the type of label used. Skilled artisans will be able to determine the appropriate method for detecting a particular label. Methods and devices that may be used in the diagnostic methods of the invention include, but are not limited to, computed tomography (CT), whole body scan such as position emission tomography (PET), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and sonography.","In a specific embodiment, the molecule is labeled with a radioisotope and is detected in the patient using a radiation responsive surgical instrument (Thurston et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,441,050). In another embodiment, the molecule is labeled with a fluorescent compound and is detected in the patient using a fluorescence responsive scanning instrument. In another embodiment, the molecule is labeled with a positron emitting metal and is detected in the patent using positron emission-tomography. In yet another embodiment, the molecule is labeled with a paramagnetic label and is detected in a patient using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Antibodies that specifically detect the albumin fusion protein but not albumin or the therapeutic protein alone are a preferred embodiment. These can be used to detect the albumin fusion protein as described throughout the specification.","Kits","The present invention provides kits that can be used in the above methods. In one embodiment, a kit comprises an antibody, preferably a purified antibody, in one or more containers. In a specific embodiment, the kits of the present invention contain a substantially isolated polypeptide comprising an epitope which is specifically immunoreactive with an antibody included in the kit. Preferably, the kits of the present invention further comprise a control antibody which does not react with the polypeptide of interest. In another specific embodiment, the kits of the present invention contain a means for detecting the binding of an antibody to a polypeptide of interest (e.g., the antibody may be conjugated to a detectable substrate such as a fluorescent compound, an enzymatic substrate, a radioactive compound or a luminescent compound, or a second antibody which recognizes the first antibody may be conjugated to a detectable substrate).","In another specific embodiment of the present invention, the kit is a diagnostic kit for use in screening serum containing antibodies specific against proliferative and\/or cancerous polynucleotides and polypeptides. Such a kit may include a control antibody that does not react with the polypeptide of interest. Such a kit may include a substantially isolated polypeptide antigen comprising an epitope which is specifically immunoreactive with at least one anti-polypeptide antigen antibody. Further, such a kit includes means for detecting the binding of said antibody to the antigen (e.g., the antibody may be conjugated to a fluorescent compound such as fluorescein or rhodamine which can be detected by flow cytometry). In specific embodiments, the kit may include a recombinantly produced or chemically synthesized polypeptide antigen. The polypeptide antigen of the kit may also be attached to a solid support.","In a more specific embodiment the detecting means of the above-described kit includes a solid support to which said polypeptide antigen is attached. Such a kit may also include a non-attached reporter-labeled anti-human antibody. In this embodiment, binding of the antibody to the polypeptide antigen can be detected by binding of the said reporter-labeled antibody.","In an additional embodiment, the invention includes a diagnostic kit for use in screening serum containing antigens of the polypeptide of the invention. The diagnostic kit includes a substantially isolated antibody specifically immunoreactive with polypeptide or polynucleotide antigens, and means for detecting the binding of the polynucleotide or polypeptide antigen to the antibody. In one embodiment, the antibody is attached to a solid support. In a specific embodiment, the antibody may be a monoclonal antibody. The detecting means of the kit may include a second, labeled monoclonal antibody. Alternatively, or in addition, the detecting means may include a labeled, competing antigen.","In one diagnostic configuration, test serum is reacted with a solid phase reagent having a surface-bound antigen obtained by the methods of the present invention. After binding with specific antigen antibody to the reagent and removing unbound serum components by washing, the reagent is reacted with reporter-labeled anti-human antibody to bind reporter to the reagent in proportion to the amount of bound anti-antigen antibody on the solid support. The reagent is again washed to remove unbound labeled antibody, and the amount of reporter associated with the reagent is determined. Typically, the reporter is an enzyme which is detected by incubating the solid phase in the presence of a suitable fluorometric, luminescent or calorimetric substrate (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.).","The solid surface reagent in the above assay is prepared by known techniques for attaching protein material to solid support material, such as polymeric beads, dip sticks, 96-well plate or filter material. These attachment methods generally include non-specific adsorption of the protein to the support or covalent attachment of the protein, typically through a free amine group, to a chemically reactive group on the solid support, such as an activated carboxyl, hydroxyl, or aldehyde group. Alternatively, streptavidin coated plates can be used in conjunction with biotinylated antigen(s).","Thus, the invention provides an assay system or kit for carrying out this diagnostic method. The kit generally includes a support with surface-bound recombinant antigens, and a reporter-labeled anti-human antibody for detecting surface-bound anti-antigen antibody.","Albumin Fusion Proteins","The present invention relates generally to albumin fusion proteins and methods of treating, preventing, or ameliorating diseases or disorders. As used herein, \u201calbumin fusion protein\u201d refers to a protein formed by the fusion of at least one molecule of albumin (or a fragment or variant thereof) to at least one molecule of a Therapeutic protein (or fragment or variant thereof). An albumin fusion protein of the invention comprises at least a fragment or variant of a Therapeutic protein and at least a fragment or variant of human serum albumin, which are associated with one another, preferably by genetic fusion (i.e., the albumin fusion protein is generated by translation of a nucleic acid in which a polynucleotide encoding all or a portion of a Therapeutic protein is joined in-frame with a polynucleotide encoding all or a portion of albumin) or to one another. The Therapeutic protein and albumin protein, once part of the albumin fusion protein, may each be referred to as a \u201cportion\u201d, \u201cregion\u201d or \u201cmoiety\u201d of the albumin fusion protein.","In a preferred embodiment, the invention provides an albumin fusion protein encoded by a polynucleotide or albumin fusion construct described in Table 1 or Table 2. Polynucleotides encoding these albumin fusion proteins are also encompassed by the invention.","Preferred albumin fusion proteins of the invention, include, but are not limited to, albumin fusion proteins encoded by a nucleic acid molecule comprising, or alternatively consisting of, a polynucleotide encoding at least one molecule of albumin (or a fragment or variant thereof) joined in frame to at least one polynucleotide encoding at least one molecule of a Therapeutic protein (or fragment or variant thereof); a nucleic acid molecule comprising, or alternatively consisting of, a polynucleotide encoding at least one molecule of albumin (or a fragment or variant thereof) joined in frame to at least one polynucleotide encoding at least one molecule of a Therapeutic protein (or fragment or variant thereof) generated as described in Table 1, Table 2 or in the Examples; or a nucleic acid molecule comprising, or alternatively consisting of, a polynucleotide encoding at least one molecule of albumin (or a fragment or variant thereof) joined in frame to at least one polynucleotide encoding at least one molecule of a Therapeutic protein (or fragment or variant thereof), further comprising, for example, one or more of the following elements: (1) a functional self-replicating vector (including but not limited to, a shuttle vector, an expression vector, an integration vector, and\/or a replication system), (2) a region for initiation of transcription (e.g., a promoter region, such as for example, a regulatable or inducible promoter, a constitutive promoter), (3) a region for termination of transcription, (4) a leader sequence, and (5) a selectable marker.","In one embodiment, the invention provides an albumin fusion protein comprising, or alternatively consisting of, a Therapeutic protein (e.g., as described in Table 1) and a serum albumin protein. In other embodiments, the invention provides an albumin fusion protein comprising, or alternatively consisting of, a biologically active and\/or therapeutically active fragment of a Therapeutic protein and a serum albumin protein. In other embodiments, the invention provides an albumin fusion protein comprising, or alternatively consisting of, a biologically active and\/or therapeutically active variant of a Therapeutic protein and a serum albumin protein. In preferred embodiments, the serum albumin protein component of the albumin fusion protein is the mature portion of serum albumin.","In further embodiments, the invention provides an albumin fusion protein comprising, or alternatively consisting of, a Therapeutic protein, and a biologically active and\/or therapeutically active fragment of serum albumin. In further embodiments, the invention provides an albumin fusion protein comprising, or alternatively consisting of, a Therapeutic protein and a biologically active and\/or therapeutically active variant of serum albumin. In preferred embodiments, the Therapeutic protein portion of the albumin fusion protein is the mature portion of the Therapeutic protein.","In further embodiments, the invention provides an albumin fusion protein comprising, or alternatively consisting of, a biologically active and\/or therapeutically active fragment or variant of a Therapeutic protein and a biologically active and\/or therapeutically active fragment or variant of serum albumin. In preferred embodiments, the invention provides an albumin fusion protein comprising, or alternatively consisting of, the mature portion of a Therapeutic protein and the mature portion of serum albumin.","Preferably, the albumin fusion protein comprises HA as the N-terminal portion, and a Therapeutic protein as the C-terminal portion. Alternatively, an albumin fusion protein comprising HA as the C-terminal portion, and a Therapeutic protein as the N-terminal portion may also be used.","In other embodiments, the albumin fusion protein has a Therapeutic protein fused to both the N-terminus and the C-terminus of albumin. In a preferred embodiment, the Therapeutic proteins fused at the N- and C-termini are the same Therapeutic proteins. In an alternative preferred embodiment, the Therapeutic proteins fused at the N- and C-termini are different Therapeutic proteins. In another preferred embodiment, the Therapeutic proteins fused at the N- and C-termini are different Therapeutic proteins which may be used to treat or prevent the same or a related disease, disorder, or condition (e.g. as listed in the \u201cPreferred Indication Y\u201d column of Table 1). In another preferred embodiment, the Therapeutic proteins fused at the N- and C-termini are different Therapeutic proteins which may be used to treat, ameliorate, or prevent diseases or disorders (e.g. as listed in the \u201cPreferred Indication Y\u201d column of Table 1) which are known in the art to commonly occur in patients simultaneously, concurrently, or consecutively, or which commonly occur in patients in association with one another.","Exemplary fusion proteins of the invention containing multiple Therapeutic protein portions fused at the N- and C-termini of albumin include, but are not limited to, GCSF-HSA-EPO, EPO-HSA-GCSF, IFNalpha-HSA-IL2, IL2-HSA-IFNalpha, GCSF-HSA-IL2, IL2-HSA-GCSF, IL2-HSA-EPO, EPO-HSA-IL2, IL3-HSA-EPO, EPO-HSA-IL3, GCSF-HSA-GMCSF, GMCSF-HSA-GCSF, IL2-HSA-GMCSF, GMCSF-HSA-IL2, PTH-HSA-Calcitonin, Calcitonin-HSA-PTH, PTH-PTH-HSA-Calcitonin, Calcitonin-HSA-PTH-PTH, PTH-Calcitonin-HSA-PTH, or PTH-HSA-Calcitonin-PTH.","Albumin fusion proteins of the invention encompass proteins containing one, two, three, four, or more molecules of a given Therapeutic protein X or variant thereof fused to the N- or C-terminus of an albumin fusion protein of the invention, and\/or to the N- and\/or C-terminus of albumin or variant thereof. Molecules of a given Therapeutic protein X or variants thereof may be in any number of orientations, including, but not limited to, a \u2018head to head\u2019 orientation (e.g., wherein the N-terminus of one molecule of a Therapeutic protein X is fused to the N-terminus of another molecule of the Therapeutic protein X), or a \u2018head to tail\u2019 orientation (e.g., wherein the C-terminus of one molecule of a Therapeutic protein X is fused to the N-terminus of another molecule of Therapeutic protein X).","In one embodiment, one, two, three, or more tandemly oriented Therapeutic protein X polypeptides (or fragments or variants thereof) are fused to the N- or C-terminus of an albumin fusion protein of the invention, and\/or to the N- and\/or C-terminus of albumin or variant thereof.","In a specific embodiment, one, two, three, four, five, or more tandemly oriented molecules of PTH are fused to the N- or C-terminus of albumin or variant thereof. For example, one, two, three, four, five, or more tandemly oriented molecules of PTH (including, but not limited to, molecules of PTH comprising, or alternatively consisting of, amino acids 1 to 34) are fused to the N- or C-terminus of albumin or variant thereof. Exemplary fusion proteins of the invention containing multiple protein portions of PTH, include, but are not limited to, PTH-PTH-HSA, HSA-PTH-PTH, PTH-PTH-PTH-HSA, HSA-PTH-PTH-PTH, PTH-PTH-PTH-PTH-HSA, or HSA-PTH-PTH-PTH-PTH.","In another specific embodiment, one, two, three, four, five, or more tandemly oriented molecules of GLP-1 are fused to the N- or C-terminus of albumin or variant thereof. For example, one, two, three, four, five, or more tandemly oriented molecules of GLP-1 (including, but not limited to, molecules of GLP-1 comprising, or alternatively consisting of, amino acids 7 to 36, with residue 8 being mutated from an Alanine to a Glycine) (See for Example, the mutants disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,545,618, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety) are fused to the N- or C-terminus of albumin or variant thereof. Exemplary fusion proteins of the invention containing multiple protein portions of GLP-1, include, but are not limited to, GL1-GLP1-HSA, HSA-GLP1-GLP1, GLP1mutant-GLP1mutant-HSA, HSA-GLP1mutant-GLP1mutant, GLP1mutant-GLP1-HSA, HSA-GLP1mutant-GLP1, GLP1-GLP1mutant-HSA, or HSA-GLP1-GLP1mutant. Particularly preferred embodiments are GLP-1 tandem fusions such as construct ID #3070 and the protein encoded by such construct.","Albumin fusion proteins of the invention further encompass proteins containing one, two, three, four, or more molecules of a given Therapeutic protein X or variant thereof fused to the N- or C-terminus of an albumin fusion protein of the invention, and\/or to the N- and\/or C-terminus of albumin or variant thereof, wherein the molecules are joined through peptide linkers. Examples include those peptide linkers described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,073,627 (hereby incorporated by reference). Albumin fusion proteins comprising multiple Therapeutic protein X polypeptides separated by peptide linkers may be produced using conventional recombinant DNA technology. Linkers are particularly important when fusing a small peptide to the large HSA molecule. The peptide itself can be a linker by fusing tandem copies of the peptide (see for example GLP-1) or other known linkers can be used. Constructs that incorporate linkers are described in Table 2 or are apparent when examining SEQ ID NO:Y.","Further, albumin fusion proteins of the invention may also be produced by fusing a Therapeutic protein X or variants thereof to the N-terminal and\/or C-terminal of albumin or variants thereof in such a way as to allow the formation of intramolecular and\/or intermolecular multimeric forms. In one embodiment of the invention, albumin fusion proteins may be in monomeric or multimeric forms (i.e., dimers, trimers, tetramers and higher multimers). In a further embodiment of the invention, the Therapeutic protein portion of an albumin fusion protein may be in monomeric form or multimeric form (i.e., dimers, trimers, tetramers and higher multimers). In a specific embodiment, the Therapeutic protein portion of an albumin fusion protein is in multimeric form (i.e., dimers, trimers, tetramers and higher multimers), and the albumin protein portion is in monomeric form.","In addition to albumin fusion protein in which the albumin portion is fused N-terminal and\/or C-terminal of the Therapeutic protein portion, albumin fusion proteins of the invention may also be produced by inserting the Therapeutic protein or peptide of interest (e.g., a Therapeutic protein X as disclosed in Table 1, or an antibody that binds a Therapeutic protein or a fragment or variant thereof) into an internal region of HA. For instance, within the protein sequence of the HA molecule a number of loops or turns exist between the end and beginning of \u03b1-helices, which are stabilized by disulphide bonds. The loops, as determined from the crystal structure of HA (PDB identifiers 1AO6, 1BJ5, 1BKE, 1BM0, 1E7E to 1E71 and 1UOR) for the most part extend away from the body of the molecule. These loops are useful for the insertion, or internal fusion, of therapeutically active peptides, particularly those requiring a secondary structure to be functional, or Therapeutic proteins, to essentially generate an albumin molecule with specific biological activity.","Loops in human albumin structure into which peptides or polypeptides may be inserted to generate albumin fusion proteins of the invention include: Val54-Asn61, Thr76-Asp89, Ala92-Glu100, Gln170-Ala176, His 247-Glu252, Glu266-Glu277, Glu 280-His288, Ala362-Glu368, Lys439-Pro447, Val462-Lys475, Thr478-Pro486, and Lys560-Thr566. In more preferred embodiments, peptides or polypeptides are inserted into the Val54-Asn61, Gln170-Ala176, and\/or Lys560-Thr566 loops of mature human albumin (SEQ ID NO:1038).","Peptides to be inserted may be derived from either phage display or synthetic peptide libraries screened for specific biological activity or from the active portions of a molecule with the desired function. Additionally, random peptide libraries may be generated within particular loops or by insertions of randomized peptides into particular loops of the HA molecule and in which all possible combinations of amino acids are represented.","Such library(s) could be generated on HA or domain fragments of HA by one of the following methods:","randomized mutation of amino acids within one or more peptide loops of HA or HA domain fragments. Either one, more or all the residues within a loop could be mutated in this manner;","replacement of, or insertion into one or more loops of HA or HA domain fragments (i.e., internal fusion) of a randomized peptide(s) of length X(where X is an amino acid and n is the number of residues;","N-, C- or N- and C-terminal peptide\/protein fusions in addition to (a) and\/or (b).","The HA or HA domain fragment may also be made multifunctional by grafting the peptides derived from different screens of different loops against different targets into the same HA or HA domain fragment.","In preferred embodiments, peptides inserted into a loop of human serum albumin are peptide fragments or peptide variants of the Therapeutic proteins disclosed in Table 1. More particularly, the invention encompasses albumin fusion proteins which comprise peptide fragments or peptide variants at least 7 at least 8, at least 9, at least 10, at least 11, at least 12, at least 13, at least 14, at least 15, at least 20, at least 25, at least 30, at least 35, or at least 40 amino acids in length inserted into a loop of human serum albumin. The invention also encompasses albumin fusion proteins which comprise peptide fragments or peptide variants at least 7 at least 8, at least 9, at least 10, at least 11, at least 12, at least 13, at least 14, at least 15, at least 20, at least 25, at least 30, at least 35, or at least 40 amino acids fused to the N-terminus of human serum albumin. The invention also encompasses albumin fusion proteins which comprise peptide fragments or peptide variants at least 7 at least 8, at least 9, at least 10, at least 11, at least 12, at least 13, at least 14, at least 15, at least 20, at least 25, at least 30, at least 35, or at least 40 amino acids fused to the C-terminus of human serum albumin. For example, short peptides described in Table 1 and 2 (e.g., Therapeutic Y) can be inserted into the albumin loops.","Generally, the albumin fusion proteins of the invention may have one HA-derived region and one Therapeutic protein-derived region. Multiple regions of each protein, however, may be used to make an albumin fusion protein of the invention. Similarly, more than one Therapeutic protein may be used to make an albumin fusion protein of the invention. For instance, a Therapeutic protein may be fused to both the N- and C-terminal ends of the HA. In such a configuration, the Therapeutic protein portions may be the same or different Therapeutic protein molecules. The structure of bifunctional albumin fusion proteins may be represented as: X-HA-Y or Y-HA-X.","For example, an anti-BLyS\u2122 scFv-HA-IFN\u03b1-2b fusion may be prepared to modulate the immune response to IFN\u03b1-2b by anti-BLyS\u2122 scFv. An alternative is making a bi (or even multi) functional dose of HA-fusions e.g. HA-IFN\u03b1-2b fusion mixed with HA-anti-BLyS\u2122 scfv fusion or other HA-fusions in various ratio's depending on function, half-life etc.","Bi- or multi-functional albumin fusion proteins may also be prepared to target the Therapeutic protein portion of a fusion to a target organ or cell type via protein or peptide at the opposite terminus of HA.","As an alternative to the fusion of known therapeutic molecules, the peptides could be obtained by screening libraries constructed as fusions to the N-, C- or N- and C-termini of HA, or domain fragment of HA, of typically 6, 8, 12, 20 or 25 or X(where X is an amino acid (aa) and n equals the number of residues) randomized amino acids, and in which all possible combinations of amino acids were represented. A particular advantage of this approach is that the peptides may be selected in situ on the HA molecule and the properties of the peptide would therefore be as selected for rather than, potentially, modified as might be the case for a peptide derived by any other method then being attached to HA.","Additionally, the albumin fusion proteins of the invention may include a linker peptide between the fused portions to provide greater physical separation between the moieties and thus maximize the accessibility of the Therapeutic protein portion, for instance, for binding to its cognate receptor. The linker peptide may consist of amino acids such that it is flexible or more rigid.","The linker sequence may be cleavable by a protease or chemically to yield the growth hormone related moiety. Preferably, the protease is one which is produced naturally by the host, for example the protease kex2 or equivalent proteases.","Therefore, as described above, the albumin fusion proteins of the invention may have the following formula R1-L-R2; R2-L-R1; or R1-L-R2-L-R1, wherein R1 is at least one Therapeutic protein, peptide or polypeptide sequence, and not necessarily the same Therapeutic protein, L is a linker and R2 is a serum albumin sequence.","In preferred embodiments, Albumin fusion proteins of the invention comprising a Therapeutic protein have extended shelf life compared to the shelf life the same Therapeutic protein when not fused to albumin. Shelf-life typically refers to the time period over which the therapeutic activity of a Therapeutic protein in solution or in some other storage formulation, is stable without undue loss of therapeutic activity. Many of the Therapeutic proteins are highly labile in their unfused state. As described below, the typical shelf-life of these Therapeutic proteins is markedly prolonged upon incorporation into the albumin fusion protein of the invention.","Albumin fusion proteins of the invention with \u201cprolonged\u201d or \u201cextended\u201d shelf-life exhibit greater therapeutic activity relative to a standard that has been subjected to the same storage and handling conditions. The standard may be the unfused full-length Therapeutic protein. When the Therapeutic protein portion of the albumin fusion protein is an analog, a variant, or is otherwise altered or does not include the complete sequence for that protein, the prolongation of therapeutic activity may alternatively be compared to the unfused equivalent of that analog, variant, altered peptide or incomplete sequence. As an example, an albumin fusion protein of the invention may retain greater than about 100% of the therapeutic activity, or greater than about 105%, 110%, 120%, 130%, 150% or 200% of the therapeutic activity of a standard when subjected to the same storage and handling conditions as the standard when compared at a given time point.","Shelf-life may also be assessed in terms of therapeutic activity remaining after storage, normalized to therapeutic activity when storage began. Albumin fusion proteins of the invention with prolonged or extended shelf-life as exhibited by prolonged or extended therapeutic activity may retain greater than about 50% of the therapeutic activity, about 60%, 70%, 80%, or 90% or more of the therapeutic activity of the equivalent unfused Therapeutic protein when subjected to the same conditions. For example, as discussed in Example 38, an albumin fusion protein of the invention comprising hGH fused to the full length HA sequence may retain about 80% or more of its original activity in solution for periods of up to 5 weeks or more under various temperature conditions.","Expression of Fusion Proteins","The albumin fusion proteins of the invention may be produced as recombinant molecules by secretion from yeast, a microorganism such as a bacterium, or a human or animal cell line. Preferably, the polypeptide is secreted from the host cells.","A particular embodiment of the invention comprises a DNA construct encoding a signal sequence effective for directing secretion in yeast, particularly a yeast-derived signal sequence (especially one which is homologous to the yeast host), and the fused molecule of the first aspect of the invention, there being no yeast-derived pro sequence between the signal and the mature polypeptide.","The invertase signal is a preferred example of a yeast-derived signal sequence.","Conjugates of the kind prepared by Poznansky et al., (FEBS Lett. 239:18 (1988)), in which separately-prepared polypeptides are joined by chemical cross-linking, are not contemplated.","The present invention also includes a cell, preferably a yeast cell transformed to express an albumin fusion protein of the invention. In addition to the transformed host cells themselves, the present invention also contemplates a culture of those cells, preferably a monoclonal (clonally homogeneous) culture, or a culture derived from a monoclonal culture, in a nutrient medium. If the polypeptide is secreted, the medium will contain the polypeptide, with the cells, or without the cells if they have been filtered or centrifuged away. Many expression systems are known and may be used, including bacteria (for example and ), yeasts (for example and , filamentous fungi (for example ), plant cells, animal cells and insect cells.","Preferred yeast strains to be used in the production of albumin fusion proteins are D88, DXY1 and BXP10. D88 [leu2-3, leu2-122, can1, pra1, ubc4] is a derivative of parent strain AH22his (also known as DB1; see, e.g., Sleep et al. Biotechnology 8:42\u201346 (1990)). The strain contains a leu2 mutation which allows for auxotropic selection of 2 micron-based plasmids that contain the LEU2 gene. D88 also exhibits a derepression of PRB1 in glucose excess. The PRB1 promoter is normally controlled by two checkpoints that monitor glucose levels and growth stage. The promoter is activated in wild type yeast upon glucose depletion and entry into stationary phase. Strain D88 exhibits the repression by glucose but maintains the induction upon entry into stationary phase. The PRA1 gene encodes a yeast vacuolar protease, YscA endoprotease A, that is localized in the ER. The UBC4 gene is in the ubiquitination pathway and is involved in targeting short lived and abnormal proteins for ubiquitin dependant degradation. Isolation of this ubc4 mutation was found to increase the copy number of an expression plasmid in the cell and cause an increased level of expression of a desired protein expressed from the plasmid (see, e.g., International Publication No. WO99\/00504, hereby incorporated in its entirety by reference herein).","DXY1, a derivative of D88, has the following genotype: [leu2-3, leu2-122, can1, pra1, ubc4, ura3::yap3]. In addition to the mutations isolated in D88, this strain also has a knockout of the YAP3 protease. This protease causes cleavage of mostly di-basic residues (RR, RK, KR, KK) but can also promote cleavage at single basic residues in proteins. Isolation of this yap3 mutation resulted in higher levels of full length HSA production (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,965,386 and Kerry-Williams et al., Yeast 14:161\u2013169 (1998), hereby incorporated in their entireties by reference herein).","BXP10 has the following genotype: leu2-3, leu2-122, can1, pra1, ubc4, ura3, yap3::URA3, lys2, hsp150::LYS2, pmt1::URA3. In addition to the mutations isolated in DXY1, this strain also has a knockout of the PMT1 gene and the HSP150 gene. The PMT1 gene is a member of the evolutionarily conserved family of dolichyl-phosphate-D-mannose protein O-mannosyltransferases (Pmts). The transmembrane topology of Pmt1p suggests that it is an integral membrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum with a role in O-linked glycosylation. This mutation serves to reduce\/eliminate O-linked glycosylation of HSA fusions (see, e.g., International Publication No. WO00\/44772, hereby incorporated in its entirety by reference herein). Studies revealed that the Hsp150 protein is inefficiently separated from rHA by ion exchange chromatography. The mutation in the HSP150 gene removes a potential contaminant that has proven difficult to remove by standard purification techniques. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,783,423, hereby incorporated in its entirety by reference herein.","The desired protein is produced in conventional ways, for example from a coding sequence inserted in the host chromosome or on a free plasmid. The yeasts are transformed with a coding sequence for the desired protein in any of the usual ways, for example electroporation. Methods for transformation of yeast by electroporation are disclosed in Becker & Guarente (1990) . 194, 182.","Successfully transformed cells, i.e., cells that contain a DNA construct of the present invention, can be identified by well known techniques. For example, cells resulting from the introduction of an expression construct can be grown to produce the desired polypeptide. Cells can be harvested and lysed and their DNA content examined for the presence of the DNA using a method such as that described by Southern (1975) . 98, 503 or Berent et al. (1985) . 3, 208. Alternatively, the presence of the protein in the supernatant can be detected using antibodies.","Useful yeast plasmid vectors include pRS403\u2013406 and pRS413\u2013416 and are generally available from Stratagene Cloning Systems, La Jolla, Calif. 92037, USA. Plasmids pRS403, pRS404, pRS405 and pRS406 are Yeast Integrating plasmids (YIps) and incorporate the yeast selectable markers HIS3, 7RP1, LEU2 and URA3. Plasmids pRS413\u2013416 are Yeast Centromere plasmids (Ycps).","Preferred vectors for making albumin fusion proteins for expression in yeast include pPPC0005, pScCHSA, pScNHSA, and pC4:HSA which are described in detail in Example 1.  shows a map of the pPPC0005 plasmid that can be used as the base vector into which polynucleotides encoding Therapeutic proteins may be cloned to form HA-fusions. It contains a PRB1 promoter (PRB1p), a Fusion leader sequence (FL), DNA encoding HA (rHA) and an ADH1 terminator sequence. The sequence of the fusion leader sequence consists of the first 19 amino acids of the signal peptide of human serum albumin (SEQ ID NO:1094) and the last five amino acids of the mating factor alpha 1 promoter (SLDKR, see EP-A-387 319 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety).","The plasmids, pPPC0005, pScCHSA, pScNHSA, and pC4:HSA were deposited on Apr. 11, 2001 at the American Type Culture Collection, 10801 University Boulevard, Manassas, Va. 20110-2209 and given accession numbers ATCC PTA-3278, PTA-3276, PTA-3279, and PTA-3277, respectively. Another vector useful for expressing an albumin fusion protein in yeast the pSAC35 vector which is described in Sleep et al., BioTechnology 8:42 (1990) which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","Another yeast promoter that can be used to express the albumin fusion protein is the MET25 promoter. See, for example, Dominik Mumburg, Rolf Muller and Martin Funk. Nucleic Acids Research, 1994, Vol. 22, No. 25, pp. 5767\u20135768. The Met25 promoter is 383 bases long (bases \u2212382 to \u22121) and the genes expressed by this promoter are also known as Met15, Met17, and YLR303W.

For instance, complementary homopolymer tracts can be added to the DNA segment to be inserted to the vector DNA. The vector and DNA segment are then joined by hydrogen bonding between the complementary homopolymeric tails to form recombinant DNA molecules.","Synthetic linkers containing one or more restriction sites provide an alternative method of joining the DNA segment to vectors. The DNA segment, generated by endonuclease restriction digestion, is treated with bacteriophage T4 DNA polymerase or DNA polymerase I, enzymes that remove protruding, gamma-single-stranded termini with their 3\u20325\u2032-exonucleolytic activities, and fill in recessed 3\u2032-ends with their polymerizing activities.","The combination of these activities therefore generates blunt-ended DNA segments. The blunt-ended segments are then incubated with a large molar excess of linker molecules in the presence of an enzyme that is able to catalyze the ligation of blunt-ended DNA molecules, such as bacteriophage T4 DNA ligase. Thus, the products of the reaction are DNA segments carrying polymeric linker sequences at their ends. These DNA segments are then cleaved with the appropriate restriction enzyme and ligated to an expression vector that has been cleaved with an enzyme that produces termini compatible with those of the DNA segment.","Synthetic linkers containing a variety of restriction endonuclease sites are commercially available from a number of sources including International Biotechnologies Inc, New Haven, Conn., USA.","A desirable way to modify the DNA in accordance with the invention, if, for example, HA variants are to be prepared, is to use the polymerase chain reaction as disclosed by Saiki et al.

An advantage of glutamine synthase based vectors are the availability of cell lines (e.g., the murine myeloma cell line, NSO) which are glutamine synthase negative. Glutamine synthase expression systems can also function in glutamine synthase expressing cells (e.g., Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells) by providing additional inhibitor to prevent the functioning of the endogenous gene. A glutamine synthase expression system and components thereof are detailed in PCT publications: WO87\/04462; WO86\/05807; WO89\/01036; WO89\/10404; and WO91\/06657, which are hereby incorporated in their entireties by reference herein.

The host cell can be a higher eukaryotic cell, such as a mammalian cell (e.g., a human derived cell), or a lower eukaryotic cell, such as a yeast cell, or the host cell can be a prokaryotic cell, such as a bacterial cell. A host strain may be chosen which modulates the expression of the inserted gene sequences, or modifies and processes the gene product in the specific fashion desired. Expression from certain promoters can be elevated in the presence of certain inducers; thus expression of the genetically engineered polypeptide may be controlled. Furthermore, different host cells have characteristics and specific mechanisms for the translational and post-translational processing and modification (e.g., phosphorylation, cleavage) of proteins. Appropriate cell lines can be chosen to ensure the desired modifications and processing of the foreign protein expressed.","Introduction of the nucleic acids and nucleic acid constructs of the invention into the host cell can be effected by calcium phosphate transfection, DEAE-dextran mediated transfection, cationic lipid-mediated transfection, electroporation, transduction, infection, or other methods.

It is specifically contemplated that the polypeptides of the present invention may in fact be expressed by a host cell lacking a recombinant vector.","In addition to encompassing host cells containing the vector constructs discussed herein, the invention also encompasses primary, secondary, and immortalized host cells of vertebrate origin, particularly mammalian origin, that have been engineered to delete or replace endogenous genetic material (e.g., the coding sequence corresponding to a Therapeutic protein may be replaced with an albumin fusion protein corresponding to the Therapeutic protein), and\/or to include genetic material (e.g., heterologous polynucleotide sequences such as for example, an albumin fusion protein of the invention corresponding to the Therapeutic protein may be included). The genetic material operably associated with the endogenous polynucleotide may activate, alter, and\/or amplify endogenous polynucleotides.","In addition, techniques known in the art may be used to operably associate heterologous polynucleotides (e.g., polynucleotides encoding an albumin protein, or a fragment or variant thereof) and\/or heterologous control regions (e.g., promoter and\/or enhancer) with endogenous polynucleotide sequences encoding a Therapeutic protein via homologous recombination (see, e.g., U.S. Pat.

One of skill in the art could easily modify the process described therein for use in the purification of albumin fusion proteins of the invention.","Albumin fusion proteins of the present invention may be recovered from: products of chemical synthetic procedures; and products produced by recombinant techniques from a prokaryotic or eukaryotic host, including, for example, bacterial, yeast, higher plant, insect, and mammalian cells. Depending upon the host employed in a recombinant production procedure, the polypeptides of the present invention may be glycosylated or may be non-glycosylated. In addition, albumin fusion proteins of the invention may also include an initial modified methionine residue, in some cases as a result of host-mediated processes. Thus, it is well known in the art that the N-terminal methionine encoded by the translation initiation codon generally is removed with high efficiency from any protein after translation in all eukaryotic cells. While the N-terminal methionine on most proteins also is efficiently removed in most prokaryotes, for some proteins, this prokaryotic removal process is inefficient, depending on the nature of the amino acid to which the N-terminal methionine is covalently linked.","In one embodiment, the yeast is used to express albumin fusion proteins of the invention in a eukaryotic system. is a methylotrophic yeast which can metabolize methanol as its sole carbon source. A main step in the methanol metabolization pathway is the oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde using O. This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme alcohol oxidase. In order to metabolize methanol as its sole carbon source, must generate high levels of alcohol oxidase due, in part, to the relatively low affinity of alcohol oxidase for O. Consequently, in a growth medium depending on methanol as a main carbon source, the promoter region of one of the two alcohol oxidase genes (AOX1) is highly active. In the presence of methanol, alcohol oxidase produced from the AOX1 gene comprises up to approximately 30% of the total soluble protein in . See Ellis, S. B., et al., . 5:1111\u201321 (1985); Koutz, P. J, et al., 5:167\u201377 (1989); Tschopp, J. F., et al., . 15:3859\u201376 (1987). Thus, a heterologous coding sequence, such as, for example, a polynucleotide of the present invention, under the transcriptional regulation of all or part of the AOXI regulatory sequence is expressed at exceptionally high levels in yeast grown in the presence of methanol.","In one example, the plasmid vector pPIC9K is used to express DNA encoding an albumin fusion protein of the invention, as set forth herein, in a yeast system essentially as described in \u201cProtocols: Methods in Molecular Biology,\u201d D. R. Higgins and J. Cregg, eds. The Humana Press, Totowa, N.J., 1998. This expression vector allows expression and secretion of a polypeptide of the invention by virtue of the strong AOX1 promoter linked to the alkaline phosphatase (PHO) secretory signal peptide (i.e., leader) located upstream of a multiple cloning site.","Many other yeast vectors could be used in place of pPIC9K, such as, pYES2, pYD1, pTEF1\/Zeo, pYES2\/GS, pPICZ, pGAPZ, pGAPZalpha, pPIC9, pPIC3.5, pHIL-D2, pHIL-S1, pPIC3.5K, and PAO815, as one skilled in the art would readily appreciate, as long as the proposed expression construct provides appropriately located signals for transcription, translation, secretion (if desired), and the like, including an in-frame AUG as required.","In another embodiment, high-level expression of a heterologous coding sequence, such as, for example, a polynucleotide encoding an albumin fusion protein of the present invention, may be achieved by cloning the heterologous polynucleotide of the invention into an expression vector such as, for example, pGAPZ or pGAPZalpha, and growing the yeast culture in the absence of methanol.","In addition, albumin fusion proteins of the invention can be chemically synthesized using techniques known in the art (e.g., see Creighton, 1983, Proteins: Structures and Molecular Principles, W.H. Freeman & Co., N.Y., and Hunkapiller et al., , 310:105\u2013111 (1984)). For example, a polypeptide corresponding to a fragment of a polypeptide can be synthesized by use of a peptide synthesizer. Furthermore, if desired, nonclassical amino acids or chemical amino acid analogs can be introduced as a substitution or addition into the polypeptide sequence. Non-classical amino acids include, but are not limited to, to the D-isomers of the common amino acids, 2,4-diaminobutyric acid, a-amino isobutyric acid, 4-aminobutyric acid, Abu, 2-amino butyric acid, g-Abu, e-Ahx, 6-amino hexanoic acid, Aib, 2-amino isobutyric acid, 3-amino propionic acid, ornithine, norleucine, norvaline, hydroxyproline, sarcosine, citrulline, homocitrulline, cysteic acid, t-butylglycine, t-butylalanine, phenylglycine, cyclohexylalanine, b-alanine, fluoro-amino acids, designer amino acids such as b-methyl amino acids, Ca-methyl amino acids, Na-methyl amino acids, and amino acid analogs in general.

The albumin fusion proteins may also be modified with a detectable label, such as an enzymatic, fluorescent, isotopic or affinity label to allow for detection and isolation of the protein.","Examples of suitable enzymes include horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, beta-galactosidase, or acetylcholinesterase; examples of suitable prosthetic group complexes include streptavidin\/biotin and avidin\/biotin; examples of suitable fluorescent materials include umbelliferone, fluorescein, fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine, dichlorotriazinylamine fluorescein, dansyl chloride or phycoerythrin; an example of a luminescent material includes luminol; examples of bioluminescent materials include luciferase, luciferin, and aequorin; and examples of suitable radioactive material include iodine (I, I, I, I), carbon (C), sulfur (S), tritium (H), indium (In, In, In, In), technetium (Tc, Tc), thallium (Ti), gallium (Ga, Ga), palladium (Pd), molybdenum (Mo), xenon (Xe), fluorine (F), Sm, Lu, Gd, Pm, La, Yb, Ho, Y, Sc, Re, Re, Pr, Rh, and Ru.","In specific embodiments, albumin fusion proteins of the present invention or fragments or variants thereof are attached to macrocyclic chelators that associate with radiometal ions, including but not limited to, Lu, Y, Ho, and Sm, to polypeptides. In a preferred embodiment, the radiometal ion associated with the macrocyclic chelators is In. In another preferred embodiment, the radiometal ion associated with the macrocyclic chelator is Y.

It will be appreciated that the same type of modification may be present in the same or varying degrees at several sites in a given polypeptide. Polypeptides of the invention may be branched, for example, as a result of ubiquitination, and they may be cyclic, with or without branching.

In preferred embodiments, the marker amino acid sequence is a hexa-histidine peptide, such as the tag provided in a pQE vector (QIAGEN, Inc., 9259 Eton Avenue, Chatsworth, Calif., 91311), among others, many of which are commercially available. As described in Gentz et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:821\u2013824 (1989), for instance, hexa-histidine provides for convenient purification of the fusion protein. Other peptide tags useful for purification include, but are not limited to, the \u201cHA\u201d tag, which corresponds to an epitope derived from the influenza hemagglutinin protein (Wilson et al., Cell 37:767 (1984)) and the \u201cflag\u201d tag.","Further, an albumin fusion protein of the invention may be conjugated to a therapeutic moiety such as a cytotoxin, e.g., a cytostatic or cytocidal agent, a therapeutic agent or a radioactive metal ion, e.g., alpha-emitters such as, for example, 213Bi. A cytotoxin or cytotoxic agent includes any agent that is detrimental to cells. Examples include paclitaxol, cytochalasin B, gramicidin D, ethidium bromide, emetine, mitomycin, etoposide, tenoposide, vincristine, vinblastine, colchicin, doxorubicin, daunorubicin, dihydroxy anthracin dione, mitoxantrone, mithramycin, actinomycin D, 1-dehydrotestosterone, glucocorticoids, procaine, tetracaine, lidocaine, propranolol, and puromycin and analogs or homologs thereof. Therapeutic agents include, but are not limited to, antimetabolites (e.g., methotrexate, 6-mercaptopurine, 6-thioguanine, cytarabine, 5-fluorouracil decarbazine), alkylating agents (e.g., mechlorethamine, thioepa chlorambucil, melphalan, carmustine (BSNU) and lomustine (CCNU), cyclothosphamide, busulfan, dibromomannitol, streptozotocin, mitomycin C, and cis-dichlorodiamine platinum (II) (DDP) cisplatin), anthracyclines (e.g., daunorubicin (formerly daunomycin) and doxorubicin), antibiotics (e.g., dactinomycin (formerly actinomycin), bleomycin, mithramycin, and anthramycin (AMC)), and anti-mitotic agents (e.g., vincristine and vinblastine).","The conjugates of the invention can be used for modifying a given biological response, the therapeutic agent or drug moiety is not to be construed as limited to classical chemical therapeutic agents. For example, the drug moiety may be a protein or polypeptide possessing a desired biological activity. Such proteins may include, for example, a toxin such as abrin, ricin A, pseudomonas exotoxin, or diphtheria toxin; a protein such as tumor necrosis factor, alpha-interferon, \u03b1-interferon, nerve growth factor, platelet derived growth factor, tissue plasminogen activator, an apoptotic agent, e.g., TNF-alpha, TNF-beta, AIM I (See, International Publication No. WO 97\/33899), AIM II (See, International Publication No. WO 97\/34911), Fas Ligand (Takahashi et al., ., 6:1567\u20131574 (1994)), VEGI (See, International Publication No. WO 99\/23105), a thrombotic agent or an anti-angiogenic agent, e.g., angiostatin or endostatin; or, biological response modifiers such as, for example, lymphokines, interleukin-1 (\u201cIL-1\u201d), interleukin-2 (\u201cIL-2\u201d), interleukin-6 (\u201cIL-6\u201d), granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (\u201cGM-CSF\u201d), granulocyte colony stimulating factor (\u201cG-CSF\u201d), or other growth factors. Techniques for conjugating such therapeutic moiety to proteins (e.g., albumin fusion proteins) are well known in the art.","Albumin fusion proteins may also be attached to solid supports, which are particularly useful for immunoassays or purification of polypeptides that are bound by, that bind to, or associate with albumin fusion proteins of the invention. Such solid supports include, but are not limited to, glass, cellulose, polyacrylamide, nylon, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride or polypropylene.","Albumin fusion proteins, with or without a therapeutic moiety conjugated to it, administered alone or in combination with cytotoxic factor(s) and\/or cytokine(s) can be used as a therapeutic.","In embodiments where the albumin fusion protein of the invention comprises only the VH domain of an antibody that binds a Therapeutic protein, it may be necessary and\/or desirable to coexpress the fusion protein with the VL domain of the same antibody that binds a Therapeutic protein, such that the VH-albumin fusion protein and VL protein will associate (either covalently or non-covalently) post-translationally.","In embodiments where the albumin fusion protein of the invention comprises only the VL domain of an antibody that binds a Therapeutic protein, it may be necessary and\/or desirable to coexpress the fusion protein with the VH domain of the same antibody that binds a Therapeutic protein, such that the VL-albumin fusion protein and VH protein will associate (either covalently or non-covalently) post-translationally.","Some Therapeutic antibodies are bispecific antibodies, meaning the antibody that binds a Therapeutic protein is an artificial hybrid antibody having two different heavy\/light chain pairs and two different binding sites. In order to create an albumin fusion protein corresponding to that Therapeutic protein, it is possible to create an albumin fusion protein which has an scFv fragment fused to both the N- and C-terminus of the albumin protein moiety. More particularly, the scFv fused to the N-terminus of albumin would correspond to one of the heavy\/light (VH\/VL) pairs of the original antibody that binds a Therapeutic protein and the scFv fused to the C-terminus of albumin would correspond to the other heavy\/light (VH\/VL) pair of the original antibody that binds a Therapeutic protein.","Also provided by the invention are chemically modified derivatives of the albumin fusion proteins of the invention which may provide additional advantages such as increased solubility, stability and circulating time of the polypeptide, or decreased immunogenicity (see U.S. Pat. No. 4,179,337). The chemical moieties for derivitization may be selected from water soluble polymers such as polyethylene glycol, ethylene glycol\/propylene glycol copolymers, carboxymethylcellulose, dextran, polyvinyl alcohol and the like. The albumin fusion proteins may be modified at random positions within the molecule, or at predetermined positions within the molecule and may include one, two, three or more attached chemical moieties.","The polymer may be of any molecular weight, and may be branched or unbranched. For polyethylene glycol, the preferred molecular weight is between about 1 kDa and about 100 kDa (the term \u201cabout\u201d indicating that in preparations of polyethylene glycol, some molecules will weigh more, some less, than the stated molecular weight) for ease in handling and manufacturing. Other sizes may be used, depending on the desired therapeutic profile (e.g., the duration of sustained release desired, the effects, if any on biological activity, the ease in handling, the degree or lack of antigenicity and other known effects of the polyethylene glycol to a Therapeutic protein or analog). For example, the polyethylene glycol may have an average molecular weight of about 200, 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500, 3000, 3500, 4000, 4500, 5000, 5500, 6000, 6500, 7000, 7500, 8000, 8500, 9000, 9500, 10,000, 10,500, 11,000, 11,500, 12,000, 12,500, 13,000, 13,500, 14,000, 14,500, 15,000, 15,500, 16,000, 16,500, 17,000, 17,500, 18,000, 18,500, 19,000, 19,500, 20,000, 25,000, 30,000, 35,000, 40,000, 45,000, 50,000, 55,000, 60,000, 65,000, 70,000, 75,000, 80,000, 85,000, 90,000, 95,000, or 100,000 kDa.","As noted above, the polyethylene glycol may have a branched structure. Branched polyethylene glycols are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,643,575; Morpurgo et al., . 56:59\u201372 (1996); Vorobjev et al., 18:2745\u20132750 (1999); and Caliceti et al., . 10:638\u2013646 (1999), the disclosures of each of which are incorporated herein by reference.","The polyethylene glycol molecules (or other chemical moieties) should be attached to the protein with consideration of effects on functional or antigenic domains of the protein. There are a number of attachment methods available to those skilled in the art, such as, for example, the method disclosed in EP 0 401 384 (coupling PEG to G-CSF), herein incorporated by reference; see also Malik et al., Exp. Hematol. 20:1028\u20131035 (1992), reporting pegylation of GM-CSF using tresyl chloride. For example, polyethylene glycol may be covalently bound through amino acid residues via reactive group, such as a free amino or carboxyl group. Reactive groups are those to which an activated polyethylene glycol molecule may be bound. The amino acid residues having a free amino group may include lysine residues and the N-terminal amino acid residues; those having a free carboxyl group may include aspartic acid residues glutamic acid residues and the C-terminal amino acid residue. Sulfhydryl groups may also be used as a reactive group for attaching the polyethylene glycol molecules. Preferred for therapeutic purposes is attachment at an amino group, such as attachment at the N-terminus or lysine group.","As suggested above, polyethylene glycol may be attached to proteins via linkage to any of a number of amino acid residues. For example, polyethylene glycol can be linked to proteins via covalent bonds to lysine, histidine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, or cysteine residues. One or more reaction chemistries may be employed to attach polyethylene glycol to specific amino acid residues (e.g., lysine, histidine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, or cysteine) of the protein or to more than one type of amino acid residue (e.g., lysine, histidine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, cysteine and combinations thereof) of the protein.","One may specifically desire proteins chemically modified at the N-terminus. Using polyethylene glycol as an illustration of the present composition, one may select from a variety of polyethylene glycol molecules (by molecular weight, branching, etc.), the proportion of polyethylene glycol molecules to protein (polypeptide) molecules in the reaction mix, the type of pegylation reaction to be performed, and the method of obtaining the selected N-terminally pegylated protein. The method of obtaining the N-terminally pegylated preparation (i.e., separating this moiety from other monopegylated moieties if necessary) may be by purification of the N-terminally pegylated material from a population of pegylated protein molecules. Selective proteins chemically modified at the N-terminus modification may be accomplished by reductive alkylation which exploits differential reactivity of different types of primary amino groups (lysine versus the N-terminal) available for derivatization in a particular protein. Under the appropriate reaction conditions, substantially selective derivatization of the protein at the N-terminus with a carbonyl group containing polymer is achieved.","As indicated above, pegylation of the albumin fusion proteins of the invention may be accomplished by any number of means. For example, polyethylene glycol may be attached to the albumin fusion protein either directly or by an intervening linker. Linkerless systems for attaching polyethylene glycol to proteins are described in Delgado et al., Crit. Rev. Thera. Drug Carrier Sys. 9:249\u2013304 (1992); Francis et al., Intern. J. of Hematol. 68:1\u201318 (1998); U.S. Pat. No. 4,002,531; U.S. Pat. No. 5,349,052; WO 95\/06058; and WO 98\/32466, the disclosures of each of which are incorporated herein by reference.","One system for attaching polyethylene glycol directly to amino acid residues of proteins without an intervening linker employs tresylated MPEG, which is produced by the modification of monmethoxy polyethylene glycol (MPEG) using tresylchloride (ClSOCHCF). Upon reaction of protein with tresylated MPEG, polyethylene glycol is directly attached to amine groups of the protein. Thus, the invention includes protein-polyethylene glycol conjugates produced by reacting proteins of the invention with a polyethylene glycol molecule having a 2,2,2-trifluoreothane sulphonyl group.","Polyethylene glycol can also be attached to proteins using a number of different intervening linkers. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,612,460, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, discloses urethane linkers for connecting polyethylene glycol to proteins. Protein-polyethylene glycol conjugates wherein the polyethylene glycol is attached to the protein by a linker can also be produced by reaction of proteins with compounds such as MPEG-succinimidylsuccinate, MPEG activated with 1,1\u2032-carbonyldiimidazole, MPEG-2,4,5-trichloropenylcarbonate, MPEG-p-nitrophenolcarbonate, and various MPEG-succinate derivatives. A number of additional polyethylene glycol derivatives and reaction chemistries for attaching polyethylene glycol to proteins are described in International Publication No. WO 98\/32466, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Pegylated protein products produced using the reaction chemistries set out herein are included within the scope of the invention.","The number of polyethylene glycol moieties attached to each albumin fusion protein of the invention (i.e., the degree of substitution) may also vary. For example, the pegylated proteins of the invention may be linked, on average, to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 17, 20, or more polyethylene glycol molecules. Similarly, the average degree of substitution within ranges such as 1\u20133, 2\u20134, 3\u20135, 4\u20136, 5\u20137, 6\u20138, 7\u20139, 8\u201310, 9\u201311, 10\u201312, 11\u201313, 12\u201314, 13\u201315, 14\u201316, 15\u201317, 16\u201318, 17\u201319, or 18\u201320 polyethylene glycol moieties per protein molecule. Methods for determining the degree of substitution are discussed, for example, in Delgado et al., Crit. Rev. Thera. Drug Carrier Sys. 9:249\u2013304 (1992).","The polypeptides of the invention can be recovered and purified from chemical synthesis and recombinant cell cultures by standard methods which include, but are not limited to, ammonium sulfate or ethanol precipitation, acid extraction, anion or cation exchange chromatography, phosphocellulose chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, affinity chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography and lectin chromatography. Most preferably, high performance liquid chromatography (\u201cHPLC\u201d) is employed for purification. Well known techniques for refolding protein may be employed to regenerate active conformation when the polypeptide is denatured during isolation and\/or purification.","The presence and quantity of albumin fusion proteins of the invention may be determined using ELISA, a well known immunoassay known in the art. In one ELISA protocol that would be useful for detecting\/quantifying albumin fusion proteins of the invention, comprises the steps of coating an ELISA plate with an anti-human serum albumin antibody, blocking the plate to prevent non-specific binding, washing the ELISA plate, adding a solution containing the albumin fusion protein of the invention (at one or more different concentrations), adding a secondary anti-Therapeutic protein specific antibody coupled to a detectable label (as described herein or otherwise known in the art), and detecting the presence of the secondary antibody. In an alternate version of this protocol, the ELISA plate might be coated with the anti-Therapeutic protein specific antibody and the labeled secondary reagent might be the anti-human albumin specific antibody.","Uses of the Polynucleotides","Each of the polynucleotides identified herein can be used in numerous ways as reagents. The following description should be considered exemplary and utilizes known techniques.","The polynucleotides of the present invention are useful to produce the albumin fusion proteins of the invention. As described in more detail below, polynucleotides of the invention (encoding albumin fusion proteins) may be used in recombinant DNA methods useful in genetic engineering to make cells, cell lines, or tissues that express the albumin fusion protein encoded by the polynucleotides encoding albumin fusion proteins of the invention.","Polynucleotides of the present invention are also useful in gene therapy. One goal of gene therapy is to insert a normal gene into an organism having a defective gene, in an effort to correct the genetic defect. The polynucleotides disclosed in the present invention offer a means of targeting such genetic defects in a highly accurate manner. Another goal is to insert a new gene that was not present in the host genome, thereby producing a new trait in the host cell. Additional non-limiting examples of gene therapy methods encompassed by the present invention are more thoroughly described elsewhere herein (see, e.g., the sections labeled \u201cGene Therapy\u201d, and Examples 63 and 64).","Uses of the Polypeptides","Each of the polypeptides identified herein can be used in numerous ways. The following description should be considered exemplary and utilizes known techniques.","Albumin fusion proteins of the invention are useful to provide immunological probes for differential identification of the tissue(s) (e.g., immunohistochemistry assays such as, for example, ABC immunoperoxidase (Hsu et al., J. Histochem. Cytochem. 29:577\u2013580 (1981)) or cell type(s) (e.g., immunocytochemistry assays).","Albumin fusion proteins can be used to assay levels of polypeptides in a biological sample using classical immunohistological methods known to those of skill in the art (e.g., see Jalkanen, et al., J. Cell. Biol. 101:976\u2013985 (1985); Jalkanen, et al., J. Cell. Biol. 105:3087\u20133096 (1987)). Other methods useful for detecting protein gene expression include immunoassays, such as the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the radioimmunoassay (RIA). Suitable assay labels are known in the art and include enzyme labels, such as, glucose oxidase; radioisotopes, such as iodine (I, I, I, I), carbon (C), sulfur (S), tritium (H), indium (In, In, In, In), and technetium (Tc, Tc), thallium (Ti), gallium (Ga, Ga), palladium (Pd), molybdenum (Mo), xenon (Xe), fluorine (F), Sm, Lu, Gd, Pm, La, Yb, Ho, Y, Sc, Re, Re, Pr, Rh, Ru; luminescent labels, such as luminol; and fluorescent labels, such as fluorescein and rhodamine, and biotin.","Albumin fusion proteins of the invention can also be detected in vivo by imaging. Labels or markers for in vivo imaging of protein include those detectable by X-radiography, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) or electron spin relaxtion (ESR). For X-radiography, suitable labels include radioisotopes such as barium or cesium, which emit detectable radiation but are not overtly harmful to the subject. Suitable markers for NMR and ESR include those with a detectable characteristic spin, such as deuterium, which may be incorporated into the albumin fusion protein by labeling of nutrients given to a cell line expressing the albumin fusion protein of the invention.","An albumin fusion protein which has been labeled with an appropriate detectable imaging moiety, such as a radioisotope (for example, I, In, Tc, (I, I, I, I), carbon (C), sulfur (S), tritium (H), indium (In, In, In, In), and technetium (Tc, Tc), thallium (Ti), gallium (Ga, Ga), palladium (Pd), molybdenum (Mo), xenon (Xe), fluorine (F, Sm, Lu, Gd, Pm, La, Yb, Ho, Y, Sc, Re, Re, Pr, Rh, Ru), a radio-opaque substance, or a material detectable by nuclear magnetic resonance, is introduced (for example, parenterally, subcutaneously or intraperitoneally) into the mammal to be examined for immune system disorder. It will be understood in the art that the size of the subject and the imaging system used will determine the quantity of imaging moiety needed to produce diagnostic images. In the case of a radioisotope moiety, for a human subject, the quantity of radioactivity injected will normally range from about 5 to 20 millicuries of Tc. The labeled albumin fusion protein will then preferentially accumulate at locations in the body (e.g., organs, cells, extracellular spaces or matrices)-where one or more receptors, ligands or substrates (corresponding to that of the Therapeutic protein used to make the albumin fusion protein of the invention) are located. Alternatively, in the case where the albumin fusion protein comprises at least a fragment or variant of a Therapeutic antibody, the labeled albumin fusion protein will then preferentially accumulate at the locations in the body (e.g., organs, cells, extracellular spaces or matrices) where the polypeptides\/epitopes corresponding to those bound by the Therapeutic antibody (used to make the albumin fusion protein of the invention) are located. In vivo tumor imaging is described in S. W. Burchiel et al., \u201cImmunopharmacokinetics of Radiolabeled Antibodies and Their Fragments\u201d (Chapter 13 in , S. W. Burchiel and B. A. Rhodes, eds., Masson Publishing Inc. (1982)). The protocols described therein could easily be modified by one of skill in the art for use with the albumin fusion proteins of the invention.","In one embodiment, the invention provides a method for the specific delivery of albumin fusion proteins of the invention to cells by administering albumin fusion proteins of the invention (e.g., polypeptides encoded by polynucleotides encoding albumin fusion proteins of the invention and\/or antibodies) that are associated with heterologous polypeptides or nucleic acids. In one example, the invention provides a method for delivering a Therapeutic protein into the targeted cell. In another example, the invention provides a method for delivering a single stranded nucleic acid (e.g., antisense or ribozymes) or double stranded nucleic acid (e.g., DNA that can integrate into the cell's genome or replicate episomally and that can be transcribed) into the targeted cell.","In another embodiment, the invention provides a method for the specific destruction of cells (e.g., the destruction of tumor cells) by administering albumin fusion proteins of the invention in association with toxins or cytotoxic prodrugs.","By \u201ctoxin\u201d is meant one or more compounds that bind and activate endogenous cytotoxic effector systems, radioisotopes, holotoxins, modified toxins, catalytic subunits of toxins, or any molecules or enzymes not normally present in or on the surface of a cell that under defined conditions cause the cell's death. Toxins that may be used according to the methods of the invention include, but are not limited to, radioisotopes known in the art, compounds such as, for example, antibodies (or complement fixing containing portions thereof) that bind an inherent or induced endogenous cytotoxic effector system, thymidine kinase, endonuclease, RNAse, alpha toxin, ricin, abrin, exotoxin A, diphtheria toxin, saporin, momordin, gelonin, pokeweed antiviral protein, alpha-sarcin and cholera toxin. \u201cToxin\u201d also includes a cytostatic or cytocidal agent, a therapeutic agent or a radioactive metal ion, e.g., alpha-emitters such as, for example, Bi, or other radioisotopes such as, for example, Pd, Xe, I, Ge, Co, Zn, Sr, P, S, Y, Sm, Gd, Yb, Cr, Mn, Se, Sn, Yttrium, Tin, Rhenium, Holmium, and Rhenium; luminescent labels, such as luminol; and fluorescent labels, such as fluorescein and rhodamine, and biotin. In a specific embodiment, the invention provides a method for the specific destruction of cells (e.g., the destruction of tumor cells) by administering polypeptides of the invention or antibodies of the invention in association with the radioisotope Y. In another specific embodiment, the invention provides a method for the specific destruction of cells (e.g., the destruction of tumor cells) by administering polypeptides of the invention or antibodies of the invention in association with the radioisotope In. In a further specific embodiment, the invention provides a method for the specific destruction of cells (e.g., the destruction of tumor cells) by administering polypeptides of the invention or antibodies of the invention in association with the radioisotope I.","Techniques known in the art may be applied to label polypeptides of the invention. Such techniques include, but are not limited to, the use of bifunctional conjugating agents (see e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,756,065; 5,714,631; 5,696,239; 5,652,361; 5,505,931; 5,489,425; 5,435,990; 5,428,139; 5,342,604; 5,274,119; 4,994,560; and 5,808,003; the contents of each of which are hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety).","The albumin fusion proteins of the present invention are useful for diagnosis, treatment, prevention and\/or prognosis of various disorders in mammals, preferably humans. Such disorders include, but are not limited to, those described herein under the section heading \u201cBiological Activities,\u201d below.","Thus, the invention provides a diagnostic method of a disorder, which involves (a) assaying the expression level of a certain polypeptide in cells or body fluid of an individual using an albumin fusion protein of the invention; and (b) comparing the assayed polypeptide expression level with a standard polypeptide expression level, whereby an increase or decrease in the assayed polypeptide expression level compared to the standard expression level is indicative of a disorder. With respect to cancer, the presence of a relatively high amount of transcript in biopsied tissue from an individual may indicate a predisposition for the development of the disease, or may provide a means for detecting the disease prior to the appearance of actual clinical symptoms. A more definitive diagnosis of this type may allow health professionals to employ preventative measures or aggressive treatment earlier thereby preventing the development or further progression of the cancer.","Moreover, albumin fusion proteins of the present invention can be used to treat or prevent diseases or conditions such as, for example, neural disorders, immune system disorders, muscular disorders, reproductive disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, pulmonary disorders, cardiovascular disorders, renal disorders, proliferative disorders, and\/or cancerous diseases and conditions. For example, patients can be administered a polypeptide of the present invention in an effort to replace absent or decreased levels of the polypeptide (e.g., insulin), to supplement absent or decreased levels of a different polypeptide (e.g., hemoglobin S for hemoglobin B, SOD, catalase, DNA repair proteins), to inhibit the activity of a polypeptide (e.g., an oncogene or tumor supressor), to activate the activity of a polypeptide (e.g., by binding to a receptor), to reduce the activity of a membrane bound receptor by competing with it for free ligand (e.g., soluble TNF receptors used in reducing inflammation), or to bring about a desired response (e.g., blood vessel growth inhibition, enhancement of the immune response to proliferative cells or tissues).","In particular, albumin fusion proteins comprising of at least a fragment or variant of a Therapeutic antibody can also be used to treat disease (as described supra, and elsewhere herein). For example, administration of an albumin fusion protein comprising of at least a fragment or variant of a Therapeutic antibody can bind, and\/or neutralize the polypeptide to which the Therapeutic antibody used to make the albumin fusion protein specifically binds, and\/or reduce overproduction of the polypeptide to which the Therapeutic antibody used to make the albumin fusion protein specifically binds. Similarly, administration of an albumin fusion protein comprising of at least a fragment or variant of a Therapeutic antibody can activate the polypeptide to which the Therapeutic antibody used to make the albumin fusion protein specifically binds, by binding to the polypeptide bound to a membrane (receptor).","At the very least, the albumin fusion proteins of the invention of the present invention can be used as molecular weight markers on SDS-PAGE gels or on molecular sieve gel filtration columns using methods well known to those of skill in the art. Albumin fusion proteins of the invention can also be used to raise antibodies, which in turn may be used to measure protein expression of the Therapeutic protein, albumin protein, and\/or the albumin fusion protein of the invention from a recombinant cell, as a way of assessing transformation of the host cell, or in a biological sample. Moreover, the albumin fusion proteins of the present invention can be used to test the biological activities described herein.","Diagnostic Assays","The compounds of the present invention are useful for diagnosis, treatment, prevention and\/or prognosis of various disorders in mammals, preferably humans. Such disorders include, but are not limited to, those described for each Therapeutic protein in the corresponding row of Table 1 and herein under the section headings \u201cImmune Activity,\u201d \u201cBlood Related Disorders,\u201d \u201cHyperproliferative Disorders,\u201d \u201cRenal Disorders,\u201d \u201cCardiovascular Disorders,\u201d \u201cRespiratory Disorders,\u201d \u201cAnti-Angiogenesis Activity,\u201d \u201cDiseases at the Cellular Level,\u201d \u201cWound Healing and Epithelial Cell Proliferation,\u201d \u201cNeural Activity and Neurological Diseases,\u201d \u201cEndocrine Disorders,\u201d \u201cReproductive System Disorders,\u201d \u201cInfectious Disease,\u201d \u201cRegeneration,\u201d and\/or \u201cGastrointestinal Disorders,\u201d infra.","For a number of disorders, substantially altered (increased or decreased) levels of gene expression can be detected in tissues, cells or bodily fluids (e.g., sera, plasma, urine, semen, synovial fluid or spinal fluid) taken from an individual having such a disorder, relative to a \u201cstandard\u201d gene expression level, that is, the expression level in tissues or bodily fluids from an individual not having the disorder. Thus, the invention provides a diagnostic method useful during diagnosis of a disorder, which involves measuring the expression level of the gene encoding a polypeptide in tissues, cells or body fluid from an individual and comparing the measured gene expression level with a standard gene expression level, whereby an increase or decrease in the gene expression level(s) compared to the standard is indicative of a disorder. These diagnostic assays may be performed in vivo or in vitro, such as, for example, on blood samples, biopsy tissue or autopsy tissue.","The present invention is also useful as a prognostic indicator, whereby patients exhibiting enhanced or depressed gene expression will experience a worse clinical outcome","By \u201cassaying the expression level of the gene encoding a polypeptide\u201d is intended qualitatively or quantitatively measuring or estimating the level of a particular polypeptide (e.g. a polypeptide corresponding to a Therapeutic protein disclosed in Table 1) or the level of the mRNA encoding the polypeptide of the invention in a first biological sample either directly (e.g., by determining or estimating absolute protein level or mRNA level) or relatively (e.g., by comparing to the polypeptide level or mRNA level in a second biological sample). Preferably, the polypeptide expression level or mRNA level in the first biological sample is measured or estimated and compared to a standard polypeptide level or mRNA level, the standard being taken from a second biological sample obtained from an individual not having the disorder or being determined by averaging levels from a population of individuals not having the disorder. As will be appreciated in the art, once a standard polypeptide level or mRNA level is known, it can be used repeatedly as a standard for comparison.","By \u201cbiological sample\u201d is intended any biological sample obtained from an individual, cell line, tissue culture, or other source containing polypeptides of the invention (including portions thereof) or mRNA. As indicated, biological samples include body fluids (such as sera, plasma, urine, synovial fluid and spinal fluid) and tissue sources found to express the full length or fragments thereof of a polypeptide or mRNA. Methods for obtaining tissue biopsies and body fluids from mammals are well known in the art. Where the biological sample is to include mRNA, a tissue biopsy is the preferred source.","Total cellular RNA can be isolated from a biological sample using any suitable technique such as the single-step guanidinium-thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method described in Chomczynski and Sacchi, Anal. Biochem. 162:156\u2013159 (1987). Levels of mRNA encoding the polypeptides of the invention are then assayed using any appropriate method. These include Northern blot analysis, S1 nuclease mapping, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), reverse transcription in combination with the polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and reverse transcription in combination with the ligase chain reaction (RT-LCR).","The present invention also relates to diagnostic assays such as quantitative and diagnostic assays for detecting levels of polypeptides that bind to, are bound by, or associate with albumin fusion proteins of the invention, in a biological sample (e.g., cells and tissues), including determination of normal and abnormal levels of polypeptides. Thus, for instance, a diagnostic assay in accordance with the invention for detecting abnormal expression of polypeptides that bind to, are bound by, or associate with albumin fusion proteins compared to normal control tissue samples may be used to detect the presence of tumors. Assay techniques that can be used to determine levels of a polypeptide that bind to, are bound by, or associate with albumin fusion proteins of the present invention in a sample derived from a host are well-known to those of skill in the art. Such assay methods include radioimmunoassays, competitive-binding assays, Western Blot analysis and ELISA assays. Assaying polypeptide levels in a biological sample can occur using any art-known method.","Assaying polypeptide levels in a biological sample can occur using a variety of techniques. For example, polypeptide expression in tissues can be studied with classical immunohistological methods (Jalkanen et al., J. Cell. Biol. 101:976\u2013985 (1985); Jalkanen, M., et al., J. Cell. Biol. 105:3087\u20133096 (1987)). Other methods useful for detecting polypeptide gene expression include immunoassays, such as the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the radioimmunoassay (RIA). Suitable antibody assay labels are known in the art and include enzyme labels, such as, glucose oxidase, and radioisotopes, such as iodine (I, I), carbon (C), sulfur (S), tritium (H), indium (In), and technetium (Tc), and fluorescent labels, such as fluorescein and rhodamine, and biotin.","The tissue or cell type to be analyzed will generally include those which are known, or suspected, to express the gene of interest (such as, for example, cancer). The protein isolation methods employed herein may, for example, be such as those described in Harlow and Lane (Harlow, E. and Lane, D., 1988, \u201cAntibodies: A Laboratory Manual\u201d, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The isolated cells can be derived from cell culture or from a patient. The analysis of cells taken from culture may be a necessary step in the assessment of cells that could be used as part of a cell-based gene therapy technique or, alternatively, to test the effect of compounds on the expression of the gene.","For example, albumin fusion proteins may be used to quantitatively or qualitatively detect the presence of polypeptides that bind to, are bound by, or associate with albumin fusion proteins of the present invention. This can be accomplished, for example, by immunofluorescence techniques employing a fluorescently labeled albumin fusion protein coupled with light microscopic, flow cytometric, or fluorimetric detection.","In a preferred embodiment, albumin fusion proteins comprising at least a fragment or variant of an antibody that specifically binds at least a Therapeutic protein disclosed herein (e.g., the Therapeutic proteins disclosed in Table 1) or otherwise known in the art may be used to quantitatively or qualitatively detect the presence of gene products or conserved variants or peptide fragments thereof. This can be accomplished, for example, by immunofluorescence techniques employing a fluorescently labeled antibody coupled with light microscopic, flow cytometric, or fluorimetric detection.","The albumin fusion proteins of the present invention may, additionally, be employed histologically, as in immunofluorescence, immunoelectron microscopy or non-immunological assays, for in situ detection of polypeptides that bind to, are bound by, or associate with an albumin fusion protein of the present invention. In situ detection may be accomplished by removing a histological specimen from a patient, and applying thereto a labeled antibody or polypeptide of the present invention. The albumin-fusion proteins are preferably applied by overlaying the labeled albumin fusion proteins onto a biological sample. Through the use of such a procedure, it is possible to determine not only the presence of the polypeptides that bind to, are bound by, or associate with albumin fusion proteins, but also its distribution in the examined tissue. Using the present invention, those of ordinary skill will readily perceive that any of a wide variety of histological methods (such as staining procedures) can be modified in order to achieve such in situ detection.","Immunoassays and non-immunoassays that detect polypeptides that bind to, are bound by, or associate with albumin fusion proteins will typically comprise incubating a sample, such as a biological fluid, a tissue extract, freshly harvested cells, or lysates of cells which have been incubated in cell culture, in the presence of a detectably labeled antibody capable of binding gene products or conserved variants or peptide fragments thereof, and detecting the bound antibody by any of a number of techniques well-known in the art.","The biological sample may be brought in contact with and immobilized onto a solid phase support or carrier such as nitrocellulose, or other solid support which is capable of immobilizing cells, cell particles or soluble proteins. The support may then be washed with suitable buffers followed by treatment with the detectably labeled albumin fusion protein of the invention. The solid phase support may then be washed with the buffer a second time to remove unbound antibody or polypeptide. Optionally the antibody is subsequently labeled. The amount of bound label on solid support may then be detected by conventional means.","By \u201csolid phase support or carrier\u201d is intended any support capable of binding a polypeptide (e.g., an albumin fusion protein, or polypeptide that binds, is bound by, or associates with an albumin fusion protein of the invention.) Well-known supports or carriers include glass, polystyrene, polypropylene, polyethylene, dextran, nylon, amylases, natural and modified celluloses, polyacrylamides, gabbros, and magnetite. The nature of the carrier can be either soluble to some extent or insoluble for the purposes of the present invention. The support material may have virtually any possible structural configuration so long as the coupled molecule is capable of binding to a polypeptide. Thus, the support configuration may be spherical, as in a bead, or cylindrical, as in the inside surface of a test tube, or the external surface of a rod. Alternatively, the surface may be flat such as a sheet, test strip, etc. Preferred supports include polystyrene beads. Those skilled in the art will know many other suitable carriers for binding antibody or antigen, or will be able to ascertain the same by use of routine experimentation.","The binding activity of a given lot of albumin fusion protein may be determined according to well known methods. Those skilled in the art will be able to determine operative and optimal assay conditions for each determination by employing routine experimentation.","In addition to assaying polypeptide levels in a biological sample obtained from an individual, polypeptide can also be detected in vivo by imaging. For example, in one embodiment of the invention, albumin fusion proteins of the invention are used to image diseased or neoplastic cells.","Labels or markers for in vivo imaging of albumin fusion proteins of the invention include those detectable by X-radiography, NMR, MRI, CAT-scans or ESR. For X-radiography, suitable labels include radioisotopes such as barium or cesium, which emit detectable radiation but are not overtly harmful to the subject. Suitable markers for NMR and ESR include those with a detectable characteristic spin, such as deuterium, which may be incorporated into the albumin fusion protein by labeling of nutrients of a cell line (or bacterial or yeast strain) engineered.","Additionally, albumin fusion proteins of the invention whose presence can be detected, can be administered. For example, albumin fusion proteins of the invention labeled with a radio-opaque or other appropriate compound can be administered and visualized in vivo, as discussed, above for labeled antibodies. Further, such polypeptides can be utilized for in vitro diagnostic procedures.","A polypeptide-specific antibody or antibody fragment which has been labeled with an appropriate detectable imaging moiety, such as a radioisotope (for example, I, In, Tc), a radio-opaque substance, or a material detectable by nuclear magnetic resonance, is introduced (for example, parenterally, subcutaneously or intraperitoneally) into the mammal to be examined for a disorder. It will be understood in the art that the size of the subject and the imaging system used will determine the quantity of imaging moiety needed to produce diagnostic images. In the case of a radioisotope moiety, for a human subject, the quantity of radioactivity injected will normally range from about 5 to 20 millicuries of Tc. The labeled albumin fusion protein will then preferentially accumulate at the locations in the body which contain a polypeptide or other substance that binds to, is bound by or associates with an albumin fusion protein of the present invention. In vivo tumor imaging is described in S. W. Burchiel et al., \u201cImmunopharmacokinetics of Radiolabeled Antibodies and Their Fragments\u201d (Chapter 13 in , S. W. Burchiel and B. A. Rhodes, eds., Masson Publishing Inc. (1982)).","One of the ways in which an albumin fusion protein of the present invention can be detectably labeled is by linking the same to a reporter enzyme and using the linked product in an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) (Voller, A., \u201cThe Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)\u201d, 1978, Diagnostic Horizons 2:1\u20137, Microbiological Associates Quarterly Publication, Walkersville, Md.); Voller et al., . 31:507\u2013520 (1978); Butler, J. E., . 73:482\u2013523 (1981); Maggio, E. (ed.), 1980, Enzyme Immunoassay, CRC Press, Boca Raton, Fla.; Ishikawa, E. et al., (eds.), 1981, Enzyme Immunoassay, Kgaku Shoin, Tokyo). The reporter enzyme which is bound to the antibody will react with an appropriate substrate, preferably a chromogenic substrate, in such a manner as to produce a chemical moiety which can be detected, for example, by spectrophotometric, fluorimetric or by visual means. Reporter enzymes which can be used to detectably label the antibody include, but are not limited to, malate dehydrogenase, staphylococcal nuclease, delta-5-steroid isomerase, yeast alcohol dehydrogenase, alpha-glycerophosphate, dehydrogenase, triose phosphate isomerase, horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, asparaginase, glucose oxidase, beta-galactosidase, ribonuclease, urease, catalase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, glucoamylase and acetylcholinesterase. Additionally, the detection can be accomplished by colorimetric methods which employ a chromogenic substrate for the reporter enzyme. Detection may also be accomplished by visual comparison of the extent of enzymatic reaction of a substrate in comparison with similarly prepared standards.","Albumin fusion proteins may also be radiolabelled and used in any of a variety of other immunoassays. For example, by radioactively labeling the albumin fusion proteins, it is possible to the use the albumin fusion proteins in a radioimmunoassay (RIA) (see, for example, Weintraub, B., Principles of Radioimmunoassays, Seventh Training Course on Radioligand Assay Techniques, The Endocrine Society, March, 1986, which is incorporated by reference herein). The radioactive isotope can be detected by means including, but not limited to, a gamma counter, a scintillation counter, or autoradiography.","Additionally, chelator molecules, are known in the art and can be used to label the Albumin fusion proteins. Chelator molecules may be attached Albumin fusion proteins of the invention to facilitate labeling said protein with metal ions including radionuclides or fluorescent labels. For example, see Subramanian, R. and Meares, C. F., \u201cBifunctional Chelating Agents for Radiometal-labeled monoclonal Antibodies,\u201d in (D. M. Goldenberg, Ed.) Kluwer Academic Publications, Boston; Saji, H., \u201cTargeted delivery of radiolabeled imaging and therapeutic agents: bifunctional radiopharmaceuticals.\u201d . 16:209\u2013244 (1999); Srivastava S. C. and Mease R. C., \u201cProgress in research on ligands, nuclides and techniques for labeling monoclonal antibodies.\u201d 18:589\u2013603 (1991); and Liu, S. and Edwards, D. S., \u201cBifunctional chelators for therapeutic lanthanide radiopharmaceuticals.\u201d . 12:7\u201334 (2001). Any chelator which can be covalently bound to said Albumin fusion proteins may be used according to the present invention. The chelator may further comprise a linker moiety that connects the chelating moiety to the Albumin fusion protein.","In one embodiment, the Albumin fusion protein of the invention are attached to an acyclic chelator such as diethylene triamine-N,N,N\u2032,N\u2033,N\u2033-pentaacetic acid (DPTA), analogues of DPTA, and derivatives of DPTA. As non-limiting examples, the chelator may be 2-(p-isothiocyanatobenzyl)-6-methyldiethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (1B4M-DPTA, also known as MX-DTPA), 2-methyl-6-(rho-nitrobenzyl)-1,4,7-triazaheptane-N,N,N\u2032,N\u2033,N\u2033-pentaacetic acid (nitro-1B4M-DTPA or nitro-MX-DTPA); 2-(p-isothiocyanatobenzyl)-cyclohexyldiethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (CHX-DTPA), or N-[2-amino-3-(rho-nitrophenyl)propyl]-trans-cyclohexane-1,2-diamine-N,N\u2032,N\u2033-pentaacetic acid (nitro-CHX-A-DTPA).","In another embodiment, the Albumin fusion protein of the invention are attached to an acyclic terpyridine chelator such as 6,6\u2033-bis[[N,N,N\u2033,N\u2033-tetra(carboxymethyl)amino]methyl]-4\u2032-(3-amino-4-methoxyphenyl)-2,2\u2032:6\u2032,2\u2033-terpyridine (TMT-amine).","In specific embodiments, the macrocyclic chelator which is attached to the the Albumin fusion protein of the invention is 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,N\u2032,N\u2033,N\u2032\u2033-tetraacetic acid (DOTA). In other specific embodiments, the DOTA is attached to the the Albumin fusion protein of the invention via a linker molecule. Examples of linker molecules useful for conjugating DOTA to a polypeptide are commonly known in the art\u2014see, for example, DeNardo et al., . 4(10):2483\u201390, 1998; Peterson et al., . 10(4):553\u20137, 1999; and Zimmerman et al., . 26(8):943\u201350, 1999 which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. In addition, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,652,361 and 5,756,065, which disclose chelating agents that may be conjugated to antibodies, and methods for making and using them, are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties. Though U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,652,361 and 5,756,065 focus on conjugating chelating agents to antibodies, one skilled in the art could readily adapt the method disclosed therein in order to conjugate chelating agents to other polypeptides.","Bifunctional chelators based on macrocyclic ligands in which conjugation is via an activated arm, or functional group, attached to the carbon backbone of the ligand can be employed as described by M. Moi et al., . 49:2639 (1989) (2-p-nitrobenzyl-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,N\u2032,N\u2033,N\u2032\u2033-tetraacetic acid); S. V. Deshpande et al., . 31:473 (1990); G.

In another embodiment, the chelator is a chelator selected from the group consisting of DOTA, analogues of DOTA, and derivatives of DOTA.","In one embodiment, suitable chelator molecules that may be attached to the the Albumin fusion protein of the invention include DOXA (1-oxa-4,7,10-triazacyclododecanetriacetic acid), NOTA (1,4,7-triazacyclononanetriacetic acid), TETA (1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecanetetraacetic acid), and THT (4\u2032-(3-amino-4-methoxyphenyl)-6,6\u2033-bis(N\u2032,N\u2032-dicarboxymethyl-N-methylhydrazino)-2,2\u2032:6\u2032,2\u2033-terpyridine), and analogs and derivatives thereof.

A salt or ester of \u03b1-(5-isothiocyanato-2-methoxyphenyl)-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid may also be used.","Albumin fusion proteins of the invention to which chelators such as those decribed are covalently attached may be labeled (via the coordination site of the chelator) with radionuclides that are suitable for therapeutic, diagnostic, or both therapeutic and diagnostic purposes. Examples of appropriate metals include Ag, At, Au, Bi, Cu, Ga, Ho, In, Lu, Pb, Pd, Pm, Pr, Rb, Re, Rh, Sc, Sr, Tc, Tl, Y, and Yb. Examples of the radionuclide used for diagnostic purposes are Fe, Gd, In, Ga, or Ga. In another embodiment, the radionuclide used for diagnostic purposes is In, or Ga.

Examples of the radionuclides used for both therapeutic and diagnostic purposes include Sm, Lu, Gd, Yb, or Sc. In one embodiment, the radionuclide is Sm, Lu, Yb, or Gd.","Preferred metal radionuclides include Y, Tc, In, Sc, Ga, Cr, Sn, Cu, Tm, Ru, Re, Lu, Au, Sc, Ga, Cr, Sn, Cu, Tm, Ru, Re, Lu, Au, Pb and Ce.","In a particular embodiment, Albumin fusion proteins of the invention to which chelators are covalently attached may be labeled with a metal ion selected from the group consisting of Y, In, Lu, Ho, Bi, and Ac.","Moreover, \u03b3-emitting radionuclides, such as Tc, In, Ga, and Yb have been approved or under investigation for diagnostic imaging, while \u03b2-emitters, such as Cu, Ag, Re, and Y are useful for the applications in tumor therapy. Also other useful radionuclides include \u03b3-emitters, such as Tc, In, Ga, and Yb, and \u03b2-emitters, such as Cu, Ag, Re, Re and Y, as well as other radionuclides of interest such as At, Bi, Lu, Pb, Rh, Sm, Au, Pm, Sr, Pr, Pb, Pd, Ho, Tl, and Sc. Albumin fusion proteins of the invention to which chelators are covalently attached may be labeled with the radionuclides described above.","In another embodiment, Albumin fusion proteins of the invention to which chelators are covalently attached may be labeled with paramagnetic metal ions including ions of transition and lanthanide metal, such as metals having atomic numbers of 21\u201329, 42, 43, 44, or 57\u201371, in particular ions of Cr, V, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Pm, Sm, Eu, Gd, Th, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, and Lu. The paramagnetic metals used in compositions for magnetic resonance imaging include the elements having atomic numbers of 22 to 29, 42, 44 and 58\u201370.","In another embodiment, Albumin fusion proteins of the invention to which chelators are covalently attached may be labeled with fluorescent metal ions including lanthanides, in particular La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Pm, Sm, Eu (e.g., Eu), Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, and Lu.","In another embodiment, Albumin fusion proteins of the invention to which chelators are covalently attached may be labeled with heavy metal-containing reporters may include atoms of Mo, Bi, Si, and W.","It is also possible to label the albumin fusion proteins with a fluorescent compound. When the fluorescently labeled antibody is exposed to light of the proper wave length, its presence can then be detected due to fluorescence. Among the most commonly used fluorescent labeling compounds are fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine, phycoerythrin, phycocyanin, allophycocyanin, ophthaldehyde and fluorescamine.","The albumin fusion protein can also be detectably labeled using fluorescence emitting metals such as Eu, or others of the lanthanide series. These metals can be attached to the antibody using such metal chelating groups as diethylenetriaminepentacetic acid (DTPA) or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA).","The albumin fusion proteins can also can be detectably labeled by coupling it to a chemiluminescent compound. The presence of the chemiluminescent-tagged albumin fusion protein is then determined by detecting the presence of luminescence that arises during the course of a chemical reaction. Examples of particularly useful chemiluminescent labeling compounds are luminol, isoluminol, theromatic acridinium ester, imidazole, acridinium salt and oxalate ester.","Likewise, a bioluminescent compound may be used to label albumin fusion proteins of the present invention. Bioluminescence is a type of chemiluminescence found in biological systems in, which a catalytic protein increases the efficiency of the chemiluminescent reaction. The presence of a bioluminescent protein is determined by detecting the presence of luminescence. Important bioluminescent compounds for purposes of labeling are luciferin, luciferase and aequorin.","Transgenic Organisms","Transgenic organisms that express the albumin fusion proteins of the invention are also included in the invention. Transgenic organisms are genetically modified organisms into which recombinant, exogenous or cloned genetic material has been transferred. Such genetic material is often referred to as a transgene. The nucleic acid sequence of the transgene may include one or more transcriptional regulatory sequences and other nucleic acid sequences such as introns, that may be necessary for optimal expression and secretion of the encoded protein. The transgene may be designed to direct the expression of the encoded protein in a manner that facilitates its recovery from the organism or from a product produced by the organism, e.g. from the milk, blood, urine, eggs, hair or seeds of the organism. The transgene may consist of nucleic acid sequences derived from the genome of the same species or of a different species than the species of the target animal. The transgene may be integrated either at a locus of a genome where that particular nucleic acid sequence is not otherwise normally found or at the normal locus for the transgene.","The term \u201cgerm cell line transgenic organism\u201d refers to a transgenic organism in which the genetic alteration or genetic information was introduced into a germ line cell, thereby conferring the ability of the transgenic organism to transfer the genetic information to offspring. If such offspring in fact possess some or all of that alteration or genetic information, then they too are transgenic organisms. The alteration or genetic information may be foreign to the species of organism to which the recipient belongs, foreign only to the particular individual recipient, or may be genetic information already possessed by the recipient. In the last case, the altered or introduced gene may be expressed differently than the native gene.","A transgenic organism may be a transgenic animal or a transgenic plant. Transgenic animals can be produced by a variety of different methods including transfection, electroporation, microinjection, gene targeting in embryonic stem cells and recombinant viral and retroviral infection (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,736,866; U.S. Pat. No. 5,602,307; Mullins et al. (1993) Hypertension 22(4):630\u2013633; Brenin et al. (1997) Surg. Oncol. 6(2)99\u2013110; Tuan (ed.), Recombinant Gene Expression Protocols, Methods in Molecular Biology No. 62, Humana Press (1997)). The method of introduction of nucleic acid fragments into recombination competent mammalian cells can be by any method which favors co-transformation of multiple nucleic acid molecules. Detailed procedures for producing transgenic animals are readily available to one skilled in the art, including the disclosures in U.S. Pat. No. 5,489,743 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,602,307.","A number of recombinant or transgenic mice have been produced, including those which-express an activated oncogene sequence (U.S. Pat. No. 4,736,866); express simian SV40 T-antigen (U.S. Pat. No. 5,728,915); lack the expression of interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) (U.S. Pat. No. 5,731,490); exhibit dopaminergic dysfunction (U.S. Pat. No. 5,723,719); express at least one human gene which participates in blood pressure control (U.S. Pat. No. 5,731,489); display greater similarity to the conditions existing in naturally occurring Alzheimer's disease (U.S. Pat. No. 5,720,936); have a reduced capacity to mediate cellular adhesion (U.S. Pat. No. 5,602,307); possess a bovine growth hormone gene (Clutter et al. (1996) Genetics 143(4):1753\u20131760); or, are capable of generating a fully human antibody response (McCarthy (1997) The Lancet 349(9049):405).","While mice and rats remain the animals of choice for most transgenic experimentation, in some instances it is preferable or even necessary to use alternative animal species. Transgenic procedures have been successfully utilized in a variety of non-murine animals, including sheep, goats, pigs, dogs, cats, monkeys, chimpanzees, hamsters, rabbits, cows and guinea pigs (see, e.g., Kim et al. (1997) Mol. Reprod. Dev. 46(4):515\u2013526; Houdebine (1995) Reprod. Nutr. Dev. 35(6):609\u2013617; Petters (1994) Reprod. Fertil. Dev. 6(5):643\u2013645; Schnieke et al. (1997) Science 278(5346):2130\u20132133; and Amoah (1997) J. Animal Science 75(2):578\u2013585).","To direct the secretion of the transgene-encoded protein of the invention into the milk of transgenic mammals, it may be put under the control of a promoter that is preferentially activated in mammary epithelial cells. Promoters that control the genes encoding milk proteins are preferred, for example the promoter for casein, beta lactoglobulin, whey acid protein, or lactalbumin (see, e.g., DiTullio (1992) BioTechnology 10:74\u201377; Clark et al. (1989) BioTechnology 7:487\u2013492; Gorton et al. (1987) BioTechnology 5:1183\u20131187; and Soulier et al. (1992) FEBS Letts. 297:13). The transgenic mammals of choice would produce large volumes of milk and have long lactating periods, for example goats, cows, camels or sheep.","An albumin fusion protein of the invention can also be expressed in a transgenic plant, e.g. a plant in which the DNA transgene is inserted into the nuclear or plastidic genome. Plant transformation procedures used to introduce foreign nucleic acids into plant cells or protoplasts are known in the art. See, in general, Methods in Enzymology Vol. 153 (\u201cRecombinant DNA Part D\u201d) 1987, Wu and Grossman Eds., Academic Press and European Patent Application EP 693554. Methods for generation of genetically engineered plants are further described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,283,184, U.S. Pat. No. 5,482,852, and European Patent Application EP 693 554, all of which are hereby incorporated by reference.","Pharmaceutical or Therapeutic Compositions","The albumin fusion proteins of the invention or formulations thereof may be administered by any conventional method including parenteral (e.g. subcutaneous or intramuscular) injection or intravenous infusion. The treatment may consist of a single dose or a plurality of doses over a period of time.","While it is possible for an albumin fusion protein of the invention to be administered alone, it is preferable to present it as a pharmaceutical formulation, together with one or more acceptable carriers. The carrier(s) must be \u201cacceptable\u201d in the sense of being compatible with the albumin fusion protein and not deleterious to the recipients thereof. Typically, the carriers will be water or saline which will be sterile and pyrogen free. Albumin fusion proteins of the invention are particularly well suited to formulation in aqueous carriers such as sterile pyrogen free water, saline or other isotonic solutions because of their extended shelf-life in solution. For instance, pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be formulated well in advance in aqueous form, for instance, weeks or months or longer time periods before being dispensed.","For example, formulations containing the albumin fusion protein may be prepared taking into account the extended shelf-life of the albumin fusion protein in aqueous formulations. As discussed above, the shelf-life of many of these Therapeutic proteins are markedly increased or prolonged after fusion to HA.","In instances where aerosol administration is appropriate, the albumin fusion proteins of the invention can be formulated as aerosols using standard procedures. The term \u201caerosol\u201d includes any gas-borne suspended phase of an albumin fusion protein of the instant invention which is capable of being inhaled into the bronchioles or nasal passages. Specifically, aerosol includes a gas-borne suspension of droplets of an albumin fusion protein of the instant invention, as may be produced in a metered dose inhaler or nebulizer, or in a mist sprayer. Aerosol also includes a dry powder composition of a compound of the instant invention suspended in air or other carrier gas, which may be delivered by insufflation from an inhaler device, for example. See Ganderton & Jones, (1987); Gonda (1990) 6:273\u2013313; and Raeburn et al. (1992) 27:143\u2013159.","The formulations of the invention are also typically non-immunogenic, in part, because of the use of the components of the albumin fusion protein being derived from the proper species. For instance, for human use, both the Therapeutic protein and albumin portions of the albumin fusion protein will typically be human. In some cases, wherein either component is non human-derived, that component may be humanized by substitution of key amino acids so that specific epitopes appear to the human immune system to be human in nature rather than foreign.","The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. Such methods include the step of bringing into association the albumin fusion protein with the carrier that constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product.","Formulations suitable for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous sterile injection solutions which may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation appropriate for the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents. The formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampules, vials or syringes, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilised) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example water for injections, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders. Dosage formulations may contain the Therapeutic protein portion at a lower molar concentration or lower dosage compared to the non-fused standard formulation for the Therapeutic protein given the extended serum half-life exhibited by many of the albumin fusion proteins of the invention.","As an example, when an albumin fusion protein of the invention comprises one of the proteins listed in the \u201cTherapeutic Protein:X\u201d column of Table 1 as one or more of the Therapeutic protein regions, the dosage form can be calculated on the basis of the potency of the albumin fusion protein relative to the potency of hGH, while taking into account the prolonged serum half-life and shelf-life of the albumin fusion proteins compared to that of native hGH. Growth hormone is typically administered at 0.3 to 30.0 IU\/kg\/week, for example 0.9 to 12.0 IU\/kg\/week, given in three or seven divided doses for a year or more. In an albumin fusion protein consisting of full length HA fused to full length GH, an equivalent dose in terms of units would represent a greater weight of agent but the dosage frequency can be reduced, for example to twice a week, once a week or less.","Formulations or compositions of the invention may be packaged together with, or included in a kit with, instructions or a package insert referring to the extended shelf-life of the albumin fusion protein component. For instance, such instructions or package inserts may address recommended storage conditions, such as time, temperature and light, taking into account the extended or prolonged shelf-life of the albumin fusion proteins of the invention. Such instructions or package inserts may also address the particular advantages of the albumin fusion proteins of the inventions, such as the ease of storage for formulations that may require use in the field, outside of controlled hospital, clinic or office conditions. As described above, formulations of the invention may be in aqueous form and may be stored under less than ideal circumstances without significant loss of therapeutic activity.","Albumin fusion proteins of the invention can also be included in nutraceuticals. For instance, certain albumin fusion proteins of the invention may be administered in natural products, including milk or milk product obtained from a transgenic mammal which expresses albumin fusion protein. Such compositions can also include plant or plant products obtained from a transgenic plant which expresses the albumin fusion protein. The albumin fusion protein can also be provided in powder or tablet form, with or without other known additives, carriers, fillers and diluents. Nutraceuticals are described in Scott Hegenhart, , December 1993.","The invention also provides methods of treatment and\/or prevention of diseases or disorders (such as, for example, any one or more of the diseases or disorders disclosed herein) by administration to a subject of an effective amount of an albumin fusion protein of the invention or a polynucleotide encoding an albumin fusion protein of the invention (\u201calbumin fusion polynucleotide\u201d) in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.","The albumin fusion protein and\/or polynucleotide will be formulated and dosed in a fashion consistent with good medical practice, taking into account the clinical condition of the individual patient (especially the side effects of treatment with the albumin fusion protein and\/or polynucleotide alone), the site of delivery, the method of administration, the scheduling of administration, and other factors known to practitioners. The \u201ceffective amount\u201d for purposes herein is thus determined by such considerations.","As a general proposition, the total pharmaceutically effective amount of the albumin fusion protein administered parenterally per dose will be in the range of about lug\/kg\/day to 10 mg\/kg\/day of patient body weight, although, as noted above, this will be subject to therapeutic discretion. More preferably, this dose is at least 0.01 mg\/kg\/day, and most preferably for humans between about 0.01 and 1 mg\/kg\/day for the hormone. If given continuously, the albumin fusion protein is typically administered at a dose rate of about 1 ug\/kg\/hour to about 50 ug\/kg\/hour, either by 1\u20134 injections per day or by continuous subcutaneous infusions, for example, using a mini-pump.

Liposomes containing the albumin fusion protein and\/or polynucleotide are prepared by methods known per se: DE 3,218,121; Epstein et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA) 82:3688\u20133692 (1985); Hwang et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA) 77:4030\u20134034 (1980); EP 52,322; EP 36,676; EP 88,046; EP 143,949; EP 142,641; Japanese Pat. Appl. 83-118008; U.S. Pat.

Ordinarily, the liposomes are of the small (about 200\u2013800 Angstroms) unilamellar type in which the lipid content is greater than about 30 mol. percent cholesterol, the selected proportion being adjusted for the optimal Therapeutic.","In yet an additional embodiment, the albumin fusion proteins and\/or polynucleotides of the invention are delivered by way of a pump (see Langer, supra; Sefton, CRC Crit. Ref. Biomed. Eng. 14:201 (1987); Buchwald et al., Surgery 88:507 (1980); Saudek et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 321:574 (1989)).","Other controlled release systems are discussed in the review by Langer (249:1527\u20131533 (1990)).","For parenteral administration, in one embodiment, the albumin fusion protein and\/or polynucleotide is formulated generally by mixing it at the desired degree of purity, in a unit dosage injectable form (solution, suspension, or emulsion), with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, i.e., one that is non-toxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed and is compatible with other ingredients of the formulation. For example, the formulation preferably does not include oxidizing agents and other compounds that are known to be deleterious to the Therapeutic.","Generally, the formulations are prepared by contacting the albumin fusion protein and\/or polynucleotide uniformly and intimately with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both. Then, if necessary, the product is shaped into the desired formulation. Preferably the carrier is a parenteral carrier, more preferably a solution that is isotonic with the blood of the recipient. Examples of such carrier vehicles include water, saline, Ringer's solution, and dextrose solution. Non-aqueous vehicles such as fixed oils and ethyl oleate are also useful herein, as well as liposomes.","The carrier suitably contains minor amounts of additives such as substances that enhance isotonicity and chemical stability. Such materials are non-toxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed, and include buffers such as phosphate, citrate, succinate, acetic acid, and other organic acids or their salts; antioxidants such as ascorbic acid; low molecular weight (less than about ten residues) polypeptides, e.g., polyarginine or tripeptides; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids, such as glycine, glutamic acid, aspartic acid, or arginine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates including cellulose or its derivatives, glucose, manose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugar alcohols such as mannitol or sorbitol; counterions such as sodium; and\/or nonionic surfactants such as polysorbates, poloxamers, or PEG.","The albumin fusion protein is typically formulated in such vehicles at a concentration of about 0.1 mg\/ml to 100 mg\/ml, preferably 1\u201310 mg\/ml, at a pH of about 3 to 8. It will be understood that the use of certain of the foregoing excipients, carriers, or stabilizers will result in the formation of polypeptide salts.","Any pharmaceutical used for therapeutic administration can be sterile. Sterility is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes (e.g., 0.2 micron membranes). Albumin fusion proteins and\/or polynucleotides generally are placed into a container having a sterile access port, for example, an intravenous solution bag or vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle.","Albumin fusion proteins and\/or polynucleotides ordinarily will be stored in unit or multi-dose containers, for example, sealed ampoules or vials, as an aqueous solution or as a lyophilized formulation for reconstitution. As an example of a lyophilized formulation, 10-ml vials are filled with 5 ml of sterile-filtered 1% (w\/v) aqueous albumin fusion protein and\/or polynucleotide solution, and the resulting mixture is lyophilized. The infusion solution is prepared by reconstituting the lyophilized albumin fusion protein and\/or polynucleotide using bacteriostatic Water-for-Injection.","In a specific and preferred embodiment, the Albumin fusion protein formulations comprises 0.01 M sodium phosphate, 0.15 mM sodium chloride, 0.16 micromole sodium octanoate\/milligram of fusion protein, 15 micrograms\/milliliter polysorbate 80, pH 7.2. In another specific and preferred embodiment, the Albumin fusion protein formulations consists 0.01 M sodium phosphate, 0.15 mM sodium chloride, 0.16 micromole sodium octanoate\/milligram of fusion protein, 15 micrograms\/milliliter polysorbate 80, pH 7.2. The pH and buffer are chosen to match physiological conditions and the salt is added as a tonicifier. Sodium octanoate has-been chosen due to its reported ability to increase the thermal stability of the protein in solution. Finally, polysorbate has been added as a generic surfactant, which lowers the surface tension of the solution and lowers non-specific adsorption of the albumin fusion protein to the container closure system.","The invention also provides a pharmaceutical pack or kit comprising one or more containers filled with one or more of the ingredients of the albumin fusion proteins and\/or polynucleotides of the invention. Associated with such container(s) can be a notice in the form prescribed by a governmental agency regulating the manufacture, use or sale of pharmaceuticals or biological products, which notice reflects approval by the agency of manufacture, use or sale for human administration.

Optionally associated with such container(s) can be a notice in the form prescribed by a governmental agency regulating the manufacture, use or sale of pharmaceuticals or biological products, which notice reflects approval by the agency of manufacture, use or sale for human administration.","Gene Therapy","Constructs encoding albumin fusion proteins of the invention can be used as a part of a gene therapy protocol to deliver therapeutically effective doses of the albumin fusion protein. A preferred approach for in vivo introduction of nucleic acid into a cell is by use of a viral vector containing nucleic acid, encoding an albumin fusion protein of the invention. Infection of cells with a viral vector has the advantage that a large proportion of the targeted cells can receive the nucleic acid. Additionally, molecules encoded within the viral vector, e.g., by a cDNA contained in the viral vector, are expressed efficiently in cells which have taken up viral vector nucleic acid.","Retrovirus vectors and adeno-associated virus vectors can be used as a recombinant gene delivery system for the transfer of exogenous nucleic acid molecules encoding albumin fusion proteins in vivo. These vectors provide efficient delivery of nucleic acids into cells, and the transferred nucleic acids are stably integrated into the chromosomal DNA of the host. The development of specialized cell lines (termed \u201cpackaging cells\u201d) which produce only replication-defective retroviruses has increased the utility of retroviruses for gene therapy, and defective retroviruses are characterized for use in gene transfer for gene therapy purposes (for a review see Miller, A. D. (1990) 76:271). A replication defective retrovirus can be packaged into virions which can be used to infect a target cell through the use of a helper virus by standard techniques. Protocols for producing recombinant retroviruses and for infecting cells in vitro or in vivo with such viruses can be found in Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Ausubel, F. M. et al., (eds.) Greene Publishing Associates, (1989), Sections 9.10\u20139.14 and other standard laboratory manuals.","Another viral gene delivery system useful in the present invention uses adenovirus-derived vectors. The genome of an adenovirus can be manipulated such that it encodes and expresses a gene product of interest but is inactivated in terms of its ability to replicate in a normal lytic viral life cycle. See, for example, Berkner et al., 6:616 (1988); Rosenfeld et al., Science 252:431\u2013434 (1991); and Rosenfeld et al., 68:143\u2013155 (1992). Suitable adenoviral vectors derived from the adenovirus strain Ad type 5 d1324 or other strains of adenovirus (e.g., Ad2, Ad3, Ad7 etc.) are known to those skilled in the art. Recombinant adenoviruses can be advantageous in certain circumstances in that they are not capable of infecting nondividing cells and can be used to infect a wide variety of cell types, including epithelial cells (Rosenfeld et al., (1992) cited supra). Furthermore, the virus particle is relatively stable and amenable to purification and concentration, and as above, can be modified so as to affect the spectrum of infectivity. Additionally, introduced adenoviral DNA (and foreign DNA contained therein) is not integrated into the genome of a host cell but remains episomal, thereby avoiding potential problems that can occur as a result of insertional mutagenesis in situations where introduced DNA becomes integrated into the host genome (e.g., retroviral DNA). Moreover, the carrying capacity of the adenoviral genome for foreign DNA is large (up to 8 kilobases) relative to other gene delivery vectors (Berkner et al., cited supra; Haj-Ahmand et al., J. Virol. 57:267 (1986)).","In another embodiment, non-viral gene delivery systems of the present invention rely on endocytic pathways for the uptake of the subject nucleotide molecule by the targeted cell. Exemplary gene delivery systems of this type include liposomal derived systems, poly-lysine conjugates, and artificial viral envelopes. In a representative embodiment, a nucleic acid molecule encoding an albumin fusion protein of the invention can be entrapped in liposomes bearing positive charges on their surface (e.g., lipofectins) and (optionally) which are tagged with antibodies against cell surface antigens of the target tissue (Mizuno et al. (1992) 20:547\u2013551; PCT publication WO91\/06309; Japanese patent application 1047381; and European patent publication EP-A-43075).","Gene delivery systems for a gene encoding an albumin fusion protein of the invention can be introduced into a patient by any of a number of methods. For instance, a pharmaceutical preparation of the gene delivery system can be introduced systemically, e.g. by intravenous injection, and specific transduction of the protein in the target cells occurs predominantly from specificity of transfection provided by the gene delivery vehicle, cell-type or tissue-type expression due to the transcriptional regulatory sequences controlling expression of the receptor gene, or a combination thereof. In other embodiments, initial delivery of the recombinant gene is more limited with introduction into the animal being quite localized. For example, the gene delivery vehicle can be introduced by catheter (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,328,470) or by Stereotactic injection (e.g. Chen et al. (1994) 91: 3054\u20133057). The pharmaceutical preparation of the gene therapy construct can consist essentially of the gene delivery system in an acceptable diluent, or can comprise a slow release matrix in which the gene delivery vehicle is imbedded. Where the albumin fusion protein can be produced intact from recombinant cells, e.g. retroviral vectors, the pharmaceutical preparation can comprise one or more cells which produce the albumin fusion protein.","Additional Gene Therapy Methods","Also encompassed by the invention are gene therapy methods for treating or preventing disorders, diseases and conditions. The gene therapy methods relate to the introduction of nucleic acid (DNA, RNA and antisense DNA or RNA) sequences into an animal to achieve expression of an albumin fusion protein of the invention. This method requires a polynucleotide which codes for an albumin fusion protein of the present invention operatively linked to a promoter and any other genetic elements necessary for the expression of the fusion protein by the target tissue. Such gene therapy and delivery techniques are known in the art, see, for example, WO90\/11092, which is herein incorporated by reference.","Thus, for example, cells from a patient may be engineered with a polynucleotide (DNA or RNA) comprising a promoter operably linked to a polynucleotide encoding an albumin fusion protein of the present invention ex vivo, with the engineered cells then being provided to a patient to be treated with the fusion protein of the present invention. Such methods are well-known in the art. For example, see Belldegrun, A., et al., J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 85: 207\u2013216 (1993); Ferrantini, M. et al., Cancer Research 53: 1107\u20131112 (1993); Ferrantini, M. et al., J. Immunology 153: 4604\u20134615 (1994); Kaido, T., et al., Int. J. Cancer 60: 221\u2013229 (1995); Ogura, H., et al., Cancer Research 50: 5102\u20135106 (1990); Santodonato, L., et al., Human Gene Therapy 7:1\u201310 (1996); Santodonato, L., et al., Gene Therapy 4:1246\u20131255 (1997); and Zhang, J.-F. et al., Cancer Gene Therapy 3: 31\u201338 (1996)), which are herein incorporated by reference. In one embodiment, the cells which are engineered are arterial cells. The arterial cells may be reintroduced into the patient through direct injection to the artery, the tissues surrounding the artery, or through catheter injection.","As discussed in more detail below, the polynucleotide constructs can be delivered by any method that delivers injectable materials to the cells of an animal, such as, injection into the interstitial space of tissues (heart, muscle, skin, lung, liver, and the like). The polynucleotide constructs may be delivered in a pharmaceutically acceptable liquid or aqueous carrier.","In one embodiment, polynucleotides encoding the albumin fusion proteins of the present invention is delivered as a naked polynucleotide. The term \u201cnaked\u201d polynucleotide, DNA or RNA refers to sequences that are free from any delivery vehicle that acts to assist, promote or facilitate entry into the cell, including viral sequences, viral particles, liposome formulations, lipofectin or precipitating agents and the like. However, polynucleotides encoding the albumin fusion proteins of the present invention can also be delivered in liposome formulations and lipofectin formulations and the like can be prepared by methods well known to those skilled in the art. Such methods are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,593,972, 5,589,466, and 5,580,859, which are herein incorporated by reference.","The polynucleotide vector constructs used in the gene therapy method are preferably constructs that will not integrate into the host genome nor will they contain sequences that allow for replication. Appropriate vectors include pWLNEO, pSV2CAT, pOG44, pXT1 and pSG available from Stratagene; pSVK3, pBPV, pMSG and pSVL available from Pharmacia; and pEF1\/V5, pcDNA3.1, and pRc\/CMV2 available from Invitrogen. Other suitable vectors will be readily apparent to the skilled artisan.","Any strong promoter known to those skilled in the art can be used for driving the expression of the polynucleotide sequence. Suitable promoters include adenoviral promoters, such as the adenoviral major late promoter; or heterologous promoters, such as the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter; the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) promoter; inducible promoters, such as the MMT promoter, the metallothionein promoter; heat shock promoters; the albumin promoter; the ApoAI promoter; human globin promoters; viral thymidine kinase promoters, such as the Herpes Simplex thymidine kinase promoter; retroviral LTRs; the b-actin promoter; and human growth hormone promoters. The promoter also may be the native promoter for the gene corresponding to the Therapeutic protein portion of the albumin fusion proteins of the invention.","Unlike other gene therapy techniques, one major advantage of introducing naked nucleic acid sequences into target cells is the transitory nature of the polynucleotide synthesis in the cells. Studies have shown that non-replicating DNA sequences can be introduced into cells to provide production of the desired polypeptide for periods of up to six months.","The polynucleotide construct can be delivered to the interstitial space of tissues within the an animal, including of muscle, skin, brain, lung, liver, spleen, bone marrow, thymus, heart, lymph, blood, bone, cartilage, pancreas, kidney, gall bladder, stomach, intestine, testis, ovary, uterus, rectum, nervous system, eye, gland, and connective tissue. Interstitial space of the tissues comprises the intercellular, fluid, mucopolysaccharide matrix among the reticular fibers of organ tissues, elastic fibers in the walls of vessels or chambers, collagen fibers of fibrous tissues, or that same matrix within connective tissue ensheathing muscle cells or in the lacunae of bone. It is similarly the space occupied by the plasma of the circulation and the lymph fluid of the lymphatic channels. Delivery to the interstitial space of muscle tissue is preferred for the reasons discussed below. They may be conveniently delivered by injection into the tissues comprising these cells. They are preferably delivered to and expressed in persistent, non-dividing cells which are differentiated, although delivery and expression may be achieved in non-differentiated or less completely differentiated cells, such as, for example, stem cells of blood or skin fibroblasts. In vivo muscle cells are particularly competent in their ability to take up and express polynucleotides.","For the naked nucleic acid sequence injection, an effective dosage amount of DNA or RNA will be in the range of from about 0.05 mg\/kg body weight to about 50 mg\/kg body weight. Preferably the dosage will be from about 0.005 mg\/kg to about 20 mg\/kg and more preferably from about 0.05 mg\/kg to about 5 mg\/kg. Of course, as the artisan of ordinary skill will appreciate, this dosage will vary according to the tissue site of injection. The appropriate and effective dosage of nucleic acid sequence can readily be determined by those of ordinary skill in the art and may depend on the condition being treated and the route of administration.","The preferred route of administration is by the parenteral route of injection into the interstitial space of tissues. However, other parenteral routes may also be used, such as, inhalation of an aerosol formulation particularly for delivery to lungs or bronchial tissues, throat or mucous membranes of the nose. In addition, naked DNA constructs can be delivered to arteries during angioplasty by the catheter used in the procedure.","The naked polynucleotides are delivered by any method known in the art, including, but not limited to, direct needle injection at the delivery site, intravenous injection, topical administration, catheter infusion, and so-called \u201cgene guns\u201d. These delivery methods are known in the art.","The constructs may also be delivered with delivery vehicles such as viral sequences, viral particles, liposome formulations, lipofectin, precipitating agents, etc. Such methods of delivery are known in the art.","In certain embodiments, the polynucleotide constructs are complexed in a liposome preparation. Liposomal preparations for use in the instant invention include cationic (positively charged), anionic (negatively charged) and neutral preparations. However, cationic liposomes are particularly preferred because a tight charge complex can be formed between the cationic liposome and the polyanionic nucleic acid. Cationic liposomes have been shown to mediate intracellular delivery of plasmid DNA (Felgner et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (1987) 84:7413\u20137416, which is herein incorporated by reference); mRNA (Malone et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (1989) 86:6077\u20136081, which is herein incorporated by reference); and purified transcription factors (Debs et al., J. Biol. Chem. (1990) 265:10189\u201310192, which is herein incorporated by reference), in functional form.","Cationic liposomes are readily available. For example, N[1-2,3-dioleyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-triethylammonium (DOTMA) liposomes are particularly useful and are available under the trademark Lipofectin, from GIBCO BRL, Grand Island, N.Y. (See, also, Felgner et al., Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA (1987) 84:7413\u20137416, which is herein incorporated by reference). Other commercially available liposomes include transfectace (DDAB\/DOPE) and DOTAP\/DOPE (Boehringer).","Other cationic liposomes can be prepared from readily available materials using techniques well known in the art. See, e.g. PCT Publication No. WO 90\/11092 (which is herein incorporated by reference) for a description of the synthesis of DOTAP (1,2-bis(oleoyloxy)-3-(trimethylammonio)propane) liposomes. Preparation of DOTMA liposomes is explained in the literature, see, e.g., P. Felgner et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84:7413\u20137417, which is herein incorporated by reference. Similar methods can be used to prepare liposomes from other cationic lipid materials.","Similarly, anionic and neutral liposomes are readily available, such as from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, Ala.), or can be easily prepared using readily available materials. Such materials include phosphatidyl, choline, cholesterol, phosphatidyl ethanolamine, dioleoylphosphatidyl choline (DOPC), dioleoylphosphatidyl glycerol (DOPG), dioleoylphoshatidyl ethanolamine (DOPE), among others. These materials can also be mixed with the DOTMA and DOTAP starting materials in appropriate ratios. Methods for making liposomes using these materials are well known in the art.","For example, commercially dioleoylphosphatidyl choline (DOPC), dioleoylphosphatidyl glycerol (DOPG), and dioleoylphosphatidyl ethanolamine (DOPE) can be used in various combinations to make conventional liposomes, with or without the addition of cholesterol. Thus, for example, DOPG\/DOPC vesicles can be prepared by drying 50 mg each of DOPG and DOPC under a stream of nitrogen gas into a sonication vial. The sample is placed under a vacuum pump overnight and is hydrated the following day with deionized water. The sample is then sonicated for 2 hours in a capped vial, using a Heat Systems model 350 sonicator equipped with an inverted cup (bath type) probe at the maximum setting while the bath is circulated at 15EC. Alternatively, negatively charged vesicles can be prepared without sonication to produce multilamellar vesicles or by extrusion through nucleopore membranes to produce unilamellar vesicles of discrete size. Other methods are known and available to those of skill in the art.","The liposomes can comprise multilamellar vesicles (MLVs), small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs), or large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs), with SUVs being preferred. The various liposome-nucleic acid complexes are prepared using methods well known in the art. See, e.g., Straubinger et al., Methods of Immunology (1983), 101:512\u2013527, which is herein incorporated by reference. For example, MLVs containing nucleic acid can be prepared by depositing a thin film of phospholipid on the walls of a glass tube and subsequently hydrating with a solution of the material to be encapsulated. SUVs are prepared by extended sonication of MLVs to produce a homogeneous population of unilamellar liposomes. The material to be entrapped is added to a suspension of preformed MLVs and then sonicated. When using liposomes containing cationic lipids, the dried lipid film is resuspended in an appropriate solution such as sterile water or an isotonic buffer solution such as 10 mM Tris\/NaCl, sonicated, and then the preformed liposomes are mixed directly with the DNA. The liposome and DNA form a very stable complex due to binding of the positively charged liposomes to the cationic DNA. SUVs find use with small nucleic acid fragments. LUVs are prepared by a number of methods, well known in the art. Commonly used methods include Ca-EDTA chelation (Papahadjopoulos et al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta (1975) 394:483; Wilson et al., Cell 17:77 (1979)); ether injection (Deamer, D. and Bangham, A., Biochim. Biophys. Acta 443:629 (1976); Ostro et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 76:836 (1977); Fraley et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 76:3348 (1979)); detergent dialysis (Enoch, H. and Strittmatter, P., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 76:145 (1979)); and reverse-phase evaporation (REV) (Fraley et al., J. Biol. Chem. 255:10431 (1980); Szoka, F. and Papahadjopoulos, D., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 75:145 (1978); Schaefer-Ridder et al., Science 215:166 (1982)), which are herein incorporated by reference.","Generally, the ratio of DNA to liposomes will be from about 10:1 to about 1:10. Preferably, the ration will be from about 5:1 to about 1:5. More preferably, the ration will be about 3:1 to about 1:3. Still more preferably, the ratio will be about 1:1.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,676,954 (which is herein incorporated by reference) reports on the injection of genetic material, complexed with cationic liposomes carriers, into mice. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,897,355, 4,946,787, 5,049,386, 5,459,127, 5,589,466, 5,693,622, 5,580,859, 5,703,055, and international publication no.

Nos. 5,589,466, 5,693,622, 5,580,859, 5,703,055, and international publication no. WO 94\/9469 provide methods for delivering DNA-cationic lipid complexes to mammals.","In certain embodiments, cells are engineered, ex vivo or in vivo, using a retroviral particle containing RNA which comprises a sequence encoding an albumin fusion protein of the present invention. Retroviruses from which the retroviral plasmid vectors may be derived include, but are not limited to, Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus, spleen necrosis virus, Rous sarcoma Virus, Harvey Sarcoma Virus, avian leukosis virus, gibbon ape leukemia virus, human immunodeficiency virus, Myeloproliferative Sarcoma Virus, and mammary tumor virus.","The retroviral plasmid vector is employed to transduce packaging cell lines to form producer cell lines. Examples of packaging cells which may be transfected include, but are not limited to, the PE501, PA317, R-2, R-AM, PA12, T19-14X, VT-19-17-H2, RCRE, RCRIP, GP+E-86, GP+envAm12, and DAN cell lines as described in Miller, Human Gene Therapy 1:5\u201314 (1990), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The vector may transduce the packaging cells through any means known in the art. Such means include, but are not limited to, electroporation, the use of liposomes, and CaPOprecipitation. In one alternative, the retroviral plasmid vector may be encapsulated into a liposome, or coupled to a lipid, and then administered to a host.","The producer cell line generates infectious retroviral vector particles which include polynucleotide encoding an albumin fusion protein of the present invention. Such retroviral vector particles then may be employed, to transduce eukaryotic cells, either in vitro or in vivo. The transduced eukaryotic cells will express a fusion protin of the present invention.","In certain other embodiments, cells are engineered, ex vivo or in vivo, with polynucleotide contained in an adenovirus vector. Adenovirus can be manipulated such that it encodes and expresses fusion protein of the present invention, and at the same time is inactivated in terms of its ability to replicate in a normal lytic viral life cycle. Adenovirus expression is achieved without integration of the viral DNA into the host cell chromosome, thereby alleviating concerns about insertional mutagenesis. Furthermore, adenoviruses have been used as live enteric vaccines for many years with an excellent safety profile (Schwartz et al. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 109:233\u2013238 (1974)). Finally, adenovirus mediated gene transfer has been demonstrated in a number of instances including transfer of alpha-1-antitrypsin and CFTR to the lungs of cotton rats (Rosenfeld, M. A. et al. (1991) Science 252:431\u2013434; Rosenfeld et al., (1992) Cell 68:143\u2013155). Furthermore, extensive studies to attempt to establish adenovirus as a causative agent in human cancer were uniformly negative (Green, M. et al. (1979) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 76:6606).","Suitable adenoviral vectors useful in the present invention are described, for example, in Kozarsky and Wilson, Curr. Opin. Genet. Devel. 3:499\u2013503 (1993); Rosenfeld et al., Cell 68:143\u2013155 (1992); Engelhardt et al., Human Genet. Ther. 4:759\u2013769 (1993); Yang et al., Nature Genet. 7:362\u2013369 (1994); Wilson et al., Nature 365:691\u2013692 (1993); and U.S. Pat. No. 5,652,224, which are herein incorporated by reference. For example, the adenovirus vector Ad2 is useful and can be grown in human 293 cells. These cells contain the E1 region of adenovirus and constitutively express E1a and E1b, which complement the defective adenoviruses by providing the products of the genes deleted from the vector. In addition to Ad2, other varieties of adenovirus (e.g., Ad3, Ad5, and Ad7) are also useful in the present invention.","Preferably, the adenoviruses used in the present invention are replication deficient. Replication deficient adenoviruses require the aid of a helper virus and\/or packaging cell line to form infectious particles. The resulting virus is capable of infecting cells and can express a polynucleotide of interest which is operably linked to a promoter, but cannot replicate in most cells. Replication deficient adenoviruses may be deleted in one or more of all or a portion of the following genes: E1a, E1b, E3, E4, E2a, or L1 through L5.","In certain other embodiments, the cells are engineered, ex vivo or in vivo, using an adeno-associated virus (AAV). AAVs are naturally occurring defective viruses that require helper viruses to produce infectious particles (Muzyczka, N., Curr. Topics in Microbiol. Immunol. 158:97 (1992)). It is also one of the few viruses that may integrate its DNA into non-dividing cells. Vectors containing as little as 300 base pairs of AAV can be packaged and can integrate, but space for exogenous DNA is limited to about 4.5 kb. Methods for producing and using such AAVs are known in the art. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,139,941, 5,173,414, 5,354,678, 5,436,146, 5,474,935, 5,478,745, and 5,589,377.","For example, an appropriate AAV vector for use in the present invention will include all the sequences necessary for DNA replication, encapsidation, and host-cell integration. The polynucleotide construct is inserted into the AAV vector using standard cloning methods, such as those found in Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Press (1989). The recombinant AAV vector is then transfected into packaging cells which are infected with a helper virus, using any standard technique, including lipofection, electroporation, calcium phosphate precipitation, etc. Appropriate helper viruses include adenoviruses, cytomegaloviruses, vaccinia viruses, or herpes viruses. Once the packaging cells are transfected and infected, they will produce infectious AAV viral particles which contain the polynucleotide construct. These viral particles are then used to transduce eukaryotic cells, either ex vivo or in vivo. The transduced cells will contain the polynucleotide construct integrated into its genome, and will express a fusion protein of the invention.","Another method of gene therapy involves operably associating heterologous control regions and endogenous polynucleotide sequences (e.g. encoding a polypeptide of the present invention) via homologous recombination (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,641,670, issued Jun. 24, 1997; International Publication No. WO 96\/29411, published Sep. 26, 1996; International Publication No. WO 94\/12650, published Aug. 4, 1994; Koller et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:8932\u20138935 (1989); and Zijlstra et al., Nature 342:435\u2013438 (1989), which are herein encorporated by reference. This method involves the activation of a gene which is present in the target cells, but which is not normally expressed in the cells, or is expressed at a lower level than desired.","Polynucleotide constructs are made, using standard techniques known in the art, which contain the promoter with targeting sequences flanking the promoter. Suitable promoters are described herein. The targeting sequence is sufficiently complementary to an endogenous sequence to permit homologous recombination of the promoter-targeting sequence with the endogenous sequence. The targeting sequence will be sufficiently near the 5\u2032 end of the desired endogenous polynucleotide sequence so the promoter will be operably linked to the endogenous sequence upon homologous recombination.","The promoter and the targeting sequences can be amplified using PCR. Preferably, the amplified promoter contains distinct restriction enzyme sites on the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends. Preferably, the 3\u2032 end of the first targeting sequence contains the same restriction enzyme site as the 5\u2032 end of the amplified promoter and the 5\u2032 end of the second targeting sequence contains the same restriction site as the 3\u2032 end of the amplified promoter. The amplified promoter and targeting sequences are digested and ligated together.","The promoter-targeting sequence construct is delivered to the cells, either as naked polynucleotide, or in conjunction with transfection-facilitating agents, such as liposomes, viral sequences, viral particles, whole viruses, lipofection, precipitating agents, etc., described in more detail above. The P promoter-targeting sequence can be delivered by any method, included direct needle injection, intravenous injection, topical administration, catheter infusion, particle accelerators, etc. The methods are described in more detail below.","The promoter-targeting sequence construct is taken up by cells. Homologous recombination between the construct and the endogenous sequence takes place, such that an endogenous sequence is placed under the control of the promoter. The promoter then drives the expression of the endogenous sequence.","The polynucleotide encoding an albumin fusion protein of the present invention may contain a secretory signal sequence that facilitates secretion of the protein. Typically, the signal sequence is positioned in the coding region of the polynucleotide to be expressed towards or at the 5\u2032 end of the coding region. The signal sequence may be homologous or heterologous to the polynucleotide of interest and may be homologous or heterologous to the cells to be transfected. Additionally, the signal sequence may be chemically synthesized using methods known in the art.","Any mode of administration of any of the above-described polynucleotides constructs can be used so long as the mode results in the expression of one or more molecules in an amount sufficient to provide a therapeutic effect. This includes direct needle injection, systemic injection, catheter infusion, biolistic injectors, particle accelerators (i.e., \u201cgene guns\u201d), gelfoam sponge depots, other commercially available depot materials, osmotic pumps (e.g., Alza minipumps), oral or suppositorial solid (tablet or pill) pharmaceutical formulations, and decanting or topical applications during surgery. For example, direct injection of naked calcium phosphate-precipitated plasmid into rat liver and rat spleen or a protein-coated plasmid into the portal vein has resulted in gene expression of the foreign gene in the rat livers (Kaneda et al., Science 243:375 (1989)).","A preferred method of local administration is by direct injection. Preferably, an albumin fusion protein of the present invention complexed with a delivery vehicle is administered by direct injection into or locally within the area of arteries. Administration of a composition locally within the area of arteries refers to injecting the composition centimeters and preferably, millimeters within arteries.","Another method of local administration is to contact a polynucleotide construct of the present invention in or around a surgical wound. For example, a patient can undergo surgery and the polynucleotide construct can be coated on the surface of tissue inside the wound or the construct can be injected into areas of tissue inside the wound.","Therapeutic compositions useful in systemic administration, include fusion proteins of the present invention complexed to a targeted delivery vehicle of the present invention. Suitable delivery vehicles for use with systemic administration comprise liposomes comprising ligands for targeting the vehicle to a particular site. In specific embodiments, suitable delivery vehicles for use with systemic administration comprise liposomes comprising albumin fusion proteins of the invention for targeting the vehicle to a particular site.","Preferred methods of systemic administration, include intravenous injection, aerosol, oral and percutaneous (topical) delivery. Intravenous injections can be performed using methods standard in the art. Aerosol delivery can also be performed using methods standard in the art (see, for example, Stribling et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 189:11277\u201311281, 1992, which is incorporated herein by reference). Oral delivery can be performed by complexing a polynucleotide construct of the present invention to a carrier capable of withstanding degradation by digestive enzymes in the gut of an animal. Examples of such carriers, include plastic capsules or tablets, such as those known in the art. Topical delivery can be performed by mixing a polynucleotide construct of the present invention with a lipophilic reagent (e.g., DMSO) that is capable of passing into the skin.","Determining an effective amount of substance to be delivered can depend upon a number of factors including, for example, the chemical structure and biological activity of the substance, the age and weight of the animal, the precise condition requiring treatment and its severity, and the route of administration. The frequency of treatments depends upon a number of factors, such as the amount of polynucleotide constructs administered per dose, as well as the health and history of the subject. The precise amount, number of doses, and timing of doses will be determined by the attending physician or veterinarian.","Albumin fusion proteins of the present invention can be administered to any animal, preferably to mammals and birds. Preferred mammals include humans, dogs, cats, mice, rats, rabbits sheep, cattle, horses and pigs, with humans being particularly preferred.","Biological Activities","Albumin fusion proteins and\/or polynucleotides encoding albumin fusion proteins of the present invention, can be used in assays to test for one or more biological activities. If an albumin fusion protein and\/or polynucleotide exhibits an activity in a particular assay, it is likely that the Therapeutic protein corresponding to the fusion portein may be involved in the diseases associated with the biological activity. Thus, the fusion protein could be used to treat the associated disease.","In preferred embodiments, the present invention encompasses a method of treating a disease or disorder listed in the \u201cPreferred Indication Y\u201d column of Table 1 comprising administering to a patient in which such treatment, prevention or amelioration is desired an albumin fusion protein of the invention that comprises a Therapeutic protein portion corresponding to a Therapeutic protein disclosed in the \u201cTherapeutic Protein X\u201d column of Table 1 (in the same row as the disease or disorder to be treated is listed in the \u201cPreferred Indication Y\u201d column of Table 1) in an amount effective to treat, prevent or ameliorate the disease or disorder.","In a further preferred embodiment, the present invention encompasses a method of treating a disease or disorder listed for a particular Therapeutic protein in the \u201cPreferred Indication:Y\u201d column of Table 1 comprising administering to a patient in which such treatment, prevention or amelioration is desired an albumin fusion protein of the invention that comprises a Therapeutic protein portion corresponding to the Therapeutic protein for which the indications in the Examples are related in an amount effective to treat, prevent or ameliorate the disease or disorder.","Specifically contemplated by the present invention are albumin fusion proteins produced by a cell when encoded by the polynucleotides that encode SEQ ID NO:Y. When these polynucleotides are used to express the encoded protein from a cell, the cell's natural secretion and processing steps produces a protein that lacks the signal sequence explicitly listed in columns 4 and\/or 11 of Table 2. The specific amino acid sequence of the listed signal sequence is shown in the specification or is well known in the art. Thus, most preferred embodiments of the present invention include the albumin fusion protein produced by a cell (which would lack the leader sequence shown in columns 4 and\/or 11 of Table 2). Also most preferred are polypeptides comprising SEQ ID NO:Y without the specific leader sequence listed in columns 4 and\/or 11 of Table 2. Compositions comprising these two preferred embodiments, including pharmaceutical compositions, are also preferred. These albumin fusion proteins are specifically contemplated to treat, prevent, or ameliorate a disease or disorder listed for a particular Therapeutic protein in the \u201cPreferred Indication:Y\u201d column of Table 1.","In preferred embodiments, fusion proteins of the present invention may be used in the diagnosis, prognosis, prevention and\/or treatment of diseases and\/or disorders relating to diseases and disorders of the endocrine system (see, for example, \u201cEndocrine Disorders\u201d section below), the nervous system (see, for example, \u201cNeurological Disorders\u201d section below), the immune system (see, for example, \u201cImmune Activity\u201d section below), respiratory system (see, for example, \u201cRespiratory Disorders\u201d section below), cardiovascular system (see, for example, \u201cCardiovascular Disorders\u201d section below), reproductive system (see, for example, \u201cReproductive System Disorders\u201d section below) digestive system (see, for example, \u201cGastrointestinal Disorders\u201d section below), diseases and\/or disorders relating to cell proliferation (see, for example, \u201cHyperproliferative Disorders\u201d section below), and\/or diseases or disorders relating to the blood (see, for example, \u201cBlood-Related Disorders\u201d section below).","In certain embodiments, an albumin fusion protein of the present invention may be used to diagnose and\/or prognose diseases and\/or disorders associated with the tissue(s) in which the gene corresponding to the Therapeutic protein portion of the fusion protein of the invention is expressed.","Thus, fusion proteins of the invention and polynucleotides encoding albumin fusion proteins of the invention are useful in the diagnosis, detection and\/or treatment of diseases and\/or disorders associated with activities that include, but are not limited to, prohormone activation, neurotransmitter activity, cellular signaling, cellular proliferation, cellular differentiation, and cell migration.","More generally, fusion proteins of the invention and polynucleotides encoding albumin fusion proteins of the invention may be useful for the diagnosis, prognosis, prevention and\/or treatment of diseases and\/or disorders associated with the following systems.","Immune Activity","Albumin fusion proteins of the invention and polynucleotides encoding albumin fusion proteins of the invention may be useful in treating, preventing, diagnosing and\/or prognosing diseases, disorders, and\/or conditions of the immune system, by, for example, activating or inhibiting the proliferation, differentiation, or mobilization (chemotaxis) of immune cells. Immune cells develop through a process called hematopoiesis, producing myeloid (platelets, red blood cells, neutrophils, and macrophages) and lymphoid (B and T lymphocytes) cells from pluripotent stem cells. The etiology of these immune diseases, disorders, and\/or conditions may be genetic, somatic, such as cancer and some autoimmune diseases, acquired (e.g., by chemotherapy or toxins), or infectious. Moreover, fusion proteins of the invention and\/or polynucleotides encoding albumin fusion proteins of the invention can be used as a marker or detector of a particular immune system disease or disorder.","In another embodiment, a fusion protein of the invention and\/or polynucleotide encoding an albumin fusion protein of the invention, may be used to treat diseases and disorders of the immune system and\/or to inhibit or enhance an immune response generated by cells associated with the tissue(s) in which the polypeptide of the invention is expressed.","Albumin fusion proteins of the invention and\/or polynucleotides encoding albumin fusion proteins of the invention may be useful in treating, preventing, diagnosing, and\/or prognosing immunodeficiencies, including both congenital and acquired immunodeficiencies. Examples of B cell immunodeficiencies in which immunoglobulin levels B cell function and\/or B cell numbers are decreased include: X-linked agammaglobulinemia (Bruton's disease), X-linked infantile agammaglobulinemia, X-linked immunodeficiency with hyper IgM, non X-linked immunodeficiency with hyper IgM, X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome (XLP), agammaglobulinemia including congenital and acquired agammaglobulinemia, adult onset agammaglobulinemia, late-onset agammaglobulinemia, dysgammaglobulinemia, hypogammaglobulinemia, unspecified hypogammaglobulinemia, recessive agammaglobulinemia (Swiss type), Selective IgM deficiency, selective IgA deficiency, selective IgG subclass deficiencies, IgG subclass deficiency (with or without IgA deficiency), Ig deficiency with increased IgM, IgG and IgA deficiency with increased IgM, antibody deficiency with normal or elevated Igs, Ig heavy chain deletions, kappa chain deficiency, B cell lymphoproliferative disorder (BLPD), common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), common variable immunodeficiency (CVI) (acquired), and transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy.","In specific embodiments, ataxia-telangiectasia or conditions associated with ataxia-telangiectasia are treated, prevented, diagnosed, and\/or prognosing using the, fusion proteins of the invention and\/or polynucleotides encoding albumin fusion proteins of the invention.","Examples of congenital immunodeficiencies in which T cell and\/or B cell function and\/or number is decreased include, but are not limited to: DiGeorge anomaly, severe combined immunodeficiencies (SCID) (including, but not limited to, X-linked SCID, autosomal recessive SCID, adenosine deaminase deficiency, purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) deficiency, Class II MHC deficiency (Bare lymphocyte syndrome), Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, and ataxia telangiectasia), thymic hypoplasia, third and fourth pharyngeal pouch syndrome, 22q11.2 deletion, chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, natural killer cell deficiency (NK), idiopathic CD4+ T-lymphocytopenia, immunodeficiency with predominant T cell defect (unspecified), and unspecified immunodeficiency of cell mediated immunity.","In specific embodiments, DiGeorge anomaly or conditions associated with DiGeorge anomaly are treated, prevented, diagnosed, and\/or prognosed using fusion proteins of the invention and\/or polynucleotides encoding albumin fusion proteins of the invention.","Other immunodeficiencies that may be treated, prevented, diagnosed, and\/or prognosed using fusion proteins of the invention and\/or polynucleotides encoding albumin fusion proteins of the invention, include, but are not limited to, chronic granulomatous disease, Ch\u00e9diak-Higashi syndrome, myeloperoxidase deficiency, leukocyte glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome (XLP), leukocyte adhesion deficiency, complement component deficiencies (including C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C8 and\/or C9 deficiencies), reticular dysgenesis, thymic alymphoplasia-aplasia, immunodeficiency with thymoma, severe congenital leukopenia, dysplasia with immunodeficiency, neonatal neutropenia, short limbed dwarfism, and Nezelof syndrome-combined immunodeficiency with Igs.","In a preferred embodiment, the immunodeficiencies and\/or conditions associated with the immunodeficiencies recited above are treated, prevented, diagnosed and\/or prognosed using fusion proteins of the invention and\/or polynucleotides encoding albumin fusion proteins of the invention.","In a preferred embodiment fusion proteins of the invention and\/or polynucleotides encoding albumin fusion proteins of the invention could be used as an agent to boost immunoresponsiveness among immunodeficient individuals.

Many autoimmune disorders result from inappropriate recognition of self as foreign material by immune cells. This inappropriate recognition results in an immune response leading to the destruction of the host tissue. Therefore, the administration of fusion proteins of the invention and\/or polynucleotides encoding albumin fusion proteins of the invention that can inhibit an immune response, particularly the proliferation, differentiation, or chemotaxis of T-cells, may be an effective therapy in preventing autoimmune disorders.","Autoimmune diseases or disorders that may be treated, prevented, diagnosed and\/or prognosed by fusion proteins of the invention and\/or polynucleotides encoding albumin fusion proteins of the invention include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following: systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, multiple sclerosis, autoimmune thyroiditis, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, autoimmune thrombocytopenia purpura, autoimmune neonatal thrombocytopenia, idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura, purpura (e.g., Henloch-Scoenlein purpura), autoimmunocytopenia, Goodpasture's syndrome, Pemphigus vulgaris, myasthenia gravis, Grave's disease (hyperthyroidism), and insulin-resistant diabetes mellitus.","Additional disorders that are likely to have an autoimmune component that may be treated, prevented, and\/or diagnosed with the albumin fusion proteins of the invention and\/or polynucleotides encoding albumin fusion proteins of the invention include, but are not limited to, type II collagen-induced arthritis, antiphospholipid syndrome, dermatitis, allergic encephalomyelitis, myocarditis, relapsing polychondritis, rheumatic heart disease, neuritis, uveitis ophthalmia, polyendocrinopathies, Reiter's Disease, Stiff-Man Syndrome, autoimmune pulmonary inflammation, autism, Guillain-Barre Syndrome, insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, and autoimmune inflammatory eye disorders.","Additional disorders that are likely to have an autoimmune component that may be treated, prevented, diagnosed and\/or prognosed with the albumin fusion proteins of the invention and\/or polynucleotides encoding albumin fusion proteins of the invention include, but are not limited to, scleroderma with anti-collagen antibodies (often characterized, e.g., by nucleolar and other nuclear antibodies), mixed connective tissue disease (often characterized, e.g., by antibodies to extractable nuclear antigens (e.g., ribonucleoprotein)), polymyositis (often characterized, e.g., by nonhistone ANA), pernicious anemia (often characterized, e.g., by antiparietal cell, microsomes, and intrinsic factor antibodies), idiopathic Addison's disease (often characterized, e.g., by humoral and cell-mediated adrenal cytotoxicity, infertility (often characterized, e.g., by antispermatozoal antibodies), glomerulonephritis (often characterized, e.g., by glomerular basement membrane antibodies or immune complexes), bullous pemphigoid (often characterized, e.g., by IgG and complement in basement membrane), Sjogren's syndrome (often characterized, e.g., by multiple tissue antibodies, and\/or a specific nonhistone ANA (SS-B)), diabetes mellitus (often characterized, e.g., by cell-mediated and humoral islet cell antibodies), and adrenergic drug resistance (including adrenergic drug resistance with asthma or cystic fibrosis) (often characterized, e.g., by beta-adrenergic receptor antibodies).","Additional disorders that may have an autoimmune component that may be treated, prevented, diagnosed and\/or prognosed with the albumin fusion proteins of the invention and\/or polynucleotides encoding albumin fusion proteins of the invention include, but are not limited to, chronic active hepatitis (often characterized, e.g., by smooth muscle antibodies), primary biliary cirrhosis (often characterized, e.g., by mitochondria antibodies), other endocrine gland failure (often characterized, e.g., by specific tissue antibodies in some cases), vitiligo (often characterized, e.g., by melanocyte antibodies), vasculitis (often characterized, e.g., by Ig and complement in vessel walls and\/or low serum complement), post-MI (often characterized, e.g., by myocardial antibodies), cardiotomy syndrome (often characterized, e.g., by myocardial antibodies), urticaria (often characterized, e.g., by IgG and IgM antibodies to IgE), atopic dermatitis (often characterized, e.g., by IgG and IgM antibodies to IgE), asthma (often characterized, e.g., by IgG and IgM antibodies to IgE), and many other inflammatory, granulomatous, degenerative, and atrophic disorders.","In a preferred embodiment, the autoimmune diseases and disorders and\/or conditions associated with the diseases and disorders recited above are treated, prevented, diagnosed and\/or prognosed using for example, fusion proteins of the invention and\/or polynucleotides encoding albumin fusion proteins of the invention.

For example, diseases associated with increased cell survival or the inhibition of apoptosis that could be diagnosed, prognosed, prevented, and\/or treated by polynucleotides, polypeptides, and\/or agonists or antagonists of the invention, include cancers (such as follicular lymphomas, carcinomas with p53 mutations, and hormone-dependent tumors, including, but not limited to colon cancer, cardiac tumors, pancreatic cancer, melanoma, retinoblastoma, glioblastoma, lung cancer, intestinal cancer, testicular cancer, stomach cancer, neuroblastoma, myxoma, myoma, lymphoma, endothelioma, osteoblastoma, osteoclastoma, osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, adenoma, breast cancer, prostate cancer, Kaposi's sarcoma and ovarian cancer);

In a preferred embodiment, polynucleotides of the present invention is a DNA construct comprising a recombinant expression vector effective in expressing a DNA sequence encoding said polynucleotides. In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the DNA construct encoding the fusion protein of the present invention is inserted into cells to be treated utilizing a retrovirus, or more preferably an adenoviral vector (See G J. Nabel, et. al., PNAS 1999 96: 324\u2013326, which is hereby incorporated by reference). In a most preferred embodiment, the viral vector is defective and will not transform non-proliferating cells, only proliferating cells. Moreover, in a preferred embodiment, the polynucleotides of the present invention inserted into proliferating cells either alone, or in combination with or fused to other polynucleotides, can then be modulated via an external stimulus (i.e. magnetic, specific small molecule, chemical, or drug administration, etc.), which acts upon the promoter upstream of said polynucleotides to induce expression of the encoded protein product. As such the beneficial therapeutic affect of the present invention may be expressly modulated (i.e. to increase, decrease, or inhibit expression of the present invention) based upon said external stimulus.","Polynucleotides of the present invention may be useful in repressing expression of oncogenic genes or antigens. By \u201crepressing expression of the oncogenic genes\u201d is intended the suppression of the transcription of the gene, the degradation of the gene transcript (pre-message RNA), the inhibition of splicing, the destruction of the messenger RNA, the prevention of the post-translational modifications of the protein, the destruction of the protein, or the inhibition of the normal function of the protein.","For local administration to abnormally proliferating cells, polynucleotides of the present invention may be administered by any method known to those of skill in the art including, but not limited to transfection, electroporation, microinjection of cells, or in vehicles such as liposomes, lipofectin, or as naked polynucleotides, or any other method described throughout the specification. The polynucleotide of the present invention may be delivered by known gene delivery systems such as, but not limited to, retroviral vectors (Gilboa, J. Virology 44:845 (1982); Hocke, Nature 320:275 (1986); Wilson, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 85:3014), vaccinia virus system (Chakrabarty et al., Mol. Cell Biol. 5:3403 (1985) or other efficient DNA delivery systems (Yates et al., Nature 313:812 (1985)) known to those skilled in the art. These references are exemplary only and are hereby incorporated by reference. In order to specifically deliver or transfect cells which are abnormally proliferating and spare non-dividing cells, it is preferable to utilize a retrovirus, or adenoviral (as described in the art and elsewhere herein) delivery system known to those of skill in the art. Since host DNA replication is required for retroviral DNA to integrate and the retrovirus will be unable to self replicate due to the lack of the retrovirus genes needed for its life cycle. Utilizing such a retroviral delivery system for polynucleotides of the present invention will target said gene and constructs to abnormally proliferating cells and will spare the nondividing normal cells.","The polynucleotides of the present invention may be delivered directly to cell proliferative disorder\/disease sites in internal organs, body cavities and the like by use of imaging devices used to guide an injecting needle directly to the disease site. The polynucleotides of the present invention may also be administered to disease sites at the time of surgical intervention.","By \u201ccell proliferative disease\u201d is meant any human or animal disease or disorder, affecting any one or any combination of organs, cavities, or body parts, which is characterized by single or multiple local abnormal proliferations of cells, groups of cells, or tissues, whether benign or malignant.","Any amount of the polynucleotides of the present invention may be administered as long as it has a biologically inhibiting effect on the proliferation of the treated cells. Moreover, it is possible to administer more than one of the polynucleotide of the present invention simultaneously to the same site. By \u201cbiologically inhibiting\u201d is meant partial or total growth inhibition as well as decreases in the rate of proliferation or growth of the cells. The biologically inhibitory dose may be determined by assessing the effects of the polynucleotides of the present invention on target malignant or abnormally proliferating cell growth in tissue culture, tumor growth in animals and cell cultures, or any other method known to one of ordinary skill in the art.","Moreover, fusion proteins of the invention and\/or polynucleotides encoding albumin fusion proteins of the invention of the present invention are useful in inhibiting the angiogenesis of proliferative cells or tissues, either alone, as a protein fusion, or in combination with other polypeptides directly or indirectly, as described elsewhere herein. In a most preferred embodiment, said anti-angiogenesis effect may be achieved indirectly, for example, through the inhibition of hematopoietic, tumor-specific cells, such as tumor-associated macrophages (See Joseph I B, et al. J Natl Cancer Inst, 90(21):1648\u201353 (1998), which is hereby incorporated by reference).","Albumin fusion proteins of the invention and\/or polynucleotides encoding albumin fusion proteins of the invention may be useful in inhibiting proliferative cells or tissues through the induction of apoptosis. These fusion protieins and\/or polynucleotides may act either directly, or indirectly to induce apoptosis of proliferative cells and tissues, for example in the activation of a death-domain receptor, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-1, CD95 (Fas\/APO-1), TNF-receptor-related apoptosis-mediated protein (TRAMP) and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptor-1 and -2 (See Schulze-Osthoff K, et. al., Eur J Biochem 254(3):439\u201359 (1998), which is hereby incorporated by reference). Moreover, in another preferred embodiment of the present invention, these fusion proteins and\/or polynucleotides may induce apoptosis through other mechanisms, such as in the activation of other proteins which will activate apoptosis, or through stimulating the expression of these proteins, either alone or in combination with small molecule drugs or adjuviants, such as apoptonin, galectins, thioredoxins, anti-inflammatory proteins (See for example, Mutat Res 400(1\u20132):447\u201355 (1998), Med Hypotheses. 50(5):423\u201333 (1998), Chem Biol Interact.

Inhibition may occur as a direct result of administering these albumin fusion proteins and\/or polynucleotides, or indirectly, such as activating the expression of proteins known to inhibit metastasis, for example alpha 4 integrins, (See, e.g., Curr Top Microbiol Immunol 1998;231:125\u201341, which is hereby incorporated by reference). Such thereapeutic affects of the present invention may be achieved either alone, or in combination with small molecule drugs or adjuvants.","In another embodiment, the invention provides a method of delivering compositions containing the albumin fusion proteins of the invention and\/or polynucleotides encoding albumin fusion proteins of the invention to targeted cells expressing the a polypeptide bound by, that binds to, or associates with an albumin fuison protein of the invention.

Rastinejad et al., 56:345\u2013355 (1989). In those rare instances in which neovascularization occurs under normal physiological conditions, such as wound healing, organ regeneration, embryonic development, and female reproductive processes, angiogenesis is stringently regulated and spatially and temporally delimited. Under conditions of pathological angiogenesis such as that characterizing solid tumor growth, these regulatory controls fail. Unregulated angiogenesis becomes pathologic and sustains progression of many neoplastic and non-neoplastic diseases. A number of serious diseases are dominated by abnormal neovascularization including solid tumor growth and metastases, arthritis, some types of eye disorders, and psoriasis. See, e.g., reviews by Moses et al., . 9:630\u2013634 (1991); Folkman et al., ., 333:1757\u20131763 (1995); Auerbach et al., . 29:401\u2013411 (1985); Folkman, Advances in Cancer Research, eds. Klein and Weinhouse, Academic Press, New York, pp. 175\u2013203 (1985); Patz, . 94:715\u2013743 (1982); and Folkman et al., Science 221:719\u2013725 (1983). In a number of pathological conditions, the process of angiogenesis contributes to the disease state. For example, significant data have accumulated which suggest that the growth of solid tumors is dependent on angiogenesis. Folkman and Klagsbrun, 235:442\u2013447 (1987).","The present invention provides for treatment of diseases or disorders associated with neovascularization by administration of fusion proteins of the invention and\/or polynucleotides encoding albumin fusion proteins of the invention. Malignant and metastatic conditions which can be treated with the polynucleotides and polypeptides, or agonists or antagonists of the invention include, but are not limited to, malignancies, solid tumors, and cancers described herein and otherwise known in the art (for a review of such disorders, see Fishman et al., Medicine, 2d Ed., J. B. Lippincott Co., Philadelphia (1985)). Thus, the present invention provides a method of treating an angiogenesis-related disease and\/or disorder, comprising administering to an individual in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of an albumin fusion protein of the invention and\/or polynucleotides encoding an albumin fusion protein of the invention. For example, fusion proteins of the invention and\/or polynucleotides encoding albumin fusion proteins of the invention may be utilized in a variety of additional methods in order to therapeutically treat a cancer or tumor.

Albumin fusion proteins of the invention and\/or polynucleotides encoding albumin fusion proteins of the invention may be delivered directly into the tumor, or near the tumor site, via injection or a catheter. Of course, as the artisan of ordinary skill will appreciate, the appropriate mode of administration will vary according to the cancer to be treated. Other modes of delivery are discussed herein.","Albumin fusion proteins of the invention and\/or polynucleotides encoding albumin fusion proteins of the invention may be useful in treating other disorders, besides cancers, which involve angiogenesis. These disorders include, but are not limited to: benign tumors, for example hemangiomas, acoustic neuromas, neurofibromas, trachomas, and pyogenic granulomas; artheroscleric plaques; ocular angiogenic diseases, for example, diabetic retinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity, macular degeneration, corneal graft rejection, neovascular glaucoma, retrolental fibroplasia, rubeosis, retinoblastoma, uvietis and Pterygia (abnormal blood vessel growth) of the eye; rheumatoid arthritis; psoriasis; delayed wound healing; endometriosis; vasculogenesis; granulations; hypertrophic scars (keloids); nonunion fractures; scleroderma; trachoma; vascular adhesions; myocardial angiogenesis; coronary collaterals; cerebral collaterals; arteriovenous malformations; ischemic limb angiogenesis; Osler-Webber Syndrome; plaque neovascularization; telangiectasia; hemophiliac joints; angiofibroma; fibromuscular dysplasia; wound granulation; Crohn's disease; and atherosclerosis.","For example, within one aspect of the present invention methods are provided for treating hypertrophic scars and keloids, comprising the step of administering albumin fusion proteins of the invention and\/or polynucleotides encoding albumin fusion proteins of the invention to a hypertrophic scar or keloid.","Within one embodiment of the present invention fusion proteins of the invention and\/or polynucleotides encoding albumin fusion proteins of the invention are directly injected into a hypertrophic scar or keloid, in order to prevent the progression of these lesions. This therapy is of particular value in the prophylactic treatment of conditions which are known to result in the development of hypertrophic scars and keloids (e.g., burns), and is preferably initiated after the proliferative phase has had time to progress (approximately 14 days after the initial injury), but before hypertrophic scar or keloid development. As noted above, the present invention also provides methods for treating neovascular diseases of the eye, including for example, corneal neovascularization, neovascular glaucoma, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, retrolental fibroplasia and macular degeneration.","Moreover, Ocular disorders associated with neovascularization which can be treated with the albumin fusion proteins of the invention and\/or polynucleotides encoding albumin fusion proteins of the invention include, but are not limited to: neovascular glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, retinoblastoma, retrolental fibroplasia, uveitis, retinopathy of prematurity macular degeneration, corneal graft neovascularization, as well as other eye inflammatory diseases, ocular tumors and diseases associated with choroidal or iris neovascularization. See, e.g., reviews by Waltman et al., . 85:704\u2013710 (1978) and Gartner et al., . 22:291\u2013312 (1978).","Thus, within one aspect of the present invention methods are provided for treating neovascular diseases of the eye such as corneal neovascularization (including corneal graft neovascularization), comprising the step of administering to a patient a therapeutically effective amount of a compound (e.g., fusion proteins of the invention and\/or polynucleotides encoding albumin fusion proteins of the invention) to the cornea, such that the formation of blood vessels is inhibited. Briefly, the cornea is a tissue which normally lacks blood vessels. In certain pathological conditions however, capillaries may extend into the cornea from the pericorneal vascular plexus of the limbus. When the cornea becomes vascularized, it also becomes clouded, resulting in a decline in the patient's visual acuity. Visual loss may become complete if the cornea completely opacitates. A wide variety of disorders can result in corneal neovascularization, including for example, corneal infections (e.g., trachoma, herpes simplex keratitis, leishmaniasis and onchocerciasis), immunological processes (e.g., graft rejection and Stevens-Johnson's syndrome), alkali burns, trauma, inflammation (of any cause), toxic and nutritional deficiency states, and as a complication of wearing contact lenses.","Within particularly preferred embodiments of the invention, may be prepared for topical administration in saline (combined with any of the preservatives and antimicrobial agents commonly used in ocular preparations), and administered in eyedrop form. The solution or suspension may be prepared in its pure form and administered several times daily. Alternatively, anti-angiogenic compositions, prepared as described above, may also be administered directly to the cornea. Within preferred embodiments, the anti-angiogenic composition is prepared with a muco-adhesive polymer which binds to cornea. Within further embodiments, the anti-angiogenic factors or anti-angiogenic compositions may be utilized as an adjunct to conventional steroid therapy. Topical therapy may also be useful prophylactically in corneal lesions which are known to have a high probability of inducing an angiogenic response (such as chemical burns). In these instances the treatment, likely in combination with steroids, may be instituted immediately to help prevent subsequent complications.","Within other embodiments, the compounds described above may be injected directly into the corneal stroma by an ophthalmologist under microscopic guidance. The preferred site of injection may vary with the morphology of the individual lesion, but the goal of the administration would be to place the composition at the advancing front of the vasculature (i.e., interspersed between the blood vessels and the normal cornea). In most cases this would involve perilimbic corneal injection to \u201cprotect\u201d the cornea from the advancing blood vessels. This method may also be utilized shortly after a corneal insult in order to prophylactically prevent corneal neovascularization. In this situation the material could be injected in the perilimbic cornea interspersed between the corneal lesion and its undesired potential limbic blood supply. Such methods may also be utilized in a similar fashion to prevent capillary invasion of transplanted corneas. In a sustained-release form injections might only be required 2\u20133 times per year. A steroid could also be added to the injection solution to reduce inflammation resulting from the injection itself.","Within another aspect of the present invention, methods are provided for treating neovascular glaucoma, comprising the step of administering to a patient a therapeutically effective amount of an albumin fusion protein of the invention and\/or polynucleotides encoding an albumin fusion protein of the invention to the eye, such that the formation of blood vessels is inhibited. In one embodiment, the compound may be administered topically to the eye in order to treat early forms of neovascular glaucoma. Within other embodiments, the compound may be implanted by injection into the region of the anterior chamber angle. Within other embodiments, the compound may also be placed in any location such that the compound is continuously released into the aqueous humor. Within another aspect of the present invention, methods are provided for treating proliferative diabetic retinopathy, comprising the step of administering to a patient a therapeutically effective amount of an albumin fusion protein of the invention and\/or polynucleotides encoding an albumin fusion protein of the invention to the eyes, such that the formation of blood vessels is inhibited.","Within particularly preferred embodiments of the invention, proliferative diabetic retinopathy may be treated by injection into the aqueous humor or the vitreous, in order to increase the local concentration of the polynucleotide, polypeptide, antagonist and\/or agonist in the retina. Preferably, this treatment should be initiated prior to the acquisition of severe disease requiring photocoagulation.","Within another aspect of the present invention, methods are provided for treating retrolental fibroplasia, comprising the step of administering to a patient a therapeutically effective amount of an albumin fusion protein of the invention and\/or polynucleotides encoding an albumin fusion protein of the invention to the eye, such that the formation of blood vessels is inhibited. The compound may be administered topically, via intravitreous injection and\/or via intraocular implants.","Additionally, disorders which can be treated with fusion proteins of the invention and\/or polynucleotides encoding albumin fusion proteins of the invention include, but are not limited to, hemangioma, arthritis, psoriasis, angiofibroma, atherosclerotic plaques, delayed wound healing, granulations, hemophilic joints, hypertrophic scars, nonunion fractures, Osler-Weber syndrome, pyogenic granuloma, scleroderma, trachoma, and vascular adhesions.","Moreover, disorders and\/or states, which can be treated, prevented, diagnosed, and\/or prognosed with the the albumin fusion proteins of the invention and\/or polynucleotides encoding albumin fusion proteins of the invention of the invention include, but are not limited to, solid tumors, blood born tumors such as leukemias, tumor metastasis, Kaposi's sarcoma, benign tumors, for example hemangiomas, acoustic neuromas, neurofibromas, trachomas, and pyogenic granulomas, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, ocular angiogenic diseases, for example, diabetic retinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity, macular degeneration, corneal graft rejection, neovascular glaucoma, retrolental fibroplasia, rubeosis, retinoblastoma, and uvietis, delayed wound healing, endometriosis, vascluogenesis, granulations, hypertrophic scars (keloids), nonunion fractures, scleroderma, trachoma, vascular adhesions, myocardial angiogenesis, coronary collaterals, cerebral collaterals, arteriovenous malformations, ischemic limb angiogenesis, Osler-Webber Syndrome, plaque neovascularization, telangiectasia, hemophiliac joints; angiofibroma fibromuscular dysplasia, wound granulation, Crohn's disease, atherosclerosis, birth control agent by preventing vascularization required for embryo implantation controlling menstruation, diseases that have angiogenesis as a pathologic consequence such as cat scratch disease (), ulcers (), Bartonellosis and bacillary angiomatosis.","In one aspect of the birth control method, an amount of the compound sufficient to block embryo implantation is administered before or after intercourse and fertilization have occurred, thus providing an effective method of birth control, possibly a \u201cmorning after\u201d method. Albumin fusion proteins of the invention and\/or polynucleotides encoding albumin fusion proteins of the invention may also be used in controlling menstruation or administered as either a peritoneal lavage fluid or for peritoneal implantation in the treatment of endometriosis.","Albumin fusion proteins of the invention and\/or polynucleotides encoding albumin fusion proteins of the invention may be incorporated into surgical sutures in order to prevent stitch granulomas.","Albumin fusion proteins of the invention and\/or polynucleotides encoding albumin fusion proteins of the invention may be utilized in a wide variety of surgical procedures. For example, within one aspect of the present invention a compositions (in the form of, for example, a spray or film) may be utilized to coat or spray an area prior to removal of a tumor, in order to isolate normal surrounding tissues from malignant tissue, and\/or to prevent the spread of disease to surrounding tissues. Within other aspects of the present invention, compositions (e.g., in the form of a spray) may be delivered via endoscopic procedures in order to coat tumors, or inhibit angiogenesis in a desired locale. Within yet other aspects of the present invention, surgical meshes which have been coated with anti-angiogenic compositions of the present invention may be utilized in any procedure wherein a surgical mesh might be utilized. For example, within one embodiment of the invention a surgical mesh laden with an anti-angiogenic composition may be utilized during abdominal cancer resection surgery (e.g., subsequent to colon resection) in order to provide support to the structure, and to release an amount of the anti-angiogenic factor.","Within further aspects of the present invention, methods are provided for treating tumor excision sites, comprising administering albumin fusion proteins of the invention and\/or polynucleotides encoding albumin fusion proteins of the invention to the resection margins of a tumor subsequent to excision, such that the local recurrence of cancer and the formation of new blood vessels at the site is inhibited. Within one embodiment of the invention, the anti-angiogenic compound is administered directly to the tumor excision site (e.g., applied by swabbing, brushing or otherwise coating the resection margins of the tumor with the anti-angiogenic compound). Alternatively, the anti-angiogenic compounds may be incorporated into known surgical pastes prior to administration. Within particularly preferred embodiments of the invention, the anti-angiogenic compounds are applied after hepatic resections for malignancy, and after neurosurgical operations.","Within one aspect of the present invention, fusion proteins of the invention and\/or polynucleotides encoding albumin fusion proteins of the invention may be administered to the resection margin of a wide variety of tumors, including for example, breast, colon, brain and hepatic tumors. For example, within one embodiment of the invention, anti-angiogenic compounds may be administered to the site of a neurological tumor subsequent to excision, such that the formation of new blood vessels at the site are inhibited.","The albumin fusion proteins of the invention and\/or polynucleotides encoding albumin fusion proteins of the invention may also be administered along with other anti-angiogenic factors.
