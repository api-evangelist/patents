Field of the Invention","Aspects of the present invention relate to a system and method for interacting with broadcast media.","2. Discussion of Related Art","Consumers of broadcast media (e.g., radio and television broadcasts) typically receive broadcast media passively through a receiver (e.g., a radio or television). For example, an individual listening to a radio or watching a television may listen to and\/or watch broadcast media signals passively received by the radio or television over a selected channel. Despite various advancements in broadcasting equipment, current systems are generally not interactive with respect to the media being broadcast.","According to one aspect of the present invention, it is appreciated that in traditional broadcasting systems, individuals are unable to interact with the received broadcast media. Alternatively, with internet enabled devices (e.g., computers, cell phones, laptops, etc.), a user may be able to specifically select desired media content which the user wishes to view (rather than merely a desired channel) and may also directly interact with selected media content via the internet enabled device. However, a problem exists whereby even though both broadcast media receivers and internet enabled devices are commonly utilized today, individual broadcast media receivers and internet enabled devices are not directly linked to allow for interaction between the receivers and devices to provide the user with benefits of both types of systems.","Also, in addition to users not being able to directly interact with the broadcast media, television and radio broadcast providers are also typically unable to directly interact with the users. For example, in conventional broadcast media reward-based systems, a user is typically rewarded for taking a specific defined action (e.g., logging in or \u201cchecking in\u201d). However, in such systems, there is no way for the broadcast provider to confirm that the user is actually viewing or listening to the required program. The broadcast provider must take the word of the user. In addition, in such systems, the user must take an additional intermediary step (e.g., \u201cchecking-in\u201d) to be rewarded. In this way, merely viewing or listening to a program is not typically enough to receive rewards.","In another example, in conventional broadcast media related chat groups, it is a common problem that a chat group may become overcrowded because of the large number of people who view broadcast programming and wish to discuss it with others. For instance, too many users who are viewing the same program may be in the same chat room, making meaningful discussion difficult. For example, due to a large number of posters, a post of a single user may not remain visible long enough for it to be read in detail.","According to one aspect the present invention features a method for awarding incentives, the method comprising receiving, via a first interface of a server, audio signals from a user over a communication network, receiving, via a second interface of the server, audio signals from a plurality of broadcast channels over the communication network, comparing, by a processor in the server, the audio signals received from the user and the audio signals received from the plurality of broadcast channels, determining, by the processor, based on the act of comparing, that the audio signals from the user correspond to a program currently being broadcast on one of the plurality of broadcast channels, and in response to the act of determining, automatically awarding, by the processor, the user at least one incentive.","According to one embodiment, the method further comprises tracking, based on the act of determining, a program history of the user. In one embodiment, the method further comprises generating, based on the act of tracking, a program history profile corresponding to the user. In another embodiment, the act of awarding further comprises awarding incentives to the user based on the user's program history profile.","According to another embodiment, the method further comprises awarding, by the processor, bonus incentives to the user in response to the user interacting with the program currently being broadcast. In one embodiment, the act of awarding bonus incentives includes awarding bonus incentives to the user in response to the user participating in a chat related to the program currently being broadcast. In another embodiment, the act of awarding bonus incentives includes awarding bonus incentives to the user in response to the user making a comment in a social media network related to the program currently being broadcast. In one embodiment, the act of awarding bonus incentives includes awarding bonus incentives to the user in response to the user participating in a poll related to the program currently being broadcast.","According to another aspect, the present invention features a system for awarding incentives, the system comprising a server comprising, a first interface configured to be coupled to a communication network and to receive audio signals from a user over the communication network, a second interface configured to be coupled to the communication network and to receive audio signals from a plurality of broadcast channels over the communication network, and a processor coupled to the first interface and the second interface, wherein the processor is configured to associate the audio signals from the user with a program currently being broadcast on one of the plurality of broadcast channels and in response, automatically award at least one incentive to the user.","According to one embodiment, the at least one incentive is at least one reward point capable of being redeemed by the user towards an award. In another embodiment, the processor is further configured to automatically track an amount of time that the first interface is receiving audio signals from the user associated with the program currently being broadcast and to automatically award a corresponding incentive to the user in response to the amount of time. In one embodiment, the processor is further configured to award at least one incentive to the user in response to the user interacting with the program currently being broadcast.","According to one embodiment, the system further comprises a data storage coupled to the processor, the data storage configured to maintain a database including a profile associated with the user, wherein the profile includes a program history associated with the user. In one embodiment, the profile also includes incentive information related to the user.","According to one aspect, the present invention features a computer readable medium comprising computer-executable instructions that when executed on a processor performs a method for awarding incentives, the method comprising acts of receiving, via a first interface of a server, audio signals from a user over a communication network, receiving, via a second interface of the server, audio signals from a plurality of broadcast channels over the communication network, comparing, by a processor in the server, the audio signals received from the user and the audio signals received from the plurality of broadcast channels, determining, by the processor, based on the act of comparing, that the audio signals from the user correspond to a program currently being broadcast on one of the plurality of broadcast channels, and in response to the act of determining, automatically awarding, by the processor, the user at least one incentive.","According to one embodiment, the method further comprises tracking, based on the act of determining, a program history of the user. In another embodiment, the method further comprises generating, based on the act of tracking, a program history profile corresponding to the user.

Embodiments of the invention are capable of being practiced or of being carried out in various ways. Also, the phraseology and terminology used herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting. The use of \u201cincluding,\u201d \u201ccomprising,\u201d or \u201chaving,\u201d \u201ccontaining\u201d, \u201cinvolving\u201d, and variations thereof herein, is meant to encompass the items listed thereafter and equivalents thereof as well as additional items.","As described above, individual broadcast media receivers and internet enabled devices are not directly linked. As a result, users are unable to directly interact with received broadcast media. Common applications may allow for a user to indirectly interact with received broadcast media; however, such applications require an intermediary action by a user of the broadcast media receiver and internet enabled device. For example, while viewing or listening to broadcast media via a broadcast media receiver, a typical application on an internet enabled device (e.g., a cell phone or computer) may allow a user to log in and identify (i.e. \u201cchecking-in\u201d) what broadcast media they are currently viewing or listening to. In response to the identification provided by the user, the application may provide additional options, such as allowing the user to chat with other people viewing or listening to the same broadcast media, providing the user an opportunity to vote in a poll related to the broadcast media, or allowing the user to gain bonus, experience or reward points for \u201cchecking in\u201d and\/or participating in a poll.","However, in requiring the user of the broadcast media receiver and internet enabled device to take the extra intermediary step of \u201cchecking in\u201d, the broadcast media receiver and the internet enabled device are not directly linked. Thus, the information provided by the user to the internet enabled device may not be entirely accurate. For example, after a user has already \u201cchecked in\u201d in relation to a certain program; a user may begin viewing or listening to a different program (e.g., by turning the channel of the broadcast media receiver). If the user fails to update the application on the internet enabled device to reflect the new program, the application on the internet enabled device will still think the user is watching or listening to the old program and will continue to provide information related to that program. Also, if reward points are being offered by the application for viewing a specific program, a dishonest user may \u201ccheck-in\u201d to a program they are not actually viewing or listening to in an effort to gain the reward points. Because of the indirect nature of the connection between the broadcast media receiver and the internet enabled device, there is no way for the application on the internet enabled device to confirm that the user is actually watching or listening to the reward giving program.","Also, in addition to users not being able to directly interact with the broadcast media, television and radio broadcasters are unable to directly interact with the users. Traditionally, television and radio broadcasters have a uni-directional relationship with their viewers. For example, while broadcasting television or radio signals to a user, television and radio broadcasters are unable to directly track how many people are watching\/listening to their broadcast media. As such, television and radio broadcasters typically rely on diaries and surveys to determine how many people are watching\/listening to their programming. However, diaries and surveys suffer from a number of problems. For example, diaries and surveys are not able to offer real time feedback and are only as reliable as a consumer's memory. An alternative may be the use of a set meter for measuring viewer or listener behavior. However, despite being more accurate than the diaries and surveys, the set meters still do not offer real-time feedback and typically report overall viewing for a period of time (e.g., a 24 hour period of time).","As such, the current invention provides a system and method for automatically detecting and identifying, with an internet enabled device, broadcast media being viewed or listened to by a user and for allowing the user to directly interact with the received broadcast media via the internet enabled device.","One example of a system  for automatically detecting and identifying broadcast media in accordance with aspects of the current invention is shown in . The system  includes a broadcast media receiver . The broadcast media receiver  is coupled to a broadcast media network through a wired or wireless connection and is configured to receive broadcast media signals from the broadcast media network. As shown in , the broadcast media receiver  is a television. However, according to other embodiments, the broadcast media receiver  may be any device capable of receiving broadcast media signals (e.g., a radio, a digital cable television receiver, an analog cable television receiver, a satellite television receiver etc.).","The system  also includes an internet enabled device . As shown in , an internet enabled device  may include a mobile phone (e.g., a smart phone) or a computer (e.g., a laptop computer, personal computer or tablet computer). According to other embodiments, the internet enabled device  may be any internet capable device that includes a microphone. The internet enabled device  is located proximate the broadcast media receiver  to receive audio signals  projected by the broadcast media receiver  in response to broadcast media signals received over the broadcast media network. The internet enabled device  is also coupled to an external network  (e.g., the internet) via a wired or wireless connection.","The system  also includes a matching server . The matching server  is also coupled to the external network , via a wired or wired connection, and is configured to communicate with an internet enabled device  over the external network. From the external network , the matching server  receives audio streams of the audio signals received by the internet enabled device , via a first interface, and also audio streams  of broadcast media from one or more known broadcast channels (e.g., known radio or television stations), via a second interface.","The matching server  compares the audio stream from the internet enabled device  with audio streams from the known broadcast channels, matches the audio stream from the internet enabled device  with audio streams  from the known broadcast channels and automatically identifies the broadcast media that the user is viewing or listening too. Based on this matching, the server  provides to the user, via the internet enabled device , one or more features and\/or functionality that correspond to the detected broadcast, allowing the user to directly interact with the detected broadcast. The interaction between the internet enabled device  and the matching server  will now be described in greater detail with relation to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","104","106","104","106","105","102","104","202","105","106","202"]},"According to one embodiment, communication between the internet enabled device  and the matching server  (e.g., a matching request ) may include a variety of parameters. Certain parameters may be defined as optional or required. Such parameters may include:\n\n","In addition to the parameters discussed above, matching requests  sent by the internet enabled device  also include audio signals received by the internet enabled device  from the broadcast media receiver . According to one embodiment, the audio signals are sent with the MATCH action; however, the transfer of audio data between the internet enabled device  and the matching server  may be configured differently. According to one embodiment, the format and encoding of the audio signals sent by the internet enabled device  to the matching server  is determined based on at least one of the parameters discussed above. For example, according to one embodiment, the format and encoding of the audio signals is based on the client_version identifier. According to one embodiment, the audio signals are formatted and encoded as 16 Bit, 22 KHz, mono, Speex signals. However, according to other embodiments, the audio signals may be formatted and encoded in any way.","The matching server  also constantly receives audio channel feeds  from known broadcast media channels. According to one embodiment, the matching server  captures information from the known broadcast media channels every two seconds. However, according to other embodiments, the matching server  may be configured to capture information from the known broadcast media channels at any desired interval. According to one embodiment, in addition to receiving broadcast media feeds from known channels, the matching server  also receives schedule information related to the received broadcast media from the known channels.","According to one embodiment, the matching server  is configured to capture information from location specific broadcast media channels. For example, broadcast media networks typically have separate feeds for western and eastern time zones (customers in the eastern and central time zones receive the east coast feed and customers in the pacific and mountain time zones receive the west coast feed). According to one embodiment, a matching server  may be configured to receive the east coast feed, the west coast feed, or both feeds.","According to one embodiment, an internet enabled device  determines the location (e.g., the time zone) of a user based on the IP address of the internet enabled device . Based on the determined location of the user, the internet enabled device  will communicate with an appropriate location specific matching server . For example, according to one embodiment, based on a determination by the internet enabled device  that a user is in the eastern or central time zone, the internet enabled device  will send a matching request to a matching server  receiving east coast feeds. Alternatively, based on a determination by the internet enabled device  that a user is in the western or mountain time zone, the internet enabled device  will send a matching request to a matching server  receiving west coast feeds.","Based on the received audio feeds from the internet enable devices  and the known broadcast media channels, the matching server  calculates signal cross-correlation (X-Correlation) between the audio signals  received from the internet enabled device  and the audio signals  received from the known broadcast channels to determine whether any matching exists between the signals. An example of X-Correlation  between signals is illustrated in . Audio signals  from the known broadcast channels are compared to the audio signals  received from the internet enabled device. As shown in , signals  that do no match will result in low signal X-Correlation. However, if an audio signal  from a known broadcast channel does match audio signals  from the internet enabled device , then a high signal X-Correlation will result. Upon detecting a high signal X-Correlation with a known broadcast channel, the matching server  determines that the audio signals being received by the internet enabled device  match the program being broadcast by the known broadcast channel.","According to one embodiment, the matching server  compares audio signals  from the internet enabled device  to the audio signals  from the known broadcast channels over a sliding period of time or window. According to one embodiment, the window is a thirty second window. However, in other embodiments, the window may be defined as having any length. By comparing signals over a sliding window, the matching server  is able to account for signal delays between the audio signals , . For example, if broadcast signals received by an internet enabled device  are transmitted via a satellite system, there will likely be a delay between when the signals are actually broadcast over the known channel to when they are received by the internet enabled device . Therefore, by matching signals within a window, the matching server  accounts for the potential delay.","Upon performing matching, the matching server  responds to the matching request  of the internet enabled device . According to one embodiment, a response  to the matching request by the matching server  is sent within ten seconds of receiving the matching request. However, according to other embodiments, a response  to a matching request may be configured to be sent at any time upon receiving a matching request .","According to one embodiment, a response  to a matching request  may include a variety of parameters. Certain parameters may be defined as optional or required. Such parameters may include:\n\n","According to one embodiment, using at least one of the parameters identified above, the matching server  may also retrieve information about the specific matched program being viewed or listened to on the matched channel. For example, in one embodiment, the channel_id parameter may be used by the matching server  to retrieve schedule and\/or program information from an Electronic Program Guide (EPG) about the matched program currently being broadcast on the matched channel. According to one embodiment, the matching server  retrieves information from the EPG such as the name and synopsis of the matched program. According to other embodiments, the matching server  also retrieves meta-information from the EPG including the cast, producer, genre, rating, etc. of the matched program. According to other embodiments, any type of information related to the matched program may be retrieved by the matching server .","Upon completing the matching operation and retrieving information related to the matched channel and matched program, the matching server  transmits the matching program and matching channel information back to the user via the internet enabled device . According to one embodiment, the internet enabled device  includes a reference client application to illustrate the information provided by the matching server . In one embodiment, the reference client application is implemented in ActionScript; however, in other embodiments, the reference client application may be implemented in any other appropriate programming language.","According to one embodiment, the reference client displays information related to the matched channel and\/or program. For example, in one embodiment, the reference client displays at least one of the network name of the matched channel, the name of the matched program, or a synopsis of the matched program. In other embodiments, the reference client displays other information related to the matched program such as the cast, producer, genre, rating etc. In one embodiment, the reference client displays other information related to the matched channel and\/or program, such as related advertising or social media functionality. Additional functionality displayed by the reference client in response to a matched channel or program will be discussed in greater detail below.","The operation of the system  will now be described in greater detail in relation to .  is a flow chart  of a process for the automatic detection of broadcast programming in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. At block , a user of an internet enabled device  situates himself near a broadcast media receiver  (e.g., an audio source such as a television or radio receiving broadcast media signals).","At block , the user operates the internet enabled device  to open an application and\/or website configured to communicate with a matching server . At block , the internet enabled device  receives audio signals from the broadcast media receiver  via a microphone.","At block , the internet enabled device  transmits the audio signals received from the broadcast media receiver  to the matching server . According to one embodiment, the audio signals may be transmitted by the internet enabled device  to the matching server  in sequences of a few seconds via real time streaming. For example, as discussed above, matching requests  including the audio signals may be sent in four to five second bursts, every fifteen seconds. However, according to other embodiments, the duration of matching requests and time between matching requests may be defined as any amount of time.","At block , the matching server  receives the audio signals transmitted by the internet enabled device  and stores the audio signals at least temporarily for processing. At block , at the same time as the matching server  is receiving audio signals from the internet enabled device , the matching server  is also receiving and storing live audio signals from a plurality of known broadcast channels (e.g., a plurality of known television and\/or radio channels).","According to one embodiment, the matching server  only stores, at any given moment, a small portion of the audio signals from the internet enabled device  and the audio signals from the known broadcast channels. For example, according to one embodiment, the matching server  receives a few seconds of audio data, processes the audio data and deletes the few seconds of audio data, before repeating the process again and again over time as the matching process is performed.

However, in other embodiments, the matching server  may also operate on time shifted feeds. For instance, in conventional television or radio systems, a user may be able to record programs for later viewing (i.e. time shift the program). When the user later selects the program for viewing; comparing the time shifted audio feed received by the internet enabled device  to live audio feeds received from known broadcast channels may not yield an accurate matching process.","Therefore, according to one embodiment, the matching server  archives audio feeds received from the known broadcast channels. In this way, when a user views\/listens to a time shifted program, the audio signals received by the internet enabled device  may be compared to the archived audio feeds to determine the currently being viewed program. In one embodiment, in order to ensure accurate synchronization between the internet enabled device  and the matching server , the archived audio feeds may be tagged with program metadata (e.g., information about the program, advertisement information, time\/date information etc.). By comparing the received audio signals from the internet enabled device  with the archived audio feeds and the tagged metadata related to the archived feeds, the matching server  is able to accurately synchronize the internet enabled device  to the correct program and provide appropriate content and functionality as described above.","As described above, an internet enabled device  is described as communicating with a single matching server . However, in other embodiments, the internet enabled device  may be configured to communicate with a plurality of matching servers . In this way, the workload of receiving audio feeds from known broadcast channels may be distributed amongst multiple matching servers .","As described above, a matching server  is configured to automatically identify a currently being viewed\/listened to channel or program by a user and provide content\/functionality related to the identified channel\/program. However, in other embodiments, a user may be able to manually identify the program\/channel he is watching or listening to. In response to the manual identification, related content or functionality may be provided to the user as discussed above.","As described herein, by automatically identifying a currently being viewed\/listened to channel or program via audio matching, an intermediary step required by a user (e.g., a checking in or logging in step) is eliminated. In addition, by not requiring an intermediary action be taken by a user, the user is able to be directly linked to the received broadcast media and to directly interact with the broadcast media. For example, upon automatically identifying the program or channel currently being viewed or listened to by a user, the user may immediately be provided with program\/channel specific content or functionality, allowing the user to directly interact with the program or channel. By automatically providing the user with specific content related to what the user is currently viewing or listening to, the content or functionality provided to the user is able to be automatically directed specifically at the interests of the user, potentially creating a deeper relationship between the user and the program.","In addition, it is to be appreciated that by providing a dual device system (i.e. a \u201ctwo-screen system\u201d) instead of a fully integrated system, the current invention may be mobile. For example, according to some embodiments, the internet enable device  is not physically coupled to the matching server  and instead, may be located adjacent any broadcast receiving device  which is currently receiving broadcast media signals and which is providing audio signals, as long as the internet enabled device is able to communicate with the matching server  (e.g., via the internet). Therefore, a user may move from broadcast receiving device to broadcast receiving device (e.g., from TV to TV) and the matching server  will perform the matching process accordingly.","Having thus described several aspects of at least one embodiment of this invention, it is to be appreciated that various alterations, modifications and improvements will readily occur to those skilled in the art. Such alterations, modifications, and improvements are intended to be part of this disclosure, and are intended to be within the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the foregoing description is by way of example only."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS","p":["The accompanying drawings are not intended to be drawn to scale.
