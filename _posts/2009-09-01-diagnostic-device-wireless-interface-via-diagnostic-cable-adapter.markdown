The GPS transceiver may also include or be coupled to an altimeter to determine the altitude of the wireless interface . The memory  can be used to store cartographic data, such as electronic maps. The memory can store all the maps for the U.S. (or country of use), North America or can have the region or state where the wireless interface  is located. In alternative embodiments, the wireless interface  can have all the maps of the world or any portion of the world desired by the user. The GPS transceiver  communicates with and \u201clock on\u201d to a certain number of satellites in order to have a \u201cfix\u201d on its global location. Once the location is fixed, the GPS transceiver , with the help of the processor , can determine the exact location including longitude, latitude, altitude, velocity of movement and other navigational data. Should the GPS transceiver  be unable to lock on to the required number of satellites to determine the altitude or unable to determine the altitude for any reason, the altimeter can be used to determine the altitude of the wireless interface .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 2"],"b":["400","100","104","110","402","100","200","200","100","200"]},"In another embodiment of the invention, the wireless interface can be updated via the diagnostic cable interface  or the diagnostic device interface . The interfaces ,  allow communication between the wireless interface  and the various computing devices and thus the various computing devices can provide updated software and firmware to the wireless interface . In still another embodiment, the wireless interface can be used by the diagnostic device to update, for example, an ECU in the vehicle or the remote device.","In operation, with the wireless interface connected to the computing device, such as the diagnostic device, can communicate wirelessly. This will allow older generation of devices that do not have built-in wirelessly capability to communicate wirelessly with remote devices. This functionality will allow repair shops to keep their existing devices and save the costs of buying a new diagnostic device just to add the wireless capability.","The wireless interface can be connected using existing connections on the computing devices without having to retrofit the computing device with a new board or electronics. Further, the wireless interface does not have to interfere with existing connections as it can merely be added serially, for example, along an existing connection. The wireless interface can allow the existing connections to continue to communicate without interfering with the signals of communication.","The many features and advantages of the invention are apparent from the detailed specification, and thus, it is intended by the appended claims to cover all such features and advantages of the invention which fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention.
