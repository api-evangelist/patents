A fundamental problem with all of these approaches is \u201cbrittleness\u201d\u2014they have limited inherent ability to adapt to changing circumstances without direct human intervention. For the more robust of these information management approaches (e.g., relational database management system, or RDBMS), the human intervention may be somewhat reduced compared to that of less sophisticated approaches (e.g., flat files), but the need for direct, manual effort is certainly not eliminated.","Likewise, specific computer applications that are underpinned by the prior art information management approaches are generally very limited in their ability to adapt to changing circumstances and user requirements over time. In addition to prior art information management approaches and the computing applications built on them generally being too brittle, they also can be criticized for being monolithic\u2014that is, it is generally not possible to dynamically separate subsets of a computing application and recombine them with other subsets of a plurality of computing applications to form new and useful applications. In other words, prior art computing systems and applications are very limited in their ability to usefully evolve without directed human programming or content management attention. This is a significant root cause of the well-known and well-discussed \u201csoftware bottleneck.\u201d","An adaptive recombinant system is disclosed to address the problems of limited adaptation and extensibility associated with prior art computing applications by incorporating an information management and computing system paradigm that has built-in capabilities to facilitate adaptation to changing circumstances and user requirements and preferences. The adaptive recombinant system can track, store and make user preference and interest inferences from a broad array of system usage behaviors. These inferencing capabilities may be applied to not only assist system users in more effectively navigating the system, but may also be applied to modify system structure and content so as to embed adaptation directly within the system and content, thereby enabling the system to evolve to become ever more effective over time.","Furthermore, users of the system may themselves be represented or explicitly referenced within system content. Fundamentally, the adaptive recombinant system represents a computer-based systems architecture in which system users may be represented directly within the system content and structure, and the usage behaviors over time of the users may be embedded directly in the system structure. Thus, the adaptive recombinant system explicitly integrates the system, users of the system, and usage of the system in a way that extends beyond the less integrative, and more ad hoc approaches of prior art; thereby enabling a higher degree of computer-based system adaptiveness and extensibility. The adaptive recombinant system can complement current information management and computer application approaches to enable the resulting overall system to be more adaptive to individual and community user requirements.","In some embodiments, a network (where the term \u201cnetwork\u201d is used as a term denoting a general system topology, not to be confused with specific application or use of the term, such as, for example, a \u201ctelecommunications network\u201d) system structure is employed to facilitate adequate structural plasticity to enable system adaptation, and to enable syndication and combinations of system subsets. The network-based system structure may furthermore be based on a fuzzy network or fuzzy content network architecture.","In accordance with the embodiments described herein, an adaptive system, an adaptive recombinant system, and methods for establishing the systems are disclosed. The adaptive system includes algorithms for tracking user interactions with a collection of system objects, and generates adaptive recommendations based on the usage behaviors associated with the system objects. The adaptive recommendations may be explicitly represented to the user or may be used to automatically update the collection of system objects and associated relationships. In either case, the collection of objects and associated relationships become more useful to the user over time.","The adaptive recombinant system, which includes the adaptive system, may further be syndicated to other computer applications, including other adaptive systems. The adaptive recombinant system may recombine and resyndicate indefinitely. Both the adaptive system and the adaptive recombinant system may be based on a fuzzy network or a fuzzy content network structure.","The adaptive system may be implemented on a single computer or on multiple computers that are connected through a network, such as the Internet. The software and data storage associated with the adaptive system may reside on the single computer, or may be distributed across the multiple computers. The adaptive system may be implemented on stationary computers, on mobile computing devices, on processing units architected according to Von Neumann designs, or on those designed according to non-Von Neumann architectures. The adaptive system may integrate with existing types of computer software, such as computer operating systems, including mobile device operating systems and special purpose devices, such as television \u201cset-top boxes,\u201d network operating systems, database software, application middleware, and application software, such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) applications, desktop productivity tools, Internet applications, and so on.","In the following description, numerous details are set forth to provide an understanding of the present invention. However, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these details and that numerous variations or modifications from the described embodiments may be possible.","Adaptive System",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","210","220","230","200","100","240","250","200","100"]},"As used herein, one or more users  may be a single user or multiple users. As shown in , the one or more users  may receive the adaptive recommendations . Non-users  of the adaptive system  may also receive adaptive recommendations  from the adaptive system .","A user  may be a human entity, a computer system, or a second adaptive system (distinct from the adaptive system ) that interacts with, or otherwise uses the adaptive system. The one or more users  may include non-human users of the adaptive system . In particular, one or more other adaptive systems may serve as virtual system \u201cusers.\u201d These other adaptive systems may operate in accordance with the architecture of the adaptive system .

Furthermore, one or more non-adaptive systems  may be modified to become one or more adaptive systems  by integrating the usage aspect  and the recommendations function  with the one or more non-adaptive systems .","The term \u201ccomputer system\u201d or the term \u201csystem,\u201d without further qualification, as used herein, will be understood to mean either a non-adaptive or an adaptive system. Likewise, the terms \u201csystem structure\u201d or \u201csystem content,\u201d as used herein, will be understood to refer to the structural aspect  and the content aspect , respectively, whether associated with the non-adaptive system  or the adaptive system . The term \u201csystem structural subset\u201d or \u201cstructural subset,\u201d as used herein, will be understood to mean a portion or subset of the structural aspect  of a system.","Structural Aspect","The structural aspect  of the adaptive system  is depicted in the block diagram of . The structural aspect  denotes a collection of system objects  that are part of the adaptive system , as well as the relationships among the objects . The relationships among objects  may be persistent across user sessions, or may be transient in nature. The objects  may include or reference items of content, such as text, graphics, audio, video, interactive content, or embody any other type or item of information. The objects  may also include references to content, such as pointers. Computer applications, executable code, or references to computer applications may also be stored as objects  in the adaptive system . The content of the objects  is known herein as information . The information , though part of the object , is also considered part of the content aspect , as depicted in , and described below.","The objects  may be managed in a relational database, or may be maintained in structures such as flat files, linked lists, inverted lists, hypertext networks, or object-oriented databases. The objects  may include meta-information  associated with the information  contained within, or referenced by the objects .","As an example, in some embodiments, the World-wide Web could be considered a structural aspect, where web pages constitute the objects of the structural aspect and links between web pages constitute the relationships among the objects. Alternatively, or in addition, in some embodiments, the structural aspect could be comprised of objects associated with an object-oriented programming language, and the relationships between the objects associated with the protocols and methods associated with interaction and communication among the objects in accordance with the object-oriented programming language.","The one or more users  of the adaptive system  may be explicitly represented as objects  within the system , therefore becoming directly incorporated within the structural aspect . The relationships among objects  may be arranged in a hierarchical structure, a relational structure (e.g. according to a relational database structure), or according to a network structure.","Content Aspect","The content aspect  of the adaptive system  is depicted in the block diagram of . The content aspect  denotes the information  contained in, or referenced by the objects  that are part of the structural aspect . The content aspect  of the objects  may include text, graphics, audio, video, and interactive forms of content, such as applets, tutorials, courses, demonstrations, modules, or sections of executable code or computer programs. The one or more users  interact with the content aspect .","The content aspect  may be updated based on the usage aspect , as well as associated metrics. To achieve this, the adaptive system  may employ the usage aspect of other systems. Such systems may include, but are not limited to, other computer systems, other networks, such as the World Wide Web, multiple computers within an organization, other adaptive systems, or other adaptive recombinant systems. In this manner, the content aspect  benefits from usage occurring in other environments.","Usage Aspect","The usage aspect  of the adaptive system  is depicted in the block diagram of . The usage aspect  denotes captured usage information , further identified as usage behaviors , and usage behavior pre-processing . The usage aspect  thus reflects the tracking, storing, categorization, and clustering of the use and associated usage behaviors of the one or more users  interacting with the adaptive system .","The captured usage information , known also as system usage or system use , includes any interaction by the one or more users  with the system. The adaptive system  tracks and stores user key strokes and mouse clicks, for example, as well as the time period in which these interactions occurred (e.g., timestamps), as captured usage information . From this captured usage information , the adaptive system  identifies usage behaviors  of the one or more users  (e.g., web page access or email transmission). Finally, the usage aspect  includes usage-behavior pre-processing, in which usage behavior categories , usage behavior clusters , and usage behavioral patterns  are formulated for subsequent processing of the usage behaviors  by the adaptive system . Some usage behaviors  identified by the adaptive system , as well as usage behavior categories  designated by the adaptive system , are listed in Table 1, and described in more detail, below.","The usage behavior categories , usage behaviors clusters , and usage behavior patterns  may be interpreted with respect to a single user , or to multiple users , in which the multiple users may be described herein as a community, an affinity group, or a user segment. These terms are used interchangeably herein. A community is a collection of one or more users, and may include what is commonly referred to as a \u201ccommunity of interest.\u201d A sub-community is also a collection of one or more users, in which members of the sub-community include a portion of the users in a previously defined community. Communities, affinity groups, and user segments are described in more detail, below.","Usage behavior categories  include types of usage behaviors , such as accesses, referrals to other users, collaboration with other users, and so on. These categories and more are included in Table 1, below. Usage behavior clusters  are groupings of one or more usage behaviors , either within a particular usage behavior category  or across two or more usage categories. The usage behavior pre-processing  may also determine new \u201cclusterings\u201d of user behaviors  in previously undefined usage behavior categories , across categories, or among new communities. Usage behavior patterns , also known as \u201cusage behavioral patterns\u201d or \u201cbehavioral patterns,\u201d are also groupings of usage behaviors  across usage behavior categories . Usage behavior patterns  are generated from one or more filtered clusters of captured usage information .","The usage behavior patterns  may also capture and organize captured usage information  to retain temporal information associated with usage behaviors . Such temporal information may include the duration or timing of the usage behaviors , such as those associated with reading or writing of written or graphical material, oral communications, including listening and talking, or physical location of the user . The usage behavioral patterns  may include segmentations and categorizations of usage behaviors  corresponding to a single user of the one or more users  or according to multiple users  (e.g., communities or affinity groups). The communities or affinity groups may be previously established, or may be generated during usage behavior pre-processing  based on inferred usage behavior affinities or clustering. Usage behaviors  may also be derived from the use or explicit preferences  associated with other adaptive or non-adaptive systems.","Adaptive Recommendations Function","Returning to , the adaptive system  includes an adaptive recommendations function , which interacts with the structural aspect , the usage aspect , and the content aspect . The adaptive recommendations function  generates adaptive recommendations  based on the integration and application of the structural aspect , the usage aspect , and, optionally, the content aspect .","The term \u201crecommendations\u201d associated with the adaptive recommendations function  is used broadly in the adaptive system . The adaptive recommendations  may be displayed to a recommendations recipient. As used herein, a recommendations recipient is an entity who receives the adaptive recommendations . Thus, the recommendations recipient may include the one or more users  of the adaptive system , as indicated by the dotted arrow  in , or a non-user  of the system (see dotted arrow ). However, the adaptive recommendations  may also be used internally by the adaptive system  to update the structural aspect  (see dotted arrow ). In this manner, the usage behavior  of the one or more users  may be influenced by the system structural alterations that are automatically or semi-automatically applied. Or, the adaptive recommendations  may be used by the adaptive system  to update the content aspect  (see dotted arrow ).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0084","num":"0083"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1"],"b":["240","100","240","242","244","100","250"]},"Preferably, the adaptive system  identifies the preferences of the user  and adapts the adaptive system  in view of the preferences. Preferences describe the likes, tastes, partiality, and\/or predilection of the user  that may be inferred during access of the objects  of the adaptive system . In general, user preferences exist consciously or sub-consciously within the mind of the user. Since the adaptive system  has no direct access to these preferences, they are generally inferred by the preference inferencing algorithm  of the adaptive recommendations function .","The preference inferencing algorithm , infers preferences based on information that may be obtained as the user  accesses the adaptive system . The preference inferencing algorithm and associated output  is also described herein generally as \u201cpreference inferencing\u201d or \u201cpreference inferences\u201d of the adaptive system . The preference inferencing algorithm  identifies three types of preferences: explicit preferences , inferred preferences , and inferred interests . Unless otherwise stated, the use of the term \u201cpreferences\u201d herein is meant to include any or all of the elements , , and  depicted in .","As used herein, explicit preferences  describe explicit choices or designations made by the user  during use of the adaptive system . The explicit preferences  may be considered to more explicitly reveal preferences than inferences associated with other types of usage behaviors. A response to a survey is one example where explicit preferences  may be identified by the adaptive system .","Inferred preferences  describe preferences of the user  that are based on usage behavioral patterns . Inferred preferences  are derived from signals and cues made by the user . (The derivation of inferred preferences  by the adaptive system  is included in the description of , below.)","Inferred interests  describe interests of the user  that are based on usage behavioral patterns . In general, the adaptive recommendations  produced by the preference inferencing algorithm  combine inferences from overall user community behaviors and preferences, inferences from sub-community or expert behaviors and preferences, and inferences from personal user behaviors and preferences. As used herein, preferences (whether explicit  or inferred ) are distinguishable from interests () in that preferences imply a ranking (e.g., object A is better than object B) while interests do not necessarily imply a ranking.","A second algorithm , designated recommendations optimization , optimizes the adaptive recommendations  produced by the adaptive system . The adaptive recommendations  may be augmented by automated inferences and interpretations about the content within individual and sets of objects  using statistical pattern matching of words, phrases or representations, in written or audio format, or in pictorial format, within the content. Such statistical pattern matching may include, but is not limited to, semantic network techniques, Bayesian analytical techniques, neural network-based techniques, support vector machine-based techniques, or other statistical analytical techniques. Relevant statistical techniques that may be applied by the present invention include those found in Vapnik, The Nature of Statistical Learning Theory, 1999.","Adaptive Recommendations","As shown in , the adaptive system  generates adaptive recommendations  using the adaptive recommendations function . The adaptive recommendations , or suggestions, enable users to more effectively use and navigate through the adaptive system .","The adaptive recommendations  are presented as structural subsets of the structural aspect .  depicts a hypothetical structural aspect , including a plurality of objects  and associated relationships . The adaptive recommendations function  generates adaptive recommendations  based on usage of the structural aspect  by the one or more users , possibly in conjunction with considerations associated with the structural aspect and the content aspect.","Three structural subsets A, B, and C (collectively, structural subsets ) are depicted. The structural subset A includes three objects  and one associated relationship, which are reproduced by the adaptive recommendations function  in the same form as in the structural aspect  (objects are speckle shaded). The structural subset B includes a single object (object is shaded), with no associated relationships (even though the object originally had a relationship to another object in the structural aspect ).","The third structural subset C includes five objects (striped shading), but the relationships between objects has been changed from their orientation in the structural aspect . In the structural subset C, a relationship  has been eliminated while a new relationship  has been formed by the adaptive recommendations function . The structural subsets  depicted in  represent but three of a myriad of possibilities from the original network of objects.","The illustration in  shows a simplified representation of structural subsets  being generated from objects  and relationships  of the structural aspect . Although not shown, the structural subset  may also have corresponding associated subsets of the usage aspect , such as usage behaviors and usage behavioral patterns. As used herein, references to structural subsets  are meant to include the relevant subsets of the usage aspect, or usage subsets, as well.","The adaptive recommendations  may be in the context of a currently conducted activity of the system , a currently accessed object , or a communication with another user . The adaptive recommendations  may also be in the context of a historical path of executed system activities, accessed objects , or communications during a specific user session or across user sessions. The adaptive recommendations  may be without context of a current activity, currently accessed object , current session path, or historical session paths. Adaptive recommendations  may also be generated in response to direct user requests or queries. Such user requests may be in the context of a current system navigation, access or activity, or may be outside of any such context.","Usage Behavior Categories","In Table 1, several different usage behaviors  identified by the adaptive system  are categorized. The usage behaviors  may be associated with the entire user community, one or more sub-communities, or with individual users of the adaptive system .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0099","num":"0098"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Usage behavior categories and usage behaviors."}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"140pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["usage behavior category","usage behavior"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["navigation and access","activity, content and computer application"]},{"entry":[{},"accesses, including buying\/selling paths of"]},{"entry":[{},"accesses or click streams"]},{"entry":["subscription and","personal or community subscriptions to"]},{"entry":["self-profiling","process topical areas"]},{"entry":[{},"interest and preference self-profiling"]},{"entry":[{},"affiliation self-profiling (e.g., job function)"]},{"entry":["collaborative","referral to others"]},{"entry":[{},"discussion forum activity"]},{"entry":[{},"direct communications (voice call, messaging)"]},{"entry":[{},"content contributions or structural alterations"]},{"entry":["reference","personal or community storage and tagging"]},{"entry":[{},"personal or community organizing of stored or"]},{"entry":[{},"tagged information"]},{"entry":["direct feedback","user ratings of activities, content, computer"]},{"entry":[{},"applications and automatic recommendations"]},{"entry":[{},"user comments"]},{"entry":["physical location","current location"]},{"entry":[{},"location over time"]},{"entry":[{},"relative location to users\/object references"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"A first category of usage behaviors  is known as system navigation and access behaviors. System navigation and access behaviors include usage behaviors  such as accesses to, and interactions with, objects , such as activities, content, topical areas, and computer applications. These usage behaviors may be conducted through use of a keyboard, a mouse, oral commands, or using any other input device. Usage behaviors  in the system navigation and access behaviors category may include, but are not limited to, the viewing or reading of displayed information, typing written information, interacting with online objects orally, or combinations of these forms of interactions with the adaptive system .","System navigation and access behaviors may also include executing transactions, including commercial transactions, such as the buying or selling of merchandise, services, or financial instruments. System navigation and access behaviors may include not only individual accesses and interactions, but the capture and categorization of sequences of object accesses and interactions over time.","A second category of usage behaviors  is known as subscription and self-profiling behaviors. Subscriptions may be associated with specific topical areas of the adaptive system , or may be associated with any other structural subset  of the system . Subscriptions may thus indicate the intensity of interest (inferred interests ) with regard to system objects , including specific topical areas. The delivery of information to fulfill subscriptions may occur online, such as through electronic mail (email), on-line newsletters, XML feeds, etc., or through physical delivery of media.","Self-profiling refers to other direct, persistent (unless explicitly changed by the user) indications explicitly designated by the one or more users  regarding their preferences and interests, or other meaningful attributes. The user  may explicitly identify interests or affiliations, such as job function, profession, or organization, and preferences, such as representative skill level (e.g., novice, business user, advanced). Self-profiling enables the adaptive system  to infer explicit preferences . For example, a self-profile may contain information on skill levels or relative proficiency in a subject area, organizational affiliation, or a position held in an organization. Self-profiling information may be used to infer preferences and interests with regard to system use and associated topical areas, and with regard to degree of affinity with other user community subsets. The user  may identify preferred methods of information receipt or learning style, such as visual or audio, as well as relative interest levels in other communities.","A third category of usage behaviors  is known as collaborative behaviors. Collaborative behaviors are interactions among the one or more users  of the adaptive system , or between users  and non-system users. Collaborative behaviors may thus provide information on areas of interest and intensity of interest. Interactions including online referrals of objects , such as through email, or structural subsets  of the system , whether to other system users  or to non-users , are types of collaborative behaviors obtained by the adaptive system .","Other examples of collaborative behaviors include, but are not limited to, online discussion forum activity, contributions of content or other types of objects  to the structural aspect  of the adaptive system , or any other alterations of the structural aspect  for the benefit of others. Collaborative behaviors may also include general user-to-user communications, whether synchronous or asynchronous, such as email, instant messaging, interactive audio communications, and discussion forums, as well as other user-to-user communications that can be tracked by the adaptive system .","A fourth category of usage behaviors  is known as reference behaviors. Reference behaviors refer to the saving or tagging of specific objects  or structural subsets  of the system  by the user  for recollection or retrieval at a subsequent time. The saved or tagged objects , or structural subsets , may be organized in a manner customizable by the user . The referenced objects  (structural subsets ), as well as the manner in which they are organized by the user , may provide information on inferred interests  and intensity of interest.","A fifth category of usage behaviors  is known as direct feedback behaviors. Direct feedback behaviors include ratings or other indications of perceived quality by individuals of specific objects  or their attributes. The direct feedback behaviors may reveal the explicit preferences  of the user . In the adaptive system , the adaptive recommendations  produced by the adaptive recommendations function  (see ) may be rated. This enables a direct, adaptive feedback loop, based on explicit preferences  specified by the user . Direct feedback also includes user-written comments and narratives associated with objects  in the system .","A sixth category of usage behaviors  is known as physical location behaviors. Physical location behaviors identify physical location and mobility behaviors of the user . Location of the user  may be inferred from, for example, information associated with a Global Positioning System or any other positionally aware system or device. The physical location of physical objects referenced by objects  may be stored in the system . Proximity of users  to other users , or to physical objects referenced by objects , may be inferred. The length of time, or duration, at which the user  resides in a particular location may be used to infer intensity of interests associated with the particular location, or associated with objects  that have a relationship to a physical location.","In addition to the usage behavior categories  depicted in Table 1, usage behaviors  may be categorized over time and across user behavioral categories . Temporal patterns may be associated with each of the usage behavioral categories . Temporal patterns associated with each of the categories may be tracked and stored by the adaptive system . The temporal patterns may include historical patterns, including how recently an object  is accessed. For example, more recent behaviors may be inferred to indicate more intense current interest than less recent behaviors.","Another temporal pattern that may be tracked and contribute to preference inferences made is the duration associated with the access of objects , the interaction with the objects , or the user's physical proximity to objects  that refer to physical objects, or the user's physical proximity to other users  of the adaptive system . For example, longer durations may generally be inferred to indicate greater interest than short durations. In addition, trends over time of the behavior patterns may be captured to enable more effective inference of interests and relevancy. Since adaptive recommendations  may include a combination of structural aspects  and content aspects , the usage pattern types and preference inferencing may also apply to interactions of the one or more users  with the adaptive recommendations  themselves.","Adaptive System is Recursive and Iterative",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0111","num":"0110"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","240","200","100","240","262","240","210","100","264","214"]},"At a subsequent time to the structural aspect update (time n+1), the system use  is captured by the adaptive system  (block ). Recall that system use , or captured usage information , includes any interaction by the one or more users  of the adaptive system . The use of the system, and hence the captured usage information  may be influenced by the updated structural aspects  from the previous time period (time n).","As shown in , the adaptive recommendations function  may be iteratively invoked following each capture of the system use . Thus, at time n+2, the adaptive recommendations function  is invoked (block ), the adaptive recommendations being based on, among other things, the captured usage information  from the previous time period (time n+1). Based on the invocation of the adaptive recommendations function , the structural aspect  may again be updated (block ). Once the users  again use the adaptive system , the system use  is captured (block ), such that the adaptive recommendations function  can again be invoked. Thus, an iterative, feedback loop may be established between system usage  and the system structure (the structural aspect ), which may continue indefinitely.","Multiple invocations of the adaptive recommendations function  may be run, automatically or through direct user invocations, synchronously or asynchronously. Each invocation of the adaptive recommendations function  performs one or more of the following: 1) providing adaptive recommendations directly to individual users or to or groups of users (communities); 2) updating or modifying the system aspect ; and, 3) updating or modifying the content aspect . The result of this process is multiple, distributed, feedback loops enabling adaptation of the adaptive system .","Public Information Framework",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0115","num":"0114"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["1100","100","250","1100"]},"Recall from  that usage behaviors  are part of the usage aspect  of the adaptive system . Usage behaviors  include categorizations of system usage  over time and across usage categories , whether at an individual user or community level. In , additional details associated with individual usage behaviors  are depicted.","The individual usage behaviors  can be divided into private behaviors , and non-private behaviors . Private behaviors  are behaviors of a user  that are unavailable to other users while non-private behaviors  are behaviors that may be available to other users. As illustrated in , the non-private behaviors  may become socially available information .","The social information  includes unintentional information or communications, or \u201ccues\u201d , as well as intentional information or communications, or \u201csignals\u201d . Cues  may include by-product information from the intentional communications , whether the cues are derived by the user or users to whom the intentional communications were directed, or by a user or users other than to whom the intentional communications were directed.","Recall from  that the adaptive recommendations function  employs a preference inferencing algorithm  to derive explicit preferences , inferred preferences , and inferred interests  based on the captured usage information . As shown in , inferred preferences  and interests  are specifically derived from signals  and cues . The social information  thus further includes inferred preferences , such as reputations a, and interests . Inferred preferences  and interests  may be formed from both signals  and cues , or from combinations thereof.","An added feature of the adaptive system  enables users to specify the level of privacy associated with the derivation of inferred preferences  and interests . Users  may be able to adjust the level of privacy, through a privacy control , associated with the private information  and non-private information  being used by the adaptive system  to produce inferred preferences  and interests . A privacy control a allows the user to enable or disable non-private cues  and signals  from being used to infer preferences and interests.

Recall that a community may include a single user  or multiple users. Sub-communities may likewise include one or more users . Thus, the individual usage patterns  in  may also be described as representing the usage patterns of a community or a sub-community. For the adaptive system , usage behavior patterns  may be segmented among communities and individuals so as to effectively enable adaptive recommendations  for each sub-community or individual.","The communities identified by the adaptive system  may be determined through self-selection, through explicit designation by other users or external administrators (e.g., designation of certain users as \u201cexperts\u201d), or through automatic determination by the adaptive system . The communities themselves may have relationships between each other, of multiple types and values. In addition, a community may be comprised not of human users, or solely of human users, but instead may include one or more other computer-based systems, which may have reason to interact with the adaptive system . Or, such computer-based systems may provide an input into the adaptive system , such as by being the output from a search engine. The interacting computer-based system may be another instance of the adaptive system .","The usage behaviors  included in Table 1 may be categorized by the adaptive system  according to the usage framework  of . For example, categories of usage behavior may be captured and categorized according to the entire community usage patterns , sub-community usage patterns , and individual usage patterns . The corresponding usage behavior information  may be used to infer preferences and interests at each of the user levels.","Multiple usage behavior categories  shown in Table 1 may be used by the adaptive system  to make reliable inferences based on the preferences, of the user  with regard to the content aspect  and the structural aspect . There are likely to be different preference inferencing  results for different users . In addition, preference inferencing  may be different with regard to optimizing the content aspect  for display to the user  versus inferred preferences that are used for updating the structural aspect  or the content aspect , as updates to the structural aspect  are likely to be persistent and affect many users.","As an example, simply using the sequences of content accesses as the sole relevant usage behavior on which to base updates to the structure will generally yield unsatisfactory results. This is because the structure itself, through navigational proximity, will create a tendency toward certain navigational access sequence biases. Using just object or content access sequence patterns as the basis for updates to the structural aspect  will therefore tend to reinforce the pre-existing structure of the system , which may limit the adaptiveness of the adaptive system .","By introducing different or additional behavioral characteristics, such as the duration of access of an object  or item of content (information ), on which to base updates to the structural aspect  of the system  (system structural updates), a more adaptive system is enabled. For example, duration of access will generally be much less correlated with navigational proximity than access sequences will be, and therefore provide a better indicator of true user preferences. Therefore, combining access sequences and access duration will generally provide better inferences and associated system structural updates than using either usage behavior alone. Effectively utilizing additional usage behaviors as described above will generally enable increasingly effective system structural updating. In addition, the adaptive system  may employ user affinity groups to enable even more effective system structural updating than are available merely by applying either individual (personal) usage behaviors or entire community usage behaviors.","Furthermore, relying on only one or a limited set of usage behavioral cues  and signals  mitigates against potential \u201cspoofing\u201d or \u201cgaming\u201d of the system . \u201cSpoofing\u201d or \u201cgaming\u201d the adaptive system  refers to conducting consciously insincere or otherwise intentional usage behaviors  so as to influence the adaptive recommendations  or changes to the structural aspect  by the adaptive system . Utilizing broader sets of system usage behavioral cues  and signals  may lessen the effects of spoofing or gaming. One or more algorithms may be employed to detect such contrived usage behaviors, and when detected, such behaviors may be compensated for by the preference and interest inferencing algorithm .","User Communities","As described above, the user  of the adaptive system  may be a member of one or more communities of interest, or affinity groups, with a potentially varying degree of affinity associated with the respective communities. These affinities may change over time as interests of the user  and communities evolve over time. The affinities or relationships among users and communities may be categorized into specific types. An identified user may be considered a member of a special sub-community containing only one member, the member being the identified user. A user can therefore be thought of as just a specific case of the more general notion of user segments, communities, or affinity groups.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0130","num":"0129"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 9","FIG. 9"],"b":["100","202","1000","100","1000","1060","1061","1000","1064","1062","1069","1065","1067","1063","1000"]},"Sub-community B  is a community which has many relationships or affinities to other communities. These relationships may be of different types and differing degrees of relevance or affinity. (The relationships between communities depicted in  are distinct from the relationships between objects  referred to in .) For example, a first relationship  between sub-community B  and sub-community D  may be of one type, and a second relationship  may be of a second type. (In , the first relationship  is depicted using a double-pointing arrow, while the second relationship  is depicted using a unidirectional arrow.)","The relationships  and  may be directionally distinct, and may have an indicator of relationship or affinity associated with each distinct direction of affinity or relationship. For example, the first relationship  has a numerical value , or relationship value, of \u201c0.8.\u201d Several other relationship values are shown in , below, and are scaled to values between 0 and 1. The relationship value  thus describes the first relationship  between sub-community B  and sub-community D  as having a value of 0.8.","The relationship value may be scaled as in  (e.g., between 0 and 1), or may be scaled according to another interval. The relationship values may also be bounded or unbounded, or they may be symbolically represented (e.g., high, medium, low).","The user , which could be considered a user community including a single member, may also have a number of relationships to other communities, where these relationships are of different types, directions and relevance. From the perspective of the user , these relationship types may take many different forms. Some relationships may be automatically formed by the adaptive system , for example, based on interests or geographic location or similar traffic\/usage patterns. Thus, for example the entire community  may include users in a particular city. Some relationships may be context-relative. For example, a community to which the user  has a relationship could be job-related and another community could be related to another aspect of life, such as related to family, hobby, or health. Thus, sub-community E  may be the employees at a corporation to which the user  has a relationship ; sub-community B  may be the members of a sailing club to which the user  has a relationship ; sub-community C may be the doctors at a medical facility to which the user  has a relationship . The generation of new communities which include the user  may be based on the inferred interests  of the user  or other users within the entire community .","Membership of communities may overlap, as indicated by sub-communities A  and C . The overlap may result when one community is wholly a subset of another community, such as between the entire community  and sub-community B . More generally, a community overlap will occur whenever two or more communities contain at least one user in common. Such community subsets may be formed automatically by the adaptive system  based on preference inferencing  from usage patterns . For example, a subset of a community may be formed based on an inference of increased interest or demand of particular content or expertise of an associated community. The adaptive system  is also capable of inferring that a new community is appropriate. The adaptive system  will thus create the new community automatically.","For each user, whether residing within, say, sub-community A , or residing outside the community , such as the user , the relationships (such as arrows  or ), affinities, or \u201crelationship values\u201d (such as numerical indicator ), and directions (of arrows) are unique. Accordingly, some relationships (and specific types of relationships) between communities may be unique to each user. Other relationships, affinities, values, and directions may have more general aspects or references that are shared among many users, or among all users of the adaptive system . A distinct and unique mapping of relationships between users, such as is illustrated in , could thus be produced for each user of the adaptive system .","The adaptive system  may automatically generate communities, or affinity groups, based on user behaviors  and associated preference inferences . In addition, communities may be identified by users, such as administrators of the adaptive system . Thus, the adaptive system  utilizes automatically generated and manually generated communities in generating adaptive recommendations .","The communities, affinity groups, or user segments aid the adaptive system  in matching interests optimally, developing learning groups, prototyping system designs before adaptation, and many other uses. For example, advanced users of the adaptive system  may receive a preview of a new adaptation of a system for testing and fine-tuning, prior to other users receiving this change.","The users  or communities may be explicitly represented as objects  within the structural aspect  or the content aspect  of the adaptive system . This feature enhances the extensibility (portability) and adaptability of the adaptive system .","The user community structure depicted in  may be directly embedded in the usage aspect . Further, the usage community structure and the usage aspect may be a fuzzy network-based structure. Fuzzy networks are described in more detail, below.","Community Preference Inferences","The preferences of a given user community may be inferred from the amount of on-line traffic, or number of accesses or interactions, associated with individual objects , or with people or physical objects referenced by the object  (this may be termed, \u201cpopularity\u201d). The users  may have the ability to subscribe to selected structural subsets  and assign degrees of personal interest associated with the structural subsets, for the purposes of periodic updates on the structural subsets. Recall that a structural subset is a portion or subset of the structural aspect  of a system. The updates may be effected through, for example, e-mail updates.","The relative frequency of structural subsets  (e.g., topics) subscribed to by the user community as a whole, or by selected sub-communities, may be used to infer preferences at the community or sub-community level. The users  may create their own personalized structural aspect  through selection and saving of individual objects  or multiple objects and optionally associated relationships or, more generally, structural subsets . In such embodiments, the relative frequency of structural subsets being saved in the structural aspect  of a particular user by the user community as a whole, or by selected sub-communities, may also be used to infer community and sub-community preferences. These inferred community and sub-community preferences may be derived directly from saved structural subsets , but also from direct or indirect affinities the saved structural subsets have with other structural subsets.","Users  of the adaptive system  may be able to directly rate structural subsets  when they are accessed. In such embodiments, the preferences of a community or sub-community may also be inferred through ratings of individual structural subsets. The ratings may apply against both the information  referenced by the structural subset , as well as meta-information  such as an expert review of the information referenced by the system subset. Users  may have the ability to suggest structural subsets  to one or more other users, and preferences may be inferred from these human-based suggestions. The inferences may be derived from correlating the human-based suggestions with the inferred interests  of the receivers if the receivers of the human-based suggestions are users of the adaptive system  and have a personal history of objects  viewed and\/or a personal structural aspect  that they may have created.","Expert Preference Inferences","In the adaptive system , community subsets, such as subject matter experts, may be designated. Expert opinions on the relationship between objects  may be encoded in the structural aspect  of the adaptive system . Expert views can be directly inferred from the structural aspect. An expert or set of experts may directly rate individual objects and expert preferences may be directly inferred from these ratings.","The history of access of objects  or associated meta-information  by sub-communities, such as experts, may be used to infer preferences of the associated sub-community. Experts or other user sub-communities may also have the ability to create their own personalized structural aspect  through selection and saving or tagging of objects . The relative frequency of objects  being saved in personal structural aspects  (such as a local hard drive) by experts or communities of experts may also be used to infer expert preferences. These inferences may be derived directly from saved or tagged objects , but also from affinities the saved objects have with other objects.","A sub-community may be generated by the adaptive system  to prototype a new set of adaptive recommendations . For example, a sub-community may reflect a newly optimized business process or a frequently traveled path that many novice users of a larger community often follow. In such circumstances, the new set of adaptive recommendations  could be useful as a learning tool for new users.","Personal Preference Inferences","Users  of the adaptive system  may subscribe to selected structural subsets  for the purposes of, for example, e-mail updates on these subsets. The objects  subscribed to by the user  may be used to infer the preferences of the user. Users  may create their own personalized structural aspect  through selection and saving or tagging of objects . The relative frequency of objects  being saved in a personal structural aspect  by the user  may be used to infer the individual preferences of the user. These inferences may be derived directly from saved objects , but also from direct or indirect affinities the saved objects have with other objects.","Users can also directly rate objects  when accessed. In such embodiments, personal preferences may also be inferred through these ratings of individual objects . The ratings may apply against both the information  referenced by the object , such as an expert review of the information  referenced by the object . A personal history of paths of the objects  viewed may be stored. This personal history can be used to infer preferences of the user , as well as tuning adaptive recommendations and suggestions by avoiding recommending or suggesting objects  that have already been recently viewed or completed by the user .","Adaptive Recommendations and Suggestions","Adaptive recommendations  generated by the adaptive  recommendations function  may combine inferences from community, sub-community (including expert), and personal behaviors and preferences, as discussed above, to present to the one or more users , one or more system structural subsets . The users  may find the structural subsets particularly relevant given the current navigational context of the user within the system, the physical location of the user, and\/or responsive to an explicit request of the system by the one or more users. In other words, the adaptive recommendation function  determines preference \u201csignals\u201d from the \u201cnoise\u201d of system usage behaviors.","The sources of user behavioral information, which typically include the objects  referenced by the user , may also include the actual information  contained therein. In generating adaptive recommendations , the adaptive system  may thus employ search algorithms that use text matching or more general statistical pattern matching to provide inferences on the inferred themes of the information  embedded in, or referenced by, individual objects . Furthermore, the structural aspect  may itself inform the specific adaptive recommendations  generated. For example, existing relationship structures within the structural aspect  at the time of the adaptive recommendations  may be combined with the user preference inferences based on usage behaviors, along with any inferences based on the content aspect  (the information ).","Delivery of Adaptive Recommendations",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0151","num":"0150"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 1"],"b":["250","100","250","200","255","210","245","230","246","260","100","265"]},"The adaptive system  begins by determining the relevant usage behavioral patterns  to be analyzed (block ). The adaptive system  thus identifies the relevant communities, affinity groups, or user segments of the one or more users . Affinities are then inferred among objects , structural subsets , and among the identified affinity groups (block ). This data enables the adaptive recommendations function  to generate adaptive recommendations  of the one or more users  for delivery. The adaptive system  next determines whether the adaptive recommendations  are to be delivered to the recommendations recipients (e.g., users  or non-users ), or are used to update the adaptive system  (block ). Where the recommendations recipients are to receive the adaptive recommendations (the \u201cno\u201d prong of block ), the adaptive recommendations  are generated based on mapping the context of the current system use (or \u201csimulated\u201d use if the current context is external to the actual use of the system) (block ) to the usage behavior patterns  generated by the preference inferencing algorithm  (block ).","Adaptive recommendations are then delivered visually and\/or in other communications forms, such as audio, to the recommendations recipients (block ). The recommendations recipients may be individual users or a group of users, or may be non-users  of the adaptive system . For Internet-based applications, the adaptive recommendations  may be delivered through a web browser directly, or through RSS\/Atom feeds and other similar protocols.","The recommended structural subsets , along with associated content may constitute most or all of the user interface that is presented to the recommendations recipient, on a periodic or continuous basis. Such embodiments correspond to the continuous, fully adaptive interface described in the framework  of , below, including systems which do not syndicate (), systems in which individual content is syndicated (), systems in which structural subsets are syndicated (), and systems which support recombinant structural syndication.","Where, instead, adaptive system  is to receive the adaptive recommendations (the \u201cyes\u201d prong of block ), the adaptive recommendations  are used to update the structural aspect  or the content aspect . The adaptive recommendations  are generated based on mapping the potential structural aspect  or content aspect  to the affinities generated by the usage behavioral inferences (block ). The adaptive recommendations  are then delivered to enable updating of the structural aspect  or the content aspect  (block ).","The adaptive recommendations function  may operate completely automatically, performing in the background and updating the structural aspect  independent of human intervention. Or, the adaptive recommendations function  may be used by users or experts who rely on the adaptive recommendations  to provide guidance in maintaining the system structure as a whole, or maintaining specific structural subsets  (semi-automatic).","The navigational context for the recommendation  may be at any stage of navigation of the structural aspect  (e.g., during the viewing of a particular object ) or may be at a time when the recommendation recipient is not engaged in directly navigating the structural aspect . In fact, the recommendation recipient need not have explicitly used the system associated with the recommendation .","Some inferences will be weighted as more important than other inferences in generating the recommendation . These weightings may vary over time, and across recommendation recipients, whether individual recipients or sub-community recipients. As an example, characteristics of objects  which are explicitly stored or tagged by the user  in a personal structural aspect  would typically be a particularly strong indication of preference as storing or tagging system structural subsets requires explicit action by the user . The recommendations optimization algorithms  may thus prioritize this type of information to be more influential in driving the adaptive recommendations  than, say, general community traffic patterns within the structural aspect .","The recommendations optimization algorithm  will particularly try to avoid recommending objects  that the user is already familiar with to the user. For example, if the user  has already stored or tagged the object  in a personal structural subset , then the object  may be a low ranking candidate for recommendation to the user, or, if recommended, may be delivered to the user with a designation acknowledging that the user has already saved or marked the object for future reference. Likewise, if the user  has recently already viewed the associated system object (regardless of whether it was saved to his personal system), then the object would typically rank low for inclusion in a set of recommended objects.","The preference inferencing algorithm  may be tuned by the individual user. The tuning may occur as adaptive recommendations  are provided to the user, by allowing the user to explicitly rate the adaptive recommendations. The user  may also set explicit recommendation tuning controls to adjust the adaptive recommendations to her particular preferences. For example, the user  may guide the adaptive recommendations function  to place more relative weight on inferences of expert preferences versus inferences of the user's own personal preferences. This may particularly be the case if the user was relatively inexperienced in the corresponding domain of knowledge associated with the content aspect  of the system, or a structural subset  of the system. As the user's experience grows, she may adjust the weighting toward inferences of the user's personal preferences versus inferences of expert preferences.","Adaptive recommendations, which are structural subsets of the adaptive system  (sec ), may be displayed in variety of ways to the user. The structural subsets  may be displayed as a list of objects  (where the list may be null or a single object). The structural subset  may be displayed graphically. The graphical display may provide enhanced information that may include depicting relationships among objects (as in the \u201crelationship\u201d arrows of ).","In addition to the structural subset , the recommendation recipient may be able to access information  to help gain an understanding about why the particular structural subset was selected as the recommendation to be presented to the user. The reasoning may be fully presented to the recommendation recipient as desired by the recommendation recipient, or it may be presented through a series of interactive queries and associated answers, where the recommendation recipient desires more detail. The reasoning may be presented through display of the logic of the recommendations optimization algorithm . A natural language (e.g., English) interface may be employed to enable the reasoning displayed to the user to be as explanatory and human-like as possible.","The personal preference of the user may affect the nature of the display of the information. For example some users may prefer to see the structural aspect in a visual, graphic format while other users may prefer a more interactive question and answer or textual display.","System users may be explicitly represented as objects in the structural aspect  and hence embodied in structural subsets . Either embodied as structural subsets, or represented separately from structural subsets , the adaptive recommendations  of some set of users of the adaptive system  may be determined and displayed to recommendation recipients, providing either implicit or explicit permission is granted by the set of users. The recommendations optimization algorithm  may match the preferences of other users of the system with the current user. The preference matches may include the characteristics of structural subsets stored or tagged by users, their structural subset subscriptions and other self-profiling information, and their system usage patterns . Information about the recommended set of users may be displayed. This information may include names, as well as other relevant information such as affiliated organization and contact information. The information may also include system usage information, such as common system objects subscribed to, etc. As in the case of structural subset adaptive recommendations, the adaptive recommendations of other users may be tuned by an individual user through interactive feedback with the adaptive system .","The adaptive recommendations  may be in response to explicit requests from the user. For example, a user may be able to explicitly designate one or more objects  or structural subsets , and prompt the adaptive system  for a recommendation based on the selected objects or structural subsets. The recommendations optimization algorithm  may put particular emphasis on the selected objects or structural subsets, in addition to applying inferences on preferences from usage behaviors, as well as optionally, content characteristics.","In some embodiments, the adaptive recommendations function  may augment the preference inferencing algorithm  with considerations related to maximizing the revelation of user preferences, so as to better optimize the adaptive recommendations  in the future. In other words, where the value of information associated with reducing uncertainty associated with user preferences is high, the adaptive recommendations function  may choose to recommend objects  or other recommended structural aspects  as an \u201cexperiment.\u201d For example, the value of information will typically be highest for relatively new users, or when there appears to be a significant change in usage behavioral pattern  associated with the user . The adaptive recommendations function  may employ design of experiment (DOE) algorithms so as to select the best possible \u201cexperimental\u201d adaptive recommendations, and to optimally sequence such experimental adaptive recommendations, and to adjust such experiments as additional usage behaviors  are assimilated. The preference inferencing  and recommendations optimization  algorithms may also preferentially deliver content that is specially sponsored, for example, advertising or public relations-related content.","In summary, the adaptive recommendations  may be presented to the users , to the non-user , or back to the adaptive system , for updating either the structural aspect  or the content aspect . The adaptive recommendations  will thus influence subsequent user interactions and behaviors associated with the adaptive system , creating a dynamic feedback loop.","Automatic or Semi-Automatic System Structure Maintenance","The adaptive recommendations function , optionally in conjunction with system structure maintenance functions, may be used to automatically or semi-automatically update and enhance the structural aspect  of the adaptive system . The adaptive recommendations function  may be employed to determine new relationships  among objects  in the adaptive system, within structural subsets , or structural subsets associated with a specific sub-community. The automatic updating may include potentially assigning a relationship between any two objects to zero (effectively deleting the relationship between the two objects).","In either an autonomous mode of operation, or in conjunction with human expertise, the adaptive recommendations function  may be used to integrate new objects  into the structural aspect , or to delete existing objects  from the structural aspect.","The adaptive recommendations function  may also be extended to scan and evaluate structural subsets  that have special characteristics. For example, the adaptive recommendations function  may suggest that certain of the structural subsets that have been evaluated are candidates for special designation. This may include being a candidate for becoming a new specially designated sub-system or structural subset. The adaptive recommendations function  will suggest to human users or experts the structural subset  that is suggested to become a new sub-system or structural subset, along with existing sub-system or structural subsets that are deemed to be \u201cclosest\u201d in relationship to the new suggested structural subset. A human user or expert may then be invited to add the object or objects , and may manually create relationships  between the new object and existing objects.","As another alternative, the adaptive recommendations function , optionally in conjunction with the system structure maintenance functions, may automatically generate the object or objects , and may automatically generate the relationships  between the newly created object and other objects  in the structural aspect .","This capability is extended such that the adaptive recommendations function , in conjunction with system structure maintenance functions, automatically maintains the structural aspect and identified structural subsets . The adaptive recommendations function  may not only identify new objects , generate associated objects , and generate associated relationships  among the new objects  and existing objects , but also identify objects  that are candidates for deletion. The adaptive recommendations function  may also automatically delete the object  and its associated relationships .","In this way the adaptive recommendations function , optionally in conjunction with a system structure maintenance function, may automatically adapt the structural aspect  of the adaptive system , whether on a periodic or continuous basis, so as to optimize the user experience.","In some embodiments, each of the automatic steps listed above with regard to updating the structural aspect  may be employed interactively by human users and experts as desired.","Hence, the adaptive recommendations function , driven in part by usage behaviors, automatically or semi-automatically updates the system structural aspect  (see dotted arrow  in ). The feedback loop is closed as user interactions with the adaptive system  are influenced by the structural aspect , providing an adaptive, self-reinforcing feedback loop between the usage aspect  and the structural aspect .","Automatic or Semi-Automatic System Content Maintenance","As shown in , the adaptive recommendations function  may provide the ability to automatically or semi-automatically update the content aspect  of the adaptive system  (see dotted arrow ). Examples of content that may be updated include text, animation, audio, video, tutorials, manuals and interactive applications; reviews and brief descriptions of the content may also be updated. Customized text or multi-media content suitable for online viewing or printing may be generated. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/715,174 entitled \u201cA Method and System for Customized Print Publication and Management\u201d discloses relevant approaches for updating the content aspect  and is incorporated here in its entirety by reference.","The adaptive recommendations function  may operate automatically, performing in the background and updating the content aspect  independently of human intervention. Or, the adaptive recommendations function  may be used by users  or special experts who rely on the adaptive recommendations  to provide guidance in maintaining the content aspect .","As in the case of the structural aspect , different communities may also be used to model the maintenance of the content aspect . The communities, affinity groups, and user segments are used to adapt the relevancies and to create, alter or delete relationships  between the objects . The adaptive recommendations  may present the objects  to the user  in a different combination than initially may have been inputted and may treat sections of a larger object such as a document, book or manual as multiple objects that can be recombined in a pattern that is aligned with community usage, by creating or altering relationships between sections.","In addition, as user feedback on system activities and usage behavioral patterns  is accumulated, the adaptive system  may suggest areas where extra content would be beneficial to users. For example, if the object  is frequently rated by users  as difficult to understand, or if only expert users in a community are accessing the object, the adaptive system  may recognize the need for supplemental content (e.g., in the form of documentation or online tutorials or demonstrations).","Hence, as shown in , the adaptive recommendations function , driven in part by usage behaviors , automatically or semi-automatically updates the content aspect . The feedback loop is closed as the interactions of the user  with the adaptive system  are influenced by updates to the content aspect , providing an adaptive, self-reinforcing feedback loop between the usage aspect  and the content aspect , and, in some embodiments, between the usage aspect , the structural aspect , and the content aspect .","Furthermore, the adaptive system  may serve as a \u201cuser\u201d of another adaptive system. Recall from  that the one or more users  may include a human entity, non-human entities, such as another computer system, or a second adaptive system that interacts with the adaptive system. The second adaptive system is known herein as a virtual user of the adaptive system .","In , the one or more users A of adaptive system A have been expanded to include a human user , a non-human user , and a virtual user, adaptive system B. Interactions with the adaptive system A by each entity B, , and  are monitored and used to make preference inferences. The interactions may include any of the usage behaviors  listed in Table 1. The interactions with the adaptive system A by the virtual user (adaptive system B) may come from the adaptive recommendations function B of the adaptive system B, combined with functions suitable for interactions between the two systems A and B. The adaptive recommendations function A may generate adaptive recommendations A to be received by any of the recommendations recipients, the human user , the non-human computer , or the virtual user, the adaptive system B.","Where the adaptive system B is less \u201cexperienced\u201d (relative to the adaptive system A), the adaptive recommendations function A may serve as a training mechanism for the new adaptive system B. Given a distribution of objects  and their relationships , metrics and usage behaviors  associated with scope, subject and other experiential data such as patterns of other adaptive systems, the adaptive recommendations function A may automatically begin assimilation of objects  into the less experienced adaptive system B, possibly with intervention by human users. Clusters of newly assimilated objects  may enable inferences resulting in the suggestion of new structural subsets , communities; and their associated relationships would also be, in some embodiments, automatically created and updated. Application of mutual training functionality of the adaptive recommendation engine may also be applied when two or more adaptive systems are directly integrated.","The virtual user (adaptive system B) may be integrated with human and non-human users, as depicted in , or the virtual user may be segregated from other users  of the adaptive system , as desired. As in the case of the human user , the virtual user B may be explicitly represented as an object  within the adaptive system A, as shown in . Thus, any of the users A, human user , non-human user , or virtual user B may be explicitly represented as information  within the content aspect A (and associated object  in the structural aspect A) of the adaptive system A. In this way, the content aspect A may be extended to encompass users  of the adaptive system A. Thus, the users A of the adaptive system A are merged, in a representational sense, with the adaptive system itself. The representation of users  as being part of the content A, as shown in , reflects aspects of social networks and adaptive systems that are beneficially combined.","As with the human user  and the non-human user , virtual users may mutually \u201cuse\u201d or interact with one another, as represented by the arrows , , and  leading from the users  and the dotted arrow  leading from the adaptive recommendations A to the users B. The mutual interaction between the adaptive systems A and B enable collective evolution of the structural aspects A and B and the content aspects A and B. This principle may be extended to multiple adaptive systems mutually interacting with one another.","The adaptive system  is distinguishable from collaborative filtering-based prior art. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,790,426, entitled \u201cAutomated Collaborative Filtering System\u201d (Robinson) recommends information items based on direct ratings of multiple system users. However, among many other aspects of distinction, the Robinson invention is limited to inferences associated with one type of usage behavior, the direct rating of informational items only, and has no provisions for modifying the system structure or content based on preference inferences.","Network-Based Embodiments","The structural aspect  of the adaptive system  may be based on a network structure. The structural aspect  thus includes two or more objects, along with associated relationships among the objects. Networks, as used herein, are distinguished from other structures, such as hierarchies, in that networks allow potential relationships between any two objects of a collection of objects. In a network, there are not necessarily well-defined parent objects, and associated children, grandchildren, etc., objects, nor a \u201croot\u201d object associated with the entire system, as there would be by definition in a hierarchy. In other words, networks may include cyclic relationships that are not permitted in strict hierarchies. As used herein, a hierarchy can be thought of as just one particular form of a network, with some additional restrictions on relationships among network objects.","The adaptive system  is distinguishable from network-based system structures of the prior art. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,285,999, entitled \u201cMethod for Node Ranking in a Linked Database\u201d (Page), is a linked node search algorithm that presents a ranking of nodes based on the relative level of linkages among the nodes. However, among many other aspects of distinction, the Page invention is limited to non-fuzzy networks, does not generate persistent structural or content modifications, and does not utilize system usage information as does the adaptive system . Another example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,875,446, entitled \u201cSystem and Method for Hierarchically Grouping and Ranking a Set of Objects in a Query Context Based on One or More Relationships\u201d (Brown, et al), delivers a retrieved set of objects from an object base that has potentially non-directed, weighted relationships, and organizes the retrieved objects in a hierarchical structure. However, among many other aspects of distinction, the Brown, et al, invention does not generate persistent structural or content modifications, does not enable delivery of non-hierarchical structures to users, and does not utilize system usage information, as does the adaptive system .","The structural aspect  of the adaptive system  may also have a fuzzy network structure. Fuzzy networks are distinguished from other types of network structures in that the relationships between objects in fuzzy networks may be by degree. In non-fuzzy networks, the relationships between objects are binary. Thus, between any two objects, relationships either exist or they don't exist.","As used herein, a fuzzy network is defined as a network of information in which each individual item of information may be related to any other individual item of information, and the associated relationship between the two items may be by degree. A fuzzy network can be thought of abstractly as a manifestation of relationships among fuzzy sets (rather than classical sets), hence the designation \u201cfuzzy network.\u201d As used herein, a non-fuzzy network is a subset of a fuzzy network, in which relationships are restricted to binary values (i.e., relationship either exists or does not exist). Pedrycz and Gomide, Introduction to Fuzzy Sets: Analysis and Design, 1998 provide additional background regarding fuzzy sets.","Generalizing further, both classical networks and fuzzy networks may have a-directional (also called non-directed) or directed links between nodes.

Fuzzy networks, as used herein, are networks with topologies iii or iv."]}]}}]}}},"For each of the four network topologies listed in Table 2, another possible variation exists: whether the network allows only a single link or multiple links between any two nodes, where the multiple links may correspond to multiple types of links. For example, the fuzzy network types (iii and iv) of Table 2 may permit multiple directionally distinct and multi-valued links between any two nodes in the network. The adaptive system  encompasses any of the network topologies listed in Table 2, including those which allow multiple links and multiple link types between nodes.","The relationship among nodes in a fuzzy network may be described most generally by an affinity matrix. For a network with N nodes, n. . . n, for integer i, the affinity matrix will have N rows and columns. Each cell of the matrix contains a number from 0 to 1 that describes the relationship between the associated two nodes, nand n, 1\u2266a,b\u2266i. For classic networks (topology i or ii), each cell of the affinity matrix contains either a 0 or a 1; for fuzzy networks (topology iii or iv), each cell, when normalized, contains a number between 0 and 1, inclusive. If the network allows multiple types of links between any two nodes, then each type of link will have a corresponding affinity matrix associated therewith.","It is instructive to review networks that are familiar and their associated topologies. For example, the World Wide Web, which has been much studied, is generally thought of as a directionally distinct, binary link network (topology ii). In other words, either a web page has a link to another web page or it does not, and the link between the web page and the other web page has a particular direction. (Although there may be multiple links between two web pages, the links are not different in link type, in that they do not have distinctive relationship meanings. The brain, on the other hand, seems to be a fuzzy network, and the links between neurons seem to be generally directionally distinct (Laughlin and Sejnowski, Communication in Neuronal Networks, Science, September 2003). Social networks also seem to be fuzzy networks, and to the links among people may sometimes be modeled as a-directional, but more descriptively may be modeled as directionally distinct.","Mathematically, for a non-fuzzy network, it can be said, without loss of generality, that a relationship translates to either a \u201c0\u201d or a \u201c1\u201d\u2014\u201c0,\u201d for example if there is not a relationship, and \u201c1\u201d if there is a relationship. For fuzzy networks, the relationships between any two nodes, when normalized, may have values along a continuum between 0 and 1 inclusive, where 0 implies no relationship between the nodes, and 1 implies the maximum possible relationship between the nodes. Fundamentally then, fuzzy networks can provide more information about the relationship among network nodes than can non-fuzzy networks.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0197","num":"0196"},"figref":"FIG. 13A","b":["300","305","305","307"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0198","num":"0197"},"figref":"FIG. 13B","b":["110","312","314","309","312","311","314"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0199","num":"0198"},"figref":"FIG. 14A","b":["320","322","323","320","326","328"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0200","num":"0199"},"figref":"FIG. 14B","b":["330","331","331","332","334","331","330","331","336","338","337","339"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0201","num":"0200"},"figref":["FIGS. 15A and 15B","FIGS. 13A and 13B","FIG. 15A","FIG. 15A"],"b":["340","342","344","346"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0202","num":"0201"},"figref":"FIG. 15B","b":["350","352","354"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0203","num":"0202"},"figref":["FIGS. 16A and 16B","FIG. 13A","FIG. 16B"],"b":["360","364","366","368","368","370","172","174"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0204","num":"0203"},"figref":["FIGS. 17A and 17B","FIG. 14A","FIG. 17B"],"b":["380","382","384","386","390","392","394"]},"The structural aspect  of the adaptive system  of  may support any of the network topologies described above.

In some embodiments, the adaptive recombinant system  operates on an adaptive system in which the structural aspect  is a fuzzy network.

Recall that a structural subset is a portion or subset of the structural aspect  of the adaptive system . The structural subset  may include a single or multiple objects, and their associated relationships.","Generalized Network Degrees of Separation","The notion of the degree of separation among nodes in non-fuzzy networks is well known. Degrees of separation may be employed as a metric to describe a \u201cneighborhood\u201d within a network. The degree of separation between any two nodes is defined as the shortest path between the two nodes. For networks with directionally distinct relationships between nodes, the shortest path between any two nodes may be specified to adhere to a specific directional orientation.","A node can be thought of as having a zeroth degree of separation with itself. The node has a first degree of separation from other nodes to which it is directly connected. The node has a second degree of separation from the nodes that are directly connected to first degree of separation nodes and are not already more closely separated, and so on.  depicts a non-fuzzy, a-directional network  and the associated degrees of separation  from Node X, according to the prior art.","The notion of degrees of separation of non-fuzzy networks is extended to fuzzy networks in the adaptive system . Fractional degrees of separation among nodes may be attributed to fuzzy networks. The degree of separation between the two nodes can be defined as:\n\n(scaling factor+(1\u2212affinity))\n\nfor a given affinity level, affinity, where 0<affinity\u22661, for Node i and Node j, and where 1 is the strongest possible relationship, excluding the identity relationship, and 0 implies no direct relationship. \u201cScaling factor\u201d is a number between 0 and 1 chosen to normalize the degrees of separation for the fuzzy network consistent with the specific definition and distributions of the affinities between nodes in the fuzzy network.\n","For example, if an affinity of 1.0 is defined as the identity function, then the scaling factor could be set to 0 so that the degree of separation of an affinity of 1.0, the identity degree of separation, is defined as 0. Alternatively, if an affinity of 0 is defined as no relationship whatsoever, then the degree of separation should logically be greater than 1.0, so the scaling factor may be chosen as a number up to and including 1.0.","The scaling factor may be a function of the specific distribution of the intensity level of affinities in a fuzzy network. These intensities may be linear across the range of 0 and 1, or may be nonlinear. If, for example, the mean intensity is defined at 0.5, then the scaling factor for the fractional degree of separation calculation could be set at 0.5.","In summary, for fuzzy networks, the general case of \u201cdistance\u201d relationship between two directly linked nodes is a fractional degree of separation. More generally, the degree of separation between any two nodes in a fuzzy network is defined as the minimum of the degrees of separation (which may be calculated on the basis of a specific directional orientation of relationships among the nodes) among all possible paths between the two nodes, where the degrees of separation between any two nodes along the path may be fractional. Where a network has multiple relationships between nodes, multiple potentially fractional degrees of separation may be calculated between any two nodes in the network.","For convenience, the term fractional degrees of separation may be shortened to the acronym \u201cFREES\u201d (FRactional degrEEs of Separation)\u2014as in, say, \u201cNode X is 2.7 FREES from Node Y.\u201d  represents a fuzzy, a-directional network  and the associated degrees of separation  (using a scaling factor of 0.5) from Node X.","The degree of separation within the fuzzy or non-fuzzy network may be calculated and displayed on demand for any two nodes in the network. All nodes within a specified degree of separation of a specified node may be calculated and displayed. Optionally, the associated fractional degrees of separation between the base node and the nodes within the specified fractional degrees of separation may be displayed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0219","num":"0218"},"figref":["FIG. 23","FIG. 21","FIG. 24","FIG. 22"],"b":["620","600","620","630","610","630"]},"The degrees of separation among nodes in a fuzzy network may be described by a fractional degrees-of-separation (FREES) matrix. For a network with N nodes, n. . . n, the degree-of-separation matrix will have N rows and columns. Each cell of the matrix contains a number that describes the degree of separation between the associated two nodes, iand n. For non-fuzzy networks, each cell will contain an integer value; for fuzzy networks each cell of the FREES matrix may contain non-integer values. For both fuzzy and non-fuzzy networks, the diagonal of the affinity matrix will be 0's\u2014the identity degree of separation. If a fuzzy network is described by multiple affinity matrices, then the multiple affinity matrices correspond on a one-to-one basis with multiple associated FREES matrices.","The degrees of separation for networks with multiple relationship types, whether for fuzzy or non-fuzzy networks, may be calculated as a function across some or all of the relationship types. For example, such a function could be the minimum of degree of separation from Node X to Node Y of all associated relationship types, or the function could be an average, or any other relevant mathematical function.","According to some embodiments, the adaptive recombinant system  of  employs fractional degrees of separation in its syndication and recombination operations, as described in more detail, below.","Fuzzy Network Subsets and Adaptive Operators","The adaptive recombinant system  of  includes fuzzy network operators . The fuzzy network operators  may manipulate one or more fuzzy or non-fuzzy networks. Some of the operators  may incorporate usage behavioral inferences associated with the fuzzy networks that the operators act on, and therefore these operators may be termed \u201cadaptive fuzzy network operators.\u201d The fuzzy network operators  may apply to any fuzzy network-based system structure, including fuzzy content network system structures, described further below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0224","num":"0223"},"figref":"FIG. 20","b":["820","800","822","824","826","828","832","800","820","834","820"]},"A selection operator , which selects subsets of networks, may designate the selected network subsets based on degrees of separation. For example, subsets of a fuzzy network may be selected from the neighborhood, designated by a FREES metric, around a given node, say Node X. The selection may take the form of selecting all nodes within the designated network neighborhood, or all the nodes and all the associated links as well within the designated network neighborhood, where the network neighborhood is defined as being within a certain degree of separation from Node X. A non-null fuzzy network subset will therefore contain at least one node, and possibly multiple nodes and relationships.","Two or more fuzzy network subsets may then be operated on by network operations such as union, intersection, difference, and complement, as well as any other Boolean set operators. An example is an operation that outputs the intersection (intersection operator ) of the network subset defined by the first degree or less of separation from Node X and the network subset defined by the second or less degree of separation from Node Y. The operation would result in the set of nodes and relationships common to these two network subsets, with special auxiliary rules optionally applied to resolve duplicative relationships as will be explained below.","The network operations may apply explicitly to fractional degrees of separation. For example, the union operator  may be applied to the network subset defined by half a degree of separation (0.5) or less from Node X and the network subset defined as 2.4 degrees of separation or less from Node Y. The union of the two network subsets results in a unique set of nodes and relationships that are contained in both of these network subsets. Special auxiliary rules may optionally be applied to resolve duplicative relationships. Fuzzy network operations may also be chained together, e.g., a union of two network subsets intersected with a third network subset, etc.","The fuzzy network operators  may have special capabilities to resolve the situation in which union  and intersection  operators define common nodes, but with differing relationships or values of the relationships among the common nodes. The fuzzy network intersection operator , Fuzzy_Network_Intersection, may be defined as follows:\n\nZ=Fuzzy_Network_Intersection(X, Y, W)\n\nwhere X, Y, and Z are network subsets and W is the resolution function . The resolution function  designates how duplicative relationships among nodes common to fuzzy network subsets X and Y are resolved.\n","Specifically, the fuzzy network intersection operator  first determines the common nodes of network subsets X and Y, to form a set of nodes, network subset Z. The fuzzy network intersection operator  then determines the relationships and associated relationship value and indicators uniquely deriving from X among the nodes in Z (that is, relationships that do not also exist in Y), and adds them into Z (attaching them to the associated nodes in Z). The operator then determines the relationships and relationship indicators and associated values uniquely deriving from Y (that is, relationships that do not also exist in X) and applies them to Z (attaching them to the associated nodes in Z).","For relationships that are common to X and Y, the resolution function , is applied. The resolution function  may be any mathematical function or algorithm that takes the relationship values of X and Y as arguments, and determines a new relationship value and associated relationship indicator.","The resolution function , Resolution_Function may be a linear combination of the corresponding relationship value of X and the corresponding relationship value of Y, scaled accordingly. For example:\n\nResolution_Function (X, Y)=(c*X+c*Y)\/(c+c)\n\nwhere Xand Yare relationship values of X and Y, respectively, and cand care coefficients. If c=1, and c=0, then Xcompletely overrides Y. If c=0 and c=1, then Ycompletely overrides X. If c=1 and c=1, then the derived relationship is a simple average of Xand Y. Other values of cand cmay be selected to create weighted averages of Xand Y. Nonlinear combinations of the associated relationships values, scaled appropriately, may also be employed.\n","The Fuzzy_Network_Union operator  may be derived from the Fuzzy_Network_Intersection operator , as follows:\n\nZ=Fuzzy_Network_Union(X, Y, W)\n\nwhere X, Y and Z are network subsets and W is the resolution function . Accordingly,\n\nZ=Fuzzy_Network_Intersection(X, Y, W)+(X\u2212Y)+(Y\u2212X)\n\nThat is, fuzzy network unions of two network subsets may be defined as the sum of the differences of the two network subsets (the nodes and relationships that are uniquely in X and Y, respectively) and the fuzzy network intersection of the two network subsets. The resulting network subset of the difference operator contains any unique relationships between nodes uniquely in an originating network subset and the fuzzy network intersection of the two subsets. These relationships are then added to the fuzzy network intersection along with all the unique nodes of each originating network subset, and all the relationships among the unique nodes, to complete the resulting fuzzy network subset.\n","It should be noted that, unlike the corresponding classic set operators, the fuzzy network intersection  and union  operators are not necessarily mathematically commutative\u2014that is, the order of the operands may matter. The operators will be commutative if the resolution function or algorithm is commutative.","For the adaptive recombinant system , the resolution function  that applies to operations that combine multiple networks may incorporate usage behavioral inferences related to one or all of the networks. The resolution function  may be instantiated directly by the adaptive recommendations function  (), or the resolution function  may be a separate function that invokes the adaptive recommendations function. The resulting relationships in the combined network will therefore be those that are inferred by the system to best reflect the collective usage histories and preference inferences of the predecessor networks.","For example, where one of the predecessor networks was used by larger numbers of individuals, or by individuals that members of communities or affinity groups that are inferred to be best informed on the subject of the associated content, then the resolution function  may choose to preferentially weight the relationships of that predecessor network higher versus the other predecessor networks. The resolution function  may use any or all of the usage behaviors , along with associated user segmentations and affinities obtained during usage behavior pre-processing  (see ), as illustrated in  and Table 1, and combinations thereof, to determine the appropriate resolution of common relationships and relationship values among two or more networks that are combined into a new network.","Fuzzy Network Metrics","Special metrics may be used to measure the characteristics of fuzzy networks and fuzzy network subsets. For example, these metrics may provide measures associated with the relationship of a network node or object to other parts of the network, and relative to other network nodes or objects. A metric may be provided that indicates the degree to which nodes are connected to the rest of the network. This metric may be calculated as the sum of the affinities of first degree or less separated directionally distinct relationships or links. The metric may be called a first degree connectedness parameter for the specific node.","The first degree connectedness metric may be generalized for zeroth to Ndegrees of connectedness as follows. The zeroth degree of connectedness is, by definition, zero. The Ndegree of connectedness of Node X is the sum of the affinities among all nodes within N degrees of separation of Node X. For fuzzy networks, N may not necessarily be an integer value. The connectedness parameters may be indexed to provide a convenient relative metric among all other nodes in the network.","As an example, in the fuzzy network  of , the first degree of connectedness of Node X is determined by summing all relationship values associated with Node X to objects within a fractional degree of separation, defined here as less than 1.5 degrees of separation. Four nodes which have less than 1.5 degrees of separation from Node X are shaded in . By summing the affinities of the four nodes (0.9+0.4+0.3+0.3), a connectedness metric of 1.9 for Node X is obtained.","In networks in which there are multiple types of relationships among nodes, there may be multiple connectedness measures for any specific Node X to the subset of the fuzzy network specified by a degree of separation, N, from X.","In summary, connectedness for a specific Node X may have variations associated with relationship type, the specified directions of the relationships selected for computation, and the degree of separation from the Node X. The general connectedness metric function may be defined as follows:\n\nConnectedness(Node X, T, D, S)\n\nwhere T is the relationship indicator type, D is the relationship direction, and S is the degree of separation. The Connectedness metric may be normalized to provide a convenient relative measure by indexing the metric across all nodes in a network.\n","A metric of the popularity of the network nodes or objects, or popularity metric, may also be provided. The fuzzy or non-fuzzy network may be implemented on a computer system, or on a network of computer systems such as the Internet or on an Intranet. The system usage behavioral patterns of users of the fuzzy network may be recorded. The number of accesses of particular nodes or objects of a fuzzy to non-fuzzy network may be recorded. The accesses may be defined as the actual display of the node or object to the user or the accesses may be defined as the display of information associated with the node or object to user, such as access to an associated editorial review. In some of these embodiments, the popularity metric may be based on the number of user accesses of the associated node or object, or associated\u2014information. The popularity metric may be calculated for prescribed time periods. Popularity may be recorded for various user segments, in addition to, or instead of, the usage associated with the entire user community. The usage traffic may be stored so that popularity trends over time may be accessed. In the most general case, popularity for a specific Node X will have variations by user segments and time periods. A general popularity function may therefore be represented as follows:\n\nPopularity(Node X, user segment, time period)\n\nThe Popularity metric may be normalized to provide a convenient relative measure by indexing the metric across all nodes in a network.\n","Metrics may be generated that go beyond the connectedness metrics, to provide information on additional characteristics associated with a node or object within the network relative to other nodes or objects in the network. A metric that combines aspects of connectedness and popularity measures, an influence metric, may be generated. The influence metric may provide a sense of the degree of importance or \u201cinfluence\u201d a particular node or object has within the fuzzy network.","The influence metric for Node X is calculated by adding the popularity of Node X to a term that is the sum of the popularities of the nodes or objects separated by one degree of separation or less from Node X, weighted by the associated affinities between Node X and each associated related node. The term associated with the weighted average of the popularities of the first degree of separation nodes of Node X is scaled by a coefficient. This coefficient may be defined as the inverse of the first degree connectedness metric of Node X.","For fuzzy networks with directionally distinct relationships and affinities, the influence metric may be calculated based only on the first degree affinities or less for relationships that are oriented in a particular direction. For example, influence may be calculated based on all relationships directed to Node X (as opposed to those directed away from Node X).","A generalized influence metric may also be provided, where the Ndegree of influence of node or object X is defined as the popularity of Node X added to a term that is the weighted average of the popularities of all nodes within N degrees of separation from Node X (where N may be a non-integer, implying a fractional degree of separation). The weights for each node may be a function of the affinities of the shortest path between Node X and the associated node. The generalized influence metric may be a multiplicative function, that is, the affinities along the path from Node X to each node within N degrees separation are multiplied together and then multiplied by the popularity of the associated node. Or, the metric may be a summation function, or any other mathematical function that combines the affinities along the associated network path. The generalized influence metric may be specified as a recursive function, satisfying the following difference equations and \u201cinitial condition\u201d:\n\nNth Degree of Influence(Node X)=(N\u22121)th Degree of Influence(Node X)+Influence of Nodes of N Degrees of Separation from Node X. \u2003\u2003(1)\n\nZeroth Degree of Influence(Node X)=Popularity(Node X) \u2003\u2003(2)\n","Where there are directionally distinct affinities, the affinities that are multiplied, summed, or otherwise mathematically operated on, between Node X and all other nodes within a directionally distinct degree of separation (where the degree of separation may be fractional), may be of relationships with a selected directional orientation. The relationship direction term (D, in the connectedness metric function, above, may be scaled by the Ndegree of connectedness (of a given directional orientation) of Node X.","The zeroth degree of influence may be defined as just the popularity of Node X.

These identifiers may be managed directly by the adaptive recombinant system , or the adaptive recombinant system may rely on an auxiliary system, such as an operating system or another application, to manage object identification. Alternatively, the identity relationship between objects may be determined though comparisons of information associated with the object or through a comparison of the actual object content (information ) itself. Associated content may be compared using text, graphic, video, or audio matching techniques. A threshold may be set in determining identicalness between two objects that is less than perfect matching to compensate for minor differences, versions, errors, or other non-substantive differences between the two objects, or to increase the speed of object comparisons by sacrificing some level of accuracy in identification of identicalness.","The combination of the fuzzy network  and the fuzzy network  yields fuzzy network . In the fuzzy network , relationships that were unique in networks  and  are maintained. Where relationships or relationship indicators are common in fuzzy networks  and , the resolution function  () is applied to create the relationship and associated relationship indicators in the newly formed fuzzy network .","For example, object  and object  are part of both fuzzy network  and fuzzy network .

In general, the resolution function  may be any mathematical function or algorithm that takes as input two numbers between 0 and 1 inclusive, and outputs a number between 0 and 1 inclusive.","The resolution function  may be derived from algorithms that apply appropriate usage behavior inferences. As a simple example, if the relationship value and associated indicator of one network has been derived from the usage behaviors of highly informed or expert users, then this may have more weighting than the relationship value and associated indicator of a second network for which the corresponding relationship value was based on inferences associated with the usage behaviors of a relatively sparse set of relatively uniformed users.","New relationships and associated relationship indicators that do not exist in originating fuzzy networks may also be generated by the adaptive recombinant system  upon fuzzy network creation.

A fuzzy content network  is depicted in .","The fuzzy content network , including content sub-networks a, b, and c. The content network  includes \u201ccontent,\u201d \u201cdata,\u201d or \u201cinformation,\u201d packaged in modules known as objects .","The content network  employs features commonly associated with \u201cobject-oriented\u201d software to manage the objects . That is, the content network  discretizes information as \u201cobjects.\u201d In contrast to typical procedural computer programming structures, objects are defined at a higher level of abstraction. This level of abstraction allows for powerful, yet simple, software architectures.","One benefit to organizing information as objects is known as encapsulation. An object is encapsulated when only essential elements of interaction with other objects are revealed. Details about how the object works internally may be hidden. In , for example, the object  includes meta-information  and information . The object  thus encapsulates information .","Another benefit to organizing information as objects is known as inheritance. The encapsulation of , for example, may form discrete object classes, with particular characteristics ascribed to each object class. A newly defined object class may inherit some of the characteristics of a parent class. Both encapsulation and inheritance enable a rich set of relationships between objects that may be effectively managed as the number of individual objects and associated object classes grows.","In the content network , the objects  may be either topic objects t or content objects c, as depicted in , respectively. Topic objects t are encapsulations that contain meta-information t and relationships to other objects (not shown), but do not contain an embedded pointer to reference associated information. The topic object t thus essentially operates as a \u201clabel\u201d to a class of information. The topic object  therefore just refers to \u201citself\u201d and the network of relationships it has with other objects .","Content objects c, as shown in , are encapsulations that contain meta-information c and relationships to other objects  (not shown). Additionally, content objects c may include either an embedded pointer to information or the information  itself (hereinafter, \u201cinformation \u201d).","The referenced information  may include files, text, documents, articles, images, audio, video, multi-media, software applications and electronic or magnetic media or signals. Where the content object c supplies a pointer to information, the pointer may be a memory address. Where the content network  encapsulates information on the Internet, the pointer may be a Uniform Resource Locator (URL).","The meta-information  supplies a summary or abstract of the object . So, for example, the meta-information t for the topic object t may include a high-level description of the topic being managed. Examples of meta-information t include a title, a sub-title, one or more descriptions of the topic provided at different levels of detail, the publisher of the topic meta-information, the date the topic object t was created, and subjective attributes such as the quality, and attributes based on user feedback associated with the referenced information. Meta-information may also include a pointer to referenced information, such as a uniform resource locator (URL), in one embodiment.","The meta-information c for the content object c may include relevant keywords associated with the information , a summary of the information , and so on. The meta-information c may supply a \u201cfirst look\u201d at the objects c. The meta-information c may include a title, a sub-title, a description of the information , the author of the information , the publisher of the information , the publisher of the meta-information c, and the date the content object c was created, as examples. As with the topic object t, meta-information for the content object c may also include a pointer.","In , the content sub-network a is expanded, such that both content objects c and topic objects t are visible. The various objects  of the content network  are interrelated by degrees, using relationships  (unidirectional and bidirectional arrows) and relationship indicators  (values). (The relationships  and relationship indicators  are similar to the relationships and relationship indicators depicted in , above, as well as other figures included herein.) Each object  may be related to any other object , and may be related by a relationship indicator , as shown. Thus, while information  is encapsulated in the objects , the information  is also interrelated to other information  by a degree manifested by the relationship indicators .","The relationship indicator  is a numerical indicator of the relationship between objects . Thus, for example, the relationship indicator  may be normalized to between 0 and 1, inclusive, where 0 indicates no relationship, and 1 indicates a subset relationship. Or, the relationship indicators  may be expressed using subjective descriptors that depict the \u201cquality\u201d of the relationship. For example, subjective descriptors \u201chigh,\u201d \u201cmedium,\u201d and \u201clow\u201d may indicate a relationship between two objects .","The relationship  between objects  may be bidirectional, as indicated by the double-pointing arrows. Each double-pointing arrow includes two relationship indicators , one for each \u201cdirection\u201d of the relationships between the objects .","As  indicates, the relationships  between any two objects  need not be symmetrical. That is, topic object t  has a relationship of \u201c0.3\u201d with content object c, while content object c has a relationship of \u201c0.5\u201d with topic object t. Furthermore, the relationships  need not be bi-directional\u2014they may be in one direction only. This could be designated by a directed arrow, or by simply setting one relationship indicator  of a bi-directional arrow to \u201c0,\u201d the null relationship value.","The content networks A, B, C may be related to one another using relationships of multiple types and associated relationship indicators . For example, in , content sub-network a is related to content sub-network b and content sub-network c, using relationships of multiple types and associated relationship indicators . Likewise, content sub-network b is related to content sub-network a and content sub-network c using relationships of multiple types and associated relationship indicators .","Individual content and topic objects  within a selected content sub-network a may be related to individual content and topic objects  in another content sub-network b. Further, multiple sets of relationships of multiple types and associated relationship indicators  may be defined between two objects ","For example, a first set of relationships  and associated relationship indicators  may be used for a first purpose or be available to a first set of users while a second set of relationships  and associated relationship indicators  may be used for a second purpose or available to a second set of users. For example, in , topic object t is bi-directionally related to topic object t, not once, but twice, as indicated by the two double arrows. An indefinite number of relationships  and associated relationship indicators  may therefore exist between any two objects  in the fuzzy content network . The multiple relationships  may correspond to distinct relationship types. For example, a relationship type might be the degree an object  supports the thesis of a second object , while another relationship type might be the degree an object  disconfirms the thesis of a second object . The content network  may thus be customized for various purposes and accessible to different user groups in distinct ways simultaneously.","The relationships among objects  in the content network , as well as the relationships between content networks a and b, may be modeled after fuzzy set theory. Each object , for example, may be considered a fuzzy set with respect to all other objects , which are also considered fuzzy sets. The relationships among objects  are the degrees to which each object  belongs to the fuzzy set represented by any other object . Although not essential, every object  in the content network  may conceivably have a relationship with every other object .","The topic objects t encompass, and are labels for, very broad fuzzy sets of the content network . The topic objects t thus may be labels for the fuzzy set, and the fuzzy set may include relationships to other topic objects t as well as related content objects c. Content objects c, in contrast, typically refer to a narrower domain of information in the content network .","The adaptive system  of  may operate in a fuzzy content network environment, such as the one depicted in . In , an adaptive system D includes a structural aspect D that is a fuzzy content network. Thus, adaptive recommendations  generated by the adaptive system D are also structural subsets that are themselves fuzzy content networks.","Similarly, the adaptive recombinant system  of  may operate in a fuzzy content network environment. In , an adaptive recombinant system D includes the adaptive system D of . Thus, the adaptive recombinant system D may perform syndication and recombination operations, as described above, to generate structural subsets that are fuzzy content networks.","Extended Fuzzy Structures in Fuzzy Networks","The fuzzy network model may be extended to the organizational structure of the meta-information and other affiliated information associated with each network node or object. In a fractional degree of separation system structure, depicted in , meta-information and affiliated information may be structured in distinct tiers or rings around the information, with each tier designated as a fractional degree of separation . The chosen parameters for the degrees of separation of the meta-information will depend on the definition of the calculation of the degrees of separation between any two nodes, specifically depending on the choice of the scaling factor on in the formula. This extended fuzzy network structure may be utilized to implement a fuzzy content network system structure, or any other fuzzy network-based structure.","Meta-information  associated with information or interactive applications  may include, but is not limited to, descriptive information about the object such as title, publishing organization, date published, physical location of a physical object, an associated photo or picture, summary or abstracts, a plurality of reviews, etc. Meta-information  may also include dynamic information such as expert and community ratings of the information, feedback from users, and more generally, any relevant set of, or history of, usage behaviors described in Table 1. The meta-information  may also include information about relationships to other nodes in the network. For example, the meta-information  may include the relationships with other nodes in the networks, including an identification code for each related node, the types of relationships, the direction of the relationships, and the degree of relatedness of each relationship.","The meta-information  may be defined within tiers of fractional degree of separation between zero and one. For example, the most tightly bound meta-information might be in a tier at degree of separation of 0.1 and less tightly bound meta-information might be in a tier at degree of separation of 0.8.","Where the degrees of separation calculated between any two nodes in the fuzzy network are between 0 and 1, the meta-information tiers would more appropriately be designated with negative (possibly fractional) degrees of separation. For example, the most tightly bound meta-information  may be in a tier at degree of separation of \u22125 and less tightly bound meta-information may be in a tier at degree of separation of \u22121.","The meta-information tiers may distinguish between static meta-information such as the original author of the associated information, and dynamic information such as the total number of accesses of the associated information through a computer system.","The fractional degree of separations of less than one may correspond to compound objects . For example, a picture object plus a text biography object may constitute a person object. For typical fuzzy content network operations the compound object would generally behave as if it was one object.","The fractional degree of separations of less than one may correspond to a list of objects with which the present object has a specific sequential relation . For example, this may include workflow sequences in processes. These sequential relationships imply a tighter \u201cbinding\u201d between objects than the relationships associated with other objects in the fuzzy network , hence a smaller fractional degree of separation is employed for sequential relationships.","All meta-information may explicitly be content objects that relate to associated information by a fractional degree of separation of less than one, and may relate to other content objects in the network by a fractional degree of separation that may be greater than or equal to one. This can be described by a degree-of-separation matrix. Every object is arrayed in sequence along both the matrix columns and the matrix rows. Each cell of the matrix corresponds to the degree of separation between the two associated objects. The cells in the main diagonal of the degree of separation matrix are all zeroes, indicating the degree of separation between an object and itself is zero. All other cells will contain a non-zero number, indicating the degree of separation between the associated objects, or a designator indicating that the degree of separation is essentially infinite in the case when there is no linked path at all between the associated objects.","Personalized Fuzzy Content Network Subsets","Recall that users  of the adaptive system  of  may tag or store subsets of the structural aspect  for personal use, or to share with others. Likewise, users  of the adaptive recombinant system  may tag subsets of the fuzzy content network, whether for personal use or to share with others.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0305","num":"0304"},"figref":"FIG. 38","b":["770","772","772","772"]},"Users of the Epiture software system may select content objects and tag them for storage in their personal fuzzy network. Optionally, related meta-information and links to other objects in the original fuzzy network may be stored with the content object. Users may also store entire topics in their \u201cMy World\u201d personal fuzzy network. Furthermore, users may use fuzzy network operators to create synthetic topics. For example, a user might apply an intersection operator to Topic A and Topic B, to yield Topic C. Topic C could then be stored in the personal fuzzy network. Union, difference and other fuzzy network operators may also be used in creating new fuzzy network subsets to be stored in a private fuzzy content network.","Users of the Epiture software system may directly edit their personal fuzzy networks, including the names or labels associated with content objects and topic objects, as well as other meta-information associated with content and topic objects.

As with other network embodiments described herein, the adaptive recommendations generated from a fuzzy content network may be in the context of a currently accessed content object or historical path of accessed content objects during a specific user session, or the adaptive recommendations may be without context of a currently accessed content object or current session path.","In the most generalized approach, adaptive recommendations in a fuzzy content network combine inferences from user community behaviors and preferences, inferences of sub-community or expert behaviors and preferences, and inferences of personal user behaviors and preferences. Usage behaviors that may be used to make preference inferences include, but are not limited to, those that are described in Table 1. These usage-based inferences may be augmented by automated inferences about the content within individual and sets of content objects using statistical pattern matching of words or phrases within the content. Such statistical pattern matching may include, but not limited to, Bayesian analysis, neural network-based methods, k-nearest neighbor, support vector machine-based techniques, or other statistical analytical techniques.","Community Preference Inferences","Where the structural aspect  of the adaptive system  or the adaptive recombinant system  is a fuzzy content network, user community preferences may be inferred from the popularity of individual content objects and the influence of topic or content objects, as popularity and influence were defined above. The duration of access or interaction with topic or content objects by the user community may be used to infer preferences of the community.","Users may subscribe to selected topics, for the purposes of e-mail updates on these topics. The relative frequency of topics subscribed to by the user community as a whole, or by selected sub-communities, may be used to infer community or sub-community preferences. Users may also create their own personalized fuzzy content networks through selection and saving of content objects and\/or topics objects. The relative frequency of content objects and\/or topic objects being saved in personal fuzzy content networks by the user community as a whole, or by selected sub-communities, may be used to also infer community and sub-community preferences. These inferences may be derived directly from saved content objects and\/or topics, but also from affinities the saved content and\/or topic objects have with other content objects or topic objects. Users can directly rate content objects when they are accessed, and in such embodiments, community and sub-community preferences may also be inferred through these ratings of individual content objects.","The ratings may apply against both the information referenced by the content object, as well as meta-information such as an expert review of the information referenced by the content object. Users may have the ability to suggest content objects to other individuals and preferences may be inferred from these human-based suggestions. The inferences may be derived from correlating these human-based suggestions with inferred interests of the receivers if the receivers of the human-based suggestions are users of the fuzzy content object system and have a personal history of content objects viewed and\/or a personal fuzzy content network that they may have created.","The physical location and duration of remaining in a location of the community of users, as determined by, for example, a global positioning system or any other positionally aware system or device associated with users or sets of users, may be used to infer preferences of the overall user community.","Sub-Community and Expert Preference Inferences","Community subsets, such as experts, may also be designated. Expert opinions on the relationship between content objects may be encoded as affinities between content objects. Expert views may be directly inferred from these affinities. An expert or set of experts may directly rate individual content items and expert preferences may be directly inferred from these ratings.","The history of access of objects or associated meta-information by sub-communities, such as experts, may be used to infer preferences of the associated sub-community. The duration of access or interaction with objects by sub-communities may be used to infer preferences of the associated sub-community.","Experts or other user sub-communities may have the ability to create their own personalized fuzzy content networks through selection and saving of content objects. The relative frequency of content objects saved in personal fuzzy content networks by experts or communities of experts may be used to also infer expert preferences. These inferences may be derived directly from saved content objects, but also from affinities the saved content objects have with other content objects or topic objects.","The physical location and duration of remaining in a location of sub-community users, as determined by, for example, a global positioning system or any other positionally aware system or device associated with users or sets of users, may be used to infer preferences of the user sub-community.","Personal Preference Inferences","Users may subscribe to selected topics, for the purposes of, for example, e-mail updates on these topics. The topic objects subscribed to by the user may be used to infer personal preferences. Users may also create their own personalized fuzzy content networks through selection and saving of content objects. The relative frequency of content objects saved in personal fuzzy content networks by the user may be used to infer the individual's personal preferences. These inferences may be derived directly from saved content objects, but also from affinities the saved content objects have with other content objects or topic objects. Users may directly rate content objects when they are accessed, and in such embodiments, personal preferences may also be inferred through these ratings of individual content objects.","The ratings may apply against both the information referenced by the content object, as well as any of the associated meta-information, such as an expert review of the information referenced by the content object. A personal history of paths of content objects viewed may be stored. This personal history may be used to infer user preferences, as well as tuning adaptive recommendations and suggestions by avoiding recommending or suggesting content objects that have already been recently viewed by the individual. The duration of access or interaction with topic or content objects by the user may be used to infer preferences of the user.","The physical location and duration of remaining in a location of the user as determined by, for example, a global positioning system or any other positionally aware system or device associated with the user, may be used to infer preferences of the user.","Adaptive Recommendations and Suggestions","Adaptive recommendations in fuzzy content networks combine inferences from user community behaviors and preferences, inferences of sub-community or expert behaviors and preferences, and inferences of personal user behaviors and preferences as discussed above, to present to a fuzzy network user or set of users one or more fuzzy network subsets (one or more objects and associated relationships) that users may find particularly interesting given the user's current navigational context. These sources of information, all of which are external to the referenced information within specific content objects, may be augmented by search algorithms that use text matching or statistical pattern matching or learning algorithms to provide information on the likely themes of the information embedded or pointed to by individual content objects.","The navigational context for a recommendation may be at any stage of navigation of a fuzzy network (e.g., during viewing a particular content object) or may be at a time when the recommendation recipient is not engaged in directly navigating the fuzzy network. In fact, the recommendation recipient need never have explicitly used the fuzzy network associated with the recommendation. As an example,  depicts in-context, displayed adaptive recommendations associated with the Epiture system.","Some inferences will be weighted as more important than other inferences in generating a recommendation, and theses weightings may vary over time, and across recommendation recipients, whether individual recipients or sub-community recipients. For example, characteristics of content and topics explicitly stored by a user in a personal fuzzy network would typically be a particularly strong indication of preference as storing network subsets requires explicit action by a user. In most recommendation algorithms, this information will therefore be more influential in driving adaptive recommendations than, say, general community traffic patterns in the fuzzy network.","The recommendation algorithm may particularly try to avoid recommending to a user content that the user is already familiar with. For example, if the user has already stored a content object in a personal fuzzy network, then the content object might be a very low ranking candidate for recommending to the user. Likewise, if the user has recently already viewed the associated content object (regardless of whether it was saved to his personal fuzzy network), then the content object would typically rank low for inclusion in a set of recommended content objects. This may be further tuned through inferences with regard to the duration that an associated content object was viewed (for example, it may be inferred that a lengthy viewing of a content object is indicative of increased levels of familiarity.","The algorithms for integrating the inferences may be tuned or adjusted by the individual user. The tuning may occur as adaptive recommendations are provided to the user, by allowing the user to explicitly rate the adaptive recommendations. The user may also set explicit recommendation tuning controls to tune the adaptive recommendations to her particular preferences. For example, a user might guide the recommendation function to place more relative weight on inferences of expert or other user communities' preferences versus inferences of the user's own personal preferences. This might be particularly true if the user was relatively inexperienced in the particular domain of knowledge. As the user's experience grew, he might adjust the weighting toward inferences of the user's personal preferences versus inferences of expert preferences.","Fuzzy network usage metrics described above such as popularity, connectedness, and influence may be employed by the recommendation algorithm as convenient summaries of community, sub-community and individual user behavior with regard to the fuzzy network. These metrics may be used individually or collectively by the recommendation algorithm in determining the recommended network subset or subsets to present to the recommendation recipient.","Adaptive recommendations which are fuzzy network subsets may be displayed in variety of ways to the user. They may be displayed as a list of content objects (where the list may be null or a single content object), they may include content topic objects, and they may display a varying degree of meta-information associated with the content objects and\/or topic objects. Adaptive recommendations may be delivered through a web browser interface, through e-mail, through instant messaging, through XML-based feeds, RSS, or any other approach in which the user visually or acoustically interprets the adaptive recommendations. The recommended fuzzy network subset may be displayed graphically. The graphical display may provide enhanced information that may include depicting linkages among objects, including the degree of relationship, among the objects of the recommended fuzzy network subset, and may optionally indicate through such means of size of displayed object or color of displayed object, designate usage characteristics such as popularity of influence associated with content objects and topic objects in the recommended network subset. Adaptive recommendations may be delivered for interpretation of users by other than visual senses; for example, the recommendation may be delivered acoustically, typically through oral messaging.","The recommended structural subsets , combinations of topic objects, content objects, and associated relationships, may constitute most or even all of the user interface, which may be presented to a system user on a periodic or continuous basis. Such embodiments correspond to embodiment variations of , ,  and  of the framework  in , below.","In addition to the recommended fuzzy network subset, the recommendation recipient may be able to access information to help gain an understanding from the system why the particular fuzzy network subset was selected as the recommendation to be presented to the user. The reasoning may be fully presented to the recommendation recipient as desired by the recommendation recipient, or it may be presented through a series of interactive queries and associated answers, as a recommendation recipient desires more detail. The reasoning may be presented through display of the logic of the recommendation algorithm. A natural language (such as English) interface may be employed to enable the reasoning displayed to the user to be as explanatory and human-like as possible.","In addition to adaptive recommendations of fuzzy network subsets, adaptive recommendations of some set of users of the fuzzy network may be determined and displayed to recommendation recipients, typically assuming either implicit or explicit permission is granted by such users that might be recommended to other users. The recommendation algorithm may match preferences of other users of the fuzzy network with the current user. The preference matches may include the characteristics of fuzzy network subsets stored by users or other fuzzy network referencing, their topic subscriptions and self-profiling, their collaborative patterns, their direct feedback patterns, their physical location patterns, their fuzzy network navigational and access patterns, and related temporal cues associated with these usage patterns. Information about the recommended set of users may be displayed to a user. This information may include names, as well as other relevant information such as affiliated organizations and contact information. It may also include fuzzy network usage behavioral information, such as, for example, common topics subscribed to, common physical locations, etc. As in the case of fuzzy network subset adaptive recommendations, the adaptive recommendations of other users may be tuned by an individual user through interactive feedback with the system.","Adaptability\/Extensibility Framework",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0336","num":"0335"},"figref":"FIG. 42","b":["2000","100","800","2000","2002","2004","2002","2000"]},"The vertical dimension  includes four categories across a range, the first category being least adaptive and the fourth category being the most adaptive.

Structural subsets may be syndicated by the adaptive recombinant system .","The horizontal dimension  includes four categories across a range, the first category being least extensible and the fourth category being the most extensible.

Thus, the adaptive recombinant system  exhibits a high degree of extensibility, fully covering the horizontal dimension  of the framework .","The vertical dimension  is likewise embodied both by the adaptive system  and the adaptive recombinant system . While the adaptive system  displays adaptive recommendations  where no syndication occurs (block ), the adaptive recombinant system  further displays adaptive recommendations  where individual content is syndicated (block ), where structural subsets  are syndicated (block ) and where recombinant structures are syndicated (block ).","Moving up the vertical dimension , the adaptive system  provides adaptive recommendations  that update the structural aspect  and\/or the content aspect  of the system where there is no syndication (block ), and the adaptive recombinant system  provides adaptive recommendations that update the structural or content aspects where individual content is syndicated (block ), where structural subsets  are syndicated (block ), and where recombinant structures are syndicated (block ).","Finally, the adaptive recombinant system  provides a continuous, fully adaptive interface for all four categories of syndication (blocks , , , and ) while the adaptive system  does so where there is no syndication (block ).

This method will often generate many PHRAs, which sometimes may be too many to make useful suggestions from. For example, there may be a dozen or more PHRAs with the same value. In this case, the tie breakers are the data that informs on relationships between topics and communities.","For example, in Table 5, topic A has a strong relationship (5) to community X. Topic A itself has a high total score. Thus, the adaptive recommendations function  assigns a dynamic weighting to topic A's relevance to community X, to strengthen community X's result. In this case, if it was desirable to have only one PHPA, community X would be chosen. In some embodiments, the top 3-5 PHRAs are selected by the adaptive recommendations function .","Building on this procedure, the storing of the dynamic weightings generated in this process can be useful as an additional recommendation mechanism. This approach allows the adaptive recommendations function , at the end of processing, to compare which recommendation is actually selected by the user from the top suggestions generated. If there is a discrepancy or convergence, the weightings may be examined and used as a way to strengthen or weaken the relationships between topics, objects and communities for this user's particular context.","The adaptive recommendations function  also determines Epiture's highest recommendation area, or EHRA (block ). Recall that, in the adaptive recombinant system , relationships between objects, topics and communities, may be made by experts.

II addition, the relationship context may be delivered from another fuzzy content network or instance of the adaptive recombinant system, in particular when \u2018training\u2019 a new knowledge network or integrating existing networks. The Epiture software system includes these features in determining EHRAs.","A set of Epiture's highest recommendation areas (EHRA) may be generated by selecting related topics or communities with higher relevance values to the current object. The EHRAs are weighted appropriately to the situation, either by system rules, or by user preferences.","The adaptive recommendations function  also determines Epiture's highest recommended objects (block ). Again, this step uses relationships already in existence in the system, either an average across all relationships and quality ratings, or tuned to select a particular set of relationship types or quality ratings. From these data, a set of Epitures highest recommendation objects (EHRO) may be generated by selecting related content objects with higher relevance values (with relevance defined by context of both the object in question and system \u2018priorities\u2019) to the current object.","Although steps , , and  are presented in a particular order in , they may be implemented by the adaptive recommendations function  in a different order than the one shown. The adaptive recommendations function  next combines the PHRA, EHRA and EHRO data to determine what will be recommended to the user (block ). Initially, if a set of objects score highly in both PHRA and EHRA, then they will be the objects recommended first. Depending on the amount of recommendation results that are prespecified by the adaptive recommendations function, this initial set of recommended objects may be sufficient.","If not, however, the adaptive recommendations function  determines whether it can find any objects in EHRO that also exist in the PHRA. If so, those results will be returned and the operation ends even though the selected objects are a second tier of the recommended objects. To ensure that the user realizes this, a relevance weighting may be assigned, and graphically indicated if needed.","A third tier of recommended objects may be found by finding any objects in the EHRO that exist in the EHPA, using quality, relationships types and values and other attributes as guides for making the selection.","If a sufficient set of recommendation objects have been found (the \u201cyes\u201d prong of block ), the adaptive recommendations function  removes duplicated objects in the potential recommendations determined thus far (block ). This step is particularly relevant where the users of the Epiture software system are human users who have been browsing the system for some time period. Such users generally do not wish to be recommended content they have already read, visited, or used. If the user has already visited some of the selected recommended objects within a predetermined time period, say, in the last 24 hours, or, if some of recommended objects are already in the user's personal topic library, the adaptive recommendations function  determines the object to be unnecessary to recommend. Thus, such objects are removed from the recommendation object set.","Where objects removed in this manner cause the available adaptive recommendations to be insufficient or empty (the \u201cno\u201d prong of block ), or where enough adaptive recommendations were not produced initially (the \u201cno\u201d prong of block ), the adaptive recommendations function  proceeds to determine the most popular jump objects in the path of a community (block ).","The adaptive recommendations function  examines the paths of other users who have browsed the object. Given criteria such as similar community membership to the current user, content quality rating and distribution, overall popularity, and other attributes, it is determined which objects to recommend based on prior usage. This fourth tier of recommendation objects (besides PHRAs, EHRAs, and EHROs) is designated as a second set of Epiture's highest recommended objects or EHRO2.","This step (block ) may be helpful in the case of integrating two or more networks together. Since the relationship context and attributes of the objects in the network may be \u2018carried\u2019 over or ported into th e new network, the objects may \u2018look\u2019 for their prior relationships and segment based on usage criteria. In addition, influence and other metrics and attribute patterns may be used to determine similarities between objects. Thus, the adaptive recommendations function  may connect objects which have not been in contact before, providing the user a targeted recommendation, and generating a relationship between those objects. That newly formed relationship may cascade to affect other objects in the system such as communities and topics","Finally, the adaptive recommendations function  may track usage of adaptive recommendations (block ). As the embedded algorithms are optimized for speed and real-time performance for in-context recommendations, the \u2018understanding\u2019 and true relevance (as inferred from user usage behavior) of the adaptive recommendations may be processed later As such, tracking the selection and usage of adaptive recommendations at this time may be beneficial Criteria such as placement position on a list or other display mechanism, determined (estimated) relevance as predicted by the algorithm versus first selections by the user, and choice of object type (such as article, subject matter expert, multimedia, image etc), are just a few examples of how the adaptive recommendations function may self-monitor its performance. This performance analysis may ultimately generate better quality recommendations for the user, and be used in updating system structure such as EHRA inputs. Or, the system may be self-policing, in effect, making changes as usage data builds up.","It should be noted that the adaptive recommendations function  depicted in  is a simplified embodiment of the adaptive recommendations function , as one algorithm of possibly many is examined Many complex variations of the recommendations algorithms may be implemented, in accordance with the descriptions of the adaptive system  of  and the adaptive recombinant system  of , above.","The screenshot  also depicts a user personal library function , denoted \u201cMy Personal Topics,\u201d for a particular user.

The MyPath function way be useful to users in identifying areas of the network they have browsed before, and users may also elect to share a specific path or all paths with other users of the system.","Path data can be used to strengthen adaptive recommendations on an automatic basis, while also contributing to input of an automatic or semi-automatic recommendation for the setup of a new community or new topical area.","Cumulative usage data may also be of interest to users of the system as illustrated in the screen image  of  Table  shows an example of usage patterns shown on a temporal bases to reflect amount of interest in certain topical areas. While human users of the system can be easily overwhelmed with the amount of statistical information generated by usage data of many different kinds, the screen image displays the information in a manner so as to express multifaceted data for input into its adaptive recommendation functions.","Automatic Fuzzy Content Network Maintenance","The adaptive recommendations function and related sets of algorithms, in conjunction with the fuzzy network maintenance functions, may be used to automatically or semi-automatically update and enhance the fuzzy content network. These functions may be employed to determine new affinities and the appropriate degree of relationship among fuzzy network objects in the fuzzy network as a whole, within personal fuzzy network subsets, or sub-community-specific fuzzy network subsets. The automatic updating may include potentially setting a relationship between any two objects to zero (effectively deleting a relationship link).","The recommendation function and fuzzy network maintenance functions may operate completely automatically, performing in the background and updating affinities independently of human intervention, or the function may be used by users or special experts who rely on the adaptive recommendations to provide guidance in maintaining the fuzzy network as a whole, or maintaining specific fuzzy network subsets.","In either an autonomous mode of operation, or in conjunction with human expertise, the recommendation function may be used to integrate new content or content objects into the fuzzy content network.","As in the case of adaptive recommendations that are delivered to recipients to enhance their ability to effectively navigate and use the system, adaptive recommendations that function to update the fuzzy content network include algorithms that make inferences from the usage behaviors of system users. These inferences may be at the community level, sub-community level, or individual user level. Usage behaviors that may be included in the inferencing include online information accesses, traffic patterns and click streams associated with navigating the system structure, including buying and selling behaviors; physical locational information associated with stationary or mobile use of the system; collaborative behaviors among system users or systems users and people outside the system, that include written and oral communications; referencing behaviors of system users\u2014for example, the tagging of information for future reference; subscription and other self-profiling behavior of users; and direct feedback behaviors, such as the ratings or direct written feedback associated with objects or their attributes such as the objects' author, publisher, etc. The algorithms may also use information associated with temporal information associated with usage behaviors, including the duration of behaviors and the timing of the behaviors, where the behaviors may include those associated with reading or writing of written or graphical material, oral communications, including listening and talking, or duration of physical location of a system user.","In some embodiments, inferences regarding a plurality of usage behaviors may be used to adjust relationships and associated relationship values and indicators, as explained in the sample embodiment above. These fuzzy network structural modifications may be applied to multiple relationship types. Navigational access information may be used by the algorithms; that is, the relative level of traffic between two objects (each either a content object or a topic object) will influence the degree of relationship between the two objects. However, access information alone is likely to be insufficient for best results as navigation accesses are highly influenced by the current system structure, and therefore current structures would tend to be reinforced, limiting the level of adaptation. Therefore, other or additional behavioral information is preferentially used to overcome this bias. For example, duration of viewing objects typically provides a better indication of value of an object to a user than does just an object access, as does, for example, reference and reference organization cues, collaboration cues, and direct feedback. Therefore, this additional behavioral information may be used to adjust the strengths of relationships among objects.","As an example, where referenced or tagged information can be organized by users, the system may scan the referenced information and how it is organized, and the frequency of the organizational structures among users, to determine a preliminary degree of relationships in the system. This may be augmented by information associated with navigational accesses and the duration of the accesses.","As a simplified example,  depicts a simple fuzzy network a before application of the recommendation function and associated fuzzy network maintenance functions.  depicts fuzzy network b, resulting from the application of the recommendation function and associated fuzzy network maintenance functions to fuzzy network a. (For the sake of simplicity, relationship indicators are not shown.)","The fuzzy network a may have a popular access path a from Node X to Node Y which in turn has a popular access path a to Node Z. Assuming the existing relationships along that path are of similar strength, it might suggest, without any additional information, that these relationships should perhaps be strengthened due to the high popularity of the path. However, more usage behavioral information may suggest a different fuzzy network updating approach. For example, the duration of accesses of Node X and Node Z were generally significantly higher than for Node Y, a better structural update might be to increase, or establish, the relationship between Node X and Node Z, as is shown in the fuzzy network b. After application of an algorithm that incorporates the durational usage behavioral cues, a relationship b is established between Node X and Node Z. In addition, in this example, the former relationship a between Node X and Node Y is deleted (in practice, it might just be weakened in strength).","The structural transformation from fuzzy network a to b as shown would be even more reinforced if additional usage behavioral information supported reinforced the access durational-based inferences on preferences. For example, if Node X and Node Z were more frequently referenced by users than Node Y, and were organized such as to imply close affinity (for example, stored in the same personal topical area). This would be more confirming information to strengthen the relationship between Node X and Node Z, and to weaken or eliminate the relationship between Node X and Node Y.","The relationship updating algorithm may temper potential relationship updating, including adding new relationships, with global considerations related to optimal connections among network objects. For example, too few relationships, or relationships with insufficient spread of strength values tend to inhibit effective navigation, but on the other hand too many relationships also is not optimal. The algorithm may strive to maintain an optimal richness of relationships while updating the fuzzy content network based on usage characteristics. The algorithm may use preferential distributions based on fuzzy network metrics such as connectedness and influence to optimize the fuzzy network relationship topologies.","The recommendation function or related algorithms, in conjunction with the fuzzy content network maintenance functions, may also be extended to scan, evaluate, and determine fuzzy network subsets that have special characteristics. For example, the recommendation function or related algorithms may suggest that certain of the fuzzy network subsets that have been evaluated are candidates for special designation. This may include being a candidate for becoming a topical area. The recommendation function may suggest to human users or experts the fuzzy network subset that is suggested to become a topical area, along with existing topical areas that are deemed by the recommendation function to be \u201cclosest\u201d in relationship to the new suggested topical area. A human user or expert may then be invited to add a topic, along with associated meta-information, and may manually create relationships between the new topic and existing topics. Statistical pattern matching or learning algorithms used to identify such fuzzy network subsets may include, but are not limited to, semantic network techniques, Bayesian analytical techniques, neural network-based techniques, k-nearest neighbor, support vector machine-based techniques, or other statistical analytical techniques.","The algorithms may apply fuzzy network usage behaviors, along with user community segmentations, to determine new topical areas. The algorithms may be augmented with global considerations related to optimal topologies of fuzzy network structures so as to deliver the most effective usability. For example, too many topics, or topics not sufficiently spread across the over domain of information or knowledge addressed by the system, tend to inhibit effective navigation and use. The algorithm may strive to maintain an optimal richness of topical areas. The algorithm may use preferential distributions based on fuzzy network metrics such as connectedness and influence to optimize the fuzzy network relationship topologies. This approach may also be employed in suggesting topical areas for deletion.","Or, the recommendation function or related algorithms, in conjunction with the fuzzy content network maintenance functions, may automatically generate the topic object and associated meta-information, and may automatically generate the relationships and relationship indicators and their values between the newly created topic object and other topic objects in the fuzzy network.","In some embodiments this capability may be extended such that the recommendation function or related algorithms, along with fuzzy network maintenance functions, automatically maintain the fuzzy network and identified fuzzy network subsets. The recommendation function may not only identify new topical areas, generate associated topic objects, associated relationships and relationship indicators among the new topic objects and existing topic objects, and the associated values of the relationships indicators, but also identify topic objects that are candidates for deletion, and in some embodiments may automatically delete the topic object and its associated relationships.","The adaptive recommendations function, in conjunction with the fuzzy network maintenance functions, may likewise identify content objects that are candidates for deletion, and may automatically delete the associated content objects and their associated relationships.","In this way the adaptive recommendations function or related algorithms, along with the fuzzy content network maintenance functions, may automatically adapt the structure of the fuzzy network itself on a periodic or continuous basis to enable the best possible experience for the fuzzy network's users.","As in network embodiments, when a new fuzzy content network is initialized, the adaptive recommendation function may also serve as a training mechanism for the new network. Given a distribution of content, relationships and relationships types, metrics and usage behaviors associated with scope, subject and other experiential data of other fuzzy content networks, a module of the adaptive recommendation function may automatically begin assimilation of content objects into a fuzzy content network, with intervention as required by humans. Clusters of newly assimilated content objects may enable inferences resulting in the suggestion of new topical objects and communities, and associated relationship types and indicators may also be automatically created and updated. This functionality of the adaptive recommendation engine may also be applied when two or more fuzzy content networks are brought together and require integration.","Each of the automatic steps listed above may be interactive with human users and experts as desired.","Social Network Analysis in Fuzzy Content Object Networks","Social network analysis may be conducted with adaptive recombinant system  in multiple ways. First, the representation of a person or people may be explicitly through content objects in the fuzzy content network. Special people-type content objects may be available, for example. Such a content object may have relevant meta-information such as an image of the person, and associated biography, affiliated organization, contact information, etc. The content object may be related to other content objects that the person or persons personally contributed to, topics that they have particular interest or expertise in, or any other system objects with which the person or persons have an affinity. Tracking information associated with access to these content objects by specific users, and\/or user sub-communities may be determined as described above.","Furthermore, collaborative usage patterns may be used to understand direct communications interactions among persons, in addition to indirect interactions (e.g., interactions related to the content associated with a person). The physical location of people may be tracked, enabling an inference of in-person interactions, in addition to collaborations at a distance.","Second, specific people may be associated with specific content and topic objects\u2014for example, the author of a particular content object. These people may or may not have explicit associated people-type content objects. Metrics related to the popularity, connectedness, and influence of a person's associated content may be calculated to provide measurement and insights associated with the underlying social network. The associations with content objects may be with a group of people rather than a single individual such as an author. For example, the metrics may be calculated for organizations affiliated with content objects. An example is the publisher of the associated content.","In either of the approaches described above, report-based and graphical-based formats may be used to display attributes of the underlying social network. These may include on-line or printed displays that illustrate how communities or sub-communities of users directly access a set of people (through the associated content objects), or indirectly through associated content affiliated with the set of people.","Adaptive Processes and Process Networks","The adaptive system  and the adaptive recombinant system  enable the effective implementation of computer-based or computer-assisted processes. Processes involve a sequence of activity steps or stages that may be explicitly defined, and such sequences are sometimes termed \u201cworkflow.\u201d These processes may involve structures that require, or encourage, a step or stage to be completed before the next step or stage may be conducted. Additional relevant details on process-based applications and implementations of adaptive networks is disclosed in U.S. Provisional Patent Application, No. 60\/572,565, entitled \u201cA Method and System for Adaptive Processes,\u201d which is incorporated herein by reference, as if set forth in its entirety.","A set of relationships and associated relationship indicators may be employed to designate process flows among objects in a fuzzy network, or fuzzy content network. The existence of a process relationship between object x and object y implies that x precedes y in a specified process. A process relationship may exist between object x and a plurality of other objects. In these embodiments, a user may have a choice of multiple process step options from an originating process step. The values of a plurality relationship indicators associated with the process relationships between an object and a plurality of objects may be different.","A plurality of process relationship indicators may be designated among the objects in a fuzzy content network, which enables objects to be organized in a plurality of processes.","Display functions enable a user to navigate through a fuzzy network or fuzzy network subset via objects that have process relations between them. At each process step, corresponding to accessing the corresponding object, the user may have the ability to navigate to other related objects, which can be advantageous in providing the user with relevant information to facilitate executing the corresponding process step.","Fuzzy processes may be organized into fuzzy sub-processes through selection of a subset of objects corresponding to a contiguous set of process steps, along with all other objects related to the process step objects, or more generally, as the set of all objects within a specified fractional degrees of separation from each of the process step objects.","New fuzzy processes may be generated by combining fuzzy process sub-networks into new fuzzy process networks using the fuzzy network union, intersection and other operators.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0403","num":"0407"},"figref":"FIG. 45","b":["100","800","950","952","954","956","100","800","950","956","958","960","956"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0404","num":"0408"},"figref":"FIG. 45","b":["962","100","800","962","952","964","100","800","964"]},"Computing system  represents a PC or other computing system which connects through a gateway or other host in order to access the server  on which the systems  or  reside.
