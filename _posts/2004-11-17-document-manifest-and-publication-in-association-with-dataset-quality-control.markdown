title: Document manifest and publication in association with dataset quality control
abstract: Quality control for determinations that documents are accurate and sufficient to support various transactions. In one aspect, a document manifest is provided in connection with quality control results and corresponding reports. The document manifest lists documents that are required for a particular transaction. The list may also be associated with document publication pursuant to the transaction. The document publication aspect allows dataset quality control procedures to be associated with documents published for a transaction. This aspect also allows confirmation that the appropriate version of the published set of documents is or was used for the transaction.

No. 10\/405,890, entitled \u201cElectronic Mortgage Quality Control\u201d and filed on Apr. 1, 2003 now abandoned, which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Application Ser. No. 10,326,570, filed Dec. 20, 2002 and entitled \u201cCertification for Expedited Mortgage Sales,\u201d which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/369,030, filed Apr. 1, 2002 and entitled \u201cSystem, Specification & Tools for Creating Processing, and Validating Electronic Documents\u201d. The entire contents of these applications are hereby incorporated by reference.","1. Field of the Invention","This invention relates generally to data processing, and more particularly to a manifest and publication functionality applied in conjunction with the review of electronic datasets.","2. Description of the Related Art","Borrowers often use lenders to finance real estate transactions in the primary mortgage market. A mortgage loan closing may involve a property sale, or a refinancing of an owned property. Where there is a property sale, a typical mortgage loan closing can involve a buyer, seller, and lender. The lender loans funds to the buyer, and disburses them to the seller to complete the transaction. The buyer signs a promissory note (also referred to as a mortgage note) that obligates the buyer to repay the loaned funds. The buyer is thus often referred to as the borrower in the mortgage loan closing transaction.","Lenders sell mortgages to investors in what is known as the secondary mortgage market. Examples of investors include government sponsored entities (GSEs) such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae. Investors also include commercial banks, community banks, savings and loan associations, and others. Some of these entities participate as both lenders and investors at various times. That is, they both sell and purchase portfolios of mortgages. Similar mortgages are also often pooled together and used to as security for investment instruments referred to as mortgage-backed securities.","A problem with the sale of loans in a secondary market is the lag time between the original acquisition of the mortgage by the lender (e.g., at the closing) and the sale of the mortgage to the investor.","Electronic documents are being introduced for mortgage transactions. Use of these documents can be beneficial to participants in such markets because they can reduce the amount of physical error checking that is often required for paper documents, as well as the number of opportunities for creating discrepancies and errors among and between the various forms used by different participants. However, even where a lender uses electronic documents, a typical closing will still often implement traditional paper based practices, wherein borrowers sign standard paper forms using pen and ink (also referred to as \u201cwet\u201d signing in the industry). Where such a mortgage is later sold to a secondary market investor, since traditional paper forms are used, traditional delays in providing funds to lenders pursuant to the mortgage purchase by the investor have remained.","Another problem with transactions in the secondary mortgage (and other) markets is that investors often have complicated requirements for purchasing loans. Lenders often use experienced analysts to try to ensure that loans will meet these complicated requirements before they agree to lend the money to the borrower. Sometimes, analysts make mistakes and loans are later found not to be marketable to the investor. The loan then likely becomes what is referred to as a \u201cscratch & dent\u201d loan that is sold at substantially discounted rates as compared to what the lender would have gotten from the investor. Moreover, a loan may be subject to repurchase obligations if the investor finds it to be deficient after purchase. There the lender would have to repurchase the loan, and then market it as a scratch & dent loan, incurring losses from the sale of the loan as well as additional marketing expenses.","Another problem with electronic documents is that there are various different systems to which a document will need to integrate. Even where all of the parties to a transaction, and parties to related transactions use the same electronic document format, there are still often discrepancies among and between the variously defined documents.","Still another problem with electronic documents relates to determination of the appropriate documents to be used for a particular transaction, and assurance that the transaction and related transactions implement the correct version of such documents. With real estate closing transactions, a wide variety of documents may be required for inclusion in a proper closing package, depending upon factors such as the type of loan product and the governing State. Even where traditional paper closings are implemented, the determination of the elements in a closing package is often made ad hoc, based upon the experience of the closing agent or other party. Some document origination systems include a facility for printing documents, and thus at some point may provide a list of documents to be printed pursuant to a transaction. However, such lists are not designed for recovery after the transaction takes place, and are also not designed for post-printing association with the printed documents.","What is needed is a quality control system that overcomes the problems of conventional systems.","The present invention includes aspects that provide greater predictability in terms of marketability of electronic documents following anticipated transactions, accommodate consistency among the various documents connected to a given transaction, and expedite sales of mortgage loans involving electronic mortgage documents even where traditional pen and ink signing is used pursuant to closings.","The present invention may be provided in the context of an electronic mortgage document quality control system. For example, a quality control process may be applied to electronic mortgage documents corresponding to loans that are candidates for sale on the secondary mortgage market. A quality control system manages numerous potential rule sets. A rule set particular to a transaction type includes rules that, when satisfied, verify that the electronic mortgage document is appropriate for the transaction type. A lender can thus, for example, subject a candidate electronic mortgage document to the quality control process and receive confirmation that the corresponding loan can subsequently be sold to an investor prior to originating the loan.","The rules also allow the generation of reports that are tailored to potential problems with electronic mortgage documents. This allows the lender to correct errors or omissions, and thus modify the electronic mortgage document so that it will be known to be marketable. Although one embodiment of this process applies to secondary mortgage market transactions, it is also applicable to transactions other than sales on the secondary mortgage market.","According to one aspect of the present invention, a document manifest is provided in connection with quality control results and corresponding reports. The document manifest lists documents that are related to (and, depending upon the party, required for) a particular transaction, such as a real estate closing. The list may also be provided in association with a document publication feature that is provided according to another aspect of the present invention. The document publication aspect allows assurance that quality control procedures are applied to the electronic mortgage dataset used to produce documents that are published for a transaction (e.g., a closing). This aspect allows a party (e.g., closing agent) to ensure proper publication of documents, and parties engaging in post-closing activities to do the same.","The document manifest aspect of the present invention may be provided as a computer-implemented method that involves accessing an electronic mortgage dataset corresponding to a request for a computer implemented quality control check in connection with a particular real estate transaction; identifying a plurality of documents that are required for the particular real estate transaction in association with the request; verifying that the electronic mortgage dataset is sufficient to accurately provide the plurality of documents; and providing a list of the plurality of documents that is verifiably connected to the electronic mortgage dataset, whereby correct versions of the plurality of documents may be published pursuant to a completion of the particular real estate transaction and independently obtained for additional real estate transactions that follow the particular real estate transaction. It may alternatively be provided as software, computer program products, systems, and the like that provide such a functionality.","As indicated, the document publication process is provided in connection with the quality control. A publication value such as \u201cPrinted\u201d is associated with electronic mortgage datasets to indicate whether a corresponding package of documents has been readied (e.g., quality control checked and printed) for a transaction such as a closing. The publication process also may incorporate versioning. When a given package of documents is published, it is preferably versioned incrementally. Additionally, each document that is printed pursuant to publication includes some kind of indication of the package version number. This allows the documents in the package to be collectively managed, while also ensuring accuracy and integrity of the underlying data.","The present invention can be embodied in various forms, including computer implemented methods, computer program products, computer systems and networks, user interfaces, application programming interfaces, and the like.","In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous details are set forth, such as flowcharts and system configurations, in order to provide an understanding of one or more embodiments of the present invention. However, it is and will be apparent to one skilled in the art that these specific details are not required in order to practice the present invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIGS. 1A-B","b":["100","100"]},"Although participants are shown separately, at times the roles of multiple participants may merge. For example, the investor may provide a mortgage services platform, and within that context provide EQC functions that can be referred to as an EQC system.","The EQC system variously offers business predictability to participants. Features provided by the EQC system include determinations whether electronic data sets are sufficient to support a particular transaction, and whether data sets of multiple parties participating in a given transaction are consistent and accurate. Although the EQC system is applicable to any transaction, for ease of description it is detailed in connection with the sale of a mortgage loan from a lender to an investor in the secondary mortgage market. In that regard, the EQC system includes rules that are used to determine whether electronic data corresponding to the loan is accurate includes the necessary elements to support such a transaction.","The rules provided by the EQC system can be thought of as falling within multiple categories. The first can be referred to as a \u201ccore set\u201d that is required to generally support a given transaction. For example, industry standards that govern the sale of loans from any lender to any investor in the secondary mortgage market dictate the constitution of a core set of rules for that type of transaction. The additional categories are respectively party driven. For example, a particular investor may contribute rules beyond the industry standard, and a particular lender may have an even more stringent review process than the investor, and thus desire still further rules. The EQC system is arranged to variously accommodate rule contributions. For example, the EQC system may include the core set of rules by default, and include mechanisms for allowing participants to submit additional rules.","An agreement  between the lender and the investor, wherein the investor promises to buy EQC compliant mortgage loans from the lender in exchange for the lender's successfully invoking the EQC system, allows the sale of such mortgage loans without requiring the lender to make certain representations and warranties concerning the marketability of particular loan products in the secondary mortgage market. Successfully invoking the EQC system refers to submitting the electronic mortgage data set to be used for the loan, and receiving a \u201cpass\u201d indication regarding that data. A pass indication means that the data has satisfied all of the conditions found in the rules applied to the data by the EQC system. Where all of those conditions are satisfied, it can be said that the EQC system produces no \u201cfindings\u201d based upon application of those rules. Preferably, the waived representations and warranties include those pertaining to whether the mortgage loan (i.e., the promissory note) sold by the lender to the investor is a legally enforceable asset. This allows the lender to avoid repurchase obligations should the loan be to be found deficient after the secondary market sale. Although this representation will be waived, the lender will still be required to make other representations, such as those involving appraisal of the property and credit worthiness of the borrower.","The agreement aspect is optional. Even if the agreement is not implemented, the lender can implement the EQC system to assist in the preparation of loan packages that include all necessary components for marketability. Initially, the lender creates  the loan package, usually based upon interactions with a borrower who is either purchasing or refinancing a property. The lender often uses a loan originating system (LOS) to prepare the package. The closing package for a loan includes a note, a security instrument, RESPA required documents, and other documents.","Lenders have various systems for generating loan packages, some of which do not implement their own LOS. For example, the lender may originate a mortgage and create the necessary documents in conjunction with a service provider's electronic mortgage system, such as the MORNETPlus\u00ae 2000 system, which implements Desktop Underwriter\u00ae, Desktop Originator\u00ae, and MORNETPlus Connections, all provided by Fannie Mae. In particular, the Desktop Underwriter\u00ae works with various conventional LOS systems to allow lenders to originate mortgages and create documents such as loan applications. Other pertinent documents can also be created by independently using an LOS, or through MORNETPlus Connections. There are various alternatives, including but not limited to those working with the Freddie Mac Loan Prospector\u00ae, third party document preparation software, and others.","Preparation of the loan package results in the creation of an electronic mortgage data set (\u201cEMD\u201d). The EMD may be variously embodied. For example, the EMD may be a lender dataset that is applicable to the loan package, and is used to create corresponding documents. The EMD may also be provided as an Extensible Markup Language (XML) based file containing previously defined elements and attributes, and corresponding values.","In another alternative, the EMD may be a formal electronic mortgage document. Although aspects of the present invention are applicable to any data set, an example of a format for a formal electronic mortgage document is described further below, with reference to FIGS.  and A-B. Additionally, regardless of how it is embodied, the EMD may later be represented in paper form where the EMD is used to create paper documents, if applicable.","Preferably, the EQC request and EMD are sent together to the EQC system, for application of the request to the EMD. There, the EQC request and EMD can be commonly transmitted but separately packaged. Alternatively, particularly where a formal document definition is applied, the EQC request and the EMD can be packaged together. In another alternative, the EMD may already reside with the EQC system, or be provided by another party (e.g., a closing agent), with the EQC request being independently provided to the system.","With the EQC request functionality, lenders (or others, e.g., closing agents, title cos., appraisers, etc.) send their data to the EQC system, where the EQC rules are applied to the data, and corresponding results file is returned to the requestor.","The EQC system maintains rules to be applied to EMDs in a database. Each loan product will preferably have a rule set tailored to the product. For example, an investor has requirements for a particular loan product that are reflected in the rule set for that loan product. These rules vary in complexity, from those that merely ensure the presence of predetermined fields in the EMD, to those having more complicated logic. Detailed examples of rule sets are described in connection with , below.","After receipt of the EQC request, the EQC System runs  an EQC Request functionality against the submitted EMD. For loan products, this entails identifying the product, retrieving the appropriate rule set for the loan product from its rules database, and applying the rules to the loan product. Preliminary validation, such as XML validation against a DTD for the EMD, may also be applied prior to application of the rules, as described further below. The format of the EQC request will vary, but an example of an EQC format is described further below.","The EQC System then generates 112 results corresponding to the request. Preferably, the results are recorded in the form of a report. The EQC results can be variously provided to one or more recipients. Three example modes include asynchronous, synchronous, and postback. In the asynchronous mode, the results are retained by the EQC system and are associated with a report identifier (e.g., a GUID). The report identifier is later used to retrieve the EQC results. For example, the lender may provide the identifier to the investor, who may then use the identifier to make their own EQC request, which returns the same results. In the synchronous mode, the EQC results are returned in association with the EQC request. In the postback mode, the EQC results are simply posted to a web server corresponding to an URL submitted with the request.  illustrates a potential application of a synchronous mode wherein the lender receives  EQC results corresponding to its submitted  EQC request.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["800","800","802","804","806","808","802"]},"The EMD summary section  identifies the EMDs to which the EQC request and report apply. Preferably, each EMD submitted to the EQC system is associated with a uniquely identified so that the data can later be correlated to EQC results. An example for such an identifier is a date\/time stamp for the EMD. The date\/time stamp can variously originate. Where the EMD is a data set coming from an LOS or other party system, the date\/time can correlate to a time when a corresponding file is entered or saved into the system. Where the EMD is XML data, a time stamp correlating to the file containing the XML data can have the date\/time stamp. Alternatively, an element or attribute in the XML data can define a value (such as date\/time) that is used to identify such an EMD. Where the EMD is a formal electronic document, a field in the electronic document (which itself may be an XML element or attribute) can contain the date\/time stamp value. Still further, an EMD (formal or informal) can be a file containing a time\/date stamp, to which a tamper-evident seal is applied. A \u201cseal\u201d wrapping an electronic document that is created by a digital signature. The seal can be verified to ensure that no changes have been made to the EMD since the seal was put in place.","The Loan Characteristics section  contains information that provides further information about the loan, preferably a basic overview of characteristics that are believed to be of value to the reader of the report. Finally, the Findings section  contains details about issues that are found by application of the relevant rules to the subject EMD. If no issues are found, this may merely indicate \u201cno issues\u201d, or \u201cEQC pass\u201d, or \u201cno findings\u201d or any other indication of those type of results.","As indicated, the EQC results in this example pertain to the following EMDs: LOS data, Closing Agent (CA) Data, and an electronic closing document. Accordingly, the illustrated Findings section  includes Lender Data Set Issues, Lender Data Set Comparison Issues, Closing Agent Data Set Issues and Lender\/Closing Agent Data Set Comparison Issues. The \u201ccomparison\u201d issues pertain to consistency of data among various sources (e.g., closing document to EMD, or EMD to EMD). The remaining issues pertain to rules that examine EMDs for the presence of certain information. More examples of rules are described further in the tables below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIGS. 9A-B","b":["900","900","900","902","904","906","908","910","912"],"i":["a","b ","a","b ","a","b ","a","b"]},"The Analysis Summary Information section , EMD Summary section , Loan Characteristics section  and Findings section -respectively include the same information as was described for the commonly named sections (-) in the example of .","This EQC results report -adds the Issues Summary section  and the Document Manifest section . The Issues Summary section  includes a general description of the issues that were discovered in connection with the processing of an EQC request corresponding to an electronic mortgage dataset. In addition to corresponding to the particular entries found in the Findings section, -, this particular example of the Issues Summary section  includes entries relevant to the information in the Document Manifest section , as well as the document publication process that is described further below. Generally, the EQC process that implements the document publication in accordance with the present invention ensures that the closing documents that are published in connection with a closing are based upon a dataset that is current, consistent with other relevant datasets, and reviewed for error.","The Issues Summary section  allows the user to quickly review the categories of issues found without requiring review of the detailed information found in the Findings section -. The Issues Summary section  is generally organized according to the categorization of the underlying rule sets that are used to check submissions and generate EQC results as described further below.","The five categories that are preferably implemented in embodiments using the document publication feature are as follows.","The first category of issues is comparison of lender and closing agent data. When these issues exist, the following text will appear in the Issues Summary section : \u201c1. Data used to populate the Lender's printed documents differs from the data used to populate the Closing Agent's printed documents.\u201d","The second category of issues is errors in the lender's data set. When these issues exist, the following text will appear in the Issues Summary section : \u201c2. Data contained in the Lender's Loan Origination System contained errors.\u201d","The third category of issues is differences between a lender's system and printed documents data sets. When these issues exist, the following text will appear in the Issues Summary section : \u201c3. Data used to populate Lender's printed documents differs from the most current data in the Lender's Loan Origination System.","The forth category of issues is errors in the closing agent's data set. When these issues exist, the following text will appear in the Issues Summary section : \u201c4. Data used to populate the Closing Agent's printed documents contained errors.\u201d","Finally, the fifth category of issues is differences between a closing agent's system and printed documents data sets. When these issues exist, the following text will appear in the Issues Summary section : \u201c5. Data used to populate Closing Agent's printed documents differs from the most current data in the Closing Agent's System.\u201d","The Document Manifest section  includes a listing of those documents that should be included as part of the final closing package used by the Closing Agent. The listing may be used by the Closing Agent to ensure that all of the correct documents are published pursuant to a closing.","The Document Manifest section  may also be used by any party engaging in a post-closing activity that relates to the closing, to either confirm that all of the correct documents were published for the closing, or to ensure that the correct documents are being used for the relevant post-closing activity. The related transaction may, for example, be taking custody of, recording, reviewing, or engaging in any process related to one or more of the documents in the closing package. In any event, the connection to the EQC results allows confirmation of the adequacy and accuracy of the data contained in the documents.","Preferably, the Document Manifest section  provides a listing of the documents corresponding to the closing package, such as the rows in the table in EQC results report . Columns corresponding to the document name, document version, date\/time, # of pages, borrower signature required, file name, and comments may also be provided. The document version field is described further in connection with the document publication aspect of the present invention below. Preferably, the \u201cdocument version\u201d in this field corresponds to a version number that is tied to publication of the documents in the closing package. In that instance the column could also be called \u201cpublication version\u201d if desired. The version number is also preferably represented in the indicator that is provided on displayable (e.g., printed) versions of the published documents, which helps users to ensure that printed documents correspond to the document manifest and thereby the applied quality control processes.","The document manifest may be provided as desired by the parties in a transaction. Alternative examples of the document manifest may contain more, fewer, or different entries from those in the illustrated example.","The remaining information in the Document Manifest section  is useful for ensuring that all of the pages of a document are present, that the proper number of copies are provided, and other information useful for locating and identifying corresponding files, as well as the date\/time stamp corresponding to the published version.","Regardless of the mode and content, the report can be put in various formats. However, one preferred report uses a formal electronic document format. As described further below, this type of document includes main data and view sections, with the main data section containing results information, and the view section containing presentation formatting for rendering the printed or viewed report (e.g., ). A header section containing fields identifying the document as an EQC results document, and other criteria, is also included.","With the provision of the EQC results, the lender (or other party) has immediately verifiable indication of compliance with the rule set(s) corresponding to the EQC request, or indication of what needs to be done to gain compliance. This, for example, allows a particular lender to revise an EMD so that it complies with the expectations of a particular investor, prior to closing the loan. The lender can remedy the faults identified in the report and then resubmit the modified package to again seek an indication that the loan will be transferable. These features afford a level of business predictability that is completely absent from conventional systems.","Once the lender has submitted an EQC request and is satisfied with the report (and has verified completion of any other necessary preconditions, such as appraisal and title search), the lender sends  the closing package to the closing agent in preparation for the closing. The closing package can be sent using conventional mechanisms, including but not limited to regular postal service, express mail services, electronic mail, electronic data transfer, or other any other form of communication.","The closing  is also a conventional paper or electronic closing. In the paper closing, the closing agent obtains closing documents by receiving them in paper form from the lender, or by printing them based on a formal electronic document or other data set, or through other means. In the electronic version, the relevant parties electronically sign the corresponding electronic mortgage documents. The closing is completed by having the documents reviewed and executed by relevant parties, such as the borrowers. The executed documents include, among others, the mortgage note. At this (or some prior) time, the closing agent may wish to check the closing agent data set for the closing to ensure that it is consistent with the actual closing data in the closing package, and to apply any additional closing agent specific rules to the same.","Once all of the loan documents are executed, they are sent  to lender and\/or the investor, again using conventional means for sending paper or electronic documents. The electronic closing package may be variously embodied. For example, a single \u201celectronic document\u201d containing views corresponding to the different paper documents could be provided, or an archive file format, such as a conventional Java\u2122 JAR file, or a ZIP file could contain multiple electronic documents respectively corresponding to the different required documents can be provided.","As indicated in , at some point the lender offers  the loan to the investor. Although this process is shown to occur after the closing, it may also occur before the closing. Various conventional formats and protocols for offering to sell the loan to the investor may be used, such as Funding Express\u00ae and\/or MORENET as provided by Fannie Mae. The lender and the loan have pertinent data that are used to connect the sending of funds to a lender pursuant to a particular purchase.","Although sending  the EQC results is shown to occur after the closing, the investor may be variously made aware of the EQC results. As described, the EQC results can be posted to the investor when the EQC request is made by the lender prior to the closing. Alternatively, a report retained by the lender can be sent to the investor, or the investor may independently make an EQC request and thereby receive the results. Still further, the report may actually be sent to other parties, such as a third party reviewer of the results.","After conventional review processes (or the certification process described in connection with ), the purchase proceeds are sent  to the lender. Sending purchase proceeds, also referred to as the release of funds to the lender for the loan purchase, can use established funding protocols. Funding options include processes that provide the lender with early payment for a loan to be sold to an investor. Funds are typically sent to the lender in advance of pooling or pool settlement date (and a fee charged to the lender), subject to established credit limits. Once the lender determines the final disposition of the loan (e.g., to be sold as Cash or MBS\u2014tied to a specific commitment\/forward sale) the loan is delivered  to the investor\u2014at which point the investor will \u201csettle up\u201d\u2014any additional monies due from the lender based on the early funding plus the fee component. Alternatively, with a direct sale, documents are typically received and validated by either investor's custodial function or a 3party custodian. There is no \u201csettle up\u201d period because the price and delivery has already been established.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0074","num":"0073"},"figref":"FIGS. 2A-B"},"Referring to , after the front-end procedures of creating electronic loan documents, an EQC request is made. Here, in addition to providing an EQC results report, the electronic documents are updated to reflect the same. Preferably, part of this update is modifying the electronic document to cause the electronic document to produce a printed document having a unique mark corresponding to the EQC result. One preferred marking is the previously described date\/time stamp. Alternative markings, such as a uniquely created identifier that is generated by the EQC system and applied to the EMD that is later used to create prints, can also be used. Again, this may be an iterative process wherein the lender remedies any errors found during each EQC request, with the electronic document being modified upon receipt of a satisfactory result. Under those conditions, each iteration would include a new date\/time stamp.","An electronic closing package that has been reviewed and updated according to this process may be referred to as an EQC compliant electronic closing package. The lender sends  the closing package to the closing agent prior to the closing, and after any other necessary conditions (e.g., title search, appraisal, etc.) are completed.","The closing agent then prints  the necessary documents for the closing using the information in the electronic closing package. Alternatively, the lender may have done the same, and thus will have sent the materials to the closing agent already in paper form. Regardless, all necessary documents, such as the note, will contain a mark connecting the printed document to the EQC compliant electronic closing package. The mark may be evidenced anywhere on the documents, such as in the footer.","The closing agent then conducts a conventional closing , wherein the documents are reviewed and executed by relevant parties, such as the borrowers. As indicated, the executed documents include the note.","The executed closing documents and the electronic closing package are sent  to a certifying agent. The certifying agent then verifies that the executed documents correspond to the electronic closing package, and performs additional certifications, as follows. First, the certifying agent checks  the EQC status of the electronic closing package. Preferably, this includes referring to the EQC results already associated with the electronic closing package. The certifying agent also determines whether the executed paper corresponds to the electronic closing package and the EQC results by verifying that the paper contains the unique mark. Checking  the EQC status may also include making another post closing EQC request, although others such as the investor may alternatively perform this task.","Once it has been verified that the electronic closing package, the signed paper document, and the EQC results are all commonly connected, that certifying agent checks  the executed closing package in order to make additional certifications. The certifying agent then issues  a certificate that represents that the executed note corresponds to the EQC results, in addition to one or more of the following representations: that the printed documents were signed properly pursuant to the closing; that funds were properly disbursed (typically to the borrower); and that a particular note format was used (e.g., for the State or product). The certificate may also be issued in relation to a contract among the lender, investor and certifying agent, or, alternatively, an electronic surety policy covering the above-described representations and warranties, with the investor being designated as a beneficiary the policy along with the lender. The certificate may be variously sent to the investor (and the lender) such as by e-mailing an Adobe Acrobat\u00ae PDF file.","The electronic closing package is also sent to the investor. This allows the investor to run a post closing EQC check, if desired. The investor can also review the certificate and perform any additional in-house data comparisons prior to sending  funds to the lender pursuant to its purchase of the loan. The sequences for offering , funding , and receiving  the loan are described above in connection with . The investor relies on the certificate to provide funds to the lender without traditional delays involved in selling mortgages in the secondary market. Normally, the investor would not immediately send funds to a lender pursuant to the purchase of a loan, without additional steps such as the review of the executed closing documents by a title company or other third party, and provision of corresponding representations and warranties by the lender. By contrast, EQC system participation allows the lender and investor to proceed with the sale without such representations and warranties, and allows them to do so without requiring traditional document review to ensure the completeness and correctness of the loan data in the closing documents.","Before moving to further description of the operations of the EQC system, it is helpful to review an example of an electronic document format.  is a block diagram illustrating components of an electronic document usable in conjunction with embodiments of quality control in accordance with the present invention, although various other electronic document types and formats may also be used. The electronic document  includes a header section , a data section , and a view section . The electronic document  may also include a signature section  as part of its format; however, the signature section might not be used where paper closing documents are used, or the signature section  may merely indicate that paper documents were used and signed, in lieu of maintaining an electronic signature.","The electronic document  is preferably defined using a mark-up language. The electronic document  may be structurally altered depending upon the processing environment. For example, it may become desirable to strip one or more of header , data , view  and signature  sections from the electronic document  to facilitate processing, display, transmission, or for intended use. Particularly, an electronic document that is only intended for machine processing may at times only include the header and data sections , , or an electronic document that is only intended for viewing may not contain a data section  (e.g., a billing statement emailed to a client).","The header section  contains information about the document itself, such as its version, the type of document (e.g., that the document is a mortgage note, trial transcript, etc.) and whether or not all parties have signed. The data section  contains the information corresponding to that originating from an equivalent paper document, such as data from a mortgage note. The view section  contains tags that describe how to format and present the data contained in the document. For example, the view section  contains tags that describe how to format and present a printed mortgage note.","The header and data sections ,  are preferably written in extensible markup language (XML) and the view section  is preferably written in extensible hypertext markup language (XHTML), which are conventional languages for creating electronic documents, although various alternative languages may be utilized. The names of the tags and the structure of XML documents are defined by a document type definition (DTD). The DTD associated with a particular electronic document describes the tags or markup and the structure of the document, and specifies which tags contain other tags. Conventional XML and XHTML programming techniques can be used to create the tags particular to content and format required by industry standards or the like.","The data section  can be organized using elements as well. For example, it may be generally demarcated by a \u201cDATA\u201d element that is subdivided into MAIN and MAP elements, with the MAIN element containing the XML structural description of the data model for the particular electronic mortgage document. For example, the MAIN element might incorporate LOAN (the terms and features of the loan, e.g., the interest rate and loan amount), BORROWER (information about the borrower), LENDER (information about the lender), PROPERTY (information about the property which is the subject of the mortgage), and EXECUTION (information about the date and location of the execution of the note) elements.","The MAP element generally links fields in the data section  to presentation fields in the view section . An electronic document may include more than one \u201cview,\u201d so there may be a MAP element for each view that a DATA element is linked to. For example, if an electronic document contained three different view sections representing the data from a single data section, there would be three corresponding MAP elements within the DATA element.","The linking provided by the MAP element is preferably provided by elements that link values in the view section  to corresponding ones in the data section . There are various ways that a linking element can reference the necessary values, such as by including a pointer to a field in the data section  (e.g., in an attribute) and a pointer to a field in the view section  (e.g., in another attribute). Conversion elements may be associated with or contained by linking elements, to accommodate differences in format between the data and view sections.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0089","num":"0088"},"figref":["FIGS. 6A-B","FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIGS. 6A-B"],"b":["600","600","620","630","660","670","640","650","660","640","660","640","670","660","640","670"]},"Sometimes, the content of an electronic document will be influenced by industry standards and customs. Elements in the EQC rules can be made to comply with the elements defined by these standards and customs, so that the EQC system readily works with the data typically used by industry participants.

For example, the mortgage services ASP  may communicate with the lender  to create electronic documents for a closing package. This activity may be complemented by communications with the investor , who may provide assistance and information for loan origination and underwriting purposes. The closing agent  and title company , which may serve as the certifying agent, also can access the electronic documents, such as through receipt of the electronic closing package, etc.","As indicated in , in some systems a mortgage services platform  may be provided by one of the parties -. Particularly, the investor may provide the mortgage services platform , which would provide services similar to the mortgage services ASP (). In either case, the mortgage services preferably include an EQC system , . Additionally, each of the parties - includes an EQC module having functionality that allows EQC requests to be submitted, and EQC results to be received and displayed. Although certain systems are shown, other systems including but not limited to those for the appraiser, mortgage insurance, hazard, flood certification, and loan servicing agent can similarly connect to the EQC system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0094","num":"0093"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","502","504","506","508","510"]},"The registration module  accommodates conventional procedures for determining whether access to the EQC system  is appropriate, and authenticates the party connected to the system. Various conventional models may be implemented, but one preferred approach uses a username and password combination. The registration information and the corresponding functionality will also likely be part of the mortgage services platform registration. Accordingly, the username and password used on the mortgage services platform will carry over to the EQC system . Registration is optional as there may be users who are not formal registrants.","The EQC request receiving module  receives EQC requests. Although requests from lenders and closing agents are mainly described, it is understood that various other types of EQC System participants may also make EQC requests. Examples of these participants include title companies, the county recorder, custodial services, loan servicing agents, and others who would use data in the electronic mortgage document or rely upon the same for their participation in a transaction related to the loan. Additionally, a request may require connection to the data sets used by multiple parties, such as both the lender LOS and the closing agent system. For embodiments implementing the document publication functionality, the EQC request receiving module  receives requests for publication of documents usable in a real estate transaction in conjunction with requests to check electronic mortgage datasets.","As indicated, participant systems are configured to include EQC modules configured to generate EQC requests and receive EQC results. The EQC request may be prepared according to the previously described electronic document format. For example, relating to a closing, a lender LOS EQC module extracts LOS data related to a closing, and packages it according to the electronic document format. Since the EQC request will not necessarily entail a viewable document, this EQC request includes header information identifying the data as LOS data, and the main data section includes the underlying fields and corresponding values. As with the electronic closing package, the EQC request can be embodied as a single \u201celectronic document.\u201d Alternatively, the EQC request can be included as part of a file format with multiple electronic documents respectively corresponding to the different documents (Note, HUD-1, Appraisal, etc.) to be processed by the EQC system, along with a header identifying the package as an EQC request. Regardless, the header could include a request identifier, username and password information, and instructions for handling the results.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0098","num":"0097"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"322pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"EQC Request\/Functions"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"119pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"168pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["CATEGORY\/ATTRIBUTE","FORMAT","DESCRIPTION"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["REQUEST_GROUP",{},{}]},{"entry":["Standards Format Identification","String","Version ID corresponding to electronic document"]},{"entry":[{},{},"standard, if applicable (null if other EMD)"]},{"entry":["REQUEST",{},{}]},{"entry":["RequestIdentifier","Integer","Number used to identify the EQC Request"]},{"entry":["RequestDateTime","Datetime","Date time stamp of request."]},{"entry":["LoginAccountIdentifier","String","User ID."]},{"entry":["LoginAccountPassword","String","Password."]},{"entry":["Function_Name","String","Identifies the requested EQC service."]},{"entry":["REQUEST_DATA",{},{}]},{"entry":["_GloballyUniqueIdentifier","String ","Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) that is returned by the"]},{"entry":[{},{},"system and used to retrieve the results.

The request group category of information identifies the type of document that is being analyzed pursuant to the EQC request. Although as indicated one preferred embodiment works with regular data sets, if the EMD happens to be defined according to a particular specification, it can be so noted. The Request and Request Data categories contain information that is used to validate and identify the EQC request, and to similarly call up corresponding EQC results. This information includes the described user name and password. The EQC request receiving module  automatically communicates with the registration module  upon receipt of an EQC request package containing the username and password, without requiring user intervention to provide the information. An identifier for the EQC request, and a GUID used to retrieve the EQC results in particular (e.g., asynchronous) modes of operation, are also provided in this category of information.","The Mortgage Platform Request category is optional and includes information that is used for identifying participants who are registered with the platform, to accommodate integration with their facilities and appropriate reporting. An identifier with previously entered loan information (CaseFileIdentifier) can be used to correlate the request to such data.","The Data_File category contains information identifying and describing the data against which the request is processed. Optionally, where the request is integrated with the mortgage services platform, a corresponding file name used by the platform may be provided. The version number for the request is used to distinguish results from various requests (i.e., a data file may be subjected to several EQC requests before and after the closing, or may have initial errors that are corrected\u2014the version number is used to keep track of those results). The type attribute indicates the type of data that is being processed. As described, the document may be a formal electronic mortgage document (EMD), regular XML data, LOS data, etc. The FormatType attribute indicates the actual format of the transactional document, paper or electronic. Other attributes include those that identify the system that populated the data file to be processed (e.g., LOS identifier). Finally, the date\/time stamp information corresponding to the EMD is provided. In lieu of requiring a request format to include this information, it can be automatically recognized or extracted from submitted data.","The request receiving module  thus receives and recognizes the EQC requests, and passes corresponding requests to the EQC rules engine , which in turn accesses appropriate rule sets from the EQC rules repository  and applies the rules therein to the subject data.","As indicated, there are various types of rules. Some are comparative, and ensure data consistency. Others check for the presence of required information, or perform more complicated analyses based upon existing information. Some rules include conditions and corresponding rule mappings. The conditions can be determined by Boolean phrases referred to as dependencies. The rule mappings typically identify fields whose values are examined in order to determine whether the mapping is satisfied. Error messages specific to the conditional rules describe the problem where the mapping is not satisfied. These messages are included in the EQC results report (e.g., , ). Example rules are set forth in Table 2 below. The ordinarily skilled artisan will recognize the alternatives, which will be dictated by the type of transaction, corresponding industry custom and usage, and the individual needs and desires of parties using the EQC system.","Still referring to the rules described in Table 2, examples of various types of rules are evident. As is evident from the table, columns Rule ID, Rule Type, Rule Name, Error Message, Dependency and Rule Mapping are provided. The Rule ID allows an indexed organization of all rules and as shown may simply be a number. The Rule Type allows categorization of rules (and corresponding definitions of rule sets) according to the participants corresponding to the EQC request. Examples of these include \u201cLender Intra\u201d rules, which may be used where a lender specific EQC request is made, \u201cClosing Agent Intra\u201d rules, which may be used where a closing agent specific EQC request is made, and \u201cLender\/Closing Agent Inter\u201d rules, which may be used where an EQC request corresponding to both lender and closing agent data is made. The error message column defines the error message to be presented in the event that a rule is not satisfied or passed. These pieces of information are used to populate the EQC reports. The dependency column lists conditions that are used to provide conditional dependencies that trigger application of rule mappings. They can be thought of as part of the rule themselves, or as prerequisites for the actual rule (which would be the rule mapping). For example, with reference to Rule ID #1, where a face to face interview is made, a government monitoring section must be completed, even if the applicant indicates a refusal to provide the information. Thus, if the field Loan_Application_Interviewer_Information_ApplicationTakenMethodType has the value \u201cFace to Face,\u201d then the following rule mapping applies: the field Loan_Application_Borrower_Government_Monitoring_RaceNationalOriginType cannot have a null value OR the field Loan_Application_Borrower_Govemment_Monitoring_RaceNationalOriginRefusalIndicator must equal \u201cY\u201d.","These and other rules, rule dependencies, and mappings are evident in the provided

When used in conjunction with the publication feature of the present invention, the value \u201cPrinted\u201d is an indicia that documents corresponding to the dataset have been published, such as for usage in a closing. Datasets retaining the value \u201cSystem\u201d are not yet published. Notably, a user may print documents from this dataset without causing them to be considered as published. For example, a Closing Agent (or other user, be it a Lender, Borrower, etc.) might want to print a copy for proofreading, to allow a client (e.g. Borrower) to review the documents, or for any number of reasons. In this instance, the system retains the \u201csystem\u201d value in association with the relevant dataset even though the documents have been printed. Only when the documents are formally printed for usage, which is also referred to as publishing them, is the value for the dataset changed from \u201csystem\u201d to \u201cprinted\u201d. Additionally, as will be seen with regard to the publication process discussed further in connection with  below, when a closing package is officially printed (aka published) for a closing, each of the documents in the package are versioned accordingly.","In the example provided above, there are thus four types of datasets on the EQC system. They are \u201cLender System\u201d, \u201cLender Printed\u201d (aka Lender Published), \u201cClosing Agent System\u201d, and \u201cClosing Agent Printed\u201d (aka Closing Agent Published). Each of those datasets are labeled accordingly.","The EQC rules engine  includes conventional facilities for examining the database of rules and extracting the appropriate rule set depending upon the EQC request. For example, with reference to the rules in Table 2, certain EQC requests will require accessing rules having a given \u201cRule Type\u201d; alternatively, with reference to Table 3, certain EQC requests will require accessing rules pertaining to a given closing status and given document type.","The EQC rules engine  thus communicates with the EQC rules repository  to acquire the necessary rule sets and member rules, for application to the data. An initial validation preferably precedes application of the EQC specific rules to the data, particularly where the EMD is a formal electronic document. This initial validation will comprise a conventional (e.g., XML) validation against a DTD for the formal electronic document, followed by additional custom document validation to check for the integrity of the EMD, such as whether view data matches corresponding main data found in the EMD. Commonly owned application Ser. No. 10\/339,775 entitled \u201cElectronic Document Validation\u201d provides more information about these preliminary validation processes.","The EQC rules are then applied to the document. Whether the EMD is an XML-only data set or a formal electronic document containing an XML data section, the EMD will have known fields (e.g., defined by XML elements), having corresponding values. Conventional processing techniques are then used to identify the presence of the elements and obtain the corresponding values where required. Once the values are retrieved, the logical mappings are then applied, again using conventional processing techniques. For example, Rule ID #14 in Table 2 indicates that the deposit or earnest money on line  of HUD-1 must equal the amount in the LOS. There, the values for the relevant fields in the HUD-1 and the LOS data are retrieved, and compared to determine that they match. If they do not match, an instance of an error for Rule ID #14 is maintained, so that the subsequently produced report can reflect the mismatch. The EQC rules engine  preferably processes all of the rules in the identified rule set until they have been exhausted. Upon completion, the EQC rules engine  reports the same to the EQC Results Module .","The EQC Results Module  communicates with the EQC rules engine  and thus receives the list of failed rules. If no rules have failed, then the EQC Results Module  prepares a report indicating no findings, or a \u201cpass\u201d result pertaining to the EQC request. If there are failed rules, then the corresponding error messages are retrieved from the rule sets (e.g., from the repository or the rules engine) and are compiled to provide a report. One preferred EQC report format uses the same format as was used for the EQC request. A viewable and\/or printable report is provided in the EQC report. The EQC report can also use the formal electronic document standard.","Particularly where the document publication aspect of the present invention is practiced, the results file and corresponding report may be provided by initially checking for the appropriate datasets, which can be accommodated by examining fields in the datasets indicating the type and version of the dataset being examined. In XML embodiments, this may be accommodated by examining relevant elements, which may alone provide the dataset type and\/or version information or collectively provide such information (e.g., the type information may be a concatenation of values corresponding to the source (e.g., Lender, or Closing Agent) and type (e.g., Origination System, Closing Document) information). This information is used as the initial basis for determining whether the (e.g., lender, closing agent) datasets are present for examination, and also for populating the above described EMD summary section (e.g., , ). The remaining functionality is provided by applying the appropriate rules to the datasets and issuing EQC results as described. The EQC rules and results modules are also configured to provide the document publication functionality that is described further below, and in connection with providing reports with the document manifest.","The EQC system  can be variously embodied. The EQC system  can entirely comprise software that is stored in conventional media and executed by a conventional processor to provide the above described functionality. The EQC system  can also be embodied in the form of a computer system having such as processor and storing such software for execution. These and other alternatives will be recognized by the artisan.","The EQC System can be invoked pursuant to various transactions. The schematic diagram of  provides an overview of various examples of transactions in the life cycle of an electronic mortgage document. Participants in the illustrated process include the lender , closing agent , recorder , servicing agent , investor , and custodial services . Where electronic documents are being handled, these parties - can variously communicate over a computer network to effect a mortgage transaction utilizing the certified electronic mortgage document, such as those previously described between the lender, certifying agent, and investor. Additionally, before or after these mortgage transactions, the EQC system provides EQC results corresponding to EQC requests as described above. This includes \u201cdownstream\u201d transactions that occur after the closing.","As described above, loan documents are prepared , such as via a lender's loan origination system (LOS), and the electronic mortgage document can reside on the LOS or can be uploaded from a document preparer located at a remote location via the computer network. The closing agent  receives closing instructions from the lender and the closing documents. Closing package creation  can be centralized so that the lender  and closing agent  can provide the necessary closing data and electronic documents to complete a closing package. Additionally, the closing agent  can invoke information provided by the lender , and vice versa.","Upon completion of the closing package, a closing  involving a traditional ink and pen signing, or digital signing, of relevant documents including the paper mortgage note follows, with the borrower signing the necessary documents. Recording  of the executed documents can then proceed, with the recordable documents being sent for recordation, and corresponding indicia of what is recorded.","Also indicated is post closing quality assurance , which is provided by the EQC system. Example participants include the servicing agent , investor  and custodial services . Use of the EQC system ensures and confirms that data is consistently implemented for all of the different documents pertaining to the loan, and provides additional quality control aspects as dictated by the rule set. According to this aspect, in addition to applying a first rule set (e.g., for the lender pursuant to a closing) to an EMD corresponding to a closing package, the EQC system receives a second electronic data set for a related function. One example of a related function is that provided by the closing agent, as described above. Other examples of related functions are those provided by the servicing agent, appraiser, and other entities. The EQC system receives the second EMD and applies a second set of quality control rules to the second EMD. Results of this process can be iterative, depending upon satisfaction of the rules, and ultimately will result in an EQC pass result after corrections are made. Here, positive EQC results indicate the second EMD is consistent with the first EMD and appropriate for the function, which again is dictated by rules that can be submitted by the service provider, or combinations of parties. For example, the servicing package that is implemented by the servicing agent  is subject to an EQC check following the closing and prior to the exchange. Here, the data in the servicing agent system is submitted to the EQC system to ensure that it is consistent with data that was previously used for the loan pursuant to the closing, and to ensure compliance with any other rules, including those defined by the servicing agent. The servicing agent data for the closing note, deed of trust, assignment, first payment letter, hazard insurance and tax information sheets is among that which is compared to the existing data by the EQC system. This process uses the same type of comparison of field values as described above.","Similarly, as described above in more detail, the investor  implements the EQC system in connection with receipt of the delivery package for the loan. Additionally, in connection with the loan being held by the document custodian, wherein the signed closing package and paper documents are provided, the content of the documents can be verified using the EQC system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0133","num":"0132"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["1000","1000","1","2"]},"Of course, although it is not necessarily recommended, there may be instances where users elect not to print to the entire package for closing package version . In that case, it is up to the user to determine which documents did not change between the two versions.","For context, the illustrated process  shows origination and closing phases. As described, origination is variously provided by conventional systems that are used to populate documents (). This may be accommodated through an Automated Underwriting System (AUS) as indicated or other conventional systems used for origination that need not be described in detail herein.","Pursuant to a closing, at various times and for various purposes, parties may wish to view documents before the formal closing takes place. For example a Lender, Closing Agent or Borrower might wish to review data that is included on the documents to ensure accuracy, to make changes that occur between the original population of the document and the closing, etc. The \u201cclosing\u201d process  is divided into publish  and view  components.","Notably, documents may be printed for review as part of the view  component. This is in contrast to publishing the documents, such as in anticipation of the formal closing. Printing  the documents can be accommodated from a selection list that is displayed in connection with a displayed document, or within the document if desired. Preferably, when the documents are printed  during the view component , they will include indicia such as \u201cDRAFT\u201d in lieu of a version number, to clearly indicate that they are not a published version of the documents.","As described above, datasets that are used to produce documents are accorded values useful in connection with receiving EQC requests and producing corresponding EQC results and reports. Document publication is also provided in conjunction with the EQC system functionality. To accommodate that, datasets (or even individual elements within datasets) may be accorded the values \u201cSystem\u201d and \u201cPrinted\u201d. When drafts of the documents are printed for review, rather than published, the corresponding dataset will remain denoted as \u201cSystem\u201d. The EQC system functionality described above may thus be applied  to a dataset marked as System during the view  phase of the closing process. This allows users to check data integrity and accuracy on the underlying (e.g., Closing Agent) dataset prior to requesting a publication of the documents.","Publication  of the documents is accommodated in conjunction with the other EQC system features. According to one aspect, the EQC system distinguishes datasets corresponding to published document sets from those that have not yet been published, by associating a \u201cPrinted\u201d value with the former. As indicated, when publication  is sought, the documents in a closing package are printed . If necessary, the dataset corresponding to the printed documents is also uploaded to the EQC system, if it does not already reside therein Uploading may or may not be necessary at this stage. This is because some users may use a system that includes the EQC system functionality throughout the process of managing a transaction (e.g., from origination forward). In that instance the datasets will already reside on the EQC system. Other users will invoke the EQC system at this stage, wherein the dataset may be uploaded in conjunction with publication. In either case, the EQC system is used to check the accuracy and completeness of the data used to produce the documents published for the closing package. As indicated, the EQC system functionality is applied  to the corresponding dataset marked as \u201cPrinted\u201d. Although the described embodiment uses the term \u201cPrinted\u201d in association with datasets corresponding to published documents, the artisan may substitute whatever terms are desired for this indication, including but not limited to \u201cPublished\u201d, etc.","As conceptually indicated in , versioning  is associated with the publication  of documents. According to another aspect of the present invention, versioning is correlated with a set of documents used for a transaction, such as a closing package. The first publication of the closing package may be referred to as \u201cClosing Package Version \u201d. Preferably, each of the documents that is published as part of the closing package is marked accordingly with this version number. For example, a footer for each document may state \u201cCP v.1\u201d or the like. Accordingly, whenever a new publication  request is made, the system reviews the version counter , and prompts an increment in the version count to be associated with the set of documents being published in connection with the publication request. In embodiments that store a version number as an element value, this may merely be incrementing this value in association with publication.","If, following a publication, there is a realization that change is desired in one or more of the documents, then values in the datasets may be changed. In this instance, the user will presumably want to run another EQC system check to ensure the accuracy and consistency of and among datasets. This is done in conjunction with publication and versioning according to this embodiment of the present invention. First, the user makes the changes to the datasets. When these changes are made, the corresponding dataset and\/or individual values are denoted as System, as they lose publication status as being different from the published version. At some point the user will again be satisfied with the data, and will prompt publication. In this instance, \u201cClosing Package Version \u201d is established as the next version number for the closing package. The previously described printing  of the closing package documents, marking of the datasets as published, and application  of the EQC functionality to the datasets marked as published take place. Versioning is associated with the entire closing package. Thus, even if some of the documents remain exactly the same from version-to-version, they will be marked according to the most recent closing package version in association with publication of the closing package. In other words, if version  of the closing package is printed, each document in the package is marked \u201cCP v. 2\u201d or the like.","In some embodiments, a formal electronic document, such as an XML or XHTML based document, may be used in conjunction with the document manifest and\/or publication aspects of the present invention. In that case, a particular element for managing document publication may be established. The element is used to provide the listing of published (formally printed) documents prepared for use in a transaction such as a closing. Preferably, this listing is accessed and used in conjunction with the above-described validation processes as part of managing the list of documents to be provided for a closing package and ensuring that those documents are checked for accuracy and completeness. The element for managing document publication may be variously provided but preferably includes attributes such as \u201cname\u201d for indicating the name of each document and \u201cversion_number\u201d for managing the versioning of documents.
