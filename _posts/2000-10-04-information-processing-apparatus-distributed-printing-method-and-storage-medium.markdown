Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to an information processing apparatus and a distributed printing method for dividing a print job and printing print data at a plurality of printers, and a storage medium storing a program realizing such a method.","2. Related Background Art","A print process by application software is executed by a print function provided by a general OS installed in an information processing apparatus. However, this print process by application software to be executed by a print function provided by a general OS installed in an information processing apparatus, is associated with the following problems if used by a plurality of printers.","For example, a plurality of printer objects are formed in a printer manager of an OS, e.g., Windows (product name) of Microsoft Corporation. If a plurality of printers are used to perform print processes through application software, a user is required to enter a print command for each of the printers.","Application software cannot spool print data as the data for a plurality of printers.","If printers are of the same type (having the same PDL and the same printable area), a plurality of job control portions of a PDL generated by the common printer driver are formed to perform distributed printing by supplying PDL to distributed pages. This approach cannot be applied to the distributed printing by using printers of different types. If the same spool and print process are to be used for the distributed printing by a plurality of printers of different types, only the function shared by all printers can be used, and a function characteristic to each printer cannot be used.","For the distributed printing by a plurality of printers, a user cannot be notified of information what pages are printed on which printer.","During the distributed printing, upon copies of a distributed printing job at one printer, copies of another job may be placed. Even if a distributed printing printer becomes abnormal such as no-paper and another printer is automatically used to continue the printing, this changed output destination is not notified to a user. It becomes difficult for the user to collect output copies.","A method of notifying a completion of the distributed printing is not known. If an output of the next job is executed, copies of the current job and next job are mixed. A user is required to sort the copies with a large work load after the completion of the print jobs. These problems associated with the conventional techniques have long been desired to be solved.","The present invention has been made in order to solve the above problems. It is a first object of the present invention to provide a control method for a distributed printing process using a plurality of printers, which method allows a user only to enter a simple instruction and an application to output print data only once.","In order to achieve the above object, the invention provides an information processing apparatus in which data is spooled in specific file formats in accordance with a combination of a plurality of printers for outputting the divided print jobs, and divided print data is generated from the spooled data and output to the printers in order to print the divided print jobs at the printers. Accordingly, with a simple distributed printing instruction, data of a specific file format can be generated which is suitable even if the types of a combination of printers used for the distributed printing and printer drivers are all the same or different. Then, the requested print job is divided so that each printer can efficiently and normally output the print job through distributed printing.","It is a second object of the invention to provide a control method of reliably outputting a distributed printing result report indicating the result of the distributed printing by a plurality of printers.","In order to achieve the above object, the invention provides an information processing apparatus in which while the print job is output at each of a plurality of registered distributed printing printers, the output state of the print job at each printer is monitored to form a distributed printing result report and output to a designated printer. Accordingly, the distributed printing result of the distributed printing can be notified correctly to a user. A print process environment allowing a user to collect copies of the distributed printing from the printers can be configured as desired.","It is a third object of the invention to optimize the distributed printing by using spooling means for spooling data in suitable data formats in accordance with a combination of a plurality of printers for outputting the divided print jobs.","In order to achieve the above object, the invention provides an information processing apparatus comprising spooling means (corresponding to an EMF spooler  shown in ) for spooling data in specific file formats in accordance with a combination of a plurality of printers for outputting the divided print jobs; and output control means (corresponding to a distribution controller  shown in ) for generating divided print data from the data spooled by the spooling means, and outputting the divided print data to the printers in order to print the divided print jobs at the printers.","Other features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which like reference characters designate the same or similar parts throughout the figures thereof.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["101","102","104","106"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","208","201","205"]},"CPU  executes each process of a client by using a RAM  as a working memory, in accordance with a program stored in ROM  or RAM .

For example, the DP printer  may be provided in the print server , whereas the application program  may be provided in the host computer s or client.

The print request information is managed for each output destination printer and stored in a print order list . Reference numeral  represents a printer monitor connected to the network NET for monitoring the status of each printer under management of the server to notify the print order manager  of a print request, if any, for a printer in a ready state. The printer monitor  executes a polling operation for printers at a predetermined time interval to acquire MIB information and confirm the printer status and print completion page.","In the print control system constructed as above, for printing by the application , text data is converted into drawing commands of the intermediate data format executable by a driver, the drawing commands representing drawing data called the GDI function. The drawing data is spooled in the EMF spooler  in the binary data format. The device independent intermediate data spooled in the EMF spooler  is divided into data in the page unit so that this data format is easy to be processed by the distributed printing process.","In the normal printing, the printer driver designated as an output destination port receives intermediate data, i.e., DDI function, and the print request generator  and print data generator  generate the print request information and the print data of the printer language (page descriptive language) capable of being interpreted by a network printer at the print output destination. The generated device dependent print data is spooled in the RAW spooler , and the transmission controller  controls transmission of the print data. The print request information is transmitted by the transmission controller  to the server s via the monitor  and network NET.","If the DP printer  is designated as the output destination port, it means the distributed printing. In this case, the distribution controller  receives the data of the intermediate format from the EMF spooler  via GDI  which is the drawing means of OS, and passes data (DDI function) of the intermediate data format to each printer driver in accordance with distribution setting preset by a user. Similar to the normal printing, the printer driver received the data of the intermediate data format generates the print request information and print data which is spooled in the RAW spooler . In accordance with the distribution setting, the distribution controller  identifies a plurality of DP printer drivers (A to C) and notifies GDI  of these drivers to make GDI  generate print commands (DDI function) capable of being interpreted by each printer driver and pass the print command to each printer driver. Such a control operation is automatically repeated as many as the number of DP printer drivers. The original drawing command issued by the application  is spooled in the EMF spool  as the intermediate data of the binary format. Therefore, by using this spool file, a distributed print instruction can be issued to a plurality of printer drivers, and in addition, it is sufficient for the application to issue the drawing command only once. A print release can be performed earlier and the system becomes easy to be used.","During the distributed printing, the printer monitor  of the server s checks whether all printers used for the distributed printing enter a print ready state. If this state is satisfied, the print order manager  issues a print permission to the transmission controller  of the host computer s. In the distributed printing, data is not printed starting from the printer in the ready state, but data is printed at a time when all the printers take the ready state.","The intermediate data and print data spooled in the EMF and RAW spoolers  and  are stored until the print is completed, in order to use the data for an error process to be later described.

For example, if the printers A and B and MY printer are registered as the DP printers as shown in  and the printer A is 8 PPM for A4 size, the printer B is 16 PPM and the MY printer is 4 PPM, then the numbers of pages are distributed at a ratio of 2:4:1 for the printers A:B:MY.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["601","609"]},"Data and a use method for this distributed printing printer object are generally equal to a printer object for a single printer.

The distributed printing printer information may be added to an area such as a comment area which a user can freely use or may be managed by software realizing the print method of this invention, if the printer object is provided by a general OS such as Windows.","First, at Step S at the start of the print process for printing text data generated by application software at DP printers used as output destination ports, the printer driver is instructed to form a spool file via GDI in the host computer s. At this time, the distribution controller checks at Step S from a presence\/absence of DP printer information corresponding to the printer object name, whether the print process is executed either for the distributed printing printer object or for the general printer object. If not for DP printers, the flow advances to Step S whereat a normal spool process is executed to thereafter terminate the spool process.","If it is judged at Step S that the spool process is for DP printers, than at Step S the DP printer information is acquired and at Step S available printers are listed. These available printers may be those registered in the DP printer information set as shown in , printers having a normal status, printers selected from other conditions such as performance, or the like, so long as they can be listed based upon the DP printer information.","Next, at Step S it is checked whether each of the printers listed at Step S can execute distributed printing of data of PDL capable of dividing a job in the page unit, i.e., RAW data. For example, such PDL is a LISP (registered trademark of CANON INC.) which is a printer language capable of printing a designated page of one job by embedding page designation information in print job data. If it is judged that the printer can print RAW data itself by designating print data, then at Step S it is checked whether all the listed printers are of the same type. If of the same type, e.g., LIPS printer spool file, then at Step S a spool file is formed by using best image quality RAW data such as LIPS data to thereafter terminate the spool process at Step S. The judgement of the same type may be a judgement of the same printer driver. The same type poses no practical problem. The same printer driver does not pose serious problems in generating print data, although there is some difference between print margins and options such as both-side printing and staple.","If it is judged at Step S that the printer cannot execute distributed printing of RAW data itself, or if it is judged at Step S that the listed DP printers are different types, then at Step  a device independent spool file such as an EMF file is generated. In the above manner, the spool file is generated.","The distributed printing of RAW data spooled at Step S will be described with reference to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0072"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 11","FIG. 11"],"b":["102","104","1","102","104","21"]},"In the information processing apparatus, reference numeral  represents application software which is read from the hard disk  or the like shown in  and loaded in RAM  to execute various data processing.

GDI  dynamically links modules called device drivers to absorb dependency of each device such as a display and a printer and outputs data to the devices. The module for the printer is called a printer driver .","The printer driver  is required to prepare a function group called DDI determined to be mounted on a device driver in accordance with its performance and function. GDI  converts an API (application programming interface) call of the application into data suitable for the device driver. GDI  calls the DDI function group to execute a predetermined print process.

The DP printer information includes information on division of a job into three divided jobs such as the numbers of pages for respective printers and a page division ratio of, e.g., 1:1:1, information on assignment of pages to the printers in the registration order.","Next, at Step S the data converter of the invention acquires the spool files from the DP printer to generate device independent data. At Step S the data is divided into data for each page. At Step S it is checked whether the DP printers include the printer A. If included, the flow advances to Step S.","The print data of PDL data or image data is generated without deleting the original job.

The user can perform the next action immediately. The printer for outputting the distributed printing result is designated so that system management of the distributed printing can be easily made.","After the result report is output, the next job is inhibited to always display the result report at the highest display level. A user can be notified immediately and reliably of the inhibition of the distributed printing. Since the printer can be automatically made off-line or an audio alarm is produced after the completion of the distributed printing, a user can be notified of the completion of the distributed printing. Since the printer which outputs the distributed printing result report can be automatically made off-line or an audio alarm is produced, a user can be notified of the distributed printing result report.

In this case, the invention is applicable to the case wherein programs and data are supplied to output apparatuses by using a storage medium such as a CD-ROM, a flash memory and an FD, or an external storage medium accessible via a network. In this case, program codes themselves read from the storage medium realize novel functions of the invention, and the storage medium storing such program codes constitutes the invention.","The storage medium for storing such program codes may be a floppy disk, a hard disk, an optical disk, a magnetooptical disk, a CD-ROM, a CD-R, a CD-RW, a DVD, a magnetic tape, a nonvolatile memory card, a ROM, an EEPROM or the like.","It is obvious that the scope of the invention contains the case wherein the embodiment functions can be realized by executing read program codes by a computer, or by executing part or the whole of actual processes by an OS (operating system) running on a computer. It is obvious that the scope of the invention also contains the case wherein the functions of each embodiment can be realized by writing the program codes into a memory of a function expansion board inserted into a computer or of a function expansion unit connected to the computer, and thereafter by executing a portion or the whole of actual processes by a CPU or the like of the function expansion board or function expansion unit.","The program codes installed in a computer realize the functions and processes of the invention. More specifically, claims of the invention include the computer programs themselves realizing the functions and processes of the invention.","The computer program may be supplied by writing it in FD or CD-ROM and making a computer read and install it, or may be supplied by connecting a browser of a client computer to a home page on the Internet and downloading the program or a compressed file thereof with an automatic install function. The program codes constituting the invention may be divided into a plurality of files. In this case, the functions and processes of the invention can be realized by downloading each file from different home pages. Claims of the invention include a WWW server for downloading a program file to a plurality of users to realize the functions and processes of the invention.","The functions and processes may also be realized by enciphering the program, storing it in a storage medium such as FD, distributing it to users, allowing a user cleared a predetermined condition to download cipher key information from a home page on the Internet, and deciphering the enciphered program by using the cipher key information.","As described so far, according to the invention, in an information processing apparatus for dividing a print job to make a plurality of printers execute a print process, data is spooled in specific file formats in accordance with a combination of a plurality of printers for outputting the divided print jobs, and divided print data is generated from the spooled data and output to the printers in order to print the divided print jobs at the printers. Accordingly, with a simple distributed printing instruction, data of a specific file format can be generated which is suitable even if the types of a combination of printers used for the distributed printing and printer drivers are all the same or different. Then, the requested print job is divided so that each printer can efficiently and normally output the print job through distributed printing.","According to the invention, in accordance with the registered printer candidates, the spooled print job is divided and distributed to designated DP printers. In accordance with the distributed printing result of the print job, a distributed printing result report is formed. After the print job is output through distributed printing, the distributed printing result report is output to one of the printers. The following advantages can therefore be obtained.","(1) Since the distributed printing result report is output after the distributed printing, a system easy to be used by a user can be provided.","(2) The distributed printing result report is output only when the output method is not conformity with a predetermined output method. An error of the distributed printing can therefore be found easily.","(3) A printer to which the distributed printing result report is output is registered beforehand. Therefore, the management of the distributed printing system becomes easy.","(4) if the printer to which the distributed printing result report is output is also used as the output printer for a distributed printing job, the next job is inhibited in order not to make the next job interrupt between the current job and the report job. Copies of the distributed printing can therefore be collected easily.","(5) The printer is automatically made off-line or an audio alarm is produced to notify the user of the distributed printing, after a completion of the distributed printing. A good user interface can therefore be realized.","(6) The printer is automatically made off-line or an audio alarm is produced to notify the user of an output of the distributed printing result report, after an output of the distributed printing result report. A good user interface can therefore be realized.","(7) If an error occurs during the distributed printing, the printer is automatically changed and pages not still output are printed and an error result report is printed. It is therefore possible to notify the user of a distributed printing error without intercepting the printing.","Optimum divided print jobs for a given print job are determined by using a plurality of registered printer resources. The optimum divided print jobs are automatically transferred to the registered printers. The distributed printing result report of the distributed printing is notified to a user. Accordingly, a user can reliably collect copies of the distributed printing from the printers, and the print process environment can be configured as desired which is capable of notifying a user of a print job process error state.","As many apparently widely different embodiments of the present invention can be made without departing from the spirit and scope thereof, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the specific embodiments thereof except as defined in the appended claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 6"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 6"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 16","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIGS. 18A and 18B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIGS. 19A and 19B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 20","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 21"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 22"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 23","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 24"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
