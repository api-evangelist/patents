The U.S. Government has certain rights in the invention.","Halofuginone (1) is a halogenated derivative of febrifugine (3), a natural product extracted from the roots of the hydrangea is one of the \u201cfifty fundamental herbs\u201d of traditional Chinese medicine, originally used as an anti-malarial remedy (Jiang et al., . (2005) 49:1169-1176). Halofuginone, otherwise known as 7-bromo-6-chloro-3-[3-(3-hydroxy-2-piperidinyl)-2-oxopropyl]-4(3H)-quinazolinone, and halofuginone derivatives were first described in U.S. Pat. No. 2,694,711, incorporated herein by reference. Febrifugine has been shown to be the active ingredient in extracts; halofuginone was originally synthesized in search of less toxic anti-malarial derivatives of febrifugine. In addition to its anti-malarial properties, however, halofuginone has striking anti-fibrotic properties in vivo (Pines, et al., (2003) 9: 417-425; U.S. Pat. No. 6,028,075, incorporated herein by reference). Halofuginone shows some toxicity in humans, such as nausea, vomiting, and fatigue, and possibly bleeding complications (de Jonge et al., (2006) 42: 1768-1774).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0005","num":"0004"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"61.13mm","wi":"56.05mm","file":"US09284297-20160315-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"Since halofuginone has shown promising biological activities, there remains a need for identifying further related compounds with useful biological activities, especially those that may be less toxic than halofuginone or febrifugine.","The present invention stems from the recognition that analogs of the quinazolinone alkaloid halofuginone are inhibitors of metazoan glutamyl-prolyl tRNA synthetase (EPRS), particularly mammalian EPRS (), and\/or non-metazoan prolyl tRNA synthetase, particularly protozoan tRNA synthetase. Inhibitors of EPRS such as halofuginone and halofuginone analogs can inhibit the pro-fibrotic behavior of fibroblasts ( and Table 1) and therefore may be useful in treating disorders associated with fibrosis. In addition, halofuginone and analogs of halofuginone are useful in the modification of effector T-cell differentiation ( and Table 2) and therefore may be useful in treating diseases such as inflammatory diseases and autoimmune diseases. Furthermore, halofuginone and halofuginone analogs can inhibit angiogenesis and may be useful in treating tumor neovascularization and ocular diseases involving choroidal neovascularization and retinal edema. Halofuginone and halofuginone analogs may also be useful as antiprotozoal agents given their ability to inhibit protozoal prolyl tRNA synthetase. The present invention provides novel classes of quinazolinones, quinolinones, and heteroaryl derivatives of halofuginone and analogs thereof. The inventive compounds may have more desirable properties than halofuginone. For example, the inventive compounds may be less toxic than halofuginone or febrifugine and\/or the inventive compounds may be more potent than halofuginone or febrifugine.","In one aspect, the inventive compounds are generally of the formula:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"18.71mm","wi":"53.68mm","file":"US09284297-20160315-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":["j is an integer between 0 and 10, inclusive;","p is an integer between 0 and 6, inclusive;","q is an integer between 0 and 6, inclusive;","m is 1 or 2;","v is an integer between 1 and 3, inclusive;","X is N or CR, wherein Ris hydrogen;

See . In certain embodiments, the EPRS is a eukaryotic EPRS. In certain embodiments, the EPRS is a human EPRS. In certain embodiments, the prolyl tRNA synthetase is a protozoan prolyl tRNA synthetase. A structural feature of these inhibitors is a piperidine or pyrrolidine ring, or an analog thereof. Without wishing to be bound by a particular theory, it is believed that the piperidine ring of halofuginone (1) acts by binding in the active site of the tRNA synthetase like the pyrrolidine ring of proline, thus preventing the charging of the amino acid proline to the tRNA synthetase.","Inhibition of EPRS or other tRNA synthetases leads to the accumulation of uncharged prolyl tRNAs, which in turn activates the amino acid starvation response (AAR, ). Activation of the AAR in T-cells suppresses the differentiation of a subset of effector T-cells (Th17 cells) that promote autoimmunity. AAR also suppresses pro-fibrotic gene expression and viral gene expression, replication, and maturation. AAR may contribute to the protection of organs from stress (e.g., ER stress in the pancreas during the development of diabetes).","Inhibition of EPRS suppresses the synthesis and accumulation of proteins such as polyglutamine-containing proteins that cause neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's disease. This class of EPRS inhibitors also promotes autophagy, a process that clears protein aggregates in diseases such as Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Halofuginone and similarly active compounds are therefore useful as promoters of autophagy.","The specific inhibition of EPRS (as opposed to other tRNA synthetases) also inhibits the synthesis of proline-rich proteins such as collagen, which may be useful for the inhibition of scarring and fibrosis due to excess collagen deposition. Inhibition of collagen synthesis may be useful for cosmetic and therapeutic applications. The role of collagen in fibrosis makes the inventive compounds useful in various cosmetic and therapeutic applications associated with the accumulation of collagen.","The synthesis of collagen and the degradation and remodelling of the ECM are also involved in a number of physiological and pathological conditions, including angiogenesis, systemic sclerosis, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), pulmonary and hepatic fibrosis, and autoimmune diseases. These disease are many times associated with the excessive production of connective tissue components, particularly collagen, which results in the destruction of normal tissue architecture and function. Therefore, the inventive compounds may be useful in treating or preventing these diseases associated with collagen accumulation or the degradation and remodelling of the ECM.","Molecular Target of Halofuginone","Halofuginone activates phosphorylation of eIF2alpha, a downstream component of the amino acid starvation response. The activation of eIF2alpha leads to the stimulation of an upstream kinase, GCN2, the activation of which is monitored by measuring its state of phosphorylation.  shows that GCN2 is phosphorylated in response to halofuginone but not an inactive derivative of halofuginone. The ability of halofuginone to stimulate eIF2alpha phosphorylation is dependent on GCN2, as the ability to stimulate eIF2alpha is lost in cells lacking GCN2 (). Activation of GCN2 is well established to be regulated by the accumulation of uncharged tRNAs (Dong, et al., . (2000) 6: 269-279). These data indicate that halofuginone acts either to limit the availability of amino acids for tRNA charging or to inhibit the enzymes that charge tRNA, the amino-acyl tRNA synthetases. The data detailed below show that halofuginone inhibits an amino-acyl tRNA synthetase, in particular, EPRS.","To distinguish these possibilities, the effect of halofuginone on protein translation was examined in an in vitro system (rabbit reticulocyte lysate) in which amino acids are already present at levels adequate to support protein synthesis. In this system, halofuginone at 400 nM inhibits translation of luciferase by 5-6 orders of magnitude (), ruling out the possibility that halofuginone modifies amino acid synthesis or transport and indicating that it blocks tRNA synthetase activity. Distinct tRNA synthetases catalyze the charging of individual tRNA species with their cognate amino acid. To determine which tRNA synthetase is inhibited by halofuginone, several amino acid mixtures were added to the in vitro translation system to determine which, if any, could reverse the inhibition of translation by halofuginone (). When a mixture containing serine, phenylalanine, and proline was found to reverse the effect of halofuginone (, Mix 4), the effect of each amino acid was tested. Only proline could rescue halofuginone inhibition, indicating that glutamyl-prolyl tRNA synthetase (EPRS), the enzyme responsible for proline tRNA aminoacylation, is specifically inhibited by halofuginone. To examine whether proline could specifically rescue the effect of halofuginone in intact cells, the ability of each amino acid to reverse the effect of halofuginone on eIF2alpha phosphorylation in T-cells or to prevent halofuginone inhibition of Th17 differentiation was tested (). Only proline had an effect in these assays, confirming that EPRS is the target for halofuginone in intact cells. Inhibition of EPRS with compounds of the current invention can inhibit Th17 differentiation.","In Vitro Methods","Compounds of the invention may be screened to identify biological activity, e.g., the ability to modulate the development and\/or expansion of Th17 cells by inhibiting EPRS, e.g., IL-17 secreting cells, in a subject. An assay for screening selective inhibitors of IL-17 expressing cell development and\/or expansion, such as IL-17 expressing effector T-cell development and\/or expansion, e.g., Th17 development and\/or expansion includes contacting a na\u00efve T-cell population with a test compound under conditions sufficient to allow T-cell development and\/or expansion, culturing the cell population, and detecting the level of IL-17 expression and\/or the number of Th17 cells in the cell population, wherein no change or a decrease in the level of IL-17 expression in the cell population indicates that the test compound is a selective Th17 inhibitor and\/or wherein no change or a decrease in the number of Th17 cells in the cell population indicates that the test compound is a selective Th17 inhibitor. Determining the level of IL-17 expression and\/or the number of Th17 cells in the cell population can be accomplished for example by using a detection agent that binds to IL-17 or other marker for Th17 cells, for example, the Th17-specific transcription factor RORgammat (ROR\u03b3t). The detection agent is, for example, an antibody. The detection agent can be coupled with a radioisotope or enzymatic label such that binding of the detection agent to IL-17 or other Th17 marker can be determined by detecting the labeled compound. For example, the detection agent can be labeled with I, S, C, or H, either directly or indirectly, and the radioisotope detected by direct counting of radioemission or by scintillation counting. Alternatively, detection agents can be enzymatically labeled with, for example, horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, or luciferase, and the enzymatic label detected by determination of conversion of an appropriate substrate to product.","Methods of Modulating Th17 Cell Differentiation and\/or Proliferation and Other Cellular Functions Using Halofuginone Analogs and Compositions Thereof","Halofuginone and analogs thereof have been found to specifically alter the development of T-cells away from the Th17 lineage, which is associated with cell-mediated damage, persistent inflammation, and autoimmunity.","Th17 cells secrete several cytokines that may have a role in promoting inflammation and fibrosis, including IL-17, IL-6, IL-21, and GM-CSF. Of these cytokines, IL-17 is a specific product of Th17 cells, and not other T-cells. Whether Th17 cells are the only source of IL-17 during inflammatory response is not clear, but elevated IL-17 levels are in general thought to reflect expansion of the Th17 cell population.","Diseases that have been associated with expansion of a Th17 cell population or increased IL-17 production include, but are not limited to, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, Crohn's disease, inflammatory bowel disease, dry eye syndrome, Lyme disease, airway inflammation, transplantation rejection, graft versus host disease, lupus, psoriasis, scleroderma, periodontitis, systemic sclerosis, coronary artery disease, myocarditis, atherosclerosis, diabetes, and inflammation associated with microbial infection (e.g., viral, protazoal, fungal, or bacterial infection).","Halofuginone analogs can be useful for treatment of any of these diseases by suppressing the chronic inflammatory activity of IL-17 expressing cells, such as IL-17 expressing effector T-cells, e.g., Th17 cells. In some instances, this may address the root cause of the disease (e.g., self-sustaining inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis); in other cases (e.g., diabetes, periodontitis) it may not address the root cause but may ameloriate the symptoms associated with the disease.","IL-17 expressing effector T-cells, e.g., Th17 cells, and their associated cytokine IL-17 provide a broad framework for predicting or diagnosing diseases potentially treatable by halofuginone analogs. Specifically, pre-clinical fibrosis and\/or transplant\/graft rejection could be identified and treated with a halofuginone analog, or with a halofuginone analog in combination with other Th17 antagonists. Additionally, diseases that are not currently associated with Th17 cell damage and persistence of inflammation may be identified through the measurement of Th17 cell expansion, or of increased IL-17 levels (e.g., in serum or synovial fluid). Alternatively, or in addition, the use of gene profiling to characterize sets of genes activated subsequent to Th17 differentiation may allow detection of Th17-affected tissues, prior to histological\/pathologic changes in tissues.","Halofuginone analogs could be used in combination with other agents that act to suppress Th17 development to achieve synergistic therapeutic effects. Current examples of potential synergistic agents would include anti-IL-21 antibodies or antigen binding fragments thereof, retinoic acid, or anti-IL-6 antibodies or antigen binding fragments thereof, all of which can reduce Th17 differentiation.","Halofuginone analogs could be used in combination with other agents that act to suppress inflammation and\/or immunological reactions, such as steroids (e.g., cortisol (hydrocortisone), dexamethasone, methylprednisolone, and\/or prednisolone), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs; e.g., ibuprofen, acetominophin, aspirin, celecoxib, valdecoxib, etoricoxib, lumiracoxib, parecoxib, rofecoxib, nimesulide, and\/or naproxen), or immunosuppressants (e.g., cyclosporine, rapamycin, and\/or FK506). In certain embodiments, halofuginone analogs are used in combination with agents that are immunomodulatory (e.g., modulators of the mTOR pathway; thalidomide and derivatives thereof such as lenalidomide and actimid; biguanides such as metformin, phenformin, buformin, and proguanil; and HDAC inhibitors such as trichostatin A, depsipeptide, SAHA, PXD101, LAQ824, LBH589, MS275, CI994, MGCD0103, and valproic acid. In some embodiments, an agent that inhibits a tRNA synthetase is used in combination with an inhibitor of a proinflammatory cytokine. Proinflammatory cytokines that can be targeted (in addition to IL-6 and IL-21, discussed above) include TNF\u03b1, IFN\u03b3, GM-CSF, MIP-2, IL-12, IL-1\u03b1, IL-I\u03b2, and IL-23. Examples of such inhibitors include antibodies that bind to the cytokine or that bind to a receptor of the cytokine and block its activity, agents that reduce expression of the cytokine (e.g., small interfering RNA (siRNA) or antisense agents), soluble cytokine receptors, and small molecule inhibitors (see, e.g., WO 2007\/058990).","In some embodiments, agents that inhibit tRNA synthetases are used in combination with an inhibitor of TNF\u03b1. In some embodiments, an inhibitor of TNF\u03b1 comprises an anti-TNF\u03b1 antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof. In some embodiments, the anti-TNF\u03b1 antibody is adalimumab (Humira\u2122). In some embodiments, the anti-TNF\u03b1 antibody is infliximab (Remicade\u2122). In some embodiments, the anti-TNF\u03b1 antibody is CDP571. In some embodiments, an inhibitor of TNF\u03b1 comprises a TNF\u03b1 receptor. For example, in some embodiments, the TNF\u03b1 inhibitor is etanercept (Enbrel\u2122), which is a recombinant fusion protein having two soluble TNF receptors joined by the Fc fragment of a human IgG1 molecule. In some embodiments, an inhibitor of TNF\u03b1 comprises an agent that inhibit expression of TNF\u03b1, e.g., such as nucleic acid molecules that mediate RNA interference (RNAi) (e.g., a TNF\u03b1 selective siRNA or shRNA) or antisense oligonucleotides. For example, a TNF\u03b1 inhibitor can include, e.g., a short interfering nucleic acid (siNA), a short interfering RNA (siRNA), a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), or a short hairpin RNA (shRNA)(see, e.g., U.S. Patent Application No. 20050227935, incorporated herein by reference).","Halofuginone analogs can be evaluated in animal models. To determine whether a particular halofuginone analog suppresses graft rejection, allogeneic or xenogeneic grafting (e.g., skin grafting, organ transplantion, or cell implantation) can be performed on an animal such as a rat, mouse, rabbit, guinea pig, dog, or non-human primate. Strains of mice such as C57B1-10, B10.BR, and B10.AKM (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Me.), which have the same genetic background but are mismatched for the H-2 locus, are well suited for assessing various organ grafts.","In another example, heart transplantation is performed, e.g., by performing cardiac grafts by anastomosis of the donor heart to the great vessels in the abdomen of the host as described by Ono et al., 57:225, 1969. See also Corry et al., 16:343, 1973. Function of the transplanted heart can be assessed by palpation of ventricular contractions through the abdominal wall. Rejection is defined as the cessation of myocardial contractions. A halofuginone analog would be considered effective in reducing organ rejection if animals treated with the inhibitor experience a longer period of myocardial contractions of the donor heart than do untreated hosts.","In another example, effectiveness of a halofuginone analog at reducing skin graft rejection is assessed in an animal model. To perform skin grafts on a rodent, a donor animal is anesthetized and a full thickness skin is removed from a part of the tail. The recipient animal is also anesthetized, and a graft bed is prepared by removing a patch of skin (e.g., 0.5\u00d70.5 cm) from the shaved flank. Donor skin is shaped to fit the graft bed, positioned, covered with gauze, and bandaged. Grafts are inspected daily beginning on the sixth post-operative day and are considered rejected when more than half of the transplanted epithelium appears to be non-viable. A halofuginone analog that causes a host to experience a longer period of engraftment than seen in an untreated host would be considered effective in this type of experiment.","In another example, a halofuginone analog is evaluated in a pancreatic islet cell allograft model. DBA\/2J islet cell allografts can be transplanted into rodents, such as 6-8 week-old B6 AF1 mice rendered diabetic by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (225 mg\/kg; Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.). As a control, syngeneic islet cell grafts can be transplanted into diabetic mice. Islet cell transplantation can be performed by following published protocols (for example, see Emamaullee et al., 56(5):1289-98, 2007). Allograft function can be followed by serial blood glucose measurements (Accu-Check III\u2122; Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany). A rise in blood glucose exceeding normal levels (on each of at least 2 successive days) following a period of primary graft function is indicative of graft rejection. The NOD (non-obese diabetic) mouse model is another model that can be used to evaluate ability of a halofuginone analog to treat or prevent type I diabetes.","In another example, a tRNA synthetase inhibitor is evaluated in a model of dry eye disease (DED). In one such model, DED is induced in mice in a controlled environment chamber by administering scopolamine hydrobromide into the skin four times daily. Chamber conditions include a relative humidity <30%, airflow of 15 L\/min, and constant temperature (21-23\u00b0 C.). Induction of dry eye can be confirmed by measuring changes in corneal integrity with corneal fluorescein staining (see, e.g., Chauhan et al., 182:1247-1252, 2009; Barabino et al., 46:2766-2771, 2005; and Rashid et al., 126: 219-225, 2008).","Numerous autoimmune diseases have been modeled in animals, including rheumatic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), type I diabetes, dry eye syndrome, and autoimmune diseases of the thyroid, gut, and central nervous system. For example, animal models of SLE include MRL mice, BXSB mice, and NZB mice and their F1 hybrids. The general health of the animal as well as the histological appearance of renal tissue can be used to determine whether the administration of a halofuginone analog can effectively suppress the immune response in an animal model of one of these diseases.","Animal models of intestinal inflammation are described, for example, by Elliott et al. (Elliott et al., 1998, Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Celiac Disease. In: The Autoimmune Diseases, Third ed., N. R. Rose and I. R. MacKay, eds. Academic Press, San Diego, Calif.). Some mice with genetically engineered gene deletions develop chronic bowel inflammation similar to IBD. See, e.g., Elson et al., 109:1344, 1995; Ludviksson et al., 158:104, 1997; and Mombaerts et al., 75:274, 1993). One of the MRL strains of mice that develops SLE, MRL-lpr\/lpr, also develops a form of arthritis that resembles rheumatoid arthritis in humans (Theofilopoulos et al., 37:269, 1985).","Models of autoimmune disease in the central nervous system (CNS), such as experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), can also be experimentally induced, e.g., by injection of brain or spinal cord tissue with adjuvant into the animal (see, e.g., Steinman and Zamvil, Ann Neurol. 60:12-21, 2006). In one EAE model, C57B\/6 mice are injected with an immunodominant peptide of myelin basic protein in Complete Freund's Adjuvant. EAE disease correlates such as limp tail, weak\/altered gait, hind limb paralysis, forelimb paralysis, and morbidity are monitored in animals treated with a halofuginone analog as compared to controls.","In addition to T cell differentiation processes, halofuginone analogs can specifically alter processes such as fibrosis and angiogenesis. Fibrosis can be assayed in vitro by observing the effect of a halofuginone analog on fibroblast behavior. In one exemplary assay for use in evaluating halofuginone analogs, primary dermal fibroblasts are cultured in a matrix of Type I collagen, which mimics the interstitial matrix of the dermis and hypodermis, such that fibroblasts attach to the substratum and spread. Inhibition of fibroblast attachment and spreading in the presence of a halofuginone analog indicates that the halofuginone analog has anti-fibrotic properties. Biological effects of halofuginone analogs on non-immune cell functions can also be evaluated in vivo. In some embodiments, a halofuginone analog reduces extracellular matrix deposition (e.g., in an animal model of wound healing; see, e.g., Pines et al., 9:417-425, 2003). In some embodiments, a halofuginone analog reduces extracellular matrix deposition at a concentration lower than the concentration at which it inhibits another cellular function, such as cell proliferation or protein synthesis.","The invention further provides methods of treating a disease using a halofuginone analog. The inventive method involves the administration of a therapeutically effective amount of a halofuginone analog to a subject (including, but not limited to a human or other animal).","Compounds and compositions described herein are useful for the inhibition of glutamyl-prolyl tRNA synthetase (EPRS) Inhibition of EPRS leads to the accumulation of uncharged tRNAs, which in turn activate the amino acid starvation response (AAR). Activation of this response suppresses 1) pro-fibrotic gene expression; 2) the differentiation of na\u00efve T-cells into Th17 cells that promote autoimmunity; 3) viral gene expression, replication, and maturation; and\/or 4) stress to organs (e.g., during transplantation).","In some embodiments, halofuginone analog that inhibits EPRS has anti-fibrotic properties in vivo. For example, an EPRS inhibitor, halofuginone, potently reduces dermal extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition (Pines et al., 9: 417-425, 2003). Halofuginone inhibits the transcription of a number of components and modulators of ECM function, including Type I collagen, fibronectin, the matrix metallopeptidases MMP-2 and MMP-9, and the metalloprotease inhibitor TIMP-2 (Li et al., 11: 3046-3050, 2005; Pines et al., 9: 417-425, 2003). The major cell types responsible for altered ECM deposition, tissue thickening, and contracting during fibrosis are fibroblasts and myofibroblasts. Myofibroblasts mature\/differentiate from their precursor fibroblasts in response to cytokine release, often following tissue damage and mechanical stress, and can be distinguished from fibroblasts in a wide range of organs and pathological conditions (Border et al., 331: 1286-1292, 1994; Branton et al., 1: 1349-1365, 1999; Flanders, 85: 47-64, 2004). Halofuginone has been studied extensively as a potential anti-fibrotic therapeutic and has progressed to phase 2 clinical trials for applications stemming from these properties.","In animal models of wound healing and fibrotic disease, halofuginone reduces excess dermal ECM deposition when introduced intraperitoneally, added to food, or applied locally (Pines et al., 9: 417-425, 2003). Halofuginone is currently in phase 2 clinical trials as a treatment for scleroderma (Pines et al., 9: 417-425, 2003), bladder cancer (Elkin et al., 59: 4111-4118, 1999), and angiogenesis during Kaposi's sarcoma, as well as in earlier stages of clinical investigation for a wide range of other fibrosis-associated disorders (Nagler et al., 154: 1082-1086, 1996; Nagler et al., 17: 194-202, 1997; Nagler et al., 40: 1397-1403, 2004; Ozcelik et al., 187: 257-260, 2004). The results presented herein indicate that the inhibition of fibrosis may be due at least in part to the inhibition of glutamyl-prolyl tRNA synthetase (EPRS).","In some embodiments, a halofuginone analog inhibits pro-fibrotic activities of fibroblasts. Thus, in certain embodiments, the present invention provides a method for treating a fibroblast-associated disorder comprising the step of administering to a patient in need thereof a halofuginone analog or pharmaceutically acceptable composition thereof.","As used herein, the term \u201cfibroblast-associated\u201d disorders means any disease or other deleterious condition in which fibroblasts are known to play a role. Accordingly, another embodiment of the present invention relates to treating or lessening the severity of one or more diseases in which fibroblasts are known to play a role including, but not limited to, fibrosis.","While halofuginone at high concentrations (between 20-40 nM) does generally inhibit CD4 T cell, CD8 T cell, and B220 B cell activation, halofuginone also specifically inhibits the development of Th17 cells, i.e., the T helper subset that exclusively expresses high levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin IL-17, at low concentrations (PCT\/US08\/09774, filed Aug. 15, 2008, which claims priority to U.S. Ser. No. 60\/964,936, filed Aug. 15, 2007, the entirety of each of which is incorporated herein by reference). Th17 cells, as a function of their IL-17 secretion, play causal roles in the pathogenesis of two important autoimmune diseases in the mouse, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and type II collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). EAE and CIA are murine models of the human autoimmune pathologies, multiple sclerosis (MS) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Halofuginone has been shown to be active in these models. Halofuginone-mediated specific inhibition of IL-17 expressing cell development, such as IL-17 expressing effector T cell development, e.g., Th17 cell development, takes place at remarkably low concentrations, with 50% inhibition being achieved around 3 nM. Therefore, halofuginone treatment specifically inhibits the development of Th17-mediated and\/or IL-17 related diseases, including autoimmune diseases, persistent inflammatory diseases, and infectious diseases, while not leading to profound T cell dysfunction, either in the context of delayed-type hypersensitivity or infection. Halofuginone analogs can also be used to inhibit the development of Th17-mediated and\/or IL-17 related diseases.","Halofuginone and analogs thereof interfere with the differentiation of na\u00efve T-cells into IL-17-expressing Th17 cells. Thus, in certain embodiments, the present invention provides a method for treating a Th17-mediated or IL-17-mediated disorder comprising the step of administering to a patient in need thereof a halofuginone analog or a pharmaceutically acceptable composition thereof.","As used herein, the terms \u201cTh17-mediated\u201d disorder and \u201cIL-17-mediated\u201d disorder means any disease or other deleterious condition in which Th17 or IL-17 is known to play a role. Accordingly, another embodiment of the present invention relates to treating or lessening the severity of one or more diseases in which Th17 or IL-17 is known to play a role including, but not limited to, autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases, infectious diseases, angiogenesis, and organ protection during transplantation.","The compounds and pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be used in treating or preventing diseases or conditions including, but not limited to, asthma, arthritis, inflammatory diseases (e.g., Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, dry eye syndrome), proliferative diseases (e.g., cancer, benign neoplasms, diabetic retinopathy), cardiovascular diseases, and autoimmune diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, scleroderma, or dry eye syndrome).

It will be understood, however, that the total daily usage of the agents of the present invention will be decided by the attending physician within the scope of sound medical judgment. The specific therapeutically effective dose level for any particular patient or organism will depend upon a variety of factors including the disorder being treated and the severity of the disorder; the specific agent employed; the age, body weight, general health, sex, and diet of the patient; the time of administration, route of administration, and rate of excretion of the specific agent employed; the duration of the treatment; drugs used in combination or coincidental with the specific agent employed; and like factors well known in the medical arts.","Furthermore, after formulation with an appropriate pharmaceutically acceptable carrier in a desired dosage, the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention can be administered to humans and other animals orally, rectally, parenterally, intracisternally, intravaginally, intraperitoneally, topically (as by powders, ointments, or drops), bucally, as an oral or nasal spray, or the like, depending on the severity of the infection being treated. In certain embodiments, an agent of the invention may be administered orally or parenterally at dosage levels sufficient to deliver from about 0.001 mg\/kg to about 100 mg\/kg, from about 0.01 mg\/kg to about 50 mg\/kg, preferably from about 0.1 mg\/kg to about 40 mg\/kg, preferably from about 0.5 mg\/kg to about 30 mg\/kg, from about 0.01 mg\/kg to about 10 mg\/kg, from about 0.1 mg\/kg to about 10 mg\/kg, and more preferably from about 1 mg\/kg to about 25 mg\/kg, of subject body weight per day, one or more times a day, to obtain the desired therapeutic effect. The desired dosage may be delivered three times a day, two times a day, once a day, every other day, every third day, every week, every two weeks, every three weeks, or every four weeks. In certain embodiments, the desired dosage may be delivered using multiple administrations (e.g., two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, or more administrations). In certain embodiments, a halofuginone analog is administered at a dose that is below the dose at which the agent causes non-specific effects. In certain embodiments, a halofuginone analog is administered at a dose that does not cause generalized immunosuppression in a subject.","Liquid dosage forms for oral and parenteral administration include, but are not limited to, pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups, and elixirs. In addition to the active agents, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethylformamide, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor, and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof. Besides inert diluents, oral compositions can also include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents. In certain embodiments for parenteral administration, agents of the invention are mixed with solubilizing agents such CREMOPHOR EL\u00ae (polyethoxylated castor oil), alcohols, oils, modified oils, glycols, polysorbates, cyclodextrins, polymers, and combinations thereof.","Injectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspensions may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. Sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution, suspension or emulsion in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution, U.S.P. and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid are used in the preparation of injectables.","Injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacterial-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable medium prior to use.","In order to prolong the effect of a drug, it is often desirable to slow the absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material with poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of dissolution which, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally administered drug form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle. Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the drug in biodegradable polymers such as poly(lactide-co-glycolide). Depending upon the ratio of drug to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissues.","Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories which can be prepared by mixing the compounds of this invention with suitable non-irritating excipients or carriers such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol or a suppository wax which are solid at ambient temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active agent.","Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills, powders, and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active agent is mixed with at least one inert, pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate and\/or a) fillers or extenders such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and silicic acid, b) binders such as, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidinone, sucrose, and acacia, c) humectants such as glycerol, d) disintegrating agents such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates, and sodium carbonate, e) solution retarding agents such as paraffin, f) absorption accelerators such as quaternary ammonium compounds, g) wetting agents such as, for example, cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate, h) absorbents such as kaolin and bentonite clay, and i) lubricants such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, and mixtures thereof. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage form may also comprise buffering agents.","Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like. The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. They may optionally contain opacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions which can be used include polymeric substances and waxes. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polethylene glycols and the like.","The active agents can also be in micro-encapsulated form with one or more excipients as noted above. The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings, release controlling coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. In such solid dosage forms the active agent may be admixed with at least one inert diluent such as sucrose, lactose or starch. Such dosage forms may also comprise, as is normal practice, additional substances other than inert diluents, e.g., tableting lubricants and other tableting aids such a magnesium stearate and microcrystalline cellulose. In the case of capsules, tablets, and pills, the dosage forms may also comprise buffering agents. They may optionally contain opacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions which can be used include polymeric substances and waxes.","Formulations suitable for topical administration include liquid or semi-liquid preparations such as liniments, lotions, gels, applicants, oil-in-water or water-in-oil emulsions such as creams, ointments, or pastes; or solutions or suspensions such as drops. Formulations for topical administration to the skin surface can be prepared by dispersing the drug with a dermatologically acceptable carrier such as a lotion, cream, ointment, or soap. Useful carriers are capable of forming a film or layer over the skin to localize application and inhibit removal. For topical administration to internal tissue surfaces, the agent can be dispersed in a liquid tissue adhesive or other substance known to enhance adsorption to a tissue surface. For example, hydroxypropylcellulose or fibrinogen\/thrombin solutions can be used to advantage. Alternatively, tissue-coating solutions, such as pectin-containing formulations can be used. Ophthalmic formulation, ear drops, and eye drops are also contemplated as being within the scope of this invention. Additionally, the present invention contemplates the use of transdermal patches, which have the added advantage of providing controlled delivery of an agent to the body. Such dosage forms can be made by dissolving or dispensing the agent in the proper medium. Absorption enhancers can also be used to increase the flux of the agent across the skin. The rate can be controlled by either providing a rate controlling membrane or by dispersing the agent in a polymer matrix or gel.","Additionally, the carrier for a topical formulation can be in the form of a hydroalcoholic system (e.g., quids and gels), an anhydrous oil or silicone based system, or an emulsion system, including, but not limited to, oil-in-water, water-in-oil, water-in-oil-in-water, and oil-in-water-in-silicone emulsions. The emulsions can cover a broad range of consistencies including thin lotions (which can also be suitable for spray or aerosol delivery), creamy lotions, light creams, heavy creams, and the like. The emulsions can also include microemulsion systems. Other suitable topical carriers include anhydrous solids and semisolids (such as gels and sticks); and aqueous based mousse systems.","It will also be appreciated that the agents and pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can be employed in combination therapies, that is, the agents and pharmaceutical compositions can be administered concurrently with, prior to, or subsequent to, one or more other desired therapeutics or medical procedures. The particular combination of therapies (therapeutics or procedures) to employ in a combination regimen will take into account compatibility of the desired therapeutics and\/or procedures and the desired therapeutic effect to be achieved. It will also be appreciated that the therapies employed may achieve a desired effect for the same disorder (for example, a halofuginone analog may be administered concurrently with another agent), or they may achieve different effects (e.g., control of any adverse effects).","In still another aspect, the present invention also provides a pharmaceutical pack or kit comprising one or more containers filled with one or more of the ingredients of the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention, and in certain embodiments, includes an additional approved therapeutic agent for use as a combination therapy. Optionally associated with such container(s) can be a notice in the form prescribed by a governmental agency regulating the manufacture, use or sale of pharmaceutical products, which notice reflects approval by the agency of manufacture, use or sale for human administration.","Methods of Identifying Subjects in Need of Th17 Modulation","In various embodiments of the invention, suitable in vitro or in vivo studies are performed to determine whether administration of a specific therapeutic that modulates the development of IL-17 expressing cells, such as IL-17 expressing effector T-cells, e.g., Th17 cells is indicated for treatment of a given subject or population of subjects. For example, subjects in need of treatment using a compound that modulates IL-17 expressing cell development, such as IL-17 expressing effector T-cell development, e.g., Th17 cell development, are identified by obtaining a sample of IL-17 expressing cells, such as IL-17 expressing effector T-cells, e.g., Th17 cells from a given test subject and expanding the sample of cells. If the concentration of any of a variety of inflammatory cytokine markers, including IL-17, IL-17F, IL-6, IL-21, IL-2, and TNF\u03b1, also increases as the cell population expands, then the test subject is a candidate for treatment using any of the compounds, compositions, and methods described herein.","Subjects in need of treatment are also identified by detecting an elevated level of IL-17 expressing cells, such as IL-17 expressing effector T-cells, e.g., Th17 cells or a Th17 cell-associated cytokine or a cytokine that is secreted by a Th17 cell. Cytokine levels to be evaluated include IL-17, IL-17F, IL-6, IL-21, TNF\u03b1, and GM-CSF. The cytokine IL-17, as well as other cytokines such as IL-6, IL-21, IL-2, TNF\u03b1, and GM-CSF, are typically induced during inflammation and\/or infection. Thus, any elevated level of expression of these cytokines in a subject or biological sample as compared to the level of expression of these cytokines in a normal subject is useful as an indicator of a disease state or other situation where treatment with an inventive compound is desirable. Studies have shown that the levels of IL-17 in healthy patient serum is less than 2 pg\/mL (i.e., below the detection limit of the assay used), while patients with liver injury had levels of IL-17 expression in the range of 2-18 pg\/mL and patients with rheumatoid arthritis had levels greater than 100 pg\/mL (see Yasumi et al., . (2007) 37: 248-254, and Ziolkowska et al., . (2000) 164: 2832-2838, each of which is incorporated herein by reference). Thus, detection of an expression level of IL-17 greater than 2 pg\/mL in a subject or biological sample is useful in identifying subjects in need of treatment.","A subject suffering from or at risk of developing a Th17-related and\/or IL-17-related diseases such as an autoimmune disease, a persistent inflammatory disease, or an infectious disease is identified by methods known in the art. For example, subjects suffering from an autoimmune disease, persistent inflammatory disease, or an infectious disease are diagnosed based on the presence of one or more symptoms associated with a given autoimmune, persistent inflammatory, or infectious disease. Common symptoms include, for example, inflammation, fever, loss of appetite, weight loss, abdominal symptoms, such as, for example, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or constipation, joint pain or aches (arthralgia), fatigue, rash, anemia, extreme sensitivity to cold (Raynaud's phenomenon), muscle weakness, muscle fatigue, change in skin or tissue tone, shortness of breath or other abnormal breathing patterns, chest pain or constriction of the chest muscles, abnormal heart rate (e.g., elevated or lowered), light sensitivity, blurry or otherwise abnormal vision, and reduced organ function.","Subjects suffering from an autoimmune disease such as, e.g., multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's diseases, are identified using any of a variety of clinical and\/or laboratory test such as, physical examination, radiological examination and blood, urine, and stool analysis to evaluate immune status. For example, subjects suffering from an infectious disease such as Lyme disease are identified based on symptoms, objective physical findings (such as erythema migrans, facial palsy, or arthritis), and a history of possible exposure to infected ticks. Blood test results are generally used to confirm a diagnosis of Lyme disease.","Determination of the Biological Effect of Th17 Modulation","In various embodiments of the invention, suitable in vitro or in vivo studies are performed to determine the effect of a specific therapeutic that modulates the development of IL-17 expressing cells, such as IL-17 expressing effector T-cells, e.g., Th17 cells, and whether its administration is indicated for treatment of a given subject or population of subjects. For example, the biological effect of a selective Th17 inhibitor therapeutic, such as a compound of the invention, is monitored by measuring level of IL-17 production and\/or the number of IL-17 expressing cells, such as IL-17 expressing effector T-cells, e.g., Th17 cells in a patient-derived sample. The biological effect of a therapeutic is also measured by physical and\/or clinical observation of a patient suffering from, or at risk of developing, a Th17-related and\/or Il-17-related disease such as an autoimmune disease, persistent inflammatory disease, and\/or an infectious disease. For example, administration of a specific Th17 inhibitor to a patient suffering from a Th17-related disease and\/or an IL-17-related disease is considered successful if one or more of the symptoms associated with the disorder is alleviated, reduced, inhibited, or does not progress to a further, i.e., worse, state.","These and other aspects of the present invention will be further appreciated upon consideration of the following Examples, which are intended to illustrate certain particular embodiments of the invention but are not intended to limit its scope, as defined by the claims.","SV-MES mesangial cells were stimulated for 2 hours with halofuginone (20 nM), or an inactive derivative of halofuginone 9 (MAZ1310, 20 nM) or control buffer, lysed and analyzed by SDS-PAGE\/Western blot for total or Ser51 phosphorylated eIF2alpha, and total or Thr 898 phosphorylated GCN2.  shows the results of the experiment. Duplicate cell samples are shown. Phosphorylation of GCN2 at Thr898 is a defining characteristic of AAR activation, therefore the activation of GCN2 phosphorylation at this site following HF treatment indicates that HF activates the AAR. Activated GCN2 phosphorylates eif2alpha at Ser 51, therefore this is an expected downstream outcome of AAR activation.","CD4+ CD25\u2212 T cells purified from wild type of GCN2\u2212\/\u2212 mice were activated through TCR for 4 hours in the presence of halofuginone (10 nM) or 9 (MAZ1310, 10 nM). Results are shown in . Whole cell lysates were analyzed by SDS PAGE\/Western blot and antibodies indicated. Treatment with Halofuginone, but not the inactive derivative 9, leads to phosphorylation of Ser51 of eif2alpha only in wild type cells and not in GCN2\u2212\/\u2212 cells, establishing the eif2alpha phosphorylation following halofuginone stimulation occurs through activation of the AAR\/GCN2 pathway.","Translation in vitro was performed using rabbit reticulocyte lysates and luciferase mRNA as template. Translation was measured as arbitrary units of luciferase activity using a luminometer based luminescence assay. Results are shown in . Log scale presentation of background-subtracted data is shown. Translations were performed without (dark bars) or with (light bars) 400 nM halofuginone, in the absence of amino acids (0), or with the following additions: Mix 1: 1 mM Asn, 1 mM Arg; Mix 2: 1 mM Lys, 1 mM Ile, 1 mM Tyr; Mix 3: 1 mM His, 1 mM Met, 1 mM Leu; Mix 4: 1 mM Ser, 1 mM Phe, 1 mM Pro, Phe: 2 mM Phe; Pro: 2 mM Pro; Ser: 2 mM Ser. Addition of proline, either alone or in combination with phenylaline and serine, rescues inhibition of translation by halofuginone, establishing that proline utilization for translation (by glutamyl prolyl tRNA synthetase) is the critical target of halofuginone action.","Na\u00efve T-cells were treated to stimulate the T-cell receptor (TCR) in the presence or absence of 10 nM halofuginone in the presence of 1 mM added amino acid, and then assayed for eIF2alpha activity phosphorylation by SDS PAGE\/Western blot. Results are shown in . Phosphorylation induced by halofuginone is blocked by added proline. These data establish that utilization of proline is inhibited by halofuginone, leading to activation of the AAR.","Na\u00efve T-cells were stimulated to differentiate in the presence or absence of 10 nM halofuginone, with 1 mM of the indicated amino acids added to the medium, and stained for Th17 differentiation on day 4. Results are shown in . Na\u00efve murine T cells were activated in the presence or absence of TGF\u03b2 plus IL-6 as indicated, expanded in for 4 days and restimulated with PMA and ionomycin for intracellular cytokine staining. For intracellular cytokine staining, fixed cells were washed twice with staining buffer (PBS\/1% BSA\/0.1% NaN) and then permeabilized with perm buffer III (BD Pharmingen) on ice for 30 minutes. Cells were then washed and stored in staining buffer prior to data acquisition All FACS data was acquired on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Pharmingen) and analyzed using FlowJo software (Treestar, Inc., Ashland, Oreg.). FACS sorting was performed on a FACS-Diva cytometer (BD Pharmingen). Bars indicate percentage of cells differentiation as Th17 as indicated by IL17 expression. Proline, and no other added amino acid, rescues the inhibition of Th17 differentiation by halofuginone, confirming that proline utilization is the critical target for halofuginone inhibition of Th17 differentiation.","The ability of halofuginone and analogs thereof to inhibit the spreading of freshly plated primary dermal fibroblasts was examined.

Dose-response experiments revealed a remarkably selective effect of HF on Th17 differentiation (defined here as the percentage of IL-17 IFN\u03b3 cells following restimulation on day 4-5). HF repressed Th17 differentiation in a dose-dependent manner with an ICof 3.6 nM\u00b10.4 nM (, B). Low concentrations of HF (1-10 nM) that strongly reduced IL-17 production (, B, ) did not affect T cell proliferation, CD25 upregulation, or production of IL-2, TNF, or IFN\u03b3 (). Low-dose HF also failed to modulate Th1, Th2 or iTreg differentiation as assessed by IFN\u03b3, IL-4, or Foxp3 expression, respectively (). At approximately 10-fold higher concentrations (>20 nM), HF induced a general inhibition of T and B cell activation, proliferation, and effector function (, B).","The selective inhibition of Th17 differentiation by low-dose HF was stereospecific: the HPLC-purified D-enantiomer of HF inhibited IL-17 expression more potently than a racemic mixture, whereas the L-enantiomer was completely inactive (). Inhibition of IL-17 expression was most pronounced when HF was added during a 12-hour window at the start of the culture period () and HF treatment impaired expression of both IL-17 and IL-17f mRNA (). These results suggest that HF regulates early events, possibly involved in Th17 lineage commitment, rather than influencing the expansion of Th17 cells or preventing acute cytokine expression upon restimulation. Inhibition by HF was not due to perturbation of cell cycle progression or selective survival; HF inhibited IL-17 expression in a dose-dependent manner even when considering only cells that had completed an equivalent number of cell divisions based on CFSE dilution (). HF also reduced IL-17 expression in cultures where IFN\u03b3 and IL-4, cytokines known to inhibit Th17 differentiation (Park et al., Nat. Immunol. 6:1133, 2005), were blocked by addition of neutralizing antibodies. Thus, HF-mediated inhibition of Th17 cell development is not secondary to effects on T cell proliferation or auxiliary cytokine production.","In light of reports that IL-17 expression may be differentially regulated in murine versus human T cells (Manel et al., 9:641, 2008; Wilson et al., Nat. Immunol. 8:950, 2007; Acosta-Rodriguez et al., 8:942, 2007), HF modulation of IL-17 expression by human CD4 T cells was investigated. These experiments showed that HF treatment greatly reduced both the percentage of human T cells expressing IL-17 and the amount of IL-17 produced (, G). In striking contrast, IFN\u03b3 expression was essentially unaffected by HF treatment (, G). Therefore, HF selectively limits IL-17 expression in both human and mouse T cells.","Th17 differentiation is synergistically regulated by TGF\u03b2 and the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-21. Although reports had indicated that HF can attenuate TGF\u03b2 signaling at high concentrations (>50 nM) (Gnainsky et al., 328:153, 200; Flanders, 85:47, 2004), it was discovered that low dose HF inhibited neither TGF\u03b2-induced Smad phosphorylation nor a variety of other lymphocyte responses to TGF\u03b2 (Li et al., 24:99, 2006; Glimcher et al., 4:900, 2004; van Vlasselaer et al., 148:2062, 1992), in contrast to the type 1 TGF\u03b2 receptor kinase inhibitor SB-431542, which abrogated all responses to TGF\u03b2 (). Since STAT3 is the major transducer of IL-6 and IL-21 signaling, the kinetics of STAT3 phosphorylation in HF-treated T cells were examined. HF did not interfere with STAT3 activation during the first 6 hours of Th17 differentiation, but rather decreased the maintenance of STAT3 phosphorylation, beginning around 12 hours post activation (, B).","Next, it was investigated whether inhibition of Th17 differentiation by HF could be restored by transgenic expression of a hyperactive STAT3 protein (STAT3C) (Bromberg et al., 98:295, 1999). T cells isolated from homozygous mice containing a floxed stop-STAT3C-IRES-EGFP (STAT3C-GFPfl\/fl) or stop-YFP (YFPfl\/fl) cassette inserted into the ROSA26 locus were transduced with a cell-permeant TAT-Cre fusion protein to delete the stop cassette and these cells were activated in the presence of TGF\u03b2 plus IL-6, with either HF or 9 (MAZ1310). As expected, HF strongly impaired Th17 differentiation of cells expressing YFP or those not expressing a transgene (, top three panels); in contrast, T cells expressing STAT3C (defined by their concomitant expression of GFP) remained capable of differentiating into Th17 cells even in the presence of 10 nM HF (, bottom panel). Data from a number of similar experiments are quantified and summarized in . Collectively, these results suggest that HF inhibits Th17 differentiation through its ability to prevent sustained activation of STAT3. STAT3 promotes Th17 lineage commitment through the induction of the orphan nuclear receptors ROR\u03b3t and ROR\u03b1 (Yang et al., 282:9358, 2007; Ivanov et al., 126:1121, 2006; Yang et al., 28:29, 2008). Consistent with the finding that HF did not affect STAT3 phosphorylation during the first 12 hours of stimulation, HF did not interfere with the upregulation of ROR\u03b3t or ROR\u03b1 during Th17 differentiation (). Moreover, HF inhibited Th17 differentiation as effectively in T cells retrovirally transduced with ROR\u03b3t-expressing retroviruses as in those transduced with empty retroviruses (, C). T cells differentiated in the presence of HF showed enhanced Foxp3 expression (), as expected from the observations that HF inhibits STAT3 signaling and Th17 differentiation (Yang et al., 282:9358, 2007). This result suggested that HF redirects developing Th17 cells to the iTreg lineage rather than simply blocking their effector function. However, upregulation of Foxp3 by HF was neither necessary nor sufficient to inhibit Th17 differentiation; retroviral expression of FOXP3 in T cells did not decrease IL-17 expression induced by TGF\u03b2 plus IL-6 (), though it markedly reduced IL-2 and IFN\u03b3 production in T cells cultured under non-polarizing conditions. Moreover, HF strongly repressed IL-17 expression in T cells lacking Foxp3 (). Therefore, the inhibitory effects of HF on Th17 differentiation are not exerted indirectly through the upregulation of Foxp3. Rather, HF impairs the maintenance of STAT3 phosphorylation in developing Th17 cells, resulting in a reciprocal increase in iTreg cell development.","The 12-hour lag period between the addition of HF to T cell cultures and the ensuing effect on STAT3 phosphorylation strongly suggested an indirect effect. To identify more proximal cellular effects of HF treatment, we used DNA microarrays to define the transcriptional profiles of HF- and MAZ 1310-treated T cells activated in Th17-priming conditions for 3 or 6 hours. Eighty-one annotated genes that were differentially expressed at both time points in HF-versus MAZ1310-treated cells were identified, the majority of which were upregulated following HF treatment (, ). Among the HF-inducible transcripts, a large number of genes functionally associated with amino acid synthesis and transport, as well as protein synthesis, were observed (, ). Similar gene expression profiles have been observed during cellular responses to amino acid starvation (Fafournoux et al., 351:1, 2000; Peng et al., 22:5575, 2002). Insufficient cellular levels of amino acids lead to the accumulation of uncharged tRNAs that, in turn, activate the amino acid response (AAR) pathway via the protein kinase GCN2. Activated GCN2 phosphorylates and inhibits eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2A (eIF2\u03b1), thereby reducing overall protein translation, while specifically enhancing translation of the transcription factor ATF4 (Harding et al., 11:619, 2003; Harding et al., 6:1099, 2000). Indeed, a number of stress-induced genes reportedly regulated by ATF4 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (Harding et al., 11:619, 2003) were over-represented among the genes induced by HF treatment in T cells (, ). These analyses suggest that at least a portion of the transcriptional response to HF is mediated by ATF4. Furthermore, quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) experiments confirmed that at least three known AAR-associated genes (Asns, Gpt2, eIF4Ebp1) were induced by HF treatment within 4 hours of T cell activation ().","To directly address whether HF activates the AAR pathway, eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation and ATF4 protein levels in HF-treated T cells was examined. HF induced detectable eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation at 2.5 nM, and this effect plateaued at 5-10 nM HF (). ATF4 expression levels were highest in T cells treated with 5-10 nM HF and were reduced in cells treated with higher concentrations of HF (20-40 nM) (), demonstrating a positive correlation between the concentrations of HF that induce ATF4 expression and those that selectively inhibit Th17 differentiation (). In kinetic analyses, eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation in HF-treated cells reached maximum levels by 2 hours and ATF4 protein continued to accumulate until 4 hours (), indicating that HF activates the AAR pathway before any detectable effects on STAT3 phosphorylation or IL-17 production are observed. AAR activation was a general consequence of HF treatment; HF induced eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, not only in T cells activated in Th17-priming conditions, but also in resting na\u00efve T cells and T cells activated in ThN, Th1, Th2, and iTreg polarizing conditions (). HF treatment also increased eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation in cultured fibroblasts () and microarray analyses of fibroblasts revealed that HF induced a pattern of early gene induction similar to that seen in T cells. These data demonstrate that activation of the AAR pathway by HF is not a cell type-specific effect. HF treatment induced ATF4 expression in all differentiated T cells, but not in na\u00efve T cells (). This result most likely reflects the low metabolic rate and relatively inefficient translation capacity of na\u00efve T cells (Rathmell et al., 33:2223, 2003). Thus, the rapid activation of the AAR pathway by HF could underlie both its selective inhibition of Th17 differentiation and its effects on fibroblasts (Pines and Nagler, 30:445, 1998).","A variety of other cellular stresses (ER stress, oxidative stress, viral infection) also result in eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation and ATF4 translation, a phenomenon termed the integrated stress response (ISR) (Harding et al., 11:619, 2003; Harding et al., 6:1099, 2000). Individual stressors, however, can also activate stress type-specific pathways. For instance, the unfolded protein response (UPR), which is activated by ER stress, results in expression of the transcription factor Xbp-1 through a mechanism involving IRE-1-dependent splicing, as well as nuclear translocation of the ER-sequestered transcription factor ATF6 in addition to eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation catalyzed by the protein kinase Perk (Ron and Walter, 8:519, 2007; Brunsing et al., 283, 17954, 2008; Lin et al., 318:944, 2007). Xbp-1 and ATF6, in turn, upregulate ER chaperones such as GRP78\/BiP and calreticulin, whose expression is specific to the UPR and independent of the eIF2\u03b1\/ATF4 ISR pathway (Ron and Walter, 8:519, 2007; Lee et al., 23: 7448, 2003). However, HF did not induce the expression of these and other hallmark ER stress response genes.","To delineate the stress response pathway activated by HF, the effects of amino acid starvation with those of tunicamycin (an inducer of ER stress) or HF treatment during T cell activation were compared. As expected, cells deprived of cysteine (Cys) and methionine (Met) displayed eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, ATF4 expression, and upregulation of AAR-associated genes but did not induce Xbp-1 splicing (, , B). In contrast, tunicamycin treatment induced eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation and ATF4 expression together with Xbp-1 splicing (), as characteristic of the UPR. The effects of HF treatment closely resembled those of amino acid starvation, inducing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation without promoting Xbp-1 splicing (). Taken together, these data indicate that HF specifically induces an AAR.","Next, the effects of amino acid starvation on Th17 differentiation and STAT3 activation were investigated. It was discovered that the functional consequences of Cys\/Met-deprivation were remarkably similar to those of HF treatment in T cells. Cys\/Met deprivation profoundly and selectively impaired Th17 differentiation in a manner directly related to the concentration of these amino acids in the culture medium. T cells cultured under limiting Cys\/Met concentrations showed greatly diminished Th17 differentiation but upregulated CD25 expression and differentiated into Th1, Th2, and iTreg subsets as effectively as T cells cultured in complete medium (, ). As shown for HF (), inhibition of IL-17 expression by amino acid starvation was unrelated to cell survival or proliferation (). Further similar to the effects of HF, Cys\/Met-deprivation did not affect the early phase of STAT3 phosphorylation but impaired the maintenance of STAT3 phosphorylation (, D). Moreover, L-tryptophanol, a tryptophan derivative that competitively inhibits tryptophanyl-tRNA loading, or limiting concentrations of a different amino acid, leucine, also impaired IL-17 production (), suggesting that inhibition of Th17 differentiation is a general consequence of amino acid starvation. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway represents a second, complementary mechanism through which cells respond to amino acid availability (Fingar and Blenis, 23:3151, 2004). However, early transcriptional responses induced by HF and the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin are distinct (Peng et al., 22:5575, 2002 and ), and HF did not inhibit signaling downstream of mTOR in fibroblasts.","To test whether inhibition of IL-17 expression was specific to stress induced by amino acid starvation, the influence of tunicamycin on T cell activation and differentiation was tested. Surprisingly, low concentrations of tunicamycin had little influence on IL-17 expression in T cells (, ) but instead preferentially impaired Th1 and Th2 differentiation (, ). These data suggest that individual stress response pathways can regulate distinct aspects of T cell differentiation and effector function but also indicate that eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation and ATF4 translation (shared consequences of both AAR and UPR) are not sufficient to explain the selective regulation of Th17 differentiation by HF or amino acid deprivation. The impact of cellular stress on the immune system is complex. Data herein show here that Th17 differentiation is particularly susceptible to stress induced by amino acid deprivation, whereas ER stress blunts Th1 and Th2 differentiation. In addition to these effects on T cell effector function, eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation induced during ER stress may have cytoprotective effects in oligodendrocytes and pancreatic \u03b2 cells during acute inflammation associated with autoimmune encephalomyelitis and diabetes (Puccetti and Grohmann, 7:817, 2007; Lin et al., 117:448, 2007). Diverse cellular responses to stress may regulate both T cell function and the downstream cellular targets of inflammatory cytokine signaling during tissue inflammation.","The distinctive sensitivity of Th17 cells to AAR pathway activation may have a role during adaptive immune responses in vivo. For example, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), an IFN\u03b3-induced enzyme that breaks down tryptophan, has been shown to cause local depletion of tryptophan at sites of inflammation and activate the AAR pathway in resident T cells (Puccetti and Grohmann, 7:817, 2007; Munn et al., 22:633, 2005). While local IDO accumulation is most often associated with proliferative impairment in T cells, expansion or conversion of Foxp3+ T cells also has been reported following upregulation of IDO (Puccetti and Grohmann, 7:817, 2007; Park et al., 10:R11, 2008). Given the reciprocal relationship between the development of pro-inflammatory Th17 cells and tissue protective iTreg cells, it is postulated that IDO-mediated immune tolerance involves local AAR mediated inhibition of Th17 differentiation and consequent skewing of the Th17: iTreg balance in favor of iTreg cells (Romani et al., 180:5157, 2008).","Materials and Methods","Mice","Mice were housed in specific pathogen-free barrier facilities and were used in accordance with protocols approved by the animal care and use committees of the Immune Disease Institute and Harvard Medical School. Wild-type C57B\/6 mice were purchased from Jackson laboratories (Bar Harbor, Me.) and were used for all in vitro culture experiments unless otherwise noted. ROSA26-YFPfl\/fl (Srinivas et al., 1:4, 2001) and ROSA26-STAT3C-GFPfl\/fl (Mesaros et al., 7:236, 2008) mice have been described. Dr. Alexander Rudensky provided lymphoid organs from Foxp3gfp and Foxp3ko mice (Gavin et al., 445:771, 2007).","Cell Isolation","Primary murine T and B cells were purified by cell sorting. CD4 CD25 T cells were positively selected using CD4 dynabeads and detachabeads (Dynal, Oslo, Norway) per manufacturers instructions followed by nTreg depletion using a CD25 microbead kit (Miltenyi biotech, Auburn, Calif.). Na\u00efve (CD4 CD62Lhi CD44lo Foxp3gfp- or CD4 CD62Lhi CD44lo CD25) T cells were purified from Foxp3gfp or Foxp3ko mice, respectively, by FACS sorting. CD8 T cells or B cells were isolated from CD4 fractions using CD8 negative isolation kit (Dynal) or CD43 negative isolation kit (Miltenyi biotech), respectively. Resting human CD4 T cells were isolated from PBMC of healthy human donors using Dynal CD4 Positive Isolation Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) as previously described (Sundrud et al., 106:3440, 2005). CD4 cells were further purified to obtain memory T cells by staining with PE-conjugated anti-human CD45RO-PE antibodies (BD Biosciences), and sorting on a FACSAria cytometer (BD Biosciences). Following purification, cells were greater than 99% CD4 CD45RO. CD14 monocytes were isolated from autologous PBMC by MACS sorting using a magnetic separator (AutoMACS, Miltenyi Biotech) and were more then 99% pure following isolation.","Cytokines, Antibodies and Cell Culture","Purified CD4 CD25 T cells were activated in vitro as previously described (Djuretic et al., Nat.

Th1 and Th2 differentiation was performed as previously described (Djuretic et al., 8:145, 2007). Human IL-2 supernatant (National Cancer Institute) was used in culture at 0.01 U\/ml and was added at 48 hours-post activation when T cells were split into tissue culture wells lacking CD3 and CD28 antibodies, with the exception of Th17 cultures that were maintained in the absence of exogenous IL-2. CD8 T cells were activated with 1 \u03bcg\/ml anti-CD3 and 1 \u03bcg\/ml anti-CD28 and were expanded in 0.1 U\/ml IL-2 until day 6 post activation. CD43-depleted B cells were activated in vitro by culturing with 25 \u03bcg\/ml LPS (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) for 3-4 days in the presence or absence of TGF\u03b2. All reagents (see below) were added at the time of T cell activation and again at 48 hours post activation unless indicated otherwise. For some experiments, purified CD4 CD25 T cells, CD8 T cells or B cells were labeled with 1 \u03bcM CFSE (Invitrogen) prior to activation in accordance with manufacturer's instructions. Human T cell activation was performed by plating purified monocytes in a 96-well flat bottom plate at a concentration of 2\u00d710cells per well in complete medium overnight. 10purified human memory T cells were added to monocyte cultures in the presence of soluble anti-CD3\/anti-CD28 beads (Dynabeads, Invitrogen). T cells were expanded in the presence HF or 9 (MAZ1310) for up to 6 days.","Inhibitors and Amino Acid Starvation","1 kg of 10% pure HF was received as a gift from Hangpoon Chemical Co. (Seoul, Korea), which was further purified via HPLC to >99% purity and used for experiments. Compound 9 (MAZ1310, Kamberov, Ph. D. Dissertation, Harvard University, 2008) was generated by chemical derivatization of halofuginone and was used at equal concentrations as a negative control. HF and 9 were prepared as 100 mM stock solutions in DMSO and diluted to the indicated concentrations. SB-431542 (Inman et al., 62:65, 2002) (Tocris Bioscience, Ellisville, Mo.) was prepared as a 10 mM stock solution in DMSO and was used in culture at 10 \u03bcM. L-tryptophanol was prepared as a 20 mM stock solution in 0.1 M NaOH, pH 7.4 and was used at 0.2 mM. For amino acid starvation experiments, T cells were activated and differentiated as above in D-MEM medium without L-cysteine and L-methionine (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.), or D-MEM medium without L-leucine. Stocks containing 20 mM L-cysteine (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) plus 10 mM L-methionine (Sigma), or 400 mM L-leucine (Sigma) were prepared in ddH2O, pH 1.0 and were added to medium at the indicated concentrations.","Tat-Cre Transduction","6\u00d7His-TAT-NLS-Cre (HTNC\u2014herein called TAT-Cre) was prepared as previously described (Peitz et al., 99:4489, 2002). Purified T cells where rested in complete medium for 30 minutes, washed 3 times in ADCF-Mab serum free medium (Hyclone, Logan, Utah) and resuspended in pre-warmed serum free medium supplemented with 50 \u03bcg\/ml of TATCre. Following a 45 minute incubation at 37\u00b0 C., transduction was stopped using media containing 10% FCS and T cells were rested for 4-6 hours in complete medium prior to activation.","Retroviral Transduction","MIG and MIG.ROR\u03b3t retroviral cDNA were gifts from Dr. Dan Littman. pRV and pRV.FOXP3 retroviral constructs have been described previously (Wu et al., 126:375, 2006). Retroviral particles were generated using the phoenix-Eco system (ATCC). Supernatants were concentrated by centrifugation and stored at \u221280\u00b0 C. prior to use in culture. Thawed retroviral supernatants were added to T cell cultures 12 hours after T cell activation in the presence of 8 \u03bcg\/ml polybrene (American Bioanalytical, Natick, Mass.) and centrifuged for 1 hour at room temperature to enhance infections.","Detection of Cytokine Production","Cytokines secreted into media supernatant were measured using the mouse Th1\/Th2 cytometric bead array (CBA\u2014BD Pharmingen) in accordance with manufacturers instructions. Briefly, CD4+ CD25\u2212 T cells were activated in anti-CD3\/anti-CD28-coated tissue culture wells (see above) and supernatants were collected at the indicated times.","For detection of intracellular cytokines in murine cells, cultured T or B cells were stimulated with 10 nM PMA (Sigma) and 1 mM ionomycin (Sigma) for 4-5 hours in the presence of 10 mM brefeldin A (Sigma).

Cells were then washed with PBS, permeabilized with PBS supplemented with 1% BSA and 0.5% saponin (Sigma) at room temperature for 10 minutes before cytokine-specific antibodies were added and incubated with cells for an additional 20 minutes at room temperature. Human T cells were restimulated with PMA (20 ng\/ml) (Sigma) and Ionomycin (500 ng\/ml) (Sigma) for 6 hours in the presence of golgi plug (BD Biosciences) and intracellular staining was performed using cytofix\/cytoperm kit (BD Biosciences) per manufacturers instructions. All stained cells were stored at 4\u00b0 C. in PBS plus 1% paraformaldehyde prior to FACS analyses.","FACS Analyses and Sorting","All cell surface staining was performed in FACS buffer (PBS\/2% FBS\/0.1% NaN) and antibodies were incubated with cells on ice for 20-30 minutes.

The first model used is referred to as adjuvant-driven EAE and is actively induced by immunization of wild-type mice with the immunodominant myelin-derived peptide antigen MOGemulsified in Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA). The second model, a passive model of EAE induction, is initiated by the transfer of myelin proteolipid protein (PLP)-reactive T cells into lymphopenic hosts.","Adjuvant-driven EAE was induced in 8 week-old wild-type B6 mice purchased from Charles River laboratories (Kingston, N.Y.) by subcutaneous injection of MOGpeptide emulsified in Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant (IFA) plus 5 mg\/ml heat-killed (BD Biosciences) in both dorsal flanks as described in Veldhoen et al. (7(11):1151-1156, 2006).","Passive EAE was induced by intravenous transfer of purified CD3 splenic T cells isolated from PLP TCR transgenic B10.S mice into syngeneic RAG2-deficient mice (3\u00d710cells\/mouse) (Waldner et al., 113(7):990-997, 2004).","Mice were injected daily with HF (2 \u03bcg\/mouse) or vehicle control (DMSO) i.p. Clinical signs of EAE were assessed according to the following score: 0, no signs of disease; 1, flaccid tail; 2, weak gait\/hind limb paresis; 3, hind limb paralysis; 4, tetraplegia; 5, moribund. Cytokine production during EAE was determined either in peripheral T cells isolated from spleen or lymph nodes of mice prior to disease onset (day 6-10) or in mononuclear cells isolated from the brain and spinal cords of mice with severe disease (clinical score \u22672) between days 15-20. Briefly, splenocytes were stained for intracellular cytokines following erythrocyte lysis with ammonium chloride buffer. T cells were isolated from brain and spinal cords of mice with active EAE following perfusion with cold PBS. Minced CNS tissue was digested with liberase C1 (0.33 mg\/ml, Roche Diagnostics) or collagenase D (10 mg\/ml, Roche Diagnostics) at 37\u00b0 C. for 30-45 minutes. Cell suspensions were passed through 70 \u03bcm cell strainers (VWR) and fractionated by 70%\/30% Percoll gradient centrifugation. Mononuclear cells were collected from the interphase, washed, and used for intracellular cytokine analysis.","The adjuvant-driven EAE model is associated with infiltration of both IL-17- and IFN\u03b3-expressing CD4 T cells into the CNS (). Low-dose HF treatment (2 \u03bcg HF daily, \u02dc0.1 mg\/kg) significantly reduced both the severity of adjuvant-driven EAE disease and frequency of disease onset (). The second, passive model of EAE induction leads to a predominant Th1 response, rather than Th17 response, within CNS infiltrates (). In marked contrast to the adjuvant-driven EAE model, HF-treated mice in the passive EAE model developed disease symptoms with kinetics and severity similar to control treated animals (). The contrasting effects of HF in these two models of EAE support the notion that HF selectively inhibits IL-17-associated inflammatory T cell function without inducing general T cell hyporesponsiveness. Taken together, these data suggest that HF can modulate autoimmune inflammation associated with Th17, but not Th1, responses.","HF-mediated protection from adjuvant-driven EAE was accompanied by a reduction in T cell-derived IL-17-expression, both in peripheral lymph nodes prior to disease onset and in CNS tissue during active disease (), as well as an overall reduction in CD4 T cell infiltrates into the CNS (). Consistent with in vitro results, HF impaired IL-17 production but did not affect IFN\u03b3 expression in the same T cell populations. Moreover, splenocytes isolated ex vivo from HF-injected mice displayed increased eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation and expression of AAR-associated transcripts (). Thus, systemic administration of low doses of HF activates the AAR, leading to a selective impairment of Th17 differentiation, and concomitant blunting of IL-17 associated inflammatory responses in vivo.","Thus, consistent with in vitro data, it was discovered that HF protects mice from adjuvant-driven EAE through in vivo activation of the AAR. HF selectively reduced the number of IL-17 expressing T cells in vivo, but had no effect on the number of IFN\u03b3 T-cells. These data are consistent with reports showing that adjuvant-driven EAE disease is particularly sensitive to modulation of IL-17 expression. Notably, HF had no effect on an independent, passive model of EAE that develops in the absence of a Th17 response, demonstrating that HF is neither globally immunosuppressive nor generically protective against CNS inflammation. Both Th1 and Th17 cells can drive EAE pathogenesis when transferred into mice. In the adjuvant-driven EAE model described above, a roughly equal induction of Th1 and Th17 cells was observed, whereas in the passive model of EAE, encephalitogenic T cells were biased towards a Th1 response. Thus, the lack of an effect of HF in the passive model, in comparison to the adjuvant-driven EAE is likely due to the distinctive inflammatory T cell responses in the two models.","Two follow-on experiments were performed to further determine the therapeutic benefit of HF on EAE. In one, HF was injected into mice immunized to produce EAE as described above, with the exception that HF was not introduced into the animals until day 10 following immunization. These data demonstrate that HF controls autoimmune inflammation even after inflammatory pathogenesis is evident, providing a more accurate representation of autoimmune disease in humans. See . In the other experiment, HF was injected into mice immunized to produce EAE as described above, with the exception that HF injection was terminated at day 10 following immunization. These data as shown in  demonstrate that HF exerts a protective effect that extends well beyond the time of treatment, consistent with its proposed role in preventing the differentiation of pro-inflammatory Th17 cells. Therefore, HF has been shown to have a therapeutic benefit in EAE after the onset of symptoms as well as to prevent the development of the symptoms of EAE.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0765","num":"0891"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00200","num":"00200"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00200","he":"21.59mm","wi":"65.79mm","file":"US09284297-20160315-C00200.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"Di-tert-butyldicarbonate (982 mg) in 10 mL DMF was added to a solution of 1.5 g halofuginone hydrobromide and 1.3 mL diisopropylethylamine in 100 mL.
