An image processing system can convert pixel values of an image into an ink output value for a printer. The ink output values comprise the raw values used by the printer as a command corresponding to the quantity of ink droplets to eject at a given point on the recording medium. Ideally, the printer will output a quantity of ink in the area on the recording medium corresponding to the pixel such that that area appears to an observer to have the color, tone, tint, shade, and optical density of the pixel in the image.","A given pixel value can correspond to multiple ink output values. For example, a pixel of a given color, tone, tint, shade, and optical density can be reproduced by the printer using a combination of multiple colors of ink. A typical ink-jet printer uses black, cyan, magenta, and yellow, although other and\/or additional colors can be used. Accordingly, to reproduce a given pixel, the printer can output some portion of one or more of the ink colors available.","A transfer function can be used to by the image processing system to convert the pixel value to the corresponding ink output values for each ink nozzle (e.g., each different color) on the printer. In some examples, the transfer function can take the form of a look up table (LUT) relating pixel values to the ink output values.","Disclosed in one example is a method for printing on transparent medium using an ink-jet printer, the method including providing a grayscale image having a plurality of pixels, each pixel having a pixel value corresponding to a brightness of the pixel; converting each pixel value to an ink output value for the ink-jet printer using a conversion function, wherein the conversion function maps the darkest pixel value to an optical density of greater than 2.5 and maps all other pixel values to an appropriate output pixel value such that a resulting printed image is perceived to be linearly bright across the image.","Disclosed in another example is a system for printing with high density on a transparent medium, the system including an ink-jet printer including a plurality of nozzles; and an image processing module configured to convert pixel values of an image to a first ink output value corresponding to a black ink nozzle for the ink-jet printer, wherein converting includes mapping the darkest pixel value to an optical density of greater than 2.5 and wherein the conversion results in a perceived linear brightness of the printed image.","Disclosed in another example is a method of printing a high density image on a transparent medium using a first function that calculates an expected optical density as a function of pixel value, calculating a plurality of expected optical densities over a plurality of pixel values, the first function representing a substantially linear relationship between pixel value and optical density as substantially perceived by a human eye; measuring a plurality of optical densities of a test image printed on an inkjet printer, each optical density being associated with a pixel value; interpolating a second function that describes the relationship between pixel value and optical density based on the measured plurality of optical densities; based on the first and second functions, calculating a transfer function that maps input pixels to output pixels such that the maximum input pixel value produces an optical density on the transparent medium of at least 2.5.","Disclosed in another example is a method and a machine readable medium that stores instructions which when performed by a machine, causes the machine to perform operations of converting input pixel values into output ink values using a lookup table, wherein the lookup table is input pixel value 255, black output value about 251, cyan magenta and yellow output value about 102; input pixel value 242, black output value about 234, cyan magenta and yellow output value about 84; input pixel value 230, black output value about 220, cyan magenta and yellow output value about 72; input pixel value 217, black output value about 206, cyan magenta and yellow output value about 64; input pixel value 204, black output value about 193, cyan magenta and yellow output value about 57; input pixel value 191, black output value about 181, cyan magenta and yellow output value about 51; input pixel value 179, black output value about 170, cyan magenta and yellow output value about 45; input pixel value 166, black output value about 159, cyan magenta and yellow output value about 41; input pixel value 153, black output value about 148, cyan magenta and yellow output value about 36; input pixel value 140, black output value about 137, cyan magenta and yellow output value about 32; input pixel value 128, black output value about 127, cyan magenta and yellow output value about 29; input pixel value 115, black output value about 117, cyan magenta and yellow output value about 25; input pixel value 102, black output value about 106, cyan magenta and yellow output value about 22; input pixel value 89, black output value about 96, cyan magenta and yellow output value about 19; input pixel value 77, black output value about 85, cyan magenta and yellow output value about 16; input pixel value 64, black output value about 74, cyan magenta and yellow output value about 13; input pixel value 51, black output value about 62, cyan magenta and yellow output value about 10; input pixel value 38, black output value about 50, cyan magenta and yellow output value about 7; input pixel value 26, black output value about 36, cyan magenta and yellow output value about 5; input pixel value 13, black output value about 20, cyan magenta and yellow output value about 3; and input pixel value 0, black output value about 0, cyan magenta and yellow output value about 0.","These examples can be combined in any permutation or combination.

The detailed description is included to provide further information about the present patent application.","Disclosed is a system and method for printing high quality images on a transparent medium.

In some examples, the image processing module  can be physically integral with the printer . In other examples, the image processing module can be implemented by another computing device (e.g., a general purpose computer) that is communicatively coupled to the printer . In yet other examples, the image processing module  can be partially implemented on another computing device and partially implemented on the printer . In any case, however, the image processing module can be communicatively coupled to the printer  through data interface  such that the ink output values from the image processing module  can be used by the printer  to command the nozzles to output a given quantity of ink at a given location. The data interface can be any method known to those skilled in the art including, but not limited to, a physical cable (e.g., a universal serial bus (USB) cable, serial cable, parallel or LPT cable) and a wireless medium (e.g., a Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or cellular protocol).","Attached to or in proximity to the ink-jet printer  may be a mechanism  for supporting and making available media  to the ink-jet printer .

In some embodiments, the densitometer  may be positioned at a distance from the printer . In other embodiments, the densitometer  may be incorporated into the printer  or, in some location in between. The densitometry data  may be transmitted to the Image Processing module  using a variety of known methods, such as, for example, standard or proprietary wired interfaces, or wireless connections, physical portable data devices such as CD, flash memory, manual input and the like. Additionally, the densitometry data  may optionally be transmitted through, for example, a local network, or optionally through one or more wide area networks and the like.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","136","104","136","136","136","134","104"]},"The recording medium  may comprise an ink-jet recording medium (e.g., a film). An ink-jet recording medium may comprise at least one image-receiving layer, which receives the ink  from the ink-jet printer  during printing. The recording medium  may also comprise a substrate or support, which may be opaque or transparent. An opaque support is used in films that may be viewed using light reflected by a reflective backing, while a transparent support is used in films that may be viewed using light transmitted through the film. In some examples, the recording medium  can be the one described in provisionally filed Patent Application Ser. No. 61\/363,359 (the '359 application), entitled \u201cTRANSPARENT INK-JET RECORDING FILM\u201d, filed on Jul. 12, 2010 by Sharon Mary Simpson, John Szafraniec, and James B. Philip, and assigned to CARESTREAM HEALTH, INC. The '359 application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The image processing module  can prepare an image for printing, for example, by resizing the image (either larger or smaller). A resized image will have a different number of pixels than the original. If larger, more than 1 pixel in the resized image may represent a single initial pixel. If smaller, one pixel in the resized image may represent multiple pixels in the original image.","The image may then go though Color Separation  to be converted to a series of color separation images representing the different inks available such that the combination would closely replicate the color and\/or tone scale of the image. The choice and ratio of inks  used to closely replicate the desired color and tone of the image may comprise the use of an interaction model  to describe the interactions between the one or more ink(s)  and the recording medium . As ink formulations vary by manufacturer, and each recording medium also varies by type and manufacturer, how an ink will look on a particular recording medium will vary. The interaction model  attempts to compensate for the differing media and ink formulations to produce a consistent image. Additionally the transfer function  may comprise the output response of the ink-jet printer  to different input pixel values. The transfer function  converts pixel intensities into ink densities. That is, the transfer function  maps the desired colors into an amount of ink of each color to place on the recording medium .","The image may then be converted to a half-tone image in order to achieve the dynamic range (light to dark) desired, Half-toning  is a technique that simulates continuous tone imagery through the use of dots, varying either in size, in shape, or in spacing and involves converting each image pixel to a pattern of ink droplets. Separate CMYK color dots are laid down in a close pattern such that from a normal viewing distance, it appears to be a continuous shade. The pattern of the ink droplets may be such that the combined droplets can closely reproduce the different colors and tonal levels desired. The pattern for the drops may be chosen based on the drop size of the particular printer and the drops per inch (dpi) desired.","This data may then be sent to the ink-jet printer , which may proceed to eject as specified ink-droplets from a nozzle towards media  comprising a recording film, element, or medium to produce an output image . Additional image processing algorithms, which are known in the art, may optionally be applied throughout the image processing .","Those skilled in the art will recognize that the equivalent of such image processing module  can be constructed in many different combinations of software and hardware. Because image manipulation algorithms and systems are well known, the present description will be directed in particular to algorithms and systems forming part of, or cooperating more directly with, the method in accordance with the present invention. Other aspects of such algorithms and systems, and hardware and\/or software for producing and otherwise processing the image signals involved therewith, not specifically shown or described herein may be selected from such systems, algorithms, components and elements known in the art.","Based on the type of recording medium and inks used, image quality is dependent on both the interaction model  and the transfer function  to produce the desired output. What constitutes an acceptable image quality varies from application to application. In some examples, the output image is to be used in medical applications. In some examples, this medical imagery will be used by radiologists or other medical professionals in lieu of a traditional photographic x-ray. In these examples, images produced on the recording medium  will be viewed the same way traditional film-based x-rays are viewed\u2014by the use of back-lighting. In these examples, two factors are important: image quality, and in particular the absence of graininess, and optical density.","Optical density (OD) is the visually perceivable and measurable absorption of light on the surface of a medium due to the presence of a colorant. Optical density is important because a particular density of black is required for decent viewing through a backlight. If the density is not high enough, the image may appear gray and will be generally unacceptable. Optical density is a function of both the amount of ink laid down by the printer, as well as the particular combination of colors laid down. Thus for example, an inkjet printer does not strictly use black ink to produce a black tone, it uses additional CMY (cyan, magenta, yellow) colors as well. So to produce a black with a desired optical density, a combination of different colors can be used. For x-rays, the maximum density should be between approximately 2.0 and approximately 4.0 to be effectively viewed. Additionally, the density should be perceived to be linear. That is if the input pixel value is 0, then the density should appear to be 0 and if the input pixel value is 128, then the density of the printed image should appear to be \u00bd the maximum density (assuming pixel value goes from 0 . . . 255), and so on. If the density is not linear, detail in the image is lost.","Graininess is the property of a printed image not appearing continuously smooth, or of appearing composed of grains. Graininess is the result of the printer not printing enough drops of ink per inch. Graininess and optical density are related in that a given color of ink or combination of colors may give a desired optical density but be too grainy. The optimum combination of ink to produce a desired optical density at a desired tone or shade also uses enough ink to lay down enough dots to make the image look continuous and not grainy. Graininess is caused by the printer not laying down enough ink.","As mentioned before, it is desired to have the density to be linearly perceived. This is not as easy as it may sound as the relationship between the amounts of the one or more inks  deposited on the recording medium  and optical density on the recording medium  is not linear and may not be the same between different ink(s)  and different media . The present disclosure, in one example, is a system and method for determining the amount of one or more inks to apply to a recording medium in order to generate a linear scale in perceived optical density between a minimum density (Dmin) and a maximum density (Dmax), where Dmax is sufficiently high. Such a method is useful to reproduce an accurate image on a given recording medium  with one or more inks.","Relationship Between Optical Density and Pixel Value","Optical density (OD) is related to transmittance according to the following equation:\n\nOD=\u2212\u03b3\u00b7Log.\n","Where T is the transmittance which is defined as the fraction of incident light at a specified wavelength that passes through a sample. Gamma, or \u03b3, is used to quantify contrast and can be added to the standard OD formula as another parameter to increase equation fit with observed data. While the equation above uses transmittance T, a grayscale input image to the printer's transfer function utilizes values of between 0-255 representing the image brightness\/darkness at a particular unit of the picture, called a pixel. In an example, for 256 bit levels (0-255) transmittance T can be expressed in terms of Pixel Value (or Bit Value) as shown in the following equation:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mi":"T","mo":"=","mfrac":{"mrow":{"mn":"255","mo":"-","mi":"PixelValue"},"mn":"255"}}}}},"In this example, transmittance is 1 (transparent) for a Pixel Value of 0, and transmittance is 0 (opaque) for a PixelValue of 255. A direct substitution of T into the Optical Density Equation would result in an Optical Density of 0 for a Pixel Value of 0 according to the following statement:\n\nPixelValue=01\n\n1OD=0\n","However, as mentioned above, the transmittance properties of most recording mediums include some minimum density (Dmin).

The perceived brightness is brightness as perceived by an average human eye. This is because the human eye is better adapted at discerning differences in intensity between two bright shades rather than two dark shades. For the ideal medical image the image must look linear when viewed from the light box using a human eye. Therefore, what is desired is a linear perceived brightness, which requires greater increases in OD as the pixel value increases.

equations are used to determine theoretical optical density from a given input pixel value based on a desired or observed maximum and minimum optical density that is specific to a given device and media and based on a desired gamma curve. The goal of a proper transfer function is to match this function as closely as possible. Therefore, this function is the benchmark for determining a good transfer function. One need only to compare the measured optical density created by their transfer function to the theoretical equations above to determine how closely the transfer function performs.","Determining the Appropriate Transfer Function","The theoretical relationship between input pixel values and optical density have been explored. Given a theoretical optical density for any given input pixel value, what is needed now is to map that to an output ink quantity. A transfer function does just this by mapping input pixel values to output ink values. Since each printer and media is different, this transfer function will partly be based upon measured observations.","In one example, to accomplish this, a 21 step calibration wedge is printed by passing to the printer the input pixel values as output ink values without modification. This wedge is then measured using a densitometer to determine the OD of the various printed pixel values. Based on these data points, a relationship function between input pixel values and the output optical density can be determined by interpolation or other known mathematical means.","In one example, the printer used includes an Epson Styles Pro 4900 and the transfer function includes an identity LUT created using a RIP (e.g., Wasach, Epson's SDK Halftone). In an example the actual optical densities for the black (K) and the combination of the cyan, magenta, and yellow inks is determined based on the following functions as determined by observation of the 21 step wedge using a densitometer, working backwards to arrive at the functions:\n\nOD=0.0000243*PixelValue+0.002092*PixelValue+0.170\n\n0<PixelValue<255\u2003\u2003Equation 4:\n\nOD=0.000022*PixelValue+0.00426*PixelValue\n\n0<PixelValue<102\u2003\u2003Equation 5:\n","Additionally, the transfer function can be configured to generate the following minimum and maximum densities: @DPV=255, and @DPV=102, as determined by observation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0077"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"7"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"D","D","D","D","D","D"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"2.88",".17","2.22",".17",".66","0"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"These values are based on experimentally derived data.","In an example, the transfer function converts the pixel values such that the image on the transparent recording medium is perceived by an observer as linear when viewed from a back lit box: hence \u03b3=3.

A light detecting subsystem which can compromise a photosensitive element such as a photodiode, is positioned on the other side of the film and detects the portion of light passing through the output media.","In an example, an operator can initiate a quality check for the system  which might comprise causing the printer  to print one or more of test patches on a known value. These test patches can then be read by an internal densitometer  and the densitometry data  compared with expected optical density. This can comprise a portion of an acceptability method which comprises evaluating the how closely the printed medium reproduced the desired optical density.","In an example, the patches might be printed on the majority of the recording medium . In addition to allowing the evaluation of the individual recording medium  the accumulated data might be used to detect trends in the overall performance.","The ink-jet printer  might automatically print one or more test patches when a change is detected. These changes might comprise, among other things, wear within the ink-jet printer , information on the recording medium  type or batch, information regarding the inks , or environmental data. If the patch's densities are not acceptable there can be a variety of results comprising, among others, notification to the user that the print quality is unacceptable, notification of the need to recalibrate the system, and the like.","In an example, many ink-jet printers  will come with default models for transforming the data the resultant recording medium  will more closely resemble the desired color\/tint and tone if the model is tuned to the particular set of ink(s) , recording medium  and any additional information which might affect the output image including, but not limited to environmental data such as temperature and humidity. Applicants identified a process that could achieve the improved output described above;","In an example, the pixel values can correspond to a series of one or more patches of varying densities. After the pixel values have been printed, the one or more patches on the recording medium  can be read using a densitometer  (reflective or transmittance as appropriate for the recording medium  support.) The densitometry data  can then be conveyed to the image processing module . The method of transfer can include any of the following or combinations of the following: entering the data into the inkjet printer  through a simple user interface, transmitting to the image processing module  via either a proprietary or standardized wired or wireless system, transmitting via a local area network (LAN) or a wide area network (WAN.) It can be physically transferred to the printer through the use of a physical media which can comprise a CD, DVD or flash memory. The densitometry data  can then be used, in conjunction with information on the corresponding Pixel Values to develop an output model to that desired.","In an example, the densitometer  described above can be incorporated directly into the ink jet printer . This creates the opportunity to more rapidly or more frequently update the density data  and the resulting model(s) that can comprise the image processing.","In an example, the Pixel Values to print for the different patches can be stored in the ink-jet printer  rather than being input as pixel values.

Some examples can include a computer-readable medium or machine-readable medium encoded with instructions operable to configure an electronic device to perform methods as described in the above examples. An implementation of such methods can include code, such as microcode, assembly language code, a higher-level language code, or the like. Such code can include computer readable instructions for performing various methods. The code may form portions of computer program products. Further, in an example, the code can be tangibly stored on one or more volatile, non-transitory, or non-volatile tangible computer-readable media, such as during execution or at other times. Examples of these tangible computer-readable media can include, but are not limited to, hard disks, removable magnetic disks, removable optical disks (e.g., compact disks and digital video disks), magnetic cassettes, memory cards or sticks, random access memories (RAMs), read only memories (ROMs), and the like.","The above description is intended to be illustrative, and not restrictive.

The Abstract is provided to comply with 37 C.F.R. \u00a71.72(b), to allow the reader to quickly ascertain the nature of the technical disclosure. It is submitted with the understanding that it will not be used to interpret or limit the scope or meaning of the claims. Also, in the above Detailed Description, various features may be grouped together to streamline the disclosure. This should not be interpreted as intending that an unclaimed disclosed feature is essential to any claim. Rather, inventive subject matter may lie in less than all features of a particular disclosed embodiment. Thus, the following claims are hereby incorporated into the Detailed Description, with each claim standing on its own as a separate embodiment, and it is contemplated that such embodiments can be combined with each other in various combinations or permutations. The scope of the invention should be determined with reference to the appended claims, along with the full scope of equivalents to which such claims are entitled."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["In the drawings, which are not necessarily drawn to scale, like numerals may describe similar components in different views.
