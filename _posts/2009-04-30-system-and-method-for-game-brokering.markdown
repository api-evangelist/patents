No. 61\/049,325, entitled \u201cSYSTEM AND METHOD FOR GAME BROKERING,\u201d filed on Apr. 30, 2008, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.","1. Field of the Invention","The field pertinent to this disclosure relates generally to gaming, and more particularly to brokering games between game players and game providers.","2. Discussion of Related Art","People enjoy playing games and often regard the experience of winning by playing a game to be more valuable than that of the prize itself. Just the chance to win a prize provides considerable entertainment value. Conventional game organizers provide opportunities for such gaming entertainment by organizing and managing games for the game playing community. These game organizers often rely on their own skill, experience and interest to decide upon which games to broker, what the characteristics of the game should be and to which players the game may be of interest. Often, these game organizers draw upon their pre-existing social networks when organizing and managing these games. A particular and interesting example of a frequently brokered game is the fantasy league game.","A fantasy league game (also known as rotisserie, roto, or owner simulation) is a game where fantasy owners build a team that competes against other fantasy team owners based on the statistics generated by individual players or teams of a professional sport or people participating in a real world event. Probably the most common variant converts statistical performance into points that are compiled and totaled according to a roster selected by a team owner that makes up a fantasy team. These point systems are typically simple enough to be manually calculated by a game broker often called a \u201cleague commissioner.\u201d More complex variants use computer modeling of actual games based on statistical input generated by the real world event. In fantasy sports, for example, there is the ability to trade, cut, and resign players, like a real sports owner. Some of fantasy games require entry fees while others may be played without a fee.","Fantasy league games are an outgrowth of Rotisserie Baseball created by journalist, Daniel Okrent. Okrent, eager to test his invention, introduced the games to his friends and colleagues and in 1980 the first fantasy baseball league was created consisting of ten teams. By the late 1980s, the game had surpassed its cult status, and in 1989, The Sporting News estimated that nearly 500,000 people played. By the early 1990s, rotisserie baseball led to rotisserie football and basketball, which spawned a multitude of other fantasy games.","Today, fantasy sports have evolved to cover almost every sport genre: auto racing, baseball, basketball, bicycle racing, bowling, boxing, cricket, dog racing, fishing, football, golf, gymnastics, hockey, figure skating, volleyball, softball, horse racing, lacrosse, rugby, skiing, soccer, tennis, and even tug of war. These fantasy games are played nationally and internationally by millions of dedicated users. With the success of fantasy sports leagues, other types of fantasy leagues emerged. For example, Fantasy Moguls is like a fantasy baseball or football league, except instead of being the owner of a fantasy team that consists of real life athletes, participants are the head of a fantasy studio of real-life movies.","Although playing fantasy games is a popular activity, a great percentage of the worldwide populations do not play. This is true even after excluding underage persons, those with insufficient disposable income or technical wherewithal and those with a religious or other belief that prevents them from partaking in fantasy league play as recreation.","One aspect disclosed herein relates to a system for broking various games between game providers and game players. To ensure a variety of games are available to the players, the system may interface with several game providers and automatically configure sundry games to suit various, known player preferences. These player preferences may be gleamed from historical player information. Alternatively, the player preferences may be expressly gathered from the game players, such as through a voting process, either before or after the players have joined a game. Alternatively, the system may support manual game configuration by game organizers, who both enjoy and profit from their activities. The system may enable players to search and join a game so that each player may maximize the entertainment value of the game. The system may restrict access to various games and may allow players with specific qualifications to access the restricted games.","Another aspect disclosed herein manifests a discovery of the need to create a computer implemented method by which fantasy leagues can be easily and efficiently formed by like-minded people who are interested in a certain style of play, format of the league, prize payouts, league fee structure and the league rules. For example, according to one aspect consistent with principles of the present invention, it is appreciated that the general population has difficulty finding fantasy leagues having the characteristics they prefer because fantasy leagues requires either a large group of players to form a league (usually 10 to 20) and that group must agree on the style of play, format of the league, prize payouts, league fee structure and the league rules, or they must play in preformed, brokered leagues (with non-negotiable styles of play, format of the game, prize payouts, league fee structure and the league governing rules). Additionally, those players who are slotted into pre-formed (aka, public leagues) leagues have no choice with whom they compete against. As a result of these factors, most prospective fantasy league players find it either prohibitively difficult to form a fantasy league or to undesirable to join a pre-formed league.","Thus, one example consistent with the principles of the present invention provides a method by which a game brokerage system may facilitate the creation of, or automatically create, a league and, optionally, recruit like-minded, qualified players to join the league while maintaining appropriate safety checks on league governance, rules, entry fee collection, prize awarding and redemption. Another example provides for a system that may enable game fantasy leagues to be formed by fantasy league game organizers (a.k.a., fantasy league commissioners). Alternatively, players may form a league, decide on a particular configuration of rules and other options, and allow the game brokerage system to act as the league commissioner. Game play in the league may have a plurality of outcomes, at least, one of which is a winning outcome. An additional example provides for a method by which qualified league game organizers are able to list their leagues and then search and invite qualified players (a.k.a., qualified team owners) to join and then ultimately play in their league. Yet another example provides a method for serving as an escrow provider separate from being a provider of brokered games. Still another example enables advertisers and other parties to sponsor prizes and other rewards for game players.","In one aspect in accord with the present invention, a method for brokering a game using a computer system is provided. The computer system includes data storage and a processor coupled to the data storage. The method includes act of configuring, by the computer system, at least one of a plurality of games to match a set of preferences gathered from a plurality of players, specifying at least one qualification criterion for entry into the at least one of the plurality of games, entering, by the computer system, at least one player having the at least one qualification criterion into the at least one of the plurality of games, receiving, by the computer system, at least one winner of the at least one of the plurality of games, storing information regarding the at least one winner on the data storage, receiving, by the computer system, authorization to reward the at least one winner and providing, to the at least one winner, access to at least one reward.","In one embodiment, the act of configuring the at least one of the plurality of games may include an act of configuring a fantasy league game.
