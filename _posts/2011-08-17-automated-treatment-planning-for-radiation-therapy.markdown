No. 61\/374,485, filed Aug. 17, 2010, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.","This invention was made with government support under Grant Number CA 16672 awarded the National Institutes of Health. The United States Government has certain rights in the invention.","The present invention relates generally to developing treatment plans for use in external beam radiation therapy, and more particularly to a method, a system and a computer readable media that contains programming for the development of external beam radiation therapy treatment plans, for treating patients in need of radiation therapy.","Efforts to make radiotherapy treatment better, faster, and more cost effective have been underway since radiation was first used to treat cancer. The current radiation treatment workflow is mostly human based. First is a diagnostics\/staging step where patients go through imaging, biopsy, CT\/PET simulation and the staging of the cancer. A tumor definition and prescription is then outlined by a Radiation Oncologist, who draws the tumor contour based on imaging techniques such as CT\/PET\/MRI and gives the \u201cprescription\u201d dosages to a dosimetrist. The dosimetrist, or other such expert, then outlines the treatment planning which includes 1) drawing the contours of region of interests such as heart, cord, esophagus etc., (this can also be done by auto segmentation and graphical tools); 2) designing the beam directions and angles based on trial and error; 3) optimizing the beam intensities using objection function parameters based on trial and error; and 4) checking the plan with the radiation oncologist to determine if the plan is acceptable. If the plan is not accepted by the radiation oncologist, the radiation oncologist will ask the dosimetrist to modify the plan. The dosimetrist will then repeat the previous steps. Once the Radiation oncologist accepts the plan, the dosimetrist compiles all of the plan information and sends the plan to a delivery database and\/or clinical station. Physicists check, quality assure and approve the plan. The therapy may be divided into fractions, (one per day, 5 days per week, for example). A radiation therapist uses the final plan to deliver the treatment to the patient.","Although IMRT treatment planning methods have improved continuously over the years, IMRT treatment planning is still a complex process that depends strongly on the medical dosimetrist's experience (Schwarz 2009). For instance, the dosimetrist specifies beam directions based on past experience and trial-and-error, and then specifies objectives for dose distribution using single dose values, a few dose\u2014volume points, or fully flexible dose\u2014volume histograms (DVHs). Objectives may be weighted based on their importance. The planning system represents these objectives in a cost function, which must be maximized or minimized using an optimization algorithm. The cost function numerically attempts to represent the tradeoffs that are incorporated into clinical judgment. If the dosimetrist wants to change the outcome, he or she can iteratively alter the objectives and re-optimize. However, it is difficult to translate clinical requirements into a cost function and \u2018steer\u2019 the optimization toward the best result. As a result, IMRT planning can be a time-consuming and frustrating task, and the quality of treatment plans with similar target dose prescriptions and normal tissue constraints will vary between treatment dosimetrists and institutions (Schwarz 2009).","It is believed that the plan quality improvement is significant to improve the overall radiation therapy healthcare quality. Although IMRT can provide better outcomes for some cancers, the clinical benefits of this treatment can be compromised by sub-optimal treatment planning. In 2003, Forster, Smythe et al. 2003 reported that IMRT could provide a local control rate of greater than 80%, with acute toxicity below grade 3, in pleural mesothelioma, a largely fatal disease with an aggressive clinical course and a high mortality rate. This technology was immediately adopted by Mass General Hospital (MGH). Allen et al. (Allen, Czerminska et al. 2006) subsequently reported fatal (grade>=4) thoracic radiation penumonities (TRPs) in 6 of 13 patients receiving IMRT treatment. After much debate, (Komaki, Liao et al. 2006; Allen and Baldini 2007; Allen, Schofield et al. 2007; Rodrigues and Roa 2007; Veldeman, Madani et al. 2008) it was concluded that the high TRPs seen by Allen et al. may have been due to less strict treatment planning objectives. Importantly, Veldeman et al. (Veldeman, Madani et al. 2008) used a similar technique to that of MDACC (MD Anderson Cancer Center) and did not observe fatal TRPs. Veldeman et al. concluded that \u201cwe operate at the verge of what is clinically tolerable. Such an aggressive regimen should therefore only be delivered within strictly defined protocols, with rigorous quality control and potential candidates selected with extreme caution.\u201d From the above description, it can be speculated that the quality of IMRT planning varies from institution to institution, and only the best designed IMRT plans offer therapeutic advantages. It can also be speculated that if the AutoPlan system would be available to MGH at the time when they adopted the mesothelioma treatment technology, it would be possible that fatal radiation damage to patients could have been avoided.","With the IMRT technique available to more and more community setting hospitals, it is very hard to ensure the plan quality. There is a long learning curve for IMRT planners, demonstrated in quality comparisons between new and seasoned dosimetrists. This learning curve was confirmed (Chung, Lee et al. 2008) by a recent plan quality comparison study for same plans designed by National University Hospital, Singapore and University of California-San Francisco. After this study, Chung et. al. concluded that \u201cour IMRT plans were not able to fully maximize the potential dosimetric gains of IMRT over 3DCRT\u201d. Even for the big institution like MDACC, the learning cure for a new technology is also not very short. For example, the first case of mesothelioma case treated in MDACC took 8 weeks from simulation to treatment. After four years experiences on the planning constrains and beam angle selections, the treatment planning time was reduced to 1 week. It can be imagined that it is almost impossible to let community hospital to perform those complex treatments if they started from scratch. The AutoPlan system will be a vehicle to rapidly spread the newest treatment technologies to more radiation therapy facilities.","Embodiments of the invention presented here, including a method, system and computer readable medium designs a treatment plan in order to improve the quality and consistency of treatment planning. This method 1) automatically sets beam angles based on a beam angle automation (BAA) algorithm that is expert system based, and\/or 2) automatically adjusts the objectives of the objective function based on an objective function parameter automation (OFPA) algorithm. The treatment plan provides methods for delivering a prescribed radiation dose to a predefined target volume while attempting to avoid giving large dose to tissue and organs surrounding the target volume.","Embodiments of the present invention relate to a novel method to select beam-angles and objective-function parameters in order to create an optimized treatment plan. A goal is to set beam-angle and objective\/cost function parameters. The algorithm is executed in a reasonable time frame so that it can be used in routine clinical practice.

Additional features and advantages of the invention will be described hereinafter which form the subject of the claims of the invention. It should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the conception and specific embodiment disclosed may be readily utilized as a basis for modifying or designing other structures for carrying out the same purposes of the present invention. It should also be realized by those skilled in the art that such equivalent constructions do not depart from the spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. The novel features which are believed to be characteristic of the invention, both as to its organization and method of operation, together with further objects and advantages will be better understood from the following description when considered in connection with the accompanying figures. It is to be expressly understood, however, that each of the figures is provided for the purpose of illustration and description only and is not intended as a definition of the limits of the present invention.","\u201cTumor position\u201d or \u201ctumor location\u201d as used herein refers to the area of the body that the tumor is located in. Generally, the tumor position may relate to an organ area. More specifically, the tumor position may be given by an imaging contour. The tumor position may also be given by the relative coordinate between marked iso-center of a tumor and a planning target volume (PTV), or an integrated target volume (ITV).","\u201cBeam angles\u201d as used herein relates to the angles that the external beams are set within a tumor plan to converge on a tumor position. The beam angles may be coplanar or non-coplanar. Non-coplanar beam angles include both the angle of the beams and the angle of the couch that the patient is positioned on. For volumetric arc therapy, the beam angles refer to arc angles.","\u201cExpert system\u201d as used herein refers to a database that contains information of previously treated tumors. The expert system may contain information on the tumor position, the beam angles and intensities used to treat the tumor position, patient information, and treatment results, for example. The expert system is generated by saving patient treatment data into the database, thereby creating a large collection of patient treatment information. The expert system may be reviewed by one of skill in the art to remove entries in the database that contain inconsistencies, redundancies or other such information that the person of skill in the art deems unnecessary to the expert system. In an embodiment of the invention, the expert system is used to automatically select beam angles. In an embodiment of the invention, the expert system contains one entry, greater than five entries, greater than ten entries, greater than 20 entries, greater than 50 entries, greater than 100 entries, greater than 150 entries, or greater than 200 entries of beam angles. The expert system may contain beam angles for one location of tumor, such as lung tumors, or may contain beam angles for a plurality of tumor locations and types.","\u201cObjective function parameters\u201d as used herein refers to the designed goals of radiotherapy treatment which are defined and achieved by the selection of objective function parameters (OFPs). These OFPs may include dose levels (D0) and percent of volume exceeding\/under (Max DVH\/Min DVH type) these levels; maximum, or minimum doses; maximum or minimum equivalent uniform doses (EUD0) and the parameters specifying EUDs; and the parameters specifying relative importance of the various objectives. For example, for lung tumor treatment the objective function parameters may be EUD0=10 Gy, weight=100, a=1 with objective parameter type Max EUD, which may be specified as maximum EUD value with EUD parameter a=1 of lung which may not exceed EUD0(10 Gy) with importance weight=100 for lung.","\u201cObjective function value\u201d is a number or equation that represents an objective function parameter. For example, the objective function value may be calculated from EUD, dose based and dose volume based.","\u201cConstrained parameter\u201d refers to an objective function parameter that may not be modified.","\u201cUnconstrained parameter\u201d refers to an objective function parameter that may be modified.","\u201cEobj\u201d refers to a user adjustable objective function value used by the AutoPlan system to control the convergence of the objective function parameter optimization algorithm. Eobj=0.2 may be used for most non-constrained objectives. It was found that when an objective function value exceed Eobj=0.2 it may lead to the degradation of other objectives. In some embodiments of the invention, Eobj is about equal to 0.2. In embodiments of the invention, the Eobj is between 0.1 and 0.3, or 0.15 and 0.25.","\u201cRadiation dosage\u201d as used herein refers to the amount of radiation that is delivered to a patient. A radiation dosage may be given for multiple regions of interest, such as a prescribed radiation dosage to a tumor, or a max radiation dosage may be given for surrounding normal tissue.","\u201cRegion of interest\u201d as used herein refers to a specific region of interest within a patient. For example, the region of interest may refer to the tumor location, or the region of interest may refer to surrounding normal tissue and organs.","\u201cBeam intensities\u201d as used herein refers to the varying intensity maps from the beam angles to modulate the dose to the patient.","\u201cAutoPlan\u201d as used herein refers to the AutoPlan program, system and method that is described herein to generate radiation therapy treatment plans. AutoPlan may include both beam angle selection and\/or functional parameter optimization.","An \u201cautoplan treatment plan\u201d or \u201cautoplan\u201d as used herein refers to radiation therapy treatment plans that are developed using the AutoPlan program.","EUD as used herein refers to an equivalent uniform dose. EUD was designed to summarize and report nonhomogeneous dose distributions. Two doses are considered to be equivalent if they cause the same radiobiological effect, regardless of the actual structure of the dose itself.","\u201cAlpha\u201d as used herein refers to one of the parameters used to define the EUD. When alpha is equal to infinity, EUD is the maximal dose to the tissue area; when alpha is equal to negative infinity, EUD is the minimal dose; when alpha is equal to 1, EUD is the arithmetic mean dose.","\u201cPlanning target volume\u201d (PTV) as used herein refers to principal tumor volume or primary treatment volume, which is the fixed subset of voxels determined by a clinician to contain a cancerous tumor for treatment. This subset is chosen to account for possible uncertainties which the treatment may incur; including internal organ shifting, patient movement during treatment, and inaccuracies in detection. The PTV should have a high probability of containing the tumor for the entire treatment.","\u201cIntegrated target volume\u201d or \u201cinternal target volume\u201d (ITV) as used herein is the envelope needed to enclose the target as it moves throughout the breathing cycle. Clinical target volume (CTV) may also be used for this representation. The gross target volume (GTV) is the subset of voxels containing the highest density of tumor cells, and can be thought of as the main body of the tumor. However, since this may not account for some cancerous cells outside of the high density regions, clinicians typically add a margin of error to the GTV to create the CTV, which would most likely contain all cancerous cells which require treatment.","\u201cCompetitive objective\u201d as used herein refers to an instance of improving one objective only to degrade another objective. These two objectives are considered competitive objectives. Otherwise, these two objectives are considered non-competitive objectives.","\u201cSelecting\u201d comprises calculating in some embodiments, and may be characterized as \u2018determining.\u2019","Certain units described in this specification have been labeled as modules, in order to more particularly emphasize their implementation independence. A module is \u201c[a] self-contained hardware or software component that interacts with a larger system.\u201d Alan Freedman, \u201cThe Computer Glossary\u201d 268 (8th ed. 1998). A module comprises a machine or machines executable instructions. For example, a module may be implemented as a hardware circuit comprising custom VLSI circuits or gate arrays, off-the-shelf semiconductors such as logic chips, transistors, or other discrete components. A module may also be implemented in programmable hardware devices such as field programmable gate arrays, programmable array logic, programmable logic devices or the like.","Modules may also include software-defined units or instructions, that when executed by a processing machine or device, transform data stored on a data storage device from a first state to a second state. An identified module of executable code may, for instance, comprise one or more physical or logical blocks of computer instructions which may be organized as an object, procedure, or function. Nevertheless, the executables of an identified module need not be physically located together, but may comprise disparate instructions stored in different locations which, when joined logically together, comprise the module, and when executed by the processor, achieve the stated data transformation.","Indeed, a module of executable code may be a single instruction, or many instructions, and may even be distributed over several different code segments, among different programs, and across several memory devices.

As the name implies, the procedure involves the use of external beams of radiation directed into the patient at the lesion using either a gamma unit (referred to as a Gamma Knife), a linear accelerator, or similar beam delivery apparatus. Although treating the lesions with the radiation provides the potential for curing the related disorder, the proximity of critical normal structures and surrounding normal tissue to the lesions makes external beam radiation therapy an inherently high risk procedure that can cause severe complications. Hence, the primary objective of external beam radiation therapy is the precise delivery of the desired radiation dose to the target area defining the lesion, while minimizing the radiation dose to surrounding normal tissue and critical structures.","Thus, the basic strategy of external beam radiation therapy is to utilize multiple beams of radiation from multiple directions to \u201ccross-fire\u201d at the target volume. In that way, radiation exposure to normal tissue is kept at relatively low levels, while the dose to the tumor cells is escalated. Thus, the main objective of the treatment planning process involves designing a beam profile, for example, a collection of beams, that delivers a necrotic dose of radiation to the tumor volume, while the aggregate dose to nearby critical structures and surrounding normal tissue is kept below established tolerance levels.","One existing method for treatment planning in external beam radiation therapy is standard manual planning. This method is referred to as forward planning because the physician solves the direct problem of determining the appropriate dose distribution given a known set of beam characteristics and beam delivery parameters. In other words, standard manual planning involves a trial-and-error approach performed by an experienced physician. The physician attempts to create a plan that is neither complex nor difficult to implement in the treatment delivery process, while approximating the desired dose distribution to the greatest extent possible. For instance, the physician may choose how many isocenters to use, as well as the location in three dimensions, the collimator size, and the weighting to be used for each isocenter. A treatment planning computer may calculate the dose distribution resulting from this preliminary plan. Prospective plans are evaluated by viewing isodose contours superimposed on anatomical images and\/or with the use of quantitative tools such as cumulative dose-volume histograms (DVH's).","Standard manual planning has many disadvantages. This iterative technique of plan creation and evaluation is very cumbersome, time-consuming, and far from optimal. Thus, manual planning results in much higher costs for patients and insurers. The physician or other experienced planner can evaluate only a handful of plans before settling on one. Therefore, standard planning has very limited success in improving local tumor control or reducing complications to normal tissue and critical structures, and as a result, greatly limits the quality-of-life for patients.","Another method for treatment planning in external beam radiation therapy employs computer systems to optimize the dose distributions specified by physicians based on a set of preselected variables. This approach is known as inverse planning in the medical community because the computer system is used to calculate beam delivery parameters that best approximate the predetermined dose, given a set of required doses, anatomical data on the patient's body and the target volume, and a set of preselected or fixed beam orientation parameters and beam characteristics. In order to solve the complex problem of arriving at an optimal treatment plan for the domain of possible variables, all existing methods of inverse treatment planning fix at least a subset of the set of variables. For example, a particular modality of external beam radiation therapy may include the following domain of possible variables: (1) number of beams, (2) configuration of beams, (3) beam intensity, (4) initial gantry angle, (5) end gantry angle, (6) initial couch angle, (7) end couch angles, (8) prescription dose, (9) target volume, and (10) set of target points.","A. Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT)","IMRT is a method of treating cancer using radiation therapy that attempts to deliver a high dose to the tumor region while minimizing radiation to healthy tissues. Instead of using one beam of radiation, IMRT breaks the treatment up into multiple beams at different angles that intersect at the tumor site. In this way, low doses of radiation go to healthy tissues, while the tumor site gets overlapping radiation from multiple angles.","IMRT has been one of the hallmarks efforts to make radiotherapy treatment better, faster and more cost effective. In 2009, Liao et al., (Liao, Cox et al. 2007) demonstrated that radiation treatment with 4D CT and IMRT was as beneficial as 3D CRT in terms of the rates of freedom from locoregional progress and distal metastasis. They also saw a significant reduction in toxicity and a significant improvement in overall survival from non-small-cell lung cancer.","IMRT has made it possible to increase radiation dosage while reducing radiation-induced toxicity, yet IMRT treatment planning is still a complex process that is strongly dependent on the practitioner's experience. For instance, in IMRT treatment planning, the planner specifies beam directions based upon past experience and trial-and-error. The planner then specifies objectives for dose distribution using single-dose values, a few dose-volume points, or fully flexible DVHs. Objectives may be weighted based upon importance. The planning system represents these objectives in a cost function, which must be maximized or minimized using an optimization algorithm. The cost function numerically attempts to represent the tradeoffs that are incorporated into clinical judgment. If the planner wishes to change the outcome, he or she alters the objectives and re-optimizes. It is difficult to translate clinical requirements into a cost function and \u201csteer\u201d the optimization toward the best result. As a result, IMRT planning can be a time-consuming and frustrating task, and the quality of treatment plans, with similar target prescriptions and normal tissue constraints, will vary between different treatment planners and different institutions.","In IMRT, the beam intensity is varied across the treatment field. Rather than being treated with a single large, uniform beam, the patient is treated with many very small beams, each of which may be configured with a different intensity. Intensity modulation allows more intense treatment of the tumor, while limiting the radiation dose to adjacent healthy tissue. Appropriate data variables such as user input, constraints (e.g., dosimetric, beam geometry, etc.), clinical objectives, etc. are used to determine the corresponding treatment plan optimization model(s) and optimization mathematics, as well as determine the globally optimal solutions for the IMRT treatment plan. An embodiment of the invention is the use of AutoPlan to create IMRT treatment plans.","B. Proton Therapy (Particle Therapy)","Proton therapy has emerged as a particularly efficacious treatment for a variety of conditions. In proton therapy, positively charged proton subatomic particles are accelerated, collimated into a tightly focused beam, and directed towards a designated target region within the patient. Protons exhibit less lateral dispersion upon impact with patient tissue than electromagnetic radiation or low mass electron charged particles and can thus be more precisely aimed and delivered along a beam axis. Also, upon impact with patient tissue, protons exhibit a characteristic Bragg peak wherein a significant portion of the kinetic energy of the accelerated mass is deposited within a relatively narrow penetration depth within the patient. This offers the significant advantage of reducing delivery of energy from the accelerated proton particles to healthy tissue interposed between the target region and the delivery nozzle of a proton therapy machine as well as to \u201cdownrange\u201d tissue lying beyond the designated target region. Depending on the indications for a particular patient and their condition, delivery of the therapeutic proton beam may preferably take place from a plurality of directions in multiple treatment fractions to maintain a total dose delivered to the target region while reducing collateral exposure of interposed desired\/healthy tissue. An embodiment of the invention is the use of AutoPlan to create proton therapy treatment plans.","C. Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy or VMAT","VMAT is similar to 3D-CRT and IMRT in that it follows the same idea of delivering beams of various intensity to the tumor through apertures which are conformed to the silhouette of the tumor from the beam's-eye-view, or of approximating the IMRT intensity maps. However VMAT differs from these methods in that it strives to deliver its dose in continuous arcs around the patient's body, rather than from discrete angles. That is, whereas most methods of delivery simply position the device (called the gantry) around the body, select a position, choose an aperture, and activate their radiation dose, VMAT delivers a continual dose as the gantry rotates. It is estimated that more than half of modulated photon radiotherapy will be delivered by VMAT technologies. An embodiment of the invention is the use of AutoPlan to create VMAT plans.","D. Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy or SBRT","SBRT is a treatment procedure similar to central nervous system (CNS) stereotactic radiosurgery, except that it deals with tumors outside of the CNS. A stereotactic radiation treatment for the body means that a specially designed coordinate-system is used for the exact localization of the tumors in the body in order to treat it with limited but highly precise treatment fields. SBRT involves the delivery of a single high dose radiation treatment or a few fractionated radiation treatments (usually up to 5 treatments). A high potent biological dose of radiation is delivered to the tumor, improving the cure rates for the tumor, in a manner previously not achievable by standard conventional radiation therapy. SBRT treatment could be delivered using intensity modulated photon beam, particle beam or arc beams. Similarly, because this specialized form of radiation involves the use of multiple radiation beam angles, expert Radiation Oncologists specialized in this technique are able to safely deliver high doses of radiation, with very sharp dose gradient outside the tumor and into the surrounding normal tissue. Creating intensity modulated and volumetric arc modulated SBRT plans is almost identical to creating IMRT and VMAT plans. In an embodiment of the invention, AutoPlan is used to create SBRT plans.","E. Adaptive Radiation Therapy (ART)","ART is considered mainly to be technology in which repeated measurements of the patient's geometry during the treatment period is carried out and used to improve treatment so that a more patient-specific treatment can be performed. Today, radiation treatment is based on the patient's anatomy at the time the CT scans were taken. In fact, the patient's outer contours and inner organs change both position and form on a daily basis during treatment. These geometrical variations can be handled by adaptive radiation therapy. The complicated planning process\u2014requiring a great deal of trial-and-error\u2014is often the most time-consuming part of RT treatment. Several cycles are typically needed for review of patient progress, consultation between the radiation oncologist and dosimetrist, and subsequent reassessment of the treatment plan, making the IMRT plan expensive. ART may require even more repetition of treatment plan review, making them prohibitively expensive. An embodiment of the invention is the use of autoplan algorithm to reduce the cost of ART. Therefore it is possible to adopt ART in routine clinical practice. An embodiment of the invention is using AutoPlan to create ART treatment plans.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0129","num":"0128"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["1","2","3","4","5"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0130","num":"0129"},"figref":"FIG. 5A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0131","num":"0130"},"figref":"FIG. 5B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0132","num":"0131"},"figref":["FIGS. 6(","FIGS. 4","FIG. 12","FIG. 6("],"i":["a","b","a","b","b"],"b":["5","5"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0133","num":"0132"},"figref":["FIGS. 7A and 7B","FIG. 4","FIGS. 5A and 5B","FIGS. 6A and 6B"],"b":["3","4","3","3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0134","num":"0133"},"figref":["FIG. 7(","FIG. 7("],"i":["b","a"],"b":"4"},"This algorithm only contains non-constrained objective function and was thoroughly tested for generating autoplan for prostate cancer.

Beam Angle Selection","In IMRT treatment planning the angles at which radiation is delivered to the treatment site in the patient's body, commonly called gantry angles and couch angles in the case of non-coplanar beams, are usually pre-selected based on experience and intuition of the operator. The corresponding beam intensity profiles are then optimized under the guidance of an objective function using inverse treatment planning methods. General information on these methods is provided by S. Webb, \u201cOptimizing the Planning of Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy\u201d, Physics in Medicine and Biology, Vol. 39, 1994, pp. 2229-2246; S.

Chen, \u201cIterative Methods for Inverse Treatment Planning\u201d, Physics in Medicine and Biology, Vol. 41, 1996, pp. 2107-2123.","D. Expert System","An expert system may be used to select beam angles. From a technologically point of view, automating the treatment planning process is a difficult problem. One problem which must be overcome in developing automated treatment planning is the selection of optimal beam angles, which are currently chosen by experienced planners. Since the beginning of IMRT, beam angle optimization algorithms (BAOs) have been a subject of intense research (Stein, Mohan et al. 1997; Pugachev and Xing 2002; Meedt, Alber et al. 2003; Wang, Zhang et al. 2004; Wang, Zhang et al. 2005; Liu, Jauregui et al. 2006; D'Souza, Zhang et al. 2008; Potrebko, McCurdy et al. 2008) in the radiotherapy community. However, BAO algorithms have not been adopted in routine clinical practice. One reason is that the optimal beam angle is strongly dependent on the cost function used to obtain that angle. However, the optimal cost function for a particular patient is not known. The weights and objectives\u2014also dependent on the beam angles initially selected\u2014used in the cost function to achieve the best possible treatment plan must be optimized. Choosing initial angles from an expert system is a new approach. First, the initial angles already take advantage of clinical dosimetrists' previous experiences to eliminate some angles which are usually never chosen to design the plan for a tumor in some geometrical location. Second, choosing non-coplanar angle is also a very difficult problem since the search space of non-coplanar angles is very large. Several non-coplanar angles may be picked which are frequently used by dosimetrists if the tumor was located in some particular position. Using non-coplanar angles indeed can improve the plan quality. The added advantage of this approach is that those non-coplanar beams automatically avoid the gantry collision problem since all initial non-coplanar beams have been used before to treat the patients. Most importantly, although an expert database was used to aid in selecting the beam angles, the database need not be relied on to chose the optimal angles. In one embodiment of the invention, the database chooses initial angles which will be optimized further to select the optimal angles. This approach normally yield plans which are better than the plan manually designed by clinical dosimetrists. Even the beam angles selected are more optimal than some manually selected by experienced dosimetrists.","The Expert System or Database may include the tumor position, beam angles (gantry, couch, collimator angles), tumor sizes, and treatment results for each plan. In one embodiment of the invention, the expert database serves as the base for the beam angle selections. In another embodiment, the beam angles in the expert system are unchanged after selection from the expert system. In a further embodiment, the beam angles are unchanged, but the number of beams is reduced. In another embodiment of the invention, the expert system does not include actual patient data, but is a conglomeration of patient data done by an expert. The prostate beam angles used in the Examples are as follows: 8, 225, 260, 295, 330, 30, 65, 100, 135.","E. Beam Intensity Optimization and\/or Adjustment","Any available software may be used to optimize the beam intensities in AutoPlan. For example, HELIOS (Varian Associates, Palo Alto, Calif.) and Pinnacle (Philips, Milpitas, Calif.) are both available software packages used to optimize beam intensities. While an example of IMRT beam intensity optimization is described below, proton therapy planning also involved beam optimization, and such optimization may be used in combination with the current invention. Any of the following IMRT beam intensity optimizations may be used to select the beam intensities in AutoPlan.","1. Optimization of IMRT Beam Intensities","The potential of IMRT to improve outcome has spurred continued interest in improving optimization techniques. Many optimization algorithms for determining the optimized intensity profiles have been utilized. These include linear programming (Wu et al., 2000; Rosen et al, 1991) mixed-integer programming (Langer et al, 1996; Lee at al, 2000) gradient algorithms (Bortfeld et al, 1990; Bortfeld, 1999; Cho et al., 1998; Holmes et al., 1991; Hristov et al., 2002; Starkschall et al., 2001; Wu and Mohan, 2000), simulated dynamics (Wu and Mohan, 2001; Hou et al., 2003), and stochastic algorithms (Morrill et al., 2001; Rosen et al., 1995; Webb, 1991; Wu et al., 2000). Each of these methods has advantages and disadvantages. Gradient algorithms are normally fast but they may get trapped in local minima far from good solutions. Although stochastic algorithms, such as simulated annealing and genetic algorithms, have the advantages of avoiding getting trapped in local minima in principle, they are slow and may also get trapped in local minima if, for example, the thermal cooling process is too fast in the case of simulated annealing, or if the population evolution is not realistic in the case of genetic algorithms. For stochastic and gradient algorithms, the value of an objective function (called the score) is used to drive the optimization process to an extremum. The commonly used objective functions are dose based (Wu and Mohan, 2000; Bortfeld et al., 1996), dose volume-based (Wu and Mohan, 2000; Bortfeld et al., 1996; Langer et al., 1990) and biology based (Wu et al., 2000; Langer et al., 1990). Each objective function is composed of subobjectives corresponding to individual anatomic structures. The subobjectives are assigned relative weights, or penalties, reflecting the relative importance of the end point. Normally, the penalty parameters are chosen subjectively and determined by trial and error. Their values are not intuitively obvious to the treatment planner.","Linear programming approaches, including mixed integer programming approaches, on the other hand, normally use hard constraints (but can accommodate soft constraints as well) on tumors and organs at risk (OARs) to perform optimization without the need to use artificially defined objective functions. The application of the linear programming approach in radiotherapy has recently attracted the attention of the operations research community (Holder, 2000; Holder 2002). However, the linear programming techniques require large numbers of iterations and are slow. The simulated dynamics approach, recently developed by Hou et al. (Hou et al., 2003), combines the advantages of gradient algorithms and the constraint approach in the IMRT treatment planning. Its extensive application in routine radiation treatment planning is still to be evaluated.","Because gradient algorithms need fewer iterations to obtain a reasonable solution, they represent the most commonly implemented algorithms in the commercial planning systems, for example HELIOS (Varian Associates, Palo Alto, Calif.) and Pinnacle (Philips, Milpitas, Calif.). The Newton's (Bortfeld et al., 1990; Wu and Mohan, 2000) and conjugate gradient (CG) (Spirou and Chui, 1998) algorithms are the two most prevalent gradient methods. Newton's algorithm and the steepest descent (SD) algorithm use the gradient of the objective function to choose the direction of optimization. The SD method is not efficient in theory because the optimization directions between the first and next iterations are not orthogonal. The results of optimization in the next iteration may partially spoil the results of optimization achieved in the previous iteration. The CG algorithm avoids this problem by producing a sequence of orthogonal directions by combining the current gradient of the objective function with the previous directions of optimization. Theoretically, the CG algorithm is more efficient. However, the CG algorithm requires a line minimization to determine the step size after the search direction has been determined. The line minimization process is very slow and can considerably reduce the overall speed of the CG algorithm. Intelligent ways to avoid line minimization have been devised. For example, Spirou and Chui) (Spirou and Chui, 1998) have suggested an exact value for the step size for the quadratic cost function. However, this value is specific to the simple dose and dose-volume cost functions and cannot be applied to more general objective functions such as biologybased objective functions. The need for avoiding line minimization for CG algorithm is of interest in IMRT as well as in other fields. Moller (Moller, 1993), for example, proposed a variation of the CG algorithm, called the \u201cscaled conjugate gradient\u201d (CG) algorithm, which avoids the time consuming line search to determine the step size during optimization. This algorithm is widely applied in the field of neutral networks and can be used with any type of objective function.","The IMRT may be integrated into the Pinnacle treatment planning system (Philips, Milpitas, Calif.). Pinnacle may be used for patient contouring, beam setup, dose-volume or EUD parameter input, dose computations for intensity-modulated fields, and some of the analyses of optimized intensity-modulated dose distributions. The details of this optimization system are described elsewhere (Wu and Mohan, 2000; Wu et al., 2002). AutoPlan may use such a treatment planning system as Pinnacle to input patient contouring, parameter input, optimization of beam intensities based on dose distributions. AutoPlan will generate the beam angles based on an expert system and optimize or select new objective functional parameters to further enhance the treatment plan. A program such as Pinnacle may be used to adjust and\/or optimize the beam intensities within the AutoPlan method or system. Additional description of optimization techniques for IMRT may be found in Zhang et al., Med. Phys. 31(5), May 2004, incorporated herein in its entirety.","F. Multi-Criteria Optimization (MCO) Algorithm","The AutoPlan multi-criteria optimization (MCO) method generates a few different plans, each which favor of a target organ or an organ-at-risk (OAR) based on the initial input plan which is generated from the non-constrained AutoPlan method. The purpose of the MCO algorithm is to explore multiple possibilities in the PTV coverage and\/or different OAR sparing options. The MCO algorithm works on the basis of the initially generated autoplan and produces a couple of different PTV\/OAR-favored plans, each of which provides the best possible coverage or sparing of the PTV or an OAR while maintaining the overall quality of the plan acceptable. ) illustrates the work flow of the MCO algorithm for lung cancer with non-constrained objectives, as an example. First, the MCO algorithm examines the OARs to determine if the heart and the esophagus sparing conflicts with the lung sparing when trying to improve the plan quality. Then, MCO generates the PTV-favored plan based on the initial autoplan and the lung-favored plan is generated based on the PTV-favored plan. Next, the PTV-favored plan (if the lung sparing conflicts with the heart sparing) or the lung-favored plan (if the lung sparing does not conflict with the heart sparing) is used as the basis for generating the heart-favored plan. Similarly, the esophagus-favored is generated based on either the PTV-favored plan (if the lung sparing conflicts with the esophagus sparing) or the lung-favored plan (if the lung sparing does not conflict with the esophagus sparing). The resulted plans from above steps are then combined to produce a composite plan, which can be reviewed and adjusted by the physician. If a different compromise is preferred, the physician can easily change the weight of each input plan by sliding bars and observe the adjusted plan immediately. After the physician has come to a satisfied plan, the MCO can reproduce the final plan based on the weight settings adjusted by the physician. In such way, a plan with the physician's desired compromise is generated.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0188","num":"0187"},"figref":["FIGS. 12(","FIG. 12("],"i":["b","e","a"],"b":["2","5"]},"The lung-, heart-, and esophagus-favored plans are generated in a similar way. The major difference lies in the initial plan on which it based on, as described above. The total objective value of corresponding OAR in each plan is adjusted to \u2154, for example, of the total objective value by scaling the objective weight and then optimization is executed. Such procedure is repeated until the PTV HI drops below a given threshold. The final plan is saved as the OAR-favored plan after the cord maximum dose is pushed to below the cord maximum dose criteria.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0190","num":"0189"},"figref":"FIG. 12(","i":"e"},"After the decision was made, it is possible to deliver the 5 different plans in one fraction or deliver one of the plan in one fraction. Here, another method is used generate only one plan based on the final DVHs. In the plan explorer process, all the base plans were generated using fixed beam IMRT technology, however, final plan can be either IMRT plan or VMAT plan. The algorithm to generate one plan based on the MCO_plan is described in ).","G. Automated Adaptive Planning (AAP) Method for ART","Large inter-fractional anatomical change may occur during fractional radiation treatment. Adaptive techniques such as isocenter re-positioning are effective when tumor only exhibits translational shift. To fully take advantages of the image-guided techniques, the ideal adaptive planning strategy is to perform the replanning based on the daily CTs. However, The complete replan for daily CT is impractical with the manual recontouring and trial-and-error replanning process. In an embodiment of the invention, an automated adaptive planning (AAP) method, i.e. automated contouring and automated plan optimization is done without any manual intervention.","The AAP method involves two key steps: automated contouring, which maps the contours in planning CT to those in daily CT and automatic planning, which performs the inverse fixed beam IMRT and VMAT plan based on propagated contours in planning CT without manual intervention. In the automatic contouring process, for each daily CT, the demons deformable image registration algorithm (DIR) implemented in Insight Toolkit (ITK) was adopted to generate the voxel-to-voxel correspondences between the planning\/simulation CT and daily CT. The contours on simulation CTs were mapped to the daily CT by the deformation vectors. In an embodiment of the invention, this method works well if no large gas bubbles exist in rectum. When the method detected the large gas bubbles existed in the target and rectum region, a post contour adaption process that excluded the gas from the target and added the gas as a part of rectum's contour was performed. In the automatic planning process, AutoPlan as described in  were used to generate autoplans without human intervention.","H. Evaluation of Autoplans","Evaluation of autoplans may be done by a physician or by evaluation of the following: Equivalent Uniform Dose (EUD), Tumor Control Probability (TCP), Normal Tissue Complication Probability (NTCP), dose volume data for example mean lung dose, lung v5, V10, V20. Heterogeneity Index (HI), Conformality Index (CI), complication free tumor control probability (P+). These parameters from an autoplan may be evaluated against a dosimetrist created plan parameters to determine the quality of the autoplan.","The following examples are included to demonstrate preferred embodiments of the invention. It should be appreciated by those of skill in the art that the techniques disclosed in the examples which follow represent techniques discovered by the inventor to function well in the practice of the invention, and thus can be considered to constitute preferred modes for its practice. However, those of skill in the art should, in light of the present disclosure, appreciate that many changes can be made in the specific embodiments which are disclosed and still obtain a like or similar result without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.","A. Treatment Plan Expert Database","A treatment plan expert database was created from 150 lung cancer cases previously designed by dosimetrists. In this database, the tumor position, beam angles (gantry, couch, collimator angles), and tumor sizes were recorded for each plan. The expert database served as the base for the beam angle selections of the beam angle algorithm.","B. Beam Angle Selection Based on Expert's Experience","Step  in  mainly involves the selection of coplanar and non-coplanar beam angles for each plan. The tumor position was defined in left, middle and right position of the lung. In , shows the frequency distribution of coplanar beam angles selected by the expert dosimetrists for treatment of lung cancer. The angle distribution for tumors located at the left side of lung is different from that used on the right side of the lung. For example, if the tumor is located on the left side of lung, gantry angles 60, 120 are never selected by the expert dosimetrists. The tumor location was first determined (left, middle, or right), and 14 coplanar beams were sampled using the distribution in , from the expert system, to select the initial coplanar angles. Selecting non-coplanar beam angles is difficult and requires a great deal of treatment-planning experience. It is also a difficult problem for the computer algorithm since the combination of gantry and couch is much larger than the number of gantry alone. Adopting a brute force approach and selecting all possible gantry and couch combinations as the initial set of beam angles creates an intractable problem in terms of computer speed and memory use. In addition, some combinations of gantry and couch beam angles will cause the gantry to collide with the patient or couch. As such, instead of using the brute force method, heuristic knowledge gained from an expert database is used to select the non-coplanar beam angles. By examining the database it is observed that: only one or two non-coplanar angles are used by the dosimetrists in the expert system. Non-coplanar angles are used mainly in difficult clinical plans and these non-coplanar angles used the dosimetrists are appropriate and do not cause gantry-couch collision. To select non-coplanar angles, the tumor location was first determined and suitable previous patient matches from the database based on tumor location were identified. The five most commonly used non-coplanar angles from these matched patients were then sampled. In total; 19 angles were selected (14 coplanar and 5 non-coplanar) as the initial angles.","Additionally, initial beam angles may be selected from a method that directly assigns the beam angles to a new patient based on the best matching the tumor position of the new patient with that of the patient in the expert database. This method may design the plan faster than the one using 19 initial angles selected from the frequency distribution of like patients. This method will perform better if the expert database is comprehensive and contains all possible scenarios encountered in clinical practice.","C. Initial Objective Function","In step  of , the objective-function parameters are determined.  and table 1 lists the structures used for optimization and their initial values. Those structures and initial values are used for all lung cancer cases in this example. The FS-PTV is defined as the PTV. FS-LungAvoid, FS-CLungAvoid, FS-PrVCord, FSEsphogausAvoid, FS-HeartAvoid, FS-NTAvoid are defined as the lung, contra-lateral lung, cord, esophagus, heart, body minus the FS-PTVexp1 cm (PTV expanded isotropically 1 cm). Taking organ at risk (OAR) lung as an example, although the goal is to optimize the lung dose, FS-LungAvoid was used to achieve this goal. For most cases the lung will be overlapped with PTV and cause the conflicting objective if lung were used for optimization. FS-LungAvoid was used to avoid having conflicting objectives in the optimization algorithm. These initial objectives were the same for all of the lung patients in this Example. In one embodiment, standard objectives may used to automate the lung IMRT design. Equivalent uniform dose based objective function was adapted for the optimization. The maximum dose and minimum dose objective essentially corresponds to the EUD objective with parameter a approaches to positive and negative infinity. In one embodiment, an advantage of EUD based objective function compared with dose volume based objective function is that essentially only one parameter (target EUD) is adjusted in the objective function parameter automation (OFPA) loop, which makes the OFPA efficient and easy. EUD based objective function is a convex objective function, which makes the optimization algorithm well behaved and optimizing one EUD value will simultaneously optimize whole curve of dose volume histogram. Table 1 below lists the structures used for optimization and their initial values, which are used for all the lung cancer cases.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0205","num":"0204"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"7"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"14pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},{},"Con-","Target","Volume",{},{}]},{"entry":["ROI","Type","straint","(cGy)","(%)","Weight","a"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"7"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"14pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["FS-PlanPTV\/","Min dose","Y","7500",{},{},{}]},{"entry":"FS-PlanITV"},{"entry":["FS-PlanPTV","Uniform","N","7500",{},"100"]},{"entry":[{},"dose"]},{"entry":["FS-PlanPTV\/","Max dose","Y","7500"]},{"entry":"FS-PlanITV"},{"entry":["FS-NTAvoid","Max DVH","N","4000","0","10"]},{"entry":["FS-LungAvoid","MaxEUD","N","4000",{},"1","1"]},{"entry":["FS-CLungAvoid","MaxEUD","N","240",{},"1","1"]},{"entry":["FS-ILungAvoid","MaxEUD","N","1000",{},"1","1"]},{"entry":["FS-LungAvoid","Max DVH","N","500","15","1"]},{"entry":["FS-HeartAvoid","Max DVH","N","500","0","1"]},{"entry":["FS-PrvCord","Max DVH","Y","4000","0"]},{"entry":["FS-PrvCordRing","Max DVH","N","4500","0","1"]},{"entry":["FS-PlanEsoph","Max DVH","N","4000","0","1"]},{"entry":["FS-NTAvoid","Max Dose","Y","5700"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Objective Function Parameter Automation","In step  of , the objective-function parameter is automatically adjusted using the flowchart displayed in . This work was performed at the mean lung dose (MLD) is constrained to 22 Gy. If a plan cannot achieve MLD less than or equal to 22 Gy, the PTV coverage has to be sacrificed to force MLD<22 Gy. In step , it is predicted whether MLD will likely exceed 22 Gy or not before choosing the initial target objective for the optimization. The MLD estimator is based on the volume (Lung-PTVexp2 cm-Volume) of overlap between lung and PTV isotropically expanded to 2 cm. shows the MLD as a function of Lung-PTVexp2 cm-Volume for 100 patient cases which were planned by clinical medical dosimetrists. shows the DVHs of the plans designed using the PTV objectives (dashed lines) and the ITV objectives (solid lines). A linear relation with correlation between MLD and Lung-PTVexp2 cm-Volume was determined. For a new patient case, the Lung-PTVexp2 cm-Volume is first calculated and the MLD for the case is then predicted based on the curve shown in . If the MLD is predicted to bigger than 24 Gy, the final plan's MLD is very likely to exceed 22 Gy. In this case, the ITV objective is chosen which is required to be uniform around a prescription dose. Below, it is seen that the choosing ITV based objective will naturally lead to the plan which has higher ITV\/GTV coverage while sacrificing PTV coverage to satisfy the MLD constrains. This kind of plan is essentially the concomitant boost plan which is currently adopted to treat those very difficult cases. Choosing PTV based objective plan often leads to a plan with high PTV coverage.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0208","num":"0207"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 2"],"i":["b","b"],"sub":"0i ","b":["0","0"]},"D. Beam Angle Automation","Steps  and  in  comprise the beam-angle automation (BAA) loop. The underlying principle for this algorithm is that an IMRT plan with more beams should not be inferior to an IMRT plan with fewer beams if the optimization algorithm is well implemented. If fewer beams are better, the optimization algorithm should then turn off the extra beams automatically. However, most optimization algorithms made it difficult for the optimizer to turn off a beam completely. This problem can probably be solved using the regulation technique, which is commonly used in the optimization community. In this Example, two approaches are used to overcome this problem: 1) the initial angles, based on the expert database, had already eliminated many beam directions; and 2) steps  and  were used to delete beams with lower weights and the beam intensities were re-calculated to determine whether eliminating the beams with lowest weights deteriorates the plan quality.","E. Patient Selection and Study Design","In this example, AutoPlan was implemented as a research plug-in to Pinnacle and all plans generated from AutoPlan are deliverable plans which could directly be used to treat patients.","Five stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cases were re-planned using the AutoPlan system and compared with the plans created by dosimetrists and used to treat the patients. Those five cases were the same five cases adopted in previous work comparing the passive scattered proton plan and IMRT plans (Chang, Zhang et al. 2006). Dose volume data and conformality index (CI) were used to compare autoplan and clinical plan. The CI is defined as the volume enclosed by the prescription line divided by volume of PTV.","One stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) case was re-planned using different strategies: 1) autoplan using the AutoPlan system; 2) autoplan-cop using the parameter optimization method but with 19 coplanar initial beam angles; 3) autoplan-db using the parameter optimization method but with beam angles selected using the angles best matched in the beam angle database; and 4) autoplan-cb using the parameter optimization algorithm but with the beam angles selected by an experienced dosimetrists.","To demonstrate a rational behind the BOA algorithm the plan was also studied for the above patients using 19, 18, 17, 16, . . . , 5 beams. For plans optimized using n (n<19) beams, the beams for the plan optimized using n+1 beams with the lowest weights were deleted. The total score of the objective function, CI, HI, lung V5, P+ was computed for the plans with the different number of beams.","F. Impact of Number of Beam Angles on the Plan Quality","Table 2 used various metrics to compare the plan quality among plans using different number of beam angles. The corresponding value of the clinical plan used to treat this patient is also listed. The clinical plan used 5 non-coplanar beam angles with gantry angles (345, 40, 90, 140, 190). The overall plan quality was measured using the total score, P+ and Hot-Region. This patient was prescribed 200 cGy per fractions to 93% of PTV mean dose for 30 fractions. The standard prescription dose in an institution is 63 Gy. However, for this patient, since mean lung dose (MLD) reached 21.5 Gy. It was forbidden to treat the patient with MLD>22 Gy and only 60 Gy prescription dose was given. This case was considered a very challenging case and the dosimetrists spent a significant effort to design the clinical plans. Since the prescription dose was 60 cGy, the absolute volume receiving dose>=50 Gy in the normal tissue region was used to describe the unnecessary radiation to the patient. The overall plan quality was significantly improved for the autoplans for all beam configurations ranging from 5 to 19 beams compared with the clinical plans in terms of total score, P+ and Hot-Region in the normal tissue. The total score was defined with the objective function used in the AutoPlan system which is different from the one used for the clinical plan. P+ which reflected the complication free tumor control probability improved absolutely 9.54% (7.4%-11.2%) in autoplans compared with clinical plans. The unnecessary irradiation to the normal tissue region was also reduced 332 cc (270 cc-376 cc). The autoplan with 13 beams reached the lowest total score but P+ was lowest in autoplan with 5 beams and 13 beams. The target coverage was reflected in V prescription, CI, HI, TCP. The volume covered by the prescription dose was 93.8% (92.5%-94.8%) which is about 1% lower than that of clinical plan 94.8%. CI, HI, TCP in autoplans was 1.08 (1.07-1.09), 1.16 (1.12-1.20), 78.0% (77.8%-78.3%) compared to 1.34, 1.13, 77.1% in clinical plan. When the number of beams is greater than 12, the HI index was slightly improved. When the number of beams is less than 8, the PTV receiving the prescription dose was reduced. The lung sparing was reflected in V5, MLD and NTCP. V5, MLD, NTCP were 58.1% (56.2%-60.2%), 19.2 Gy (19.0 Gy-19.5 Gy) and 10.8% (9.7%-12.9%) in autoplans compared to 63.4%, 21.5 Gy and 22.6% in clinical plans. When number of beams is less than 9, the MLD in autoplans was about 0.4 Gy higher than that in autoplans with number of beams greater than 8. The heart, cord, esophagus sparings were represented by the NTCP values. The NTCP values for heart, cord, esophagus in autoplans were 0, 0, and 30.6% (27.1%-32.3%) compared to 0, 0, 31.3% in clinical plans. For this patient, esophagus was overlapped with PTV which leading to larger NTCP value of esophagus for all plans.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0218","num":"0217"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"364pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE

AutoPlan Algorithm Yields Better Plan Compared to Other Strategies","Table 3 used various metrics to compare the plan quality among plans designed using different strategies. The automation method essentially contains beam angle selection automation (BAA) and objective function parameter selection automation (OFPA). OFPA-CB represented the scenario that a perfect match of this patient in the expert database existed. OFPA-DB represented the scenario that a perfect match did not exist but a closest match existed. Lung V5 is lower in OFPA-CB but MLD is similar. Interestingly, NTCP of plan OFPA-DB is lower than that of OFPA-CB. There are no significant differences in target coverage and critical structure sparing among these two plans. V5 is considered as one of the most important metrics for the lung sparing in the institution this study was performed in. OFPA-CB is strongly preferred and considered better plan. The difference between autoplan-5B and autoplan-coplanar is that the initial angles of former contained both coplanar and non-coplanar angles and initial angle of latter only contained 19 equal spaced coplanar angles. The MLD of autoplan-5B is about 1 Gy lower than that of autoplan-coplanar. This is considered significant for the lung plan quality. When autoplan-5B is compared with autoplan-11B (table 3), autoplan-11B is generally better than autoplan-5B in terms of target coverage and lung sparing (MLD of autoplan-11B is 0.4 Gy lower than that of autoplan-5B). Although the difference is small, clinicians normally weigh more on the plan quality than the delivery efficiency especially for the plan which was very hard to meet the plan constrains. In this implementation of the AutoPlan method, the plans were generated with a number of beams from 11 beams to 5 beams and the decision of picking the plan to treat patients was left to clinicians.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0223","num":"0222"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"441pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 3"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Table 3: Various metrics to compare the autoplan quality among plans using different planning strategies."}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"10"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"98pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"9","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},{},"Target",{},{},"Lung",{},{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"Overall plan quality",{},"coverage",{},{},"sparing",{},"Normal tissue sparing"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"15"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"9","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"10","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"11","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"12","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"13","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"14","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"15","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"P+","Hot-",{},"V",{},{},"TCP","MLD","V5","NTCP-","Cord","NTCP-","NTCP-","NTCP-"]},{"entry":["Plans","(%)","R (%)","MU","(%)","CI","HI","(%)","(Gy)","(%)","L (%)","D(Gy)","Cord (%)","H (%)","Eso (%)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"15","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Auto plan-cop","34.80","3.94","599","93.4","1.14","1.18","78.1","20.6","57.1","18.5","44.1","0.0","0.0","30.3"]},{"entry":["OFPA-DB","33.70","1.66","633","93.8","1.06","1.20","79.1","20.3","62.7","14.6","44.5","0.0","0.0","36.0"]},{"entry":["OFPA-CB","35.70","2.14","659","93.0","1.03","1.21","78.8","20.3","56.2","15.1","44.8","0.0","0.0","32.8"]},{"entry":["Autoplan-5B","41.40","1.69","583","92.5","1.09","1.19","77.8","19.5","60.9","12.6","43.0","0.0","0.0","27.1"]},{"entry":["Clinical","30.20","3.95","670","94.8","1.34","1.13","77.1","21.5","63.4","22.6","48.0","0.1","0.0","31.3"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"15","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"The different strategies was given in the explanation of FIG. 11.

For that trial, initially, all photon IMRT plans were designed by both the AutoPlan system and experienced clinical dosimetrists. Plans designed by the AutoPlan system were consistently better or no worse than the plans designed by clinical dosimetrists. Since it was realized that AutoPlan consistently produced the IMRT plan which was hardly improved by manual intervention, the protocol was modified so that all the photon clinical plans were initially designed by the AutoPlan system. Randomization of the patients will be decided by the initial autoplans. If the plan was randomized to photon IMRT treatment, clinical dosimetrists will adjust the autoplan based on the radiation oncologist's preference if it is necessary. To all knowledge, the AutoPlan system is the first system which can essentially perform the IMRT design using one-button click and has started to be adopted in the real clinic practice.","Further, autoplans significantly improve lung sparing compared to the clinical IMRT plans which were used to treat the patients. It was also noticed that lung plan quality manually designed by medical dosimetrists was improved if they realized that the same plan was also being designed by AutoPlan system simultaneously.","Once beam angle selection was automated, the next important optimization process is objective function definition and objective function parameter automation. The planning structures were judicially selected so that every lung cancer cases were optimized by those planning structures. The AutoPlan method was tested on more than 100 lung cancer cases using the same initial planning structures (objective function parameters). It was shown that the planning structures also contained the implicit judgment of plan quality by radiation oncologists used in the expert system. The objective function parameter automation is striking efficient once initial beam angles and initial objective function parameters were judiciously selected. In practice, only 2-3 loops of OFPA were needed to obtain the final plan if beam angles were determined. Since the plans with 11 beams were frequently liked by radiation oncologists, the system can produce the autoplan with 11 beams in about 20 minutes automatically for a challenging stage III lung cancer case. With more powerful computers available and parallel dose calculation algorithms, it is expected that this 20 minutes may be easily reduced within 1 minute, which makes real time planning without manual intervention possible.","In the OFPA process, the total lung objective was set to (FS-LungAvoid) a value which is impossible to achieve which was reflected by the very high objective values for the optimized plan. The plan produced essentially corresponds to the lung optimal plan. It was found that this lung optimal plan is the plan which radiation oncologists most preferred especially for the challenged stage III lung cancer cases. It was also demonstrated by producing those lung optimal plans, that the target objectives and other critical structure objectives were also satisfied or even better than the plans manually designed by clinical dosimetrists. Based on this work, a system was designed with a multi-criteria approach which simultaneously produced several optimal plans and final plans which can then be evaluated and determined by a treatment plan explorer. This approach has been implemented.","Eleven randomly selected prostate-cancer patients, each prescribed 76 Gy in 38 fractions, were studied. Each patient had a clinical plan that was generated by a dosimetrist using 8-beam IMRT with standard beam angles used in the treatment institution. A VMAT plan using two arcs (360-degree back and forth) was generated for each patient with autoplan algorithm. Also, a series of IMRT plans based on different numbers of beam angles were generated with the autoplan algorithm for each patient. For each patient, IMRT plan was started using autoplan with 8 beams with selected beam angles and the beam number was increased to 12, 16, and so on until the IMRT plan reach similar quality as the VMAT plan. All the autoplan-based IMRT plans used beam angles that one would consider would produce better organ-at-risk (OAR) sparing. Among the three usual OARs in prostate cancer, the femoral heads and the bladder are generally easy to spare compared to the rectum, which is usually overlapping with the PTV; reducing dose in the rectum has always been a difficult task. Therefore, in this Example, the beam-angle selection was mainly focused on better rectum dose sparing. All autoplan-based plans were optimized to the similar PTV coverage as the clinically approved plan for each patient in order to compare the plans on a fare basis. PTV coverage was assessed by the conformality index (CI), which is defined as",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0237","num":"0236"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mi":"CI","mo":"=","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mfrac":[{"msub":{"mi":"TV","msub":{"mi":["D","P"]}},"mi":"TV"},{"msub":[{"mi":"TV","msub":{"mi":["D","P"]}},{"mi":"V","msub":{"mi":["D","P"]}}]}],"mo":"\u00d7"},{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mn":["0","1"],"mo":","}}],"mo":"\u2208"}}}}},"TV=Target volume covered by prescription dose","TV=Target volume","V=Volume enclosed by the prescription isodose surface","and the heterogeneity index (HI), which is defined as",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0242","num":"0241"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mi":"HI","mo":"=","mfrac":{"msub":[{"mi":"D","mn":"1"},{"mi":"D","mn":"95"}]}}}}},"D=Dose encompassing 1% of the target volume","D=Dose encompassing 95% of the target volume","Average OAR volume within 30-60 Gy isodose lines and the average mean dose for the rectum and the bladder were calculated and compared for each category of plans.

For both OARs, autoplans generally show lower dose than the clinical plans, especially for the rectum. VMAT plans produced significant dose reduction compared to the IMRT plans when fewer beams were used; however, as the number of beams increases, IMRT shows the trend to produce even lower dose than VMAT.","It was also observed that different patients show great variations in terms of the number of beams required for IMRT to exceed VMAT plan quality: some patients require fewer beams, some require more. Among the 11 patients involved in this example, the minimum and maximum numbers of beams required are, respectively, 12 and 24.  shows the number of patients who received better plan quality from each type of autoplan-based IMRT plan than from the autoplan-based VMAT plan.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0248","num":"0247"},"figref":"FIGS. 24 and 25","b":["1","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0249","num":"0248"},"figref":"FIG. 26","b":"2"},"Comparing the total MUs used in each type of plan, the total MU increases significantly with the number of beams used in IMRT; the VMAT plan resulted in about 30% higher MUs than the clinic plan and the 8-beam autoplan-based IMRT plan, respectively, but only slightly higher MUs than the 24-beam IMRT plan, as shown in .","In this example, all the autoplan-based IMRT plans have used re-selected beam angles instead of the standard 8-beam template of an institution. The principle of the angle-selection is to choose more beams that are parallel to the tangent direction of the intersection between the prostate and the rectum so that they could produce the best dose drop-off at the connection. It may be that the greatly improved dose distribution and the rectum dose sparing in AIP-based IMRT plans are partly resulted from the proper selection of beam angles. However, it was also observed that, as the number of beams increases, selection of beam angles gradually loses its impact on the plan quality.","As shown above, autoplan-based VMAT plans show obvious advantage over the clinical IMRT plans, which not only reveals immense potential of the VMAT technique, but also suggests the effectiveness of the autoplan algorithm for treatment planning. Due to the limited number of clinical VMAT plans designed by the dosimetrists, the comparison between the clinical and the autoplan-based VMAT plans were not included. However, for the only two prostate patients who have available clinical VMAT plans, the autoplan-based VMAT plans produced at least comparable plan qualities to the clinical VMAT plans. The DVHs of one of the patients are shown in .","This demonstrates that the VMAT technique combined with the autoplan algorithm generates significantly superior plans than the clinical IMRT plans for prostate cancer treatment. However, fixed-beam IMRT using autoplan algorithm is capable of exceeding the performance of VMAT if the number of beams used in the plan is high enough. IMRT plan quality consistently improves as the number of beams increases; to a certain point, IMRT surpasses VMAT and the turning point varies largely among different patients, which ranges from 12 to 24 beams for the set of patients involved in this example. Expectedly, when even higher number of beams is applied in IMRT, more superior plans could be achieved, however, at the cost of even longer dose delivery time and total treatment time as well as even higher economic expense. Considering the superior delivery efficiency of VMAT and the fact that the current plan quality of VMAT in both DVH and conformality of dose distribution have both well exceeded clinical plans, VMAT may still be the preferable choice in treating prostate cancer.","The AutoPlan algorithm for head-and-neck cancer follows a similar approach to that of prostate cancer. First, the algorithm automatically generates planning ROI structures based on physician-drawn contours; the newly generated structures involve modifications and additions to the original contours in order to improve the planning quality and efficiency.

Optimization of the objectives is executed for the first round and then the PTV objective functions are evaluated.

Objective function parameter optimization (OFPO). The flowchart of the OFPO process is shown in . Three to six rounds of optimizations were applied for each patient, depending on the PTV coverage resulted from each round of optimization. Once the PTV D95 exceeded a pre-defined threshold (Dthreshold), OFPO terminated. In each round of optimization after the initial one, the weights of the PTV objectives were increased and optimization was continued. Hence, a plan with improved PTV coverage and therefore reduced OAR sparing resulted. Beyond 3 rounds of optimizations, a copy of each resulted plan was saved and, finally, 1 to 4 plans resulted, each with a different PTV\/OAR compromise. An example is shown in . The physician can choose the most preferable plan from them.","Note that the AIP program is not a treatment planning system but rather an inverse planning technique built in conjunction with the Pinnacletreatment planning system. The MP program utilizes Pinnacle's built-in functions, which include its dose calculation and optimization plug-ins. In this example, all AIP-generated VMAT plans were optimized using the SmartArc module in Pinnacle, which uses an optimization algorithm described by Bzdusek et al. (27). All AIP-generated IMRT plans in this example were optimized with the direct machine parameter optimization (DMPO) module (28), which directly optimizes MLC leaf positions and segment weights so that there is no need for fluence conversion and the plan quality will not degrade during delivery. When the same beam configuration is used, the AIP algorithm has been shown to consistently generate plans that are superior or comparable to those developed manually by experienced dosimetrists (25, 26).","Planning Study Design","For each patient, the clinically utilized IMRT plan, which was generated by an experienced dosimetrist prior to this example, was used as the reference plan. These plans utilized an 8-beam configuration, standard for prostate cancer treatment.","In this example, a VMAT plan was generated using the AIP algorithm for each patient. The AIP-generated VMAT plans used two 360\u00b0 arcs (one rotating clockwise and the other rotating counter-clockwise), which produces better plan quality than using a single 360\u00b0 arc. A comparison between using 1 and 2 arcs can be found in the Discussions section. A total of 91 control points were created through each arc using 4\u00b0 spacing, which is Pinnacle's default value and exhibited good dose calculation accuracy (29). It was found that a denser spacing of 2\u00b0 is not necessary because it brings little improvement in plan quality but much prolonged optimization time. All VMAT plans were generated with variable dose rate as well as variable gantry rotation speed.","Also, a series of IMRT plans was generated using 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 beam angles with the AIP algorithm for each patient. The 8-beam configuration is used in MDACC's standard template. For the 12-, 16-, 20-, and 24-beam IMRT configurations, beam angles were more densely selected near the tangent direction along the intersection between the rectum and the PTV and sparsely selected at other directions. Such a beam angle distribution produces a sharp dose fall-off at the rectum. Selected beam angles varied among patients, but most of the beams angles were the same. For the 24-beam IMRT plans, however, uniformly distributed beam angles were found to yield a better plan quality than beam angles selected using the approach mentioned above. Therefore, a uniform beam angle distribution was used for the 24-beam IMRT plans. In this example, an AIP-generated plan with a higher number of beams was not simply calculated from the same set of objectives as the other plans nor was it built upon the plan with a lower number of beams. Instead, the AIP algorithm was executed independently for each beam configuration, which resulted in a different set of objective parameters. Of the generated IMRT plans with different PTV\/OAR compromises after each AIP execution, the IMRT plan was selected that had the same level of PTV coverage as the clinical IMRT plan to directly compare OAR sparing among the plans.","More details on the inverse planning parameter settings for IMRT and VMAT are listed in table 6. The maximum number of segments for IMRT and the maximum delivery time in seconds for VMAT were both set to 100 because further increasing the limits does not help to improve the plan quality.

The delivery time for a typical VMAT plan was 2.6 minutes; the delivery times for 8-, 12-, 16-, 20-, and 24-beam IMRT plans were respectively 4.7, 7, 9.3, 11.7, and 14 minutes, which included the beam-on time and loading time of each beam.","In this example, quality of VMAT plans was compared to a series of IMRT plans using increasing numbers of beams. IT is shown that the AIP-generated VMAT plans resulted in significantly better rectum sparing than the IMRT plans using the standard 8-beam configuration currently being utilized. When more gantry angles were added to the IMRT plans, the VMAT plan quality was still consistently better until the number of beams in IMRT reached 12-16 beams. At this point, which varied among the patients examined, the IMRT plan quality became similar to or slightly better than that of VMAT. Beyond this point, the plan quality of IMRT does not improve noticeably further even if more beams are used. This indicates that, for prostate cancer, the plan quality of VMAT is a limit to which the plan quality of IMRT converges as increasing numbers of beams are used.","From another perspective, these results demonstrate that the difference in the plan quality of VMAT and IMRT is due to the difference in the number of beam angles and the level of modulation from each angle used in the two modalities. These results show that having a large number of beam angles but few modulations (control points) from each angle is superior (in terms of plan quality) to having many modulations from each angle but a small number of beam angles. However, a large number of modulations from many beam angles in IMRT may compensate for the insufficient number of beams and produce a plan quality similar to that of VMAT, when the number of beams in IMRT is sufficiently large.","Because the in-house AIP algorithm was developed to generate treatment plans with optimal plan quality, all the AIP-generated plans in this example have the best quality that can be achieved, which enabled us to perform a fair comparison of the two modalities. A quality control (QC) method was applied that was recently published by Moore et al. (31) in evaluating the quality of plans involved in this example. It was found that the rectum dose measured from the AIP-generated plans is consistently close to the \u201cbest organ sparing\u201d predicted by the QC model presented in the paper. The relative model excess, which gives the normalized difference between measured and predicted dose, obtained from the AIP-generated 8-field IMRT plans ranges from \u22120.2 to 0.22 Gy, which is within the expected range for plans after applying the QC procedure (\u22120.8 to 0.22 Gy). The clinically treated IMRT plans have also resulted in a similar range. This result shows that both the clinical and the AIP-generated IMRT plans have achieved similar level of rectum sparing as the well-quality-controlled plans. For IMRT plans with a larger number of beams, the algorithm optimizes the plan in the same way as it does for 8-field IMRT which was expected to generate the same high level of plan quality for these beam configurations.","The AIP-generated VMAT plans generated in this example resulted in considerably higher MU usage than the 8-beam IMRT plans, which is inconsistent with the results reported by other groups, who have found that VMAT plans usually reduce MU usage compared to IMRT plans (3, 10, 12, 13, 16, 17). For studies conducted in the Varian planning system (3, 16), the significant reduction in MU usage of VMAT probably comes from the difference in the optimization algorithms used for VMAT and IMRT. Comparing to studies conducted in Pinnacle (12, 13), the discrepancy may be due to the fact that, in the AIP algorithm, the focus was on improving the plan quality, especially by reducing the rectum dose, so that achievable optimal plans were generated but not plans with higher delivery efficiency or lower MU usage. Higher MU usage resulting from the plans may be a consequence of their highly conformal dose distributions and their superior OAR sparing. To confirm this, a VMAT plan was manually designed for one patient using a set of objectives that has loose dose constraints for the rectum and bladder compared to those used in the AIP algorithm. This manual VMAT plan resulted in dramatically reduced MU usage (363 MU) compared to that of the corresponding AIP-generated VMAT plan (1038 MU), but it also resulted in inferior OAR sparing (). As far as delivery time is concerned, the 1038-MU plan took only 10% longer to deliver than the 363-MU plan. Admittedly, higher MU has its drawbacks such as the potential increase in total body dose because of scattering and leakage from MLCs (32).","All the VMAT plans generated in this example used two 360\u00b0 arcs instead of one 360\u00b0 arc because it was found that dual-arc is superior to single-arc in terms of the compromise between plan quality and delivery efficiency.  shows the typical DVH plots of a single-arc and a dual-arc VMAT plan. Dual-arc produced better rectum and bladder sparing than single-arc. In fact, dual-arc VMAT plans typically used less than 15% more total MUs than single-arc VMAT plans. Therefore, in this example dual-arc VMAT plans were used for the comparison with IMRT.","The effect of the number of beams on plan quality has been previously studied by Pirzkall et al., using a completely different approach from ours, who found that less than 9 beams may result in increased dose in regions far away from the target. In their work, all IMRT plans were generated \u201cusing the same dose-volume constraints\u201d (33). In contrast, every plan in this example was generated completely independently from other plans. Specifically, the objective function parameters of every plan were optimized for each beam angle configuration, ensuring a high plan quality of each case.","This suggests the effectiveness of the AIP algorithm for prostate cancer treatment planning. For the few manually-designed clinical VMAT plans that were available, the AIP-generated VMAT plans produced at least a comparable plan quality. The AIP algorithm also consistently produced IMRT plans that were comparable, if not superior, to the dosimetrists' manual IMRT plans with the same beam angle configurations for all patients that were examined.","One might argue that IMRT with a large number of beams (>8) is not clinically practical considering its lower delivery efficiency. In this example, IMRT with a larger number of fields was used to obtain a better understanding of the capability of IMRT and the differences between IMRT and VMAT plan quality. Furthermore, novel technologies that enable the more efficient delivery of fixed-field IMRT, such as the one used in the TrueBeam system (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, Calif.), and continuing improvements in IMRT delivery techniques will make it possible to deliver IMRT plans with a large number of beams more efficiently in the near future, to continue to expand understanding of this modality.","This shows that the VMAT technique combined with the in-house AIP algorithm generates significantly superior plans compared to the 8-beam clinical IMRT plans used for prostate cancer treatment. For IMRT plan quality to be improved such that it is comparable to that of an optimized VMAT plan, a sufficiently large number of beams has to be used. However, this would come at the expense of even longer dose delivery, increased treatment times (leading to increased intra-fractional motion) and higher economic cost. Considering the superior delivery efficiency of VMAT and the fact that the optimized VMAT plan quality in terms of both DVH and conformality of dose distribution well exceeds that of clinical IMRT plans, VMAT may be the preferred modality for treating prostate cancer.","All references listed below are hereby incorporated by reference in full.\n\n"],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["For a more complete understanding of the present invention, reference is now made to the following descriptions taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIGS. 5A and 5B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIGS. 6A and 6B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIGS. 7A and 7B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 12(","FIG. 12("],"i":["a","e","g","f"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 15","FIG. 15"],"i":["a ","b "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 18"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 19"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 20"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 21"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 22"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 23"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 24","b":"1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 25","b":"2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 26","b":"2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 27"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 28"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 29"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIG. 30"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 31"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIG. 32"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 33"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":"FIG. 34"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":"FIG. 35"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIG. 36"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 37"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"figref":"FIG. 38","i":["a","g "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"figref":"FIG. 39","i":["a","g "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":"FIG. 40"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0068"},"figref":"FIG. 41"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0069"},"figref":"FIG. 42"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0070"},"figref":"FIG. 43"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0071"},"figref":"FIG. 44"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
