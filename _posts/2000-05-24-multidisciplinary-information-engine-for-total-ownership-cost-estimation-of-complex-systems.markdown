Discussion of the Related Art","Conventional collaborative multi-disciplinary environments are used in the design, development, production, and support of complex systems. A collaborative multi-disciplinary environment links information from various multi-disciplinary groups involved with various aspects associated with the complex system to form a common information model that represents the complex system. The collaborative multi-disciplinary environment provides discipline specific views of the information model and integrates their tools and processes with a managed repository of information representing the complex system.","The collaborative multi-disciplinary environment is implemented in one or more commercially available software components, also referred to herein as commercial-off-the-shelf products (\u201cCOTS\u201d), to manage and leverage various activities among the disciplines involved. Using the collaborative multi-disciplinary environment, the various disciplines contributing to decisions associated with the complex system can exploit a number of synergies that result from timely and reliable exchange of information.","Some conventional environments offer a standalone cost estimation capability that incompletely represents all the of costs associated with the complex system; that do not integrate well, if at all, with other components in the environment; that lack flexibility and scalability; and that are not tightly coupled to the information model associated with the complex system as it evolves during its life cycle.","What is needed is a multi-disciplinary information engine that estimates a total ownership cost of a complex system.","The present invention is directed toward a system, method, and computer program product that estimates a total ownership cost of a complex system or a component thereof. The present invention includes at least one tool in a multi-disciplinary environment, a product data manager, and a total ownership cost assessment tool. The tools in the multi-disciplinary environment are used to gather information regarding the complex system. The product data manager organizes the information as an information model representing the complex system. The total ownership cost assessment tool extracts various system and related scheduling aspects associated with the complex system, or a component thereof, from the information model and determines the total ownership cost associated with the complex system, or the component.","According to one aspect of the present invention, a method for determining a total ownership cost associated with a complex system comprises receiving an aspect of system context from an information model of the complex system, where the information model is generated by and maintained in a multi-disciplinary environment; receiving an aspect of schedule context from the information model, where the aspect of schedule context is related to the aspect of system context; and determining the total ownership cost of the complex system based on the aspect of system context and the aspect of schedule context.","According to another embodiment of the invention, a computer program product for enabling a processor in a computer system to implement a process for estimating a total ownership cost associated with a complex system comprises a computer usable medium having computer readable program code embodied in said medium for causing a program to execute on the computer system, where the computer readable program code comprises first computer readable program code for enabling the computer system to receive an aspect of system context from an information model of the complex system, wherein the information model is generated by and maintained in a multi-disciplinary environment; second computer readable program code for enabling the computer system to receive an aspect of schedule context from the information model, where the aspect of schedule context is related to the aspect of system context; and third computer readable program code for enabling the computer system to determine the total ownership cost of the complex system based on the aspect of system context and the aspect of schedule context.","According to another embodiment of the invention, a system for determining a total ownership cost associated with a complex system comprises a multi-disciplinary environment including at least one tool used to gather information regarding the complex system; a product data manager coupled to the multi-disciplinary environment, wherein the product data manager organizes the information gathered by the tool as an information model representing the complex system; and a total ownership cost assessment tool coupled to the product data manager to receive an aspect of system context and an aspect of schedule context from the information model, wherein the total ownership cost assessment tool determines the total ownership cost associated with the complex system based on the aspect of system context and the aspect of schedule context, wherein the aspect of system context is related to the aspect of schedule context.","According to another embodiment of the present invention, a method for determining a system life cycle parameter associated with a complex system comprises receiving an aspect of system context from an information model of the complex system, wherein the information model is generated by and maintained in a multi-disciplinary environment, the aspect of system context including at least one of a functional context, a physical context, and a operational context; receiving an aspect of schedule context from the information model, the aspect of schedule context related to said aspect of system context; receiving an aspect of infrastructure context from the information model, the aspect of infrastructure context related to the aspect of system context and the aspect of schedule context; and determining the system life cycle parameter associated with the complex system based on the aspect of system context, the aspect of schedule context, and the aspect of infrastructure context.","According to another embodiment of the present invention, a method for determining a total ownership cost associated with a component of a complex system comprises receiving an aspect of system context from an information model of the complex system, wherein the information model is maintained in a multi-disciplinary environment; receiving an aspect of schedule context from the information model, the aspect of schedule context related to the aspect of system context; and determining the total ownership cost with respect to the aspect of system context and the aspect of schedule context for the component of the complex system.","These and other features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following drawings and description.","The present invention is directed toward a multi-disciplinary information engine for estimating a total ownership cost of a complex system. While the present invention focuses on and is described in terms of total ownership costs, it should be understood that other parameters could be estimated including product performance assessment, project management, operations concept analysis, sparing, or any other parameter with complex inter-relationships that exist within a multi-disciplinary environment.","System Overview",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100"]},"According to the present invention, a project is defined as a collection of project phases through which a complex system progresses during a system life cycle from beginning to end. These phases may include a conception phase, a design phase, a development phase, a production phase, a delivery phase, a technology refresh phase, a technology insertion phase, a maintenance phase, a sustaining phase, and a retirement phase. During the system life cycle, various aspects of the complex system may change or evolve to include better technology, additional features, reduction in parts or subsystems, improvements in quality, and\/or any other aspects that may occur during the system life cycle. These aspects may include internal factors (i.e., those controlled by the organization) and external factors (i.e., those outside the control of the organization). It should also be understood that a complex system does not necessarily refer to a single device or unit or a collection of devices that operate as a single unit. In one embodiment of the present invention, the complex system within a project may include a schedule of deliverable individual systems. In another embodiment, the complex system may include a schedule of deliverable subsystems that comprises an overall system. In yet another embodiment, the complex system may comprise a schedule of deliverable individual systems along with a schedule of upgrades to various subsystems that comprise the individual systems.","As alluded to above, conventional multi-disciplinary environments do not consider a total ownership cost associated with the project during the life cycle of the complex system. The total ownership cost reflects all the costs incurred by the project that are associated with the complex system during its life cycle. Total ownership costs includes all past, present and future costs associated with all aspects of the complex system as will be described below.","Multi-Disciplinary Environment","Multi-disciplinary environments, such as multi-disciplinary environment  of , were developed to manage and organize information associated the project or, in other words, with the design, development, production, and support of a complex system.

Within multi-disciplinary environment , the tools that provide this type of information to PDM  for information model  may include systems engineering tools , software analysis and development tools , CAD data managers , manufacturing planning development tools , ERP , legacy data systems , and program managers toolkit .","Technology Trends and Market Analysis","Technology trends and market analysis  include various costs curves included in information model . These cost curves may include technology costs curves. Typically, these technology cost curves are established from historical data and represent projections of the relationship between the cost associated with a technology performance parameter over time. For example, one technology cost curve may represent the cost of processing power over time expressed in dollars per MIP (millions of instructions per second). Another technology cost curve may represent the cost of memory over time expressed in dollars per megabyte. These two curves represent two generally well-known and accepted costs projections based on the historical observation that technology performance grows and the associated costs decline exponentially over time. Similarly, at a particular point in time, computer-related product costs vary linearly with respect to performance and complexity (e.g., a computer with twice the performance of another computer costs twice as much as the other computer). Other similar curves exist for various technologies as would be apparent.","Other cost curves may be generated using generally accepted inflation-driven cost indices such as a price performance index (PPI) or a metal fabrication cost index (DRI). The PPI is used to project labor and material costs components associated with information model . The PPI is used to project costs associated with general system complexity, assembly and administrative costs, and non-volatile material costs. The DRI is used to project non-electronic fabrication costs and manufacturing costs.","Other cost curves may be determined with respect to specific subcontractor costs projections. Other cost curves may be determined based on whether the component is a custom design as opposed to a high volume commercial products, or whether the component can be purchased in numbers sufficient to realize quantity discounts.","One example of a cost projection function is provided herein. While others may be used by the present invention, the following cost projection is used in one embodiment of the present invention and is represented by:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["F","c"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mrow":{"mo":["[","\u2062","]"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.em","height":"0.ex"}}},"mrow":{"mrow":[{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mi":"tech","mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["w","tech"]},"mo":["\u00d7","\u2062","\u2062"],"mn":"2","mfrac":{"mrow":{"mo":"-","mi":"t"},"msub":{"mi":["Di","tech"]}},"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mfrac":{"msub":[{"mi":["Perf","tech"]},{"mi":["RefPerf","tech"]}]}}}},{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mi":"i","mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":{"mi":"wi","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":{"msubsup":{"mi":["\u0393","i","i"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mfrac":{"msub":[{"mi":["C","i"]},{"mi":["RefC","i"]}]}}}}}],"mo":"+"}},"mo":"*","msub":{"mi":["BaseCost","ref"]}}}}},"br":{},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":["Fis product cost at time t relative to reference product cost at reference time tech technology-driven product cost components (processor, memory, I\/O, storage, etc.)","i inflation-driven product cost component, e.g.: PPI, DRI","wfraction of product cost relative to technology-driven cost component at time t","RefPerfperformance of reference product relative to w","Perfperformance of object product at time t","wFraction of product cost relative to inflation-driven cost components (for reference product)","RefCrelative complexity of inflation-driven cost component w","Ci complexity of object product at time trelative to RefCi number of time units between reference product quote and object time","Didoubling (halving) interval of cost component","rinflation rate for component I","BaseCostReference cost for the product at reference time."]}}}},"Preferably, these costs curves are built into information model so that the costs of various components can be evaluated at any point throughout the system life cycle.","Within multi-disciplinary environment , the tools that provide this type of information to PDM  for information model  include customized PDM , information model , ERP , and legacy data systems .","Current System Baseline Inter-Relationships","Current system baseline inter-relationships  represent various operational, functional physical, infrastructure, and scheduling relationships that exist among various aspects of the complex system represented within information model  for a particular system baseline. A baseline represents a snapshot in time of a particular configuration of the complex system. Analogies include a version number associated with a software release (e.g., Windows\u2122 95 4.00.950B). A baseline is established during the system life cycle when various parameters in information model  are decided, agreed upon, fixed, or otherwise established. Often, multiple baselines may be established during the system life cycle.","Within information model  are various contexts including a functional context, a physical context, an operational context, an infrastructure context, and a schedule context. Functional context represents the functional aspects associated with information model . Functional context represents an articulation of the performance specifications associated with the complex system. Functional context represents what the complex system must do and at what level of performance. Functional context preferably includes a mapping to one or more of the other contexts of its evolution through the system life cycle.","Physical context represents the physical aspects associated with information model . Physical context represents a physical packaging concept (both in terms of hardware and software) that embodies the complex system. Physical context includes the various devices, components, subsystems, software modules, etc., that implement the functional context. Preferably, physical context includes a mapping to the functional context described above. Physical context may also include a mapping to one or more of the other contexts of its evolution through the system life cycle.","Operational context represents the manner in which the complex system is utilized and maintained. Preferably, the functional and physical contexts are mapped to the operational context. Operational context may also include a mapping to one or more of the other contexts of its evolution through the system life cycle.","Infrastructure context represents the supporting assets required to produce, integrate, support, sustain, and retire the complex system. Availability of these assets is described in a mapping to the schedule context. Infrastructure context may also be mapped to one or more of the other contexts of its evolution through the system life cycle.","Schedule context represents the various scheduling embodied into information model . For example, schedule context may include design schedules, delivery schedules, maintenance schedules, technology refresh schedules, etc., and as otherwise described herein. Scheduling context is mapped to the other contexts to provide a timeline of their respective evolutions through the system life cycle.","As will be appreciated, relationships among the functional context, physical context, operational context, infrastructure context, and schedule context may exist. For example, changes to the functional context may or may not require changes to the physical context and vice versa. Similarly, changes to the functional context may or may not require changes to either of the physical context or the functional context and vice versa. These, and other, inter-relationships are provided to cost estimating engine  as current system baseline inter-relationships through the so-called \u201cmapping.\u201d","Other System Inter-Relationships","Other system inter-relationships  include interfaces to external systems, infrastructure resources, etc., that are not otherwise integral to the complex system itself. These other system inter-relationships describe the complex system's interaction with its operating environment.","System Availability Schedules","System availability schedules  represent various delivery schedules associated with the complex system. This may include dates for the actual delivery of one of the complex systems in the project or may include dates for delivery of one or more subsystems, retrofits, technology refreshments, etc. This may also include the availability of a larger system within which the complex system must be installed and\/or to which the complex system must be attached (e.g., a combat system on a ship).","Spares\/Repairs Baseline","Spares\/repairs baseline  represent various scheduling of sparing and repairing timing associated with the complex system. Various projections are made to estimate when various spare parts will be needed on hand as well as when other parts may require repair. This is accomplished using a stochastic modeling process of spare demand rates based on failure modes and their associated failure distributions for each of the components in the complex system. The modeling is used to ascertain what components will be required at what time during the system life cycle to provide a particular level of system reliability (e.g. MTBF, etc.).","This modeling may be dovetailed with technology and standards surveillance system and a multi-attribute decision making model for COTS assessment and selection. Important variables to this process include concept of operations, readiness requirements, procurement lead times, warranties\/data rights, cost, reliability distribution, sources\/vendors, function\/performance allocations, maintenance support agreements, update on system usage\/field data, technology maturity and technology refresh strategy\/schedule. Preferably, each of these variables is captured by information model  during the system life cycle.","Spare components may be additional components purchased beyond those required for the complex systems in the project. Spare components may also be components that have been replaced during technology refresh and are available for remaining systems with similar configurations.","Sparing and repairing schedules may also be integral with a technology refreshment strategy associated with information model . A technology refreshment strategy involves a schedule for when particular components are upgraded during the system life cycle. For example, a technology strategy may be implemented for upgrading a computer processor at various points during the system life cycle. This may include a progression from a Intel 486 processor through one or upgrades to a Intel Pentium III-based processor. These upgrades will have an impact on sparing and repairing as well as on system performance.","In a preferred embodiment, sparing and repairing estimation is accomplished using Clockwork Group's SPAR\u00ae to predict and analyze the time dependant allocation and provisioning of spare\/repair parts. Integration of the SPAR modeling tool integrates supportability engineering and logistics planning with information model  and enables the insertion of consistent provisioning information therein.","SPAR is a COTS modeling tool for predicting and analyzing the life-cycle behavior of systems SPAR uses information about the components making up the system (reliability and cost), the intended use of the system (including variations in the production level), and its support infrastructure (frequency of maintenance, availability of resources) to predict its behavior. Monte Carlo probabilistic simulation techniques are utilized to model the behavior of complex systems, handling such phenomena as uncertain and incomplete data, component aging and maintenance, spare parts, variable demands on the system, and component interactions. Outputs include an optimized time dependent allocation of spare parts consistent with system operational concepts, functional and performance allocations, and physical design. These are utilized to determine the cost of spares and repairs for the system under consideration.","System Configuration","System configuration  captures an actual or projected baseline of a particular complex system during the project. During the course of the project various ones of the complex systems are most likely to be completely different in terms of their respective components and subsystems but will be largely similar in their overall design. Thus, in order to properly evaluate total ownership cost of the complex system, the configuration of the particular complex system or systems must be retrieved from information model .","Cost Estimation Outputs","Cost estimation outputs  include development costs , production costs , through-life costs , qualitative impact assessments , and trade study and sensitivity analyses . Each of the outputs , , and  represents a breakout with respect to a particular aspect of the total ownership cost . Each of cost estimation outputs  are described in further detail below.","Development, Production and Through-Life Costs","Development costs , production costs , and through-life costs  represent various components of total ownership cost . These components of total ownership costs represent a particular aspect of the cost of the complex system throughout its system life cycle. Development costs  represent the cost to develop the complex system. Production costs  represent the cost to produce each individual one of the complex systems in the project. Through-life costs  represent the cost to support and sustain each individual one of the complex systems through retirement. Preferably, these costs may be expressed in past, present or future dollars at various points in time during the system life cycle.","Qualitative Impact Assessments","Qualitative impact assessments  represent an indication of impact to costs for various aspects of the complex system where a qualitative relationship is undefined or otherwise unavailable. Such an indication may provide a \u201chigh,\u201d \u201cmedium,\u201d or \u201clow\u201d impact of the particular aspect on cost.","Trade Study and Sensitivity Analyses","Trade Study and sensitivity analyses  provide users with a quantitative indication of how a change to an aspect of the complex system (e.g., design, performance, schedule, technology refresh, etc.) will impact total ownership costs .","In one embodiment of the present invention, total ownership cost assessment tool  and product data manager  facilitate a comparison of two complex systems, for example, a baseline system and a baseline system with a changed aspect. In this case, cost estimating engine  provides a delta cost quantity indicating a cost increase or decrease associated with the changed aspect.","In another embodiment of the present invention, cost estimating engine  determines a sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity analysis determines how sensitive total ownership cost  is with respect to a change in a particular aspect of the complex system. The sensitivity analysis aids in identifying those aspects of the complex system that have a critical impact on total ownership cost as well as those with little or no impact so that organizational resources may be allocated accordingly.","In another embodiment of the present invention, cost estimating engine  provides trade studies with respect to the complex system. This is particularly useful for determining how a change in one aspect of the complex system, (e.g., performance, schedule, technology refreshment) has another aspect of the complex system, preferably, total ownership cost . This is also useful for identifying payback periods, return on investment, and rollover points used in selection of a desired change.","Operation of Cost Estimating Engine","Cost estimating engine  receives inputs  and provides outputs  in order to determine a total ownership cost for the complex system. Via inputs , cost estimating engine  extracts information from associated system contexts (i.e., functional context, physical context, and operational context), system schedules (i.e., development, production, technology refreshment, support, and system availability), and infrastructure (i.e., development, production, and support). The extracted information is processed through cost estimating relationships and heuristics corresponding to components of total ownership cost  and summarized to generate cost estimation outputs .","A complete total ownership cost  computation represents a summarization of all constituent cost breakdown elements including those of research and development costs , production costs , operations and management costs  and system phase-out costs  presented as cost estimation outputs . In various embodiments of the present invention, cost estimation outputs  comprise the summarization of a selected subset of the constituent elements of total ownership costs  (e.g., development cost , one or more of the components of development cost , or any subset of the components from among costs -).","According to the present invention, information associated with a particular aspect of a complex system is extracted from information model . This extracted information includes at least one of the system contexts and an associated scheduling context associated with the particular aspect of the complex system. Costs associated with the extracted information may be obtained based on actual information, calculated based on projected information, or otherwise determined using various cost estimating heuristics.","As described above, these costs are referenced to system context as well as to scheduling context. Thus, these costs are expressed in terms of time, preferably over the system life cycle. Using well known accounting and finance operations, these costs may be expressed as a present value (i.e., today's dollars), as a future value (i.e., in terms of dollars at a particular point in time in the future), or as a past value (i.e., in terms of dollars at a particular point in time in the past).","For example, suppose six complex systems are to be delivered, one at the end of each consecutive year. To greatly simplify the explanation, suppose each of those systems includes a processor. The total ownership cost associated with the processor is determined by estimating the cost of each processor at the time it is procured. Any and all other costs associated with or attributed to the processor are also determined resulting in a stream of costs occurring at various points in time during the system life cycle. Once determined, the cost stream may be expressed as a total cost at a particular point in time (i.e., present value, future value, etc.). In this example, this expression is referred to as a total ownership cost associated with the processor.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0088","num":"0098"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","610","400","130","150","620","400","130","150"]},"In a step , cost estimating engine  may receive at least one aspect of an infrastructure context from product data manager  and embodied in information model . The aspect of the infrastructure context is preferably somewhat related to either the aspect of the system context or the aspect of the schedule context.","In a step , using cost information from information model  and\/or one or more costs projection functions or heuristics, cost estimating engine  determines a total ownership cost  associated with the complex system through the system life cycle. In one embodiment of the present invention, in step , cost estimating engine determines a component of total ownership cost .","In an alternate embodiment of the present invention, cost estimating engine  provides a qualitative indication of the costs associated with the complex system in the absence of cost information or appropriate cost projections, functions, or heuristics.","In one embodiment of the present invention, cost estimating engine  determines one or more system life cycle parameters: 1) hardware procurement cost by configuration; 2) hardware spares\/repairs costs by configuration; 3) difference between two configurations for either of the previous; and 4) total ownership cost for the complex system through its life cycle.","Hardware procurement cost by configuration computes the projected cost of a full configuration of hardware elements at a specified point in time. Projected costs for lower level elements of the configuration such as subsystems and assemblies may also be generated.","Hardware spares\/repairs cost by configuration computes the cost of spares and repairs required to support the configuration for a specified period of time. This supports the cost assessment of various provisioning strategies. As with the hardware procurement cost by configuration use case, projected costs for lower elements may also be generated.","Differences between two configurations for either hardware procurement costs or hardware spares\/repairs may be computed. The costing differences between two configurations or their comparable lower level elements are computed. This capability provides the atomic functionality to support the analysis of tradeoffs between two candidate configurations.","Total ownership cost categorizes the life cycle costs into one or more components and preferably, produces a ranking to identify those elements driving the life cycle cost. Other similar parameters may also be determined. For example, any of costs - (or the components thereof) may be estimated for any aspect of the complex system over the system life cycle.","Cost as an Independent Variable","Application of system engineering principles must contend with increasing emphasis on assessing projects and conducting design trade studies from a system life cycle perspective. This emphasis is driving an increased utilization of commercial-off-the-shelf (\u201cCOTS\u201d) products in the development of complex systems. While this emphasis on COTS products has resulted in substantial and relatively immediate system development and production costs on selected systems, the focus of general systems engineering principles must reside on the useful and operational life of the complex system, where a majority of the total ownership costs reside. A cost as an independent variable (\u201cCAIV\u201d) methodology focuses on these costs. Consistent with this methodology, all COTS selections for inclusion within the complex system, the technology refreshment strategy, and the system supportability strategy must be rationalized within the framework of the goals and objectives established as part of the CAN implementation. Furthermore, all design trade studies and the baseline change review process preferably includes an explicit focus on the total ownership cost. Accordingly, total ownership cost issues are \u201cdovetailed\u201d into the systems engineering process.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0098","num":"0108"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","210","500","590","580"]},"Engineering process  follows conventional systems engineering processes other than for the information it receives from CAIV process. Engineering process  is now described. In a step , functional analysis of the complex system is defined in accordance with system specifications provided by a customer. In a step , based on the functional analysis, an architecture definition is defined that provides the requisite functions to meet the system specifications. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, OSA (Open Scripting\/System Architecture) standards are selected as part of the architecture definition.","In a step , a functional requirements and costs are allocated and potentially updated in an evolutionary manner to constituent elements (e.g., Configuration Item, \u201cCIs\u201d) in the complex system.","In a step , modeling, simulation and prototyping are carried out based on the architecture definition. If any of these operations reveal a flaw in the design, corrective action is taken and various cost performance alternatives are evaluated in a step . In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, COTS products are selected and configuration management begins.","In a step , the design is evaluated to determine whether it achieves critical performance and cost. If not, corrective action is taken and various cost performance alternatives are evaluated in step .","In step , a build test of the design is evaluated to determine whether it achieves critical performance and cost. If not, corrective action is taken and various cost performance alternatives are evaluated in step . In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, adherence to established OSA standards begins.","In a step , a deployment of design is evaluated to determine whether it achieves critical performance and cost. If not, corrective action is taken and various cost performance alternatives are evaluated in step . In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, \u201chot box testing\u201d is initiated to validate correct system configuration.","According to the present invention, the operations of engineering process  are integrated with CAN process . In a step , a commercial market analysis is performed based on the system specifications provided by the customer. This analysis produces technology performance information required to assess the applicability of the product as a candidate solution.","In a step , a cost analysis is performed based on the commercial market analysis as well as the functional analysis determined in step . This cost analysis is utilized in step  to evaluate costs performance alternatives. This cost analysis is also utilized in architecture definition of step  to assist in selecting appropriate components for the complex system","In a step , cost goals are established based on the cost analysis and an assessment of the funding available for the project. The cost goals are utilized in step  to allocate costs for the project to implement various functional requirements.","In a step , a determination is made whether the cost goals are achievable. This determination is preferably made based on the modeling, simulating and prototyping of step .","In a step , if the cost goals are determined achievable, the cost goals are monitored. In addition, subsequent cost analyses are performed for design changes to the complex system. Specifically, the build test and deployment are monitored to ensure that critical performance is met by the complex system while meeting the cost goals. In order to properly monitor the cost goals, commercial market analyses are performed to ensure accurate and up-to-date costs information.","Once the complex system is deployed in step , CAIV process  is iterated to achieve lower costs for subsequent deliveries or system enhancements.","According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, CAIV process  and engineering process  are performed within multi-disciplinary environment  in conjunction with total ownership cost assessment tool . All information gathered and determined by these processes is preferably updated and reflected in information model .","System Implementation","In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, COTS products are used for many of the tools in multi-disciplinary environment . In particular, multi-disciplinary environment  is built on a layered software architecture using a COTS database management system (DBMS) that provides standard database management system services and a COTS PDM system that augments the DBMS with engineering specific information management capabilities. These capabilities include product data management, document management, configuration management, and workflow management.","In one embodiment of the present invention, a custom developed software framework provides an extensible infrastructure for interfacing engineering applications into PDM  and provides a standard application programming interface (API) for engineering application interfaces not traditionally supported by the vendor of PDM . In addition, the software framework provides an opportunity for managing information model  for both the information management system (PDM) and its interfacing applications.","In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, PDM  is implemented using Parametric Technology Corporation's Windchill\u2122 to provide PDM capabilities targeting production deployment. Windchill is built on Oracle\u00ae 8, and provides an out-of-the-box persistence infrastructure that obviates the need to customize software. Windchill incorporates Rational Rose as a modeling tool, and augments Rose's native code generation capability to generate a significant amount of Windchill-specific Java software as well as the database schema for information model . Windchill's architecture is web-centric. This facilitates sharing of information among distributed sites (such as customers and contractors) and requires no special client software installation beyond a web browser. Windchill is also extensible; it provides an extensive Java class library as a foundation for custom development. Windchill includes, for example, a product model \u201cpart\u201d class with basic functions and a graphical user interface. While extending the \u201cpart\u201d class to support attributes required by total ownership cost assessment tool  still requires custom development, the necessary Java class library may be used as a foundation, and the final customized extended \u201cpart\u201d class fits well within the well-defined Windchill framework.","Information model  is preferably developed by an integrated team of system and software engineers, cost engineers, hardware engineers and program managers using an Object-Oriented (OO) analysis process to specify the requirements associated therewith. Preferably, a Catalysis OO analysis methodology is applied to specify requirements for the complex system. Among other things, Catalysis extends the Object Modeling Technique (OMT) with a rigorous specification of the behaviors of the complex system being modeled. These techniques are generally well known.","In one embodiment of the present invention, a Rational Rose toolset is used to capture and document the requirements using both a Unified Modeling Language (UML) and an Object Constraint Language (OCL). These requirements are mapped into information model  and utilized to build the software product model framework and custom applications.","In an alternate embodiment of the present invention, Computervision Optegra\u2122 provides the capabilities of PDM . Optegra is built on top of the Oracle\u00ae 7 Relational Database Management System (RDBMS). Information model  is built within Optegra using the Computervision Locator client. While configurations may also be specified using Locator, a streamlined technique using Microsoft Excel is preferably implemented to specify the physical structure, components, and associated attributes of a configuration and to export a text file that may be imported into Optegra.","In an alternate embodiment of the present invention, total ownership cost assessment tool  is implemented in one or more Microsoft Excel spreadsheets. However, this embodiment lacks scalability and flexibility as well as results in a labor-intensive process to coordinate cost impact assessments of design tradeoffs.","In one embodiment of the present invention, Microsoft Access is tailored to include a user interface for migrating information from PDM  for importing the files into Access, and for producing the corresponding report in a structured format.","While the present invention has been described in terms of a preferred embodiment, other embodiments and variations are within the scope of the following claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The present invention is described with reference to the accompanying drawings.
