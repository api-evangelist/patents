No. 10\/452,996, filed Jun. 30, 2003.","In the past, there has been a lack of consistent interface between telecommunication service providers' networks and their customers' premises wiring. For instance, telephone service often has been hard-wired to the customer's premises wiring by a variety of methods, rendering service calls unnecessarily complicated and intrusive. Such services calls often required service personnel to enter the customer premises, creating logistical issues for the telecommunication service provider and increasing customer frustration. Moreover, the lack of any discrete interface between the customer's premises wiring and the provider's network sometimes forced the use of proprietary hardware from the customer's perspective and limited the provider's flexibility when considering options to upgrade or otherwise modify the network.","This problem has been exacerbated by the increased number of telecommunication services provided to customer premises. For instance, many telecommunication service providers now provide xDSL service to their customers, but those skilled in the art will recognize that there is little (if any) standardization among providers. Thus, implementations vary widely, each requiring different hardware and software configurations to be operable, and customers have little flexibility in choosing hardware. For instance, ADSL service frequently is deployed differently than VDSL service, and ADSL deployments themselves can vary from provider to provider. Likewise, telephone wiring schemes can vary widely among customer premises, requiring different types of hardware to enable and enhance services, such as filters to control interference, and the like. Further, a typical customer premises has multiple wiring networks, including one for video distribution (cable, satellite, VDSL, and the like), one for data distribution (Ethernet or the like, perhaps with a connection to an xDSL modem or cable modem), and another for telephone service, and these networks generally operate independently of one another. And if a customer wants to add a new telecommunication service, an expensive service call (often including one or more new cable drops and\/or the installation of new premises wiring) likely will be required.","Accordingly, there is a need in the art for methods and systems to address these and other problems.","Embodiments of the invention thus provide methods and systems for providing telecommunication information to a transport medium internal to a customer premises. In one set of embodiments, a network interface device is provided. The network interface device comprises an isolation device adapted to isolate the internal transport medium from a transport medium external to the customer premises such that operational changes to one of the internal and external transport media do not affect the other of the internal and external transport media. A first interface is coupled with the isolation device and adapted to communicate with the external transport medium, which is in communication with a distribution point. A second interface is coupled with the isolation device and adapted to communicate with the internal transport medium. A microserver is disposed external to the customer premises and coupled with the first and second interfaces. The microserver is adapted to receive telecommunication information from the external transport medium and includes software for implementing a predetermined function over the internal transport medium by processing the received telecommunication information.","In some such embodiments, the isolation device and microserver may be disposed within a common housing, which may be disposed on an exterior wall of the customer premises. In addition, the network interface device may comprise an addressable application device coupled with the microserver that is adapted to receive the processed telecommunication information and to execute a defined application as an aid to implementing the predetermined function over the internal transport medium. The addressable application device may be disposed external to the customer premises and may be disposed within a common housing with the isolation device and microserver.","A variety of different microservers may be used in different embodiments. For example, in one embodiment, the microserver may comprise an authentication microserver adapted to verify that the predetermined function is authorized for the customer premises. In another embodiment, the microserver comprises a file-transfer microserver adapted to transfer an electronic file of information to or from the network interface device. In a further embodiment, the microserver comprises a dynamic host configuration protocol microserver adapted to manage an internet-protocol address assignment to a device coupled with the internal transport medium; the internet-protocol address assignment may comprise a private internet-protocol address assignment or may comprise a public internet-protocol address assignment. In another embodiment, the microserver comprises a code-processing microserver adapted to receive code and process the code for use by another component of the network interface device; in addition, the microserver may further comprise a webserver microserver adapted to render a display of incoming web-page information suitable for presentation with a web-browser enabled device. In some instances, the microserver may comprise an email alert microserver adapted to initiate an alert in response to receipt of an email message at an email account. The microserver may alternatively comprise an instant-messenger microserver adapted to provide instant-messaging functionality over the internal transport medium. In one embodiment, the microserver comprises a webserver microserver and an advertising microserver. The webserver microserver is adapted to render a display of web-page information suitable for presentation with a web-browser enabled device and an advertising microserver adapted to overlay an advertisement over the display of web-page information. The microserver may comprise a wireless microserver adapted to provide an interface between wireless communications within the customer premises to the external transport medium. In another embodiment the microserver comprises an RF power-level microserver adapted to monitor an RF power level of telecommunication information received at the first interface. In a further embodiment, the microserver comprises a test-access microserver adapted to verify proper functioning of another component of the network interface device. In still another embodiment, the network interface device further comprises a webserver microserver coupled with the microserver and adapted to provide a customer-based graphical user interface for implementing software configuration changes of the microserver.","In a second set of embodiments, a method provides telecommunication information to a transport medium internal to a customer premises. The internal transport medium is isolated from a transport medium external to the customer premises such that operational changes to one of the internal and external transport media do not affect the other of the internal and external transport media. The telecommunication information is received from the external transport medium and is selectively processed with a microserver disposed external to the customer premises. Thereafter, a predetermined function is implemented over the internal transport medium with the processed telecommunication information.","In some instances, the method may further comprise transmitting the processed telecommunication information to an addressable application disposed external to the customer premises. The predetermined function may then be implemented by implementing an application over the internal transport medium with the addressable application device.","There are a variety of ways in which the received telecommunication information may be selectively processed in different embodiments. For example, in one embodiment it is verified that the predetermined function is authorized for the customer premises. In another embodiment, an electronic file of information is transferred. In a further embodiment, an internet-protocol address assignment to a device coupled with the internal transport medium is managed. In a different embodiment, code is received and processed for use in implementing the predetermined function; in some such instances, a display of incoming web-page information is rendered to be suitable for presentation with a web-browser enabled device. In some cases, an alert is initiated in response to receipt of an email message at an email account. In other cases, instant-messaging functionality is provided over the internal transport medium. In a particular embodiment, a display of web-page information is rendered suitable for presentation with a web-browser enabled device and an advertisement is overlaid over the display. In another embodiment, an interface between wireless communications within the customer premises to the external transport medium is provided. In a further embodiment, an RF power level of the telecommunication information received from the external transport medium is monitored. In still another embodiment, a customer-based graphical user interface is provided for implementing configuration changes of software governing how the received telecommunication information is selectively processed.","Embodiments of the invention are directed to methods and systems for providing telecommunications services by integrating one or more microservers with a network interface device. As used herein, a \u201cmicroserver\u201d is intended to refer to any device that uses a combination of software and hardware to meet a predefined need. For example, a microserver may be programmed to perform a specified limited set of functions and may take a structural form such as an erasable programmable read-only memory (\u201cEPROM\u201d) device, electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (\u201cEEPROM\u201d) device, programmable logic device (\u201cPLD\u201d), erasable programmable logic device (\u201cEPLD\u201d), complex programmable logic device (\u201cCPLD\u201d), field-programmable gate array (\u201cFPGA\u201d), and the like. The scope of telecommunications services that may be provided is broad, and several specific examples of services that may be provided by integrating one or more microservers with a network interface device are discussed in greater detail below.","In embodiments of the invention, the telecommunications services may be provided through the use of a network interface system that is capable of interfacing between a customer premises and a telecommunication service provider's network. In some instances such an interfacing capability is performed by elements of a \u201cdemarcation device,\u201d and specific examples of how the demarcation capabilities arise in different embodiments of the network interface systems are discussed below. Merely by way of illustration, such demarcation capabilities may derive from elements comprised by the following examples of demarcation devices: a set-top box, which may be used inter alia as an interface between a customer's video appliance and a provider's video network; broadband modems, including xDSL modems, cable modems, and wireless modems, each of which may be used to provide video and\/or data to a customer premises; integrated access devices, which may, for example, translate between Voice over IP (\u201cVoIP\u201d) signals and traditional telephone signals, allowing traditional telephones to connect to a VoIP network; devices compatible with the session initiation protocol (\u201cSIP\u201d); and the like. One particular demarcation device whose elements may be used to provide demarcation capabilities includes a network interface device (\u201cNID\u201d), described in detail below. In some instances, a demarcation device may additionally include other capabilities, including, for example, the capability to separate received telecommunication information into discrete sets; the capability to process certain of the separated sets independently from other sets; and\/or the capability to transmit different of the separated sets to different locations, perhaps through the use of different interfaces. Integration of one or more microservers with the NID has significant advantages when compared with solutions in which microservers are separate from the NID. For instance, separate microservers may require access to a customer premises for services and may be moved around and removed from the customer premises. By integrating the microservers with the NID, they are easily accessible by a technician and may be integrated in a secure fashion as described below that makes them nonremovable by others.","In describing embodiments of the invention, references to \u201ccustomer premises\u201d are intended to refer to physical structures under the control of a customer through ownership, leasehold, or any other property right. The term is not intended to encompass open real property external to the physical structures, even if such open real property is also under the control of the customer. Such a definition reflects differences in accessibility to the physical structures and surrounding open real property. Access to the physical structures generally requires the presence of the customer or a representative of the customer, while access to the surrounding open real property may be obtained by permission from customer, through an easement, or by other means that does not require the physical presence of the customer. Thus, for example, in the case of a residential customer, the customer premises may correspond to the customer's home, but does not include the yard surrounding the home. Access to the yard may be obtained even when the customer is not home, such as when the customer is at work, is shopping, or is otherwise unavailable to be physically present.","As used herein, the term \u201ctelecommunication information\u201d is broadly defined to include any information that can be transmitted or carried by a telecommunication service provider's network (e.g., the Public Switched Telephone Network or \u201cPSTN\u201d) or by any other telecommunication network, including but not limited to the Internet. Such information includes, for example, voice signals (e.g., Plain Old Telephone Service or \u201cPOTS,\u201d as the term is known to those skilled in the art), audio and video signals (encoded in any standard and\/or proprietary, digital and\/or analog format now known or hereafter developed, using any of a variety of means known to those skilled in the art, such as HDTV, NTSC, PAL, and SECAM formatting, as well as, for example any of the MPEG digital encoding and\/or compression algorithms), and data. Such data can be formatted according any of a variety of protocols familiar in the art, including in particular the Internet Protocol.","In this application, the term \u201ctelecommunication service provider\u201d refers to any entity that provides telecommunication service to a customer's premises, including, merely by way of example, incumbent local exchange carriers, competitive local exchange carriers, cable television carriers, and satellite providers, to name a few. In contrast, the term \u201ctelecommunication information provider,\u201d means any entity that is capable of serving as a source of telecommunication information. In many cases, a particular entity may be considered both a telecommunication service provider and a telecommunication information provider, for instance, when a local exchange carrier provides Internet service to a customer, as well as the external transport medium attached to that customer's premises. In other cases, the two may be separate entities. For instance, according to certain embodiments of the invention, a cable television provider could contract with a local exchange carrier to provide broadcast television signals to a customer premises using the local exchange carrier's network and\/or an external transport medium operated by the local exchange carrier.","The term \u201ctelecommunication information set\u201d is intended to describe a discrete subset of the telecommunication information transmitted across a particular transport medium and\/or received by a device having demarcation capabilities. Generally, the telecommunication information that is classified part of a particular information set shares a common characteristic. Merely by way of example, an information set can comprise telecommunication information of a particular type, such as voice, IP data, encoded video, and such; information associated with a particular application, such as information assigned to a specific IP port, as is known in the art; information addressed to or received from a particular device or network segment; information received within a particular reception window; and the like.","In certain embodiments, demarcation capabilities can support the one-way flow of telecommunication information, such as exemplified by the case of a simple set top box, which can receive data representing a video signal, decode that data, and transmit a video signal to an attached television. In other embodiments, demarcation capabilities can support bidirectional flow of telecommunication information. One such example is an xDSL modem, which allows the transmission of data both to and from a customer premises. In still other embodiments, the demarcation capability can support both unidirectional and bidirectional information flows simultaneously, depending on the type of telecommunication information transmitted or the source of the information.","The demarcation capabilities may also function to isolate the telecommunication service provider's network from the network at the customer premises. As described in detail below, the service provider's network is one example of an \u201cexternal transport medium\u201d and the customer's network is one example of an \u201cinternal transport medium.\u201d The external transport medium and internal transport medium are each examples of a \u201ctransport medium,\u201d which is used herein to describe any cable, wire, or other medium capable of carrying telecommunication information, including, but not limited to, twisted pair copper wiring (shielded or unshielded, including, for example, unshielded cables complying with industry-standard categories 3, 5, 5e and 6), optical fiber, and coaxial cable. Other examples of transport media include universal serial bus (\u201cUSB\u201d) cable, cable complying with the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers' (\u201cIEEE\u201d) 1394 standard, as well as any medium capable of complying with the many local-area networking standards known in the art. The preceding are examples of transport media that comprise physical media, but the invention is not limited to the use of physical media. In other embodiments, a transport medium may comprise any of a wide variety of wireless transmissions, including infra-red transmissions, radio frequency (\u201cRF\u201d) transmissions, and transmissions complying with standards developed by any of the IEEE's working groups governing wireless communication (e.g., the 802.11, 802.15, 802.16 and 802.20 working groups), as well as point-to-point microwave, satellite, cellular\/PCS, and\/or ultra wideband transmissions, among others.","In certain embodiments, demarcation capabilities can define an active demarcation point, serving to isolate the external transport medium from the internal transport medium (perhaps via an isolation device, discussed below), such that operational changes in one network do not affect the other network. \u201cOperational changes\u201d can include any changes in the structure, topology, format, protocol, bandwidth, media, and\/or other operational parameters of a network. This isolation feature can provide many benefits; for instance, the demarcation capability can be realized by a disclosed interface between a customer premises and a provider's network, allowing the provider to implement changes in its network without disrupting the service provided to the customer.","Likewise, the isolation of the internal transport medium from the external transport medium can allow for any variety of customer premises equipment (\u201cCPE\u201d) to be used at the customer premises without fear that the equipment might be incompatible with a particular telecommunication service provider's standards. \u201cCustomer premises equipment\u201d and \u201cCPE\u201d are intended to refer to any device that sends, receives, or otherwise utilizes telecommunication information. Moreover, the demarcation capabilities might serve to couple a plurality of external and\/or internal transport media, allowing interoperation among them all, and to provide the same isolation features among all of these media.","In this way, certain aspects of the demarcation capabilities can allow for sales of a wide variety of CPE on a consumer electronics model, instead of the proprietary model necessitated by many of today's telecommunication networks, where, for example, differing implementations of xDSL among providers virtually force consumers to purchase modems from the providers to ensure compatibility between the modem and the provider's xDSL implementation. By isolating the topologies of the external and internal transport media, embodiments of the present invention can create a disclosed interface between the provider's network and the customer's network, allowing much greater flexibility in both the provider's networking options and the customer's choice of telecommunication appliances. Those skilled in the art will recognize that these and many other benefits result from embodiments of the invention.","In accordance with other embodiments, the isolation abilities also allow insulation between different transport media coupled to the internal and external transport media in order. This may permit, for example, preventing unwanted telecommunication information of one network from entering the other network. For instance, a demarcation capability of a network interface system in accordance with particular embodiments can serve to prevent propagation of certain telecommunication information from an internal network (including particular signals or frequencies) into one or more external transport media, preventing interference in the internal transport medium from interfering with the telecommunication service provider's network. In similar fashion, demarcation capabilities can prevent the contamination of the internal transport medium with unwanted information from the external medium, interference between two or more external transport media coupled, and unwanted interference or crosstalk between multiple internal media.","In some embodiments, the isolation of the internal transport medium from the external transport medium resulting from the demarcation capabilities also allows enhanced security to be provided for the customer and\/or to control customer access to certain features or services. For instance, those skilled in the art will recognize that demarcation capabilities can prevent unauthorized access to the customer's data network, such as by a telecommunication service provider and\/or a third party, or can screen or filter telecommunication information entering or leaving the customer's premises. This enables features such as parental controls to be placed on incoming and outgoing information, as well as filtering of outgoing sensitive information, such as credit card information and the like.","Further, according to certain embodiments, the demarcation capabilities may be used to define a consolidation point for all telecommunication information entering or leaving the customer premises. Definition of such a consolidation point permits a variety of enhanced features to be provided to the entire premises, including features such as caller identification, premises-wide telephone, video and data distribution, content on demand, including video, audio, and\/or data on demand, and the like. These and other features resulting from demarcation capabilities also allow for a variety of new and useful telecommunication applications to be provided to customers. Specific details of some exemplary applications are discussed below; given the disclosure herein, those skilled in the art can appreciate the wide variety of such applications that are possible using various embodiments of the invention.","In a number of embodiments, the demarcation capability is applied specifically to a customer premises, thereby separating a transport medium internal to the customer premises from a transport medium external to the customer premises. Moreover, the demarcation is exploited to provide one or more microservers in a configuration that permits services to be provided in accordance with the programming of the microservers to the entire premises. In addition, in some instances one or more addressable application devices may also be provided such as described in the '597 application, with the microservers programmed to interact in combination with the application devices to provide the specified services. For example, the addressable application devices may be adapted to interface with the transport medium internal to the customer premises, and the microservers may be adapted to selectively process telecommunication information originating from the transport medium external to the customer premises. Applications may be implemented through transmission of the processed telecommunication information from the processors to the addressable application devices.","There are numerous organizational configurations for the NID that may be used in accordance with embodiments of the invention. Several examples are shown schematically in , although such examples are not intended to be exhaustive. A relatively simple arrangement is shown in , which includes a distribution point  in communication with a device  having demarcation capabilities via an external transport medium . In this example, the external transport medium  comprises a transport medium external to a customer premises . The device  is adapted to interface with an internal transport medium . In this example, the internal transport medium  comprises a transport medium internal to the customer premises .","In one sense, the distribution point  may be considered to be a source of telecommunication information transmitted to the customer premises and a recipient of telecommunication information transmitted from the customer premises; as described below, however, the distribution point  need not be either the ultimate source nor the ultimate recipient of telecommunication information. In certain embodiments, the distribution point  may correspond to a telecommunication service provider's local office. In other embodiments, the distribution point may correspond to another network element in the service provider's network, such as a remote termination cabinet and\/or a digital subscriber line access multiplier (\u201cDSLAM\u201d). More generally, the distribution point  may correspond to any facility operated by a telecommunication service provider that is capable of transmitting telecommunication information to, and\/or receiving telecommunication information from, a customer premises .","In general, distribution points can be classified, inter alia, as discrete distribution points or complex distribution points. With respect to a particular information set, a discrete distribution point often transmits only the necessary or desired information to the NID. In contrast, a complex distribution point can transmit the entire information set to the NID. The contrast may be illustrated with regard to video distribution: A discrete distribution point may perform channel switching (at the request of the demarcation device ), encoding and sending only the desired channel information to the demarcation device . In contrast, a complex distribution point might rely upon the demarcation device  to perform all channel switching. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that each scheme presents relative advantages and disadvantages.","Distribution point  can be capable of transmitting and\/or receiving any type of telecommunication information to\/from the NID, and such telecommunication information can be organized into a plurality of telecommunication information sets, as necessary. For ease of description,  does not show any additional sources or recipients of telecommunication information in communication with distribution point , but, those skilled in the art will recognize that, in many embodiments, distribution point  can be coupled to multiple customer premises  (perhaps via a NID at each customer premises) and often is neither the ultimate source nor the ultimate recipient of telecommunication information. Instead, distribution point  usually serves as an intermediary between one or more customer premises  and one or more larger telecommunication networks and\/or telecommunication information providers, which, as discussed above, can include cable television networks, telephone networks, data networks, and the like. Further, many such networks (as well as, in some embodiments, distribution point ) can be coupled to the Internet, so that distribution point  can serve as a gateway between customer premises  and any source and\/or recipient of telecommunication information that has a connection to the Internet. The interconnection of telecommunication networks is well known in the art, although it is specifically noted that distribution point  can be configured to transmit telecommunication information to (and receive telecommunication information from) virtually any source or recipient of telecommunication information, through either direct or indirect (e.g., through the Internet) communication. Merely by way of example, a distribution point  can transmit video signals received from a television programming provider to customer premises equipment, as described in the applications referenced above. In other embodiments, distribution point  can be in communication with one or more other customer locations, allowing for private virtual circuits, vlan tags and wavelengths, or rf connections between customer premises  and those locations.","In configuration , the NID can serve as the interface between external transport medium  and customer premises . As shown in , usually the demarcation device  comprised by the NID is interfaced with both the internal transport medium  and with the external transport medium . As conceptually illustrated in , demarcation device  may be attached to an external wall of the customer premises . Such a configuration provides many advantages. For instance, if the telecommunication service provider desires to upgrade or otherwise change its network, including, perhaps, external transport medium , a technician can perform any necessary changes at demarcation device  as appropriate without entering the customer premises. Coupled with the ability of some demarcation devices  to isolate the telecommunication service provider's network from the customer's premises, this can allow the telecommunication service provider to effect substantial changes in it network without impacting or inconveniencing the customer in any respect. This could, for example, allow the telecommunication service provider to upgrade external transmission medium  from a copper twisted pair to optical fiber, without requiring any topological changes inside the customer premises . Of course, demarcation device  may be located at a variety of alternative locations, either within customer premises  or at a facility operated by the telecommunication service provider. In addition, as previously noted and as discussed in further detail below, a NID may also be divided, with different portions situated at different locations, according to the requirements of the implementation.","The NID is configured so that it may communicate with CPE , which may be located interior to the customer premises through internal transport medium . Such communication is used to implement functionality defined by microservers comprised by NID over the CPE  in accordance with telecommunication information received from the distribution point . In addition, the demarcation device  may communicate directly with CPE  to implement other functions. While the internal transport medium  may comprise any of the media discussed above, in one embodiment it comprises existing telephone wiring in customer premises  and, in some embodiments, is capable of carrying voice, data and video information. For instance, as described in Edward H. Frank and Jack Holloway, \u201cConnecting the Home with a Phone Line Network Chip Set,\u201d (IEEE, March-April 2000), which is incorporated herein by reference, the Home Phoneline Networking Alliance (\u201cHPNA\u201d) standards allow for simultaneous transmission of both voice information and Ethernet frames across twisted-pair copper telephone wiring. In addition to the transmission of telecommunication information through the NID, telecommunication information may be transmitted via the reverse path to the distribution point . Such telecommunication information received at the distribution point  may be transmitted to an information recipient, such as a service provider. For example, such a transmission may be used to request a pay-per-view movie or the like. Alternatively, telecommunication information received at the distribution point  may be transmitted across the Internet, such as may be used in the case of sending an email message.","In certain embodiments, the NID can receive state information from a control point , which is shown in the illustrated embodiment as associated with distribution point . In certain instances, control point  can be software and\/or hardware operated by a telecommunication service provider for controlling certain features of the operation of the NID. For instance, control point  can instruct the NID to provide (or cease to provide) particular applications and\/or telecommunication services to the customer premises . Control point  can also provide other directions to the NID through the demarcation device , including, for instance, instructions to save or record a particular information set (e.g., data representing a movie), such that the information set may quickly (and, in some cases), repeatedly be transmitted to customer premises , allowing the provision of voice, data, video, etc. on demand.","Often, it may be beneficial to allow the customer to provide state information to the NID. Thus, in certain embodiments, control point  may have a web interface, such that the customer or any authorized person, such as an employee of the telecommunication service provider or telecommunication information provider, may log onto the web interface and configure options for the NID, perhaps resulting in state commands being transmitted from the distribution point  to the NID. In other embodiments, control point  can be a web interface to the NID itself, allowing the customer or other authorized person to configure the NID directly. In still other embodiments, control point  can communicate with the NID through an application programming interface (\u201cAPI\u201d). Hence, in some embodiments, control point  can interface with the NID through an API.","In many such embodiments, the API comprises a logical interface, in which case it may include a set of software, hardware, or firmware routines or libraries that may be invoked programmatically to configure or relay information to internal components of the NID. In that sense, then, control point  can be understood to be a program running on a computer, perhaps located at distribution point  or customer premises , among other locations, that provides state information to components of the NID via a software API. In other embodiments, the API comprises a physical interface to permit it to be accessed locally, such as by a service technician. For example, the service technician could visit property outside the customer premises , attach a laptop computer or other device to the physical interface, and upload information to the components of the NID, including perhaps both state information, as well as other telecommunication information. In still other embodiments, components of the NID can accept state information through other means, including, for example, through a web interface by receiving a specially formatted electronic message. This is especially the case in embodiments where one of the microservers comprised by the NID includes as a web server, as discussed below.","Those skilled in the art will appreciate that certain control methods are more well-suited to certain services than to others. For instance, with respect to cable television services, the same set of information may be broadcast to many households, and the NID is well-suited to control access to those services, allowing for greater efficiency in the providing of such services. In contrast, video on demand services may instead be controlled at a distribution point  or elsewhere such that a particular NID only receives video-on-demand information if the customer already has requested and been authorized to receive that service. In such cases, the NID may not need to provide access control functions with respect to that service.","According to some embodiments, the NID can implement either of these access control schemes, or both in combination, as well as others. Moreover, the NID can, in some cases, be configured to support a plurality of schemes transparently. For instance, the customer could request a service from the NID, perhaps using one of the methods discussed above, and the NID could relay that request to the appropriate telecommunication service provider and\/or telecommunication information provider, as well as reconfigure itself to allow access to that service, if necessary. Of course, the NID can also be configured to take any necessary validating or authenticating action, such as notifying the distribution point  and\/or control point  that the service has been requested, and, optionally, receiving a return confirmation that the service has been authorized.","In accordance with other embodiments, state information sent to the NID can include one or more commands to interface with a particular CPE in a certain way. For instance, state information could instruct the NID to turn on and\/or off certain lights or equipment, perhaps via additional equipment, or to arm, disarm or otherwise monitor and\/or configure a home security system. State information can also include operational data such as an IP address, routing information, and the like, to name but a few examples.","State information can further include instructions to modify one or more security settings of the NID. Merely by way of example, in certain embodiments, the NID can include a computer virus scanner, and state information can include updated virus definitions and\/or heuristics. Likewise, the NID often will be configured with access controls, such as to prevent unauthorized access through the NID by third parties. State information can include instructions on how to deal with particular third-party attempts to access the NID or internal transport medium . Those skilled in the art will recognize as well that some security settings may specify the level of access the customer has to the functions of the NID, such as to prevent unauthorized use of certain telecommunication services, and that these settings also may be modified by received state information.","There are a variety of ways in which the various access-control and security functionalities of the NID discussed above may be implemented. In different embodiments, these functionalities may be performed by the demarcation device  and\/or by other components such as some of the microservers described below that may additionally be comprised by the NID. Moreover, the state information that manages such functionalities may sometimes be sent periodically to the NID to ensure that it is current. Those skilled in the art will also recognize that state information can be considered a subset of the broader category of telecommunication information.","Turning now to , configuration \u2032 is illustrative of certain embodiments that can provide multiple NIDs at customer premises . A first NID A comprises an application device A in addition to a demarcation device A, while a second NID B is shown comprising a demarcation device B but no application device. These differences between the two NIDs are intended to illustrate that some functionality may be provided with an application device that is separate from a NID, such as in instances where the application device is instead comprised by the CPE. Alternatively, some functionality may be provided without any application device at all, such as in instances where the one or more microservers comprised by the NID provide all the desired functionality. In the illustration of , the application device A is shown as separated from the corresponding demarcation device A, although one or more of the multiple NIDs  may alternatively comprise structures in which they are integrated. An example of such integration of an application device with an application device is described in connection with . In instances where a NID  has separated demarcation- and application-device components, the separate components may both be affixed to an exterior wall of the customer premises . This has the same advantages discussed previously in connection with NIDs alone, namely ease of upgrading or otherwise changing the network by a telecommunication service provider, but applies also to the application device A. In other instances, the separate components may be provided in different locations, such as by providing the demarcation device A at a facility operated by the telecommunication service provider while keeping the application device A on the exterior wall of the customer premises .","The application device A may include a service interface A for addressing the application device A. The service interface A may comprise a physical interface, such as a universal serial bus (\u201cUSB\u201d), FireWire (IEEE 1394), registered jack 11 (\u201cRJ-11\u201d), registered-jack 45 (\u201cRJ-45\u201d), serial, coax, or other physical interface known to those of skill in the art. In other embodiments, the service interface A may comprise a logical interface, such as may be provided through a logical connection with an IP address.","The addressability of the application device A may be used in various embodiments to change the state of the application device A. Such state information can include any set of data or other information that may be interpreted by the application device A as defining operational instructions. This includes, for example, commands to process certain information sets in certain ways, e.g., to provide protocol conversion, to allow transmission of the information set, to deny transmission of the information set, to direct transmission on a particular interface, and the like, as well as commands to provide or cease providing a particular service, such as to provide access to a pay-per-view movie or an additional telephone line. Thus, in certain aspects, a telecommunication service provider can control the telecommunications services provided to a customer in several ways. First, the provider can only transmit a telecommunication information set to a NID  if the user of that device is authorized to receive the application service associated with that information set. Alternatively, the service provider could send one or more telecommunications services to a customer's NID A, and rely on the state of the component application device A to prevent unauthorized access to those services.","Application device A may be in communication with CPE A through internal transport medium A, and implementation of the applications provided by application device A can thus be achieved with telecommunication information received and transmitted by demarcation devices A. In addition, demarcation device A can be in direct communication with CPE A through internal transport medium A, and demarcation device B can likewise be in direct communication with CPE B through internal transport medium B. Each of the NIDs  may be provided in communication with a common distribution point  through their respective demarcation devices . In particular, demarcation device B can communicate with distribution point  through external transport medium B which, as illustrated by , can simply be spliced into external transport medium A, such as by using an active or passive splitting device, which could be optical, as in a fiber environment, or electrical. If desired, demarcation devices  and\/or distribution point  can include control logic to prevent unauthorized access by demarcation device A to telecommunication information sent to or received from demarcation device B, and vice versa. In other embodiments, external transport medium B could run directly from demarcation device B to distribution point . In still other embodiments, external transport medium B could be omitted, with demarcation device B coupled to demarcation device A, which could then provide connectivity between demarcation device B and distribution point  through external transport medium A.","Configuration \u2032 can be used in a variety of implementations. For instance, if customer premises  is a multiple-dwelling unit (\u201cMDU\u201d), separate NIDs  can be provided for each separate resident or family. Alternatively, a single demarcation device, perhaps with more interfaces, can service multiple dwelling or business units. In such implementations, especially when external transport medium B does not directly couple demarcation device B to distribution point , demarcation devices A, B can include security functionality, for example to prevent telecommunication signals intended for CPE A from reaching CPE B and vice versa. In some embodiments, demarcation devices  can provide a variety of such security, encryption, and authentication functions.","The description above provides a specific example of a more general class of embodiments in which multiple NIDs  are daisy-chained together, using any of the telecommunication media discussed herein. This allows a telecommunication service provider to provide service to additional customers without requiring any additional external transport media. Similarly, NIDs  at multiple premises can be coupled together, such that if the external transport medium coupled to one of the NIDs  fails, that device can maintain connectivity to the distribution point through its connection to another NID . A NID  in accordance with specific embodiments thus may have an interface for securely connecting to one or more additional NIDs , and thus forming a mesh network of NIDs and\/or distribution points. This allows a particular NID  to serve as a conduit between another interface device and a distribution point without allowing any unauthorized reception of telecommunication information intended for the connected interface device. This secure interface can be included, for instance, in a portion of the NID  that is inaccessible to customers, as illustrated in  and described below.","In other embodiments, a single customer premises  might have connections to a plurality of telecommunication service providers. For example, turning now to , configuration \u2033 includes a distribution point A coupled to a first NID A via external transport medium A and also includes a second distribution point B coupled to a second NID B via external transport medium B. Merely by way of example, distribution point B could, for example, be associated with a cable television provider, while distribution point A could be associated with a telephone company. In addition, configuration \u2033 illustrates that multiple CPE A and C may be coupled with a single NID A. This may be done with multiple internal transport media A and C as illustrated by , or may alternatively be done through a common internal transport medium as discussed below. Thus, for example, CPE A could be a telephone, CPE C could be a fax machine, and CPE B could be a television.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 1C","b":["107","107","104","108","109","111","107","104","107","109","109","108","109","111","111","124","124","109","109","109","107"]},"In another alternative embodiment, such as configuration \u2032\u2033 illustrated in , a NID  can provide connectivity to a plurality of distribution points A and B, as well to a plurality of CPE A, B, and C. The connectivity of a single NID  to a plurality of distribution points A and B and to a plurality of CPE A, B, and C may be effected through attachments for multiple internal transport media A, B, and C and for multiple external transport media A and B. Moreover, as illustrated by , each distribution point A and B may be associated with a different control point A and B, respectively. In alternative embodiments, a single control point  could provide configuration information to the NID  with respect to both distribution points A and B.","Turning now to , another exemplary configuration \u2033\u2033, is presented in accordance with certain embodiments of the invention. In exemplary system \u2033\u2033, the NID  is shown having a configuration similar to that of , but with a plurality of application devices  that are provided separate from the NID . Two of the application devices A and B are provided external to the customer premises  and have service interfaces A and B. The third application interface C is provide interior to the customer premises, illustrating that it is not a requirement that all of the application devices  comprised by the NID  be disposed external to the customer premises. Instead of communication of the NID  with a plurality of control points  being effected through a plurality of distribution points ,  shows an embodiment in which such communication is achieved with a common distribution point . This distribution point , which may be operated by a telecommunication service provider, can be in communication with one or more telecommunication information providers A and B. Each telecommunication information provider A and B can be the source or recipient of one or more telecommunication information sets, each of which may be associated with a particular telecommunication service. Each of the telecommunication information sets may thus be transmitted to, or received from, the distribution point . Distribution point  can also transmit these information sets to, or received them from, the NID  through demarcation device , via external transport medium . Such an configuration \u2033\u2033 thus exploits a capability of the NID  to process a plurality of such information sets in a variety of ways, as discussed below.","In certain embodiments, each telecommunication information provider A or B may have an individual control point B or C. In some such embodiments, control points B and C can be in communication with the NID  via distribution point  or, alternatively, could have a separate means of communication with the NID , such as via a modem and telephone line. Thus, in some embodiments, the NID  can receive state information from each control point B, and C through the demarcation device . As discussed above, state information can direct the behavior of the demarcation device  and\/or application devices  comprised by the NID , in particular with respect to how to handle telecommunication information to implement various applications on the CPE A, B, and\/or C. Such state information may be received by the NID  over the external transport medium  or through the service interfaces A and B of the application devices A and B. In some embodiments, the NID  can be configured to accept state information related only to the telecommunication information and\/or services provided by the telecommunication information provider sending the state information. In this way, the NID  can be protected against inadvertent or malicious misconfiguration, which could interrupt a telecommunication service provided by another telecommunication information provider. Likewise, the NID  could be configured to automatically request updated state information from control point A associated with distribution point  in the case of misconfiguration, and control point A could maintain a master set of configuration information to be able to accommodate such a request.","In other embodiments, telecommunication information providers A and B may not have an associated control point. In such embodiments, telecommunication information providers A and B can send state information to control point A, perhaps via distribution point A, and control point A can relay that state information to the demarcation device  (again, perhaps through distribution point ). In this way the telecommunication service provider can control which state information is transmitted to the NID .","In certain embodiments, the demarcation device  can submit a request for state information to one or more control points A, B, and\/or C, perhaps via distribution point . Such a request might be made if, for instance, the customer would like to watch a pay-per-view movie. The appropriate control point, e.g., B, could then provide the proper state information to the NID  as described above, allowing transmission of the movie to customer premises .","As exemplified by configuration  in , embodiments of the invention enable a single NID  to serve multiple CPE A-F, each of which can comprise a different appliance, at a single customer premises . For instance, CPE A can be a computer with an Ethernet interface, CPE B can be a telephone, CPE C can be a video game system, CPE D can be a set-top box attached to a television, CPE E can be a computer with an HPNA interface, and CPE F can be a laptop computer equipped with a wireless network card.","Also as illustrated by configuration , the single NID  can support multiple network topologies. For instance, the NID  can serve as a hub for a point-to-point network topology, with multiple point-to-point connections to CPE A and B via internal transport media A and B, respectively. In addition, the NID  can support a bus topology, as illustrated by internal transport medium , which can connect the NID  to CPE C, D and E. The NID  can also be equipped with a wireless transmitter  for communication with wireless-capable CPE F. In this way, the NID  can support a wide variety of networking media in customer premises , including the existing telephone, satellite, cable, and network wiring. For instance, the existing telephone wiring in most homes is arranged in a bus topology, as is most coaxial cable (for instance RG6 or RG59) installed by cable television providers, although each may, in some implementations, be wired using a star topology. In contrast, many homes also have 10Base-T Ethernet networks, which sometimes require a central hub. As used herein, the term \u201c10Base-T\u201d can be understood to include newer implementations of Ethernet over unshielded twisted pair wiring, including, for instance, 100 megabit Ethernet (100Base-T, 100VG-AnyLAN, etc.) and gigabit Ethernet (1000Base-T) standards. The NID  can support these and other network topologies, serving as the hub in a 10Base-T network if necessary.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":"FIG. 1G","b":["150","152","154","156","158","160","160","156","158"]},"In accordance with some embodiments, distribution point  also comprises a central office shelf  in communication with the PSTN , as well with an asynchronous transfer mode (\u201cATM\u201d) network , either of which can provide connectivity to any of the variety of data sources and\/or recipients discussed above. In certain embodiments, shelf  is, in turn, coupled to fiber distribution panel , which is connected by transport medium  to a digital loop carrier remote termination cabinet . Remote termination cabinet  can also be coupled to DSLAM  by transport medium , which may be routed through serving area interface . In effect, transport medium  can carry one or more POTS information sets, and transport medium  can carry one or more non-POTS (in this case xDSL) information sets. As illustrated, these two information sets can be combined at DSLAM , which is in communication with serving area interface  through transport medium . Serving area interface  can be coupled to NID  with transport medium  to provide functionality for various equipment within the customer premises . In the illustrated embodiment, the NID  is fixedly attached to an exterior wall at the customer premises  and is coupled via one or more internal transport media A-I to a variety of CPE, including without limitation a television set , a video phone , an IP-compatible set-top box , an analog (POTS) telephone , an IP-compatible phone , and a personal computer . In this way, a NID  can be used to provide a plurality of telecommunication services to a customer premises.","One exemplary embodiment of a NID  is illustrated in . For purposes of illustration,  provide top views that explicitly show components within the NID  for different embodiments, while  provides a side view that shows the logical organization of the NID  without the components. In the illustrated embodiment, NID  comprises a clamshell design, with a lid portion  and a body portion  connected by hinges A and B. The body portion  comprises a network area  and a customer area . Generally, network area  is adapted to receive a cover and is designed generally to be accessible only to personnel authorized by the telecommunication service provider. In contrast, when NID  is open, the customer can access customer area  to add or remove components as desired. In this and other ways, the NID  serves to isolate the telecommunication service provider's network from the customer's network, as described above.","The NID  can include a first interface  for communicating with the provider's external transport medium. Those skilled in the art will recognize that, in some embodiments, as described above, the external transport medium may comprise the twisted-pair copper \u201clocal loop\u201d running from the customer's premises to the telecommunication service provider's local office, and interface  will allow for the attachment of the local loop to the NID . As discussed above, in other embodiments, the external transport medium can be any of a variety of other media, including satellite transmissions, wireless transmissions, coaxial cable. In fact, in certain embodiments, the external transport medium can comprise multiple transport media (of the same or different types), for which the NID  could include multiple interfaces. In some such embodiments, the NID  can function to couple a plurality of external transport media to one another, seamlessly increasing the bandwidth available to the customer premises. For instance, a customer premises might have a satellite link to one telecommunication service provider and an ADSL link to another provider, and the NID  could combine or multiplex these two links to provide an apparent single, higher-bandwidth to the customer premises. Similarly, those skilled in the art will recognize that in certain of these embodiments, a particular external transport medium, such as a satellite link, may be more well-suited to one way transmission of telecommunication information; in such cases, the NID  could use a second external transport medium, such as an ADSL link, to allow transmission in the other direction.","Interface  can be coupled to a discrimination device , which can be operative to separate information sets received on interface , and, conversely, aggregate information sets for transmission on interface ). Merely by way of example, in particular embodiments, discrimination device  can separate POTS information from other telecommunication information and\/or isolate signals on the internal transport medium from the external transport medium and vice versa. In some embodiments, for instance xDSL implementations, discrimination device  can comprise one or more filters. Such filters can include, but are not limited to, high-pass, low-pass, and\/or band-pass filters. For instance, in an xDSL implementation, discrimination device  might include a high-pass and\/or low-pass filter for separating high-frequency (e.g., data) from low frequency (e.g., POTS) information. In other embodiments, discrimination device  can comprise many other types of filters, including both digital and analog filters. Discrimination device  can be operable to separate information sets through a variety of criteria, including for example, by frequency, by destination device, information type, and\/or frequency. Further, in certain embodiments, information sets can be multiplexed (for instance, using various time-division multiplexing or wave-division multiplexing schemes known in the art) for transmission over an external transport medium, and discrimination device  can comprise a demultiplexer capable of separating multiplexed signals and, optionally, routing each signal to the necessary destination.","In the illustrated embodiment, discrimination device  is in communication with a second interface , which can interface with the telephone wires at the customer premises to provide traditional analog telephone service. In some embodiments, an aggregator  can be situated between discrimination device  and interface  to allow additional, perhaps non-POTS, information sets to be sent and received through interface  simultaneously with the POTS information. This can include, for example, aggregating information sets for transmission of an HPNA signal over an internal transport medium.","The discrimination device can also be coupled to a processing system , which in the illustrated embodiment is located in the lid portion , and all non-POTS information sets can be routed to processing system  for additional processing. Processing system  is described in detail below, but can, in general, comprise one or microprocessors, including digital signal processor (\u201cDSP\u201d) chips, memory devices, including both volatile and nonvolatile memories, and storage devices, including hard disk drives, optical drives and other media. In fact, processing system  can comprise the equivalent of one or more personal computers, running any of a variety of operating systems, including variants of Microsoft's Windows\u2122 operating system, as well as various flavors of the UNIX\u2122 operating system, including open source implementations such as the several Linux\u2122 and FreeBSD\u2122 operating systems.","Telecommunication information or information sets can be processed by processing system  in a variety of ways, including, for example, routing a given information set to a particular interface, transforming information such as by encoding and\/or decoding information and converting between different transport protocols, storing information, filtering information, and any of the other functions described herein with respect to processing systems. In certain embodiments, processing system  can serve as the termination point for an external transport medium; for instance processing system  can incorporate the functionality of an xDSL modem. In other embodiments, processing system  can serve to identify quality-of-service requirements (for instance, latency requirements for voice transmissions and bandwidth requirements for streaming media transmissions, to name a few) and enforce those requirements, ensuring that sufficient bandwidth is provided to a particular device, network segment or application to maintain the quality of service required.","In certain embodiments, such as those described above with respect to , a NID may comprise another interface in communication with a second distribution point B through an additional external transport medium A, perhaps operated by a different telecommunication service provider. In such a case, the additional external interface could be coupled to discrimination device , or it could be coupled to another discrimination device, which could also be in communication with processing system , interface  and\/or aggregator . Thus, certain embodiments allow a single NID to serve as a communication gateway between the customer premises and multiple telecommunication service providers, including combining or multiplexing multiple external transport media (each of which may be in communication with a different telecommunication service provider and\/or telecommunication information provider) as discussed above.","In the illustrated example, processing system  is in communication with aggregator , which, as discussed above, can aggregate non-POTS information sets received from processing system  and POTS information sets received directly from discrimination device  for consolidated transmission via interface . In effect, discrimination device  and aggregator , perhaps in conjunction with processing system , can function to separate telecommunication information received on interface  into a set of POTS telecommunication information and a set of non-POTS telecommunication information. POTS information can be understood to include ordinary telephone signals, and non-POTS information can be understood to include all other telecommunication information). The non-POTS information is routed via transport medium  to processing system  for processing, and the POTS information is routed to interface  for transmission to the internal transport medium. In certain embodiments, one or more sets of non-POTS information can be routed to interface  using transport medium  for transmission through interface , perhaps in combination with one or more sets of POTS information.","Of course, discrimination device  and aggregator  can perform the same function in reverse, i.e., to separate and recombine different sets of telecommunication information received on interface  from the customer's premises. Thus, in some embodiments, both discrimination device  and aggregator  each can perform a combined discrimination-device-aggregator function, depending on the direction of information flow. In fact, while termed \u201cdiscrimination device\u201d and \u201caggregator\u201d for ease of description, those two devices can actually be identical, and further, their functionality can, in some embodiments, be incorporated into a single device, which could be coupled to interface , interface , and processing system , and could route information sets among any of those three components as necessary. Moreover, as described below, the functionality of discrimination device  and\/or aggregator  can be incorporated into processing system ; likewise discrimination device  can incorporate interface  and\/or aggregator  can incorporate interface , such that discrimination device  and\/or aggregator  comprise the necessary components to be coupled directly to the external and internal transport media, respectively.","Discrimination device  and\/or aggregator  can also serve another function in certain embodiments: Since the external transport medium is coupled to first interface  and the internal transport medium can be coupled to, inter alia, second interface , the discrimination device  and\/or aggregator  can serve as an isolation device for intermediating between the two media, such that when a topological change occurs in one of the media, only the NID interface need be changed, and the other transport medium is not affected. In some such embodiments, discrimination device  and\/or aggregator  can serve to intermediate (including protocol translation and the like) between interfaces , , allowing either the internal or the external transport medium to be upgraded or changed without impacting the other transport medium. Of course, in certain embodiments, this isolation function also could be performed by processing system . In yet other embodiments, the isolation device might comprise a separate piece of hardware in communication with discrimination device , aggregator  and\/or processing system .","In different embodiments, the NID  may or may not comprise application devices.  illustrates a configuration in which no application devices are provided, with the processing system  being provided in communication with interfaces  and  respectively by transport media  and , and in communication with the aggregator  with transport medium .  illustrates an alternative embodiment in which the NID  also comprises one or more application devices , which are usually disposed in the network area . In this embodiment, the application devices  are provided in communication with the processing system  by transport media , , and\/or . In some instances, such as illustrated with application devices A and B, the application devices may be in communication with interfaces  and  such as over transport media  and . Interfaces  and  allow communication with transport media internal to the customer premises. For example, interface  could be a coaxial interface for connection to RG6 and\/or RG59 cable, and interface  could be an RJ45 and\/or RJ11 interface for connection to unshielded twisted pair cable, which can, for instance, form a 10Base-T Ethernet network.","In other instances, such as illustrated with application device C, information might be routed from the application device C through the aggregator . Such an application device may be suitable for applications that use IP data, such as a VoIP application. For example, the NID  might receive IP data, perhaps combined with other types of telecommunication information, on interface . The information set comprising the IP data can be routed by the discrimination device  via medium  to processing system , where it can be processed. Depending on the embodiment, it could then be routed via transport medium  to VoIP application device C and then provided to the customer's existing telephone wiring using interface , optionally in conjunction with aggregator  and\/or one or more line drivers. It could alternatively be routed to any of the other application devices A or B depending on their functionality. In this way, the NID can allow virtually unlimited connectivity options for each CPE at the customer premises. Adding to the flexibility of NID , the processing system  could include components to serve, for example, as a cable or xDSL modem, as well as components to serve as an Ethernet hub, switch, router, or gateway, the functions of each of which are familiar to those of skill in the art.","Furthermore, the application devices  may be provided generally within the network area  or in the consumer area , or with some in the network area  and others in the consumer area , depending on the embodiment. This is illustrated in  by showing application devices A and C disposed within the network area  of the NID  and application device B disposed within the consumer area  of the NID .","Each of the application devices  in the NID may include a service interface  to permit states of the application devices  to be changed and\/or updated. As previously notes, such interfaces may comprise physical interfaces such as USB, FireWire (IEEE 1394), RJ-11, RJ-45, serial, coaxial, or other physical interfaces, to permit a service technician to interact with the application devices  while at the site of the NID . Alternatively, the service interfaces may comprise logical interfaces to permit IP addressing to be used in changing the state of the application devices. In many instances, the NID  may also include a future-application device with open architecture to support new applications. The architecture may be configured by use of the service interfaces  when the new application is implemented. Examples of a variety of different application devices  that be incorporated within the NID  in order to provide a versatile range of functionality are discussed in detail in the '597 application.","In certain embodiments, NID  can comprise a line driver (not shown on  or B), coupled to processing system  and aggregator . The line driver can function to allow conversion between various network formats and media, allowing a variety of different media types, e.g., twisted pair and\/or coaxial cable, in accordance with the HPNA and HPNA+ standards, as well, perhaps, as the customer premises' A\/C wiring, in accordance, for example, with the HomePlug\u2122 standard, to transport combined POTS and non-POTS information sets.","In certain embodiments, NID  can comprise a power supply  for providing electrical power to the components in NID . Power supply  can be powered through electrical current carried on the external transport medium and received on interface . Alternatively, power supply can receive electrical current from a coaxial interface, such as interface , or through a dedicated transformer plugged into an AC outlet at customer premises, e.g., through 12V connection . Processing system  can be powered by a connection  to power supply , or through one or more separate power sources, including perhaps the A\/C power of the customer premises. In some embodiments, processing system  might have its own power supply.","The processing system  comprises one or more microservers that use a combination of software and hardware to implement a specified limited set of functions, in addition to other components that may be included such as memory devices, storage devices and the like. Merely by way of example,  provides a detailed illustration of an exemplary processing system  that comprises multiple microservers . In accordance with the exemplified embodiment, transport medium  links processing system  with an external transport medium, perhaps via a discrimination device and\/or interface, as described above. Transport medium  can be coupled to a plurality of microservers  such that any information received by the processing system  via transport medium  may be routed to any of the microservers . Each microserver can, in some embodiments, be the equivalent of a server computer, complete with memory devices, storage devices, and the like, each of which is known in the art. In , storage devices  associated with each of the microservers  are shown. Depending on the embodiment, each microserver may or may not be associated with an application device to provide information received from transport medium  and specifically processed for use by the corresponding device.","In addition to their specific functions, the microservers  can be configured to route information sets received via transport medium , according to the type of telecommunication information in the set (e.g., encoded video, IP data, etc.) as well as any addressing information associated with either the set or the information it comprises (e.g., a specified destination port or network address for a particular subset of telecommunication information). In this way, microservers  can serve switching functions somewhat similar to that described with respect to discrimination device  described in relation to . For instance, if IP data are received by microserver A, such data can be routed to an Ethernet connection, to the existing telephone wiring, e.g., in an HPNA implementation, or to any other appropriate medium, perhaps via an appropriate line driver. In fact, in certain embodiments, processing system , and in particular one or more of microservers , can incorporate the functionality of discrimination device  and\/or aggregator , rendering those components optional. In some embodiments, one or more of the microservers may be adapted to function as a controller for the NID , overseeing the NID's state and monitoring performance. In some embodiments, the controller functions can be accessed using a web browser.","Processing system  can have multiple means of input and output. Merely by way of example, microservers  can communicate with one or more external transport media (perhaps, as discussed above, via intermediary devices) using one or more transport media (e.g., ). Processing system  also can communicate with one or more internal transport media via a variety of information conduits, such as category 5, 5e and\/or 6 unshielded twisted pair wire , RG6 and\/or RG59 coaxial cable , and category 3 unshielded twisted pair copper (telephone) wire , again possibly via intermediary devices, as discussed with reference to . Notably, some embodiments of processing system  can include interfaces for multiple transport media of a particular type, for instance, if processing system  serves as a networking hub, switch or router. Processing system  can also have infra-red and radio-frequency receivers and transmitters, for instance to allow use of a remote control device, as well as wireless transceivers, for instance to allow wireless (e.g., IEEE 802.11) networking.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0084","num":"0083"},"figref":["FIGS. 3A-3L","FIGS. 3A-3L","FIGS. 2A and 2B"],"b":["204","208","204","228","244","302","208","204","304","306"]},"In one embodiment, illustrated in , the microserver comprises an authentication microserver . This is an example of a relatively simple microserver  and may be provided in the form of an EPROM, EEPROM, PLD, EPLD, CPLD, FPGA, or the like, together with programming to implement authentication functions. Such authentication functions may be used for verifying that certain functionality of the NID should be enabled for a particular customer. For example, the authentication microserver  may provide initial processing of a request for a particular function to ensure that the customer premises is entitled to receive that functionality, such as by comparing records of authorized functions against the request. In response, the details of the specific request may be forwarded by the authentication microserver  internal to the NID to other microservers or applications as appropriate.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0086","num":"0085"},"figref":"FIG. 3B","b":["324","324","326","324","326","324","324","324","324"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0087","num":"0086"},"figref":["FIG. 3C","FIG. 3B"],"b":["328","328","328","330","324","330"]},"For some applications, a combination of distinct microservers may be appropriate for implementing certain NID functionality.  provides an example in which the NID comprises both an HTML microserver  and a webserver microserver . Each of these microservers may be embodied with physical structures that allow the implementation of software, such as an EPROM, EEPROM, PLD, EPLD, CPLD, FPGA, and the like. Programming embodied by the HTML microserver  allows the processing of HTML code that may be received by the NID according to well-known protocols. A variety of equivalent microservers may be substituted in alternative embodiments to process other types of code or computer languages, such as microservers for processing. Such microservers are described generically herein as \u201ccode-processing microservers.\u201d The discussion herein of processing HTML code is intended to be exemplary and to limit the scope of the invention.","The processed code may then be transmitted to the webserver microserver , which includes software for rendering a display of incoming web-page information suitable for presentation with a web-browser enabled device. In order to effect such rendering, the software comprised by the webserver microserver  may provide a configuration for the NID and configurations for application devices that may be integrated with or in communication with the NID. The combination of the HTML and webserver microservers  and  thus allows for both hardware and software configuration changes to be made to the NID with a customer-based graphic-user interface (\u201cGUI\u201d). A NID equipped in this fashion may therefore be used by a customer to effect customer-premises and access network changes, to modify IP configurations, to initiate and update registration of application devices integrated with or in communication with the NID, and the like. The webserver microserver  may be adapted to support a variety of different codes, usually corresponding to the codes or computer languages processed by a code-processing microserver comprised by the NID. In some instances, the HTML microserver  and\/or the webserver microserver  may be supported with upgradeable firmware (not shown in ) to allow the support of new software and additional capabilities. In embodiments where the NID additionally comprises a file-transfer microserver, such as the FTP\/TFTP microserver  described in connection with , the new software may optionally be provided to the supporting firmware with the file-transfer microserver.","Other combinations of multiple microservers that include a webserver microserver to implement still other functionality are illustrated in . In , an email alert microserver  is provided in combination with a webserver microserver , both of which may again be provided with physical structures that include an EPROM, EEPROM, PLD, EPLD, CPLD, FPGA, and the like. The email alert microserver  includes software that monitors a set of defined email accounts, such as email accounts for users at a specific customer premises, and that initiates an alert when a new message is received by one of those accounts. The alert is transmitted by the email alert microserver  to any device within the customer premises configured for receipt of alerts. Such an arrangement thus permits a variety of different devices to be used in the customer premises as email alerting devices, including not only devices such as a personal computer or television, but any device that may be in communication with the NID even if it is not a device normally used for receiving email. The webserver microserver  permits implementation of a customer-based GUI that allows for software configuration changes for the email alert microserver  to be effected conveniently. In alternative embodiments where a file-transfer microserver is comprised by the NID, such as the FTP\/TFTP microserver  described in connection with , software configuration changes may be effected through transfer of an electronic file. Also, in some embodiments, upgradeable firmware (not shown in ) may additionally be provided to support the email alert microserver  and\/or webserver microserver . In cases where the alert is transmitted to a device that may receive the email message, an option may be provided to allow a user to choose to read the email message. In such instances, the email message may be transmitted to a conversion application  for conversion to a readable format before it is transmitted to the device where it is read.","In , a similar arrangement is used to provide an instant-messenger client to a customer by including an instant-messenger microserver  in the NID in combination with a webserver microserver . In this instance, the microservers may be embodied physically with an EPROM, EEPROM, PLD, EPLD, CPLD, FPGA, or the like, with the instant-messenger microserver  having software for implementing messenger-client functions. A conversion application  allows received messages to be converted to readable formats for transmission to devices within the customer premises. A user has the option of responding to the message or ignoring it. Typical instant-messenger functionality that may be supported by the instant-messenger microserver  may include a login\/logout facility, a capability to edit a personal profile, a connect\/disconnect facility, a feature for maintaining privacy settings and other preferences information, a facility for maintaining a frequent-contact list, a facility for sending messages, a facility of conferencing multiple users, a chat facility, and the like. An ability to modify the capabilities of the instant-messenger microserver  may be provided with a webserver microserver  to allow software configuration changes to be effected through a customer-based GUI. More significant capability updates may be effected by providing new software with a file through a file-transfer microserver such as the FTP\/TFTP microserver described in connection with . In some instances, such software updates may be made to supporting firmware (not shown in ) that may additionally be comprised by the NID.","As shown in , an advertising microserver  may be provided in combination with a webserver microserver  in some embodiments. Each of the microservers may be embodied physically with an EPROM, EEPROM, PLD, EPLD, CPLD, FPGA, or the like, and the advertising microserver  may include software that initiates transmission of advertisement displays to the webserver microserver . With such an arrangement, advertisements approved by the telecommunication service provider, perhaps as part of a contractual arrangement with an advertiser, may be downloaded through the NID to the advertising microserver. When a customer is using the webserver microserver , the advertisements may then be displayed according to criteria maintained by the advertising microserver .
