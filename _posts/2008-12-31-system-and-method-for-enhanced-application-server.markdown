No. 12\/347,354, entitled SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR MESSAGE-BASED CONVERSATIONS, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The present application is related to concurrently-filed U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/347,223, entitled SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR MOBILE USER AUTHENTICATION, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The present invention relates generally to telecommunications services. More particularly, the present invention relates to capabilities that enhance substantially the value and usefulness of various messaging paradigms including, inter alia, Short Message Service (SMS), Multimedia Message Service (MMS), etc.","As the \u2018wireless revolution\u2019 continues to march forward the importance to a Mobile Subscriber (MS)\u2014for example a user of a Wireless Device (WD) such as a cellular telephone, a BlackBerry, a Palm Pilot, etc. that is serviced by a Wireless Carrier (WC)\u2014of their WD grows substantially.","One consequence of such a growing importance is the resulting ubiquitous nature of WDs\u2014i.e., MSs carry them at almost all times and use them for an ever-increasing range of activities.","Coincident with the expanding presence of WDs has been the explosive growth of messaging\u2014a steady annual increase, year over year, in the number of (SMS, MMS, etc.) messages that have been exchanged by and between WDs. That steady increase shows no sign of abating. For example, as reported by the industry group CTIA (see ctia.org on the World Wide Web [WWW]) in the U.S. there were over 158 billion SMS messages sent during 2006 (representing a 95% increase over 2005) and there were over 2.7 billion MMS messages sent during 2006 (representing a 100% increase over 2005).","Additionally, MSs would like to be able to use their WDs to engage in and complete increasingly more complicated activities (beyond, for example, exchanging simple messages with their friends, receiving one-way news\/weather\/financial\/etc. notifications, etc.)\u2014e.g., inquiring as to the current balance of an account at a financial institution, transferring funds between accounts within a financial institution, paying a bill, etc. Many of those activities require a coordinated exchange of multiple SMS, MMS, etc. messages supported by a robust back-end system.","Given (1) the ubiquitous nature of WDs, (2) the popularity of (SMS, MMS, etc.) messaging, and (3) the need for MSs to use their WDs to engage in and complete increasingly more complicated activities, it would be desirable to have a flexible, extensile, and dynamically configurable back-end Application Server (AS) environment.","Aspects of the present invention facilitate such an AS environment in new, creative, and unconventional ways and address various of the not insubstantial challenges that are associated with same.","In one embodiment of the present invention there is provided an application server system containing possibly inter alia a gateway at which an incoming message is received; an incoming queue on which at least aspects of the incoming message are deposited; workflow modules which may (a) retrieve the aspects of the incoming message from the incoming queue, (b) complete one or more processing steps, and (c) deposit an entry on an outgoing queue; a gateway from which at least aspects of the entry is transmitted after the entry is retrieved from the outgoing queue; a repository; and an administrator.","These and other features of the embodiments of the present invention, along with their attendant advantages, will be more fully appreciated upon a reading of the following detailed description in conjunction with the associated drawings.","Throughout the drawings (a) like reference numbers generally indicate identical or functionally similar elements and (b) the left-most digit(s) of a reference number generally identify the drawing in which the reference number first appears. For example, in  reference numeral  would direct the reader to  for the first appearance of that element.","It should be noted that the embodiments that are described below are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. Therefore the details that are disclosed below are not to be interpreted as limiting but merely as the basis for possibly inter alia (a) teaching one of ordinary skill in the relevant art how to make and\/or use the invention and (b) the claims.","The present invention may leverage the capabilities of a centrally-located, full-featured MICV facility. Reference is made to U.S. Pat. No. 7,154,901 entitled \u201cIntermediary network system and method for facilitating message exchange between wireless networks,\u201d and its associated continuations, for a description of a MICV, a summary of various of the services\/functions\/etc. that are performed by a MICV, and a discussion of the numerous advantages that arise from same. U.S. Pat. No. 7,154,901 and its associated continuations are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.","As illustrated in  and reference numeral  a MICV  is disposed between, possibly inter alia:","1) Multiple WCs (WC, WC\u2192WC) on one side, and","2) Multiple SPs (SP\u2192SP), entities that may possibly inter alia provide a range of services\/products\/etc. to MSs, on the other side and thus \u2018bridges\u2019 all of the connected entities. A MICV  thus, as one simple example, may offer various routing, formatting, delivery, value-add, etc. capabilities that provide, possibly inter alia:","1) A WC \u2192 (and, by extension, all of the MSs \u2192, \u2192, \u2192 that are serviced by the WC \u2192) with ubiquitous access to a broad universe of SPs \u2192, and","2) A SP \u2192 with ubiquitous access to a broad universe of WCs \u2192 (and, by extension, to all of the MSs \u2192, \u2192, \u2192 that are serviced by the WCs \u2192).","Generally speaking a MICV may have varying degrees of visibility (e.g., access, etc.) to the (MS\u21c4MS, MS\u21c4SP, etc.) messaging traffic:","1) A WC may elect to route just their out-of-network messaging traffic to a MICV. Under this approach the MICV would have visibility (e.g., access, etc.) to just the portion of the WC's messaging traffic that was directed to the MICV by the WC.","2) A WC may elect to route all of their messaging traffic to a MICV. The MICV may, possibly among other things, subsequently return to the WC that portion of the messaging traffic that belongs to (i.e., that is destined for a MS of) the WC. Under this approach the MICV would have visibility (e.g., access, etc.) to all of the WC's messaging traffic.","While the discussion below will include a MICV, it will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the relevant art that other arrangements are equally applicable and indeed are fully within the scope of the present invention.","In the discussion below aspects of the present invention will be described and illustrated as being offered by a SP (i.e., as noted above an entity that may possibly inter alia provide a range of services\/products\/etc. to MSs). A SP may, for example, be realized as an independent service bureau, an element of or within some organization (such as possibly inter alia a financial institution, a retail establishment, an on-line retailer, etc.), an element of a WC or a landline carrier, an element of a MICV, multiple entities (such as for example those just listed) or aspects of same working together, etc.","In the discussion below reference will be made to messages that are sent, for example, between a MS and a SP. As set forth below, a given \u2018message\u2019 sent between a MS and a SP may actually comprise a series of steps in which the message is received, forwarded, and routed between different entities, including possibly inter alia a MS, a WC, a MICV, and a SP. Thus, unless otherwise indicated, it will be understood that reference to a particular message generally includes that particular message as conveyed at any stage between an origination source, such as for example a MS, and an end receiver, such as for example a SP. As such, reference to a particular message generally includes a series of related communications between, for example, a MS and a WC; a WC and a MICV; a MICV and a SP; etc. The series of related communications may, in general, contain substantially the same information, or information may be added or subtracted in different communications that nevertheless may be generally referred to as a same message. To aid in clarity, a particular message, whether undergoing changes or not, is referred to by different reference numbers at different stages between a source and an endpoint of the message.","To better understand the particulars of the present invention consider for a moment a simple hypothetical example\u2014SPoffers a service that has been enhanced or augmented as provided through aspects of the instant invention and Mary, a MS, uses SP's service.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","102","104","110","112","114","118","120","120","202"],"sub":["1 ","a ","1 ","c ","1 ","Z ","N "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["300","202"],"sub":"N "},"Of interest and note in  are the following entities:","MS  WD .

The provider of service for a WD  of Mary .","MICV . As noted above the use of a MICV, although not required, provides significant advantages.","SP Web Server (WS) . A publicly-available WWW site that is optionally provided by SP.","SP Billing Interface (BI) . A single, consolidated interface that SP may use to easily reach, possibly inter alia, one or more internal and\/or external entities such as a credit card or debit card clearinghouse, a carrier billing system, a service bureau that provides access to multiple carrier billing systems, invoicing or billing facilities, etc.","SP AS . Facilities that provide key elements of the instant invention (which will be described below).","SP Gateway (GW) .

For example, the collected information may be reviewed, confirmed, etc. through one or more manual and\/or automatic mechanisms. For example, the registration process may be completed through any combination of one or more channels including, inter alia, the WWW, wireless messaging (SMS, MMS, etc.), Electronic Mail (E-Mail) messages, Instant Messaging (IM), conventional mail, telephone, an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) facility, etc.","During the registration process described above a range of information may be captured from a MS including, possibly inter alia:","A) Identifying Information.

For example, possibly among other things, the selection of one or more of the different security plans, programs, policies, etc. that a SP may optionally offer (each of which may carry, possibly inter alia, some type of fee or charge). Such plans, programs, etc. may provide, possibly inter alia, alerts to a MS (via, for example, SMS, MMS, E-Mail, IM, etc.) based on various events, criteria, thresholds, etc.; additional levels of notification, confirmation, etc. during a transaction; etc.","D) Billing Information. For example, the particulars (such as, possibly inter alia, name, account\/routing\/etc. numbers, etc.) for financial institution (bank, brokerage, etc.) accounts, credit cards, debit cards, etc. As well, possibly the selection of one or more of the different service billing models may be offered by a SP (including, inter alia, a fixed one-time charge, a recurring [monthly, etc.] fixed charge, a recurring [monthly, etc.] variable charge, a per-transaction charge, etc.) and possibly the selection of one or more of the different payment mechanisms that may be offered by a SP (including, possibly among other things, credit or debit card information, authorization to place a charge on a MS's phone bill, authorization to deduct funds from a MS' [bank, brokerage, etc.] account, etc.).","The specific pieces of information that were described above are illustrative only and it will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the relevant art that numerous other pieces of information (e.g., additional Identifying Information, scheduled daily\/weekly\/etc. reporting desired and\/or on-demand reporting desired, etc.) are easily possible and indeed are fully within the scope of the present invention.","As noted above the information that Mary provided during the registration process may be preserved in a data repository (e.g., a database) and may optionally be organized as a MS Profile.","The content of Mary's profile may be augmented by SP to include, as just a few examples of the many possibilities, internal and\/or external demographic, psychographic, sociological, etc. data.","As noted above, a SP's BI may optionally complete a billing transaction. The billing transaction may take any number of forms and may involve different external entities (e.g., a WC's billing system, a carrier billing system service bureau, a credit or debit card clearinghouse, a financial institution, etc.). The billing transaction may include, inter alia:","1) The appearance of a line item charge on the bill or statement that a MS receives from her WC.","2) The charging of a credit card or the debiting of a debit card.","3) The (electronic, etc.) transfer of funds.","4) The generation of an invoice, statement, etc.","In  the exchanges that are collected under the designation Set  represent the activities that might take place as SP optionally coordinates, etc. with one or more external entities to, possibly among other things, secure access, exchange and\/or confirm collected information, arrange to receive updates, etc. (see \u2192).

Of interest and note are:","1) In the instant example the messages are shown traversing a MICV .","2) SPN  may employ a Short Code (SC) or a regular TN as its source address (and to which it would ask users of its service to direct any reply messages). While the abbreviated length of a SC (e.g., five digits for a SC administered by Neustar under the Common Short Code [CSC] program) incrementally enhances the experience of a MS  (e.g., Mary  need remember and enter only a few digits as the destination address of a reply message) it also, by definition, constrains the universe of available SCs thereby causing each individual SC to be a limited or scarce resource and raising a number of SC\/CSC management, etc. issues. A description of a common (i.e., universal) short code environment may be found in pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/742,764 entitled \u201cUniversal Short Code administration facility.\u201d","The specific exchanges that were described above (as residing under the designation Set ) are illustrative only and it will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the relevant art that numerous other exchanges are easily possible and indeed are fully within the scope of the present invention.","The Set , Set , Set , and Set  exchanges that were described above are illustrative only and it will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the relevant art that numerous other exchanges are easily possible and indeed are fully within the scope of the present invention.
