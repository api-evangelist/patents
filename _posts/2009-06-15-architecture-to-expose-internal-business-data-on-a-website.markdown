{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Organizations store business data on internal systems that typically are not available to the public. The business data is typically captured in document sources such as word processor documents and spreadsheets. Websites provide a way to display information to a wide audience. The automated display of internal business data on a website using these document sources typically requires a degree of knowledge and expertise typically not available to a layperson.","Embodiments of the disclosure are directed to a method for importing data into a website hosted on a server computer. A block of document data is received at the server computer. The block of document data comprises data from an identified section of a document. In response to receiving the block of document data, the server computer automatically updates a web page component on the website. The web page component is selected via a document widget on the server computer. The document data is mapped to the web page component.","This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form. These concepts are further described below in the Detailed Description. This summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is this summary intended as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.","The present application is directed to systems and methods for exposing internal business data on a website. A website is a collection of related web pages hosted on a web server. The web pages can be accessed through a network, such as the Internet.","In example embodiments, a document widget is provided for a website. In this disclosure, a document widget is a graphical user interface component used on the website. The document widget can be configured to obtain data from a document or application and display the data on the website.","The document widget permits a user to select a data element in a document containing internal business data or other data. In this disclosure, a data element is an identifiable part of a document, such as a table or graph within a word processor document or spreadsheet. The data element comprises document data, for example the data in a table or graph that can be displayed on a website. The data element is typically stored on a server computer or on a client computer that may be accessible to over a network. In some example embodiments, the data element may be stored on the same server computer that hosts the website, although the data element may be stored in a private area of the web site not publicly available.","The document widget also permits a user to select a web page component, such as a table or a graph, for displaying the data element on the website. When a connection is established between the document widget and the document, any updates to the data element are automatically displayed on the website.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","106","108","110"]},"Among the plurality of information stored on the clients , ,  is a client operating system (\u201cOS\u201d) and client applications. The client OS is a program that manages the hardware and software resources of the client system. The client applications utilize the resources of the clients , ,  to directly perform tasks specified by a user, for example a user who is creating or editing a document. For example, the clients , ,  include one or more software applications, such as word processing programs and spreadsheet programs that are used to create and edit documents and spreadsheets. Two examples of such applications are Microsoft Word word processing software and Microsoft EXCEL\u00ae spreadsheet software from Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash. Other examples of such applications, for example Open Office, are also applicable. In this disclosure, the terms document and spreadsheet are used interchangeably.","In example embodiments, client  is a client computer used on a corporate or small business network. Client  is a computer used by an individual or small business with a direct connection to a network and client  is a mobile computer, for example a laptop computer.","Server  is a web server. In example embodiments server  is part of a system of an online web hosting and shared storage, such as Microsoft Office Live Small Business 2007 from Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash. For example, Microsoft Office Live Small Business 2007 permits users to build a customized web site for their business. In addition, Microsoft Office Live Small Business 2007 permits users to store and share documents online so that the documents can be accessed over the Internet. Documents stored on example clients ,  and  or on a file server accessible to clients ,  and  can be uploaded to web server  to be shared with others over network . For example, server  can host multiple files in a format (e.g., HTML or XML) that are accessible through a network using a web browser.","Web server  may be part of an interconnected server system known as a web server farm. The web server farm may comprise a plurality of servers and data storage units. In example embodiments, network  is the Internet, although other types of networks can also be used.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["108","202","204","202","108"]},"The document may also be stored on a client system, for example clients ,  or , or on a file server accessible to a client system. For example, in one embodiment, the document is stored on memory that is local to one of the clients , , . In another embodiment, the document is stored on a server that is separate from that of server . For example, the document can be stored on a file server or a document management server that is accessible to the clients , , , so that the clients , ,  can access and manipulate the document.","Document data for display on a web page is typically data that changes over time, for example data in a table or graphical data. Document data may also include blocks of text that may or may not change over time.","The document widget also permits a user to select a web page component, typically a table or graph, for display of the document data. The document widget may be dragged from a widget area of the web page to a display location. The document widget may also be expanded in size to accommodate the data to be displayed.","The document widget may also be configured. Configuring the document widget includes identifying the location of the document, identifying a section of the document to be displayed and establishing a connection to the document. Configuring the document widget also includes configuring display settings, for example configuring where the document widget is placed on the web page and how the document widget displays data (for example as a table, a graph, etc.).","The example security module  provides a secure connection from the client system, for example clients , , , to web server . Web server  implements a system of an online web hosting and shared storage, such as Microsoft Office Live Small Business 2007. In order to make changes to a website hosted on web server  or to upload document content, a user on a client system typically must logon to web server . The example security module  maintains security via a userID\/password connection from client to server. In example embodiments, it is also possible for the connection from the client system to web server  to be unsecured, for example for online document collaboration within a business organization.","Data is transmitted from client to server via web services. A web service supports computer to computer communication over the Internet. To ensure secure communication, the example security module  provides a secure identifier, for example a secure socket layer (SSL) identifier, that is typically embedded in document data transmitted from the client system to web server . Data is typically transmitted from client to server as a block of data in an HTTP message. The web server  typically includes a listener for inbound connections to the web server. In example embodiments, the listener for inbound connections is encapsulated in the example security module .","When a user logs on to web server , in example embodiments the example security module  encrypts the uniform resource locator (URL) of the website hosted on web server  after authenticating the login. The client, for example client , , , the decrypts the encrypted URL before sending document data to web server . The encryption of the URL provides an additional layer of security and prevents possible spoofing attacks whereby an application edits a file containing document data, modifies the URL and directs the client to a rogue website.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["202","202","302","304","306","308"]},"The example web page components module  provides a plurality of web page components for displaying document data. Typical web page components include a table, a bar graph, a line graph, a thermometer type graph, a calendar, a timeline, etc. Other web page components are possible.","Typically, document data is displayed in the same form that it exists in a document. For example, if the document data is in tabular form, the document data is typically displayed in tabular form on the website. If the document data is in graphical form, the document data is typically displayed in graphical form on the website. If the document data is a block of text, the document data is typically displayed as text on the website. However, the example document widget module  permits document data to be displayed in a plurality of forms on the website. For example, when document data in tabular form in the document is displayed in graphical form on the website, the example document widget module  converts the tabular data to graphical form.","The example user interface module  provides a user interface for the example document widget module . The example user interface typically includes one or more dialog boxes that prompt a user to enter information needed to identify the document and to identify the sections of the document for which document data is exposed on the website. The example user interface module  also provides a dialog box for selecting a web page component, such as a table or graph, in which the document data is displayed on example web page . Other uses of the example interface module  are possible. For example, the user interface may include components other than dialog boxes, for example pull-down list boxes. In another example, web server  may automatically enter information to identify the document without the need for user input.","If the document is stored on a client system, for example on client , , , the example user interface module  prompts a user on client , ,  to enter a user ID, for example a LiveID identifier, and a password. Live ID is single sign-on service, developed by Microsoft Corporation that permits users to logon to many websites using one account. When the user ID and password are authenticated by web server , a secure connection is established between the client system and web server .","The example mapping module  maps an identified section of a document, for example a data element in the document, to a web page component on the web page. The mapping translates the coordinates of the data element in the document to corresponding coordinates of the web page component. The web page component typically is rendered in the space provided by the expanded document widget. Typically, the data element is mapped to fit into the entire space on the website occupied by the document widget. In example embodiments, it is possible to specify a portion of the document widget to which the data element is mapped.","The example third-party application module  permits data from third party software applications running on a client system, for example on clients , ,  to be displayed on web server . For this disclosure, a third-party application is defined as a software application that is not part of Microsoft Office. Software applications that are part of Microsoft Office include Microsoft Word word processing software and Microsoft EXCEL\u00ae spreadsheet software.","An example third-party software application is a software application, for example Sage Timberline, that manages the details of a construction business, including accounts payable, accounts receivable, contracts, equipment cost, etc. A user of the software application may want to display a portion of this data on a website so that clients and employees of the construction business can have access to the data. As another example, a non-profit organization may use a third-party software application, for example Giftworks fundraising software, that organizes donations and pledges, tracks donors, manages fundraising events, etc. A user of this software application may want to display a portion of this information, for example the results of a pledge drive, on a public website. For example, the user may want to have a thermometer graph displayed on the website to display the amount of money donated and to show how close the donations are to meeting the goals of the pledge drive.","The example third-party application module processes a connection between example web server  and a computer system hosting the third-party application software. The example third-party application module downloads configuration instructions to the third-party application that enable the third-party application to connect to files hosted on a web server, for example to a web page hosted on web server . In addition, in example embodiments, the third-party application module provides an application programming interface (API) for the computer system hosting the third-party application. In this example embodiment, the third party application is configured using the API and document data is transferred from the third-party application to web server  using the API. The API makes the web server agnostic with respect to the third-party application with which it interfaces, permitting web server  to connect to a plurality of third-party applications. In other example embodiments, the third-party application is configured to periodically upload a spreadsheet to web server . The spreadsheet is either an EXCEL\u00ae spreadsheet or a spreadsheet formatted similarly to EXCEL\u00ae. The spreadsheet includes updated data from the third-party application to be displayed on web server . Because the spreadsheet is an EXCEL\u00ae spreadsheet or a spreadsheet formatted similarly to EXCEL\u00ae, web server  uses existing spreadsheet processing functionality on web server  to process the spreadsheet and to display spreadsheet data on web server .","As discussed, document data to be displayed on a website typically resides on a server, for example on web server , as part of an online website hosting and document storage system such as Microsoft Office Live Small Business 2007. The advantage of storing the document on a server, such as web server , is that the document data is available to be synchronized with the data displayed on the website. Whenever the document is updated, the website display is automatically updated. Document data is pushed to the website whenever the document is updated on web server .","When document data is stored on a client system, for example on one of clients , , , a connection needs to be established to web server . When a connection is established, document data is typically transferred via web services. In example embodiments, the client system automatically pushes data to the website when the document data is updated on the client system. For example, the document data can be pushed to web server  whenever the document is saved by a client device. Each time the document is revised and saved, any updates to the document data can be transmitted to web server .","In the case of a mobile device, for example client , because a mobile device may be offline for an extended period of time, in example embodiments, when client  is offline and comes back online, client  sends updated document data to web server  when client  is reconnected to network  and comes back online.","In other example embodiments, web server  initiates the transfer of document data from the client system. For example, web server  can be programmed to periodically pull updated document data. In one embodiment, web server  is configured to pull updated document data at specific intervals, such as 1 hour, 1 day, 1 week, or 1 month. In another example, web server  is programmed to pull updated document data if a specified period of time elapses without an update from the client, such as 1 week or 1 month. Other configurations are possible.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","108","400","401","400","400","108"]},"The example web page  includes example widgets  that are selectable on the web page. In this disclosure, a widget is a graphical user interface component having a specific functionality. The example widgets  include widgets that can be used for a variety of purposes. Some example widgets  include a weather widget that displays a weather summary for a geographical area, a slide show widget that brings up a slide show and a contact module to add contact information to the website. In addition, widgets  also include example document widget . Other examples of widgets are possible. Each widget  can be dragged from the side of the web page, moved to a desired location and expanded in size. In other example embodiments, instead of dragging a widget to a location, a user defines a zone on the example web page  and assigns a widget to the zone. In this example, a zone comprises a selected area on web page . Other examples of locating a widget on a web page are possible.","The example document widget  includes functionality to display document data on the web page.  shows the example document widget  dragged from the side of the web page to a new location  and expanded in size. When the example document widget  is dragged to location , an example user interface  is activated on the web page . The example user interface  is typically a dialog box displayed on the web page  in which data is entered by a user. In example embodiments, more than one dialog box may be sequentially displayed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","508","400","406","508","510","512","514","512","108","108","400","514","514","406"]},"In example embodiments, when a document is identified, for example by pressing the example Select button , an application programming interface (API) is activated. The API permits a user to determine elements of the document, for example worksheets, tables, graphs, etc., that are available for display on the example website . The API also permits a user to refine selected portions of a document further. For example, if a table is selected on a document, the API permits the user to select a range of rows and tables from the table.","When a document is identified for display on example web page  and a connection to the document is established, the example document widget module  displays an example dialog box  for selecting a web page component. The example dialog box  includes a drop-down list box  that lists web page components available on web server  for displaying document data. Some example web page components are tables, line graphs, bar graphs, etc. Typically, a user selects a web page component corresponding to the way data to be rendered by the web page component is displayed in the document. When the user selects a web page component to be used, the user presses example Enter button  to enter the web page component in web server .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["400","406","400","602","406"]},"A user can also initiate a process to display document data on a website from a client system, for example from client , , . This is typically the case when document data is stored on the client system or on a file server accessible to the client system. Typically, the user opens the document, identifies a section of the document to be displayed on the website and then activates a wizard on the client system, for example by pressing an example website publishing button on the client system. The example wizard activates one or more dialog boxes that permit the user to logon to the website on which document data is to be displayed, activate a document widget on the website to select a location for display of the document data and to select a web page component, for example a table or a graph, corresponding to the format in which the document data is to be displayed. It should be appreciated that a user logon is one example of user authentication. Other types of authentication are possible, for example biometrics such as fingerprints, voice recognition, etc.","The example wizard also permits the user to select when document data is to be updated on example web page . For example, document data can be updated automatically whenever a user performs a save operation. In another example, document data is uploaded only when a user presses a special button, for example a publish button, on the user interface of the client system. The use of a publish button permits the user to have more control over when the document data is displayed on the example web page . Other user actions that result in updating identified document data to example web page  are possible.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 6"],"b":["700","102","104","106","700","702","704","706","708","710","712","400","714","400","406","714"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 8"],"b":["800","108","108","800"]},"At operation , web server  processes a user login to the website. The user typically logs on to the website from a client system, for example client , , . When logging on the website, the user provides a secure login identifier, for example a LiveID identifier, and a password. The login provides a secure connection between the client system and web server .","At operation , the user selects a document widget from a web page on the website. The document widget is selected from a plurality of widgets made available on the web page. The document widget is a software tool that provides functionality for identifying a section of a document to be displayed on a web page, establishing a connection to a computing system where the document is stored, selecting a web page component in which to display the document, providing a location for the document to be displayed on the web page and displaying document data in a web page component. Operations associated with the document widget are processed by the example document widgets module .","At operation , a user moves the document widget to a desired location on the web page, typically by dragging the document widget to the desired location on the web page. The document widget is also expanded in size when dragged to provide an area in which the document data is displayed. When the document widget is moved to the desired location on the web page, at operation  the user selects a document from which to obtain data. The user identifies the document by browsing for the document via a user interface on the web page. Typically, the user interface is a dialog box, for example dialog box , which is displayed on the web page when the document widget is moved to the desired location. The user selects the identified document via example dialog box . When the user selects the identified document, a connection is established between the document widget and the document.","At operation , the user selects a section in the identified document from which to obtain data to be displayed on the web page. Typically, the example user interface module  provides an application programming interface (API) for the identified document from which sections of the document can be selected. For example, the API typically permits a user to select a page of a document, for example a page of a Microsoft Word word processing software document or a worksheet in an EXCEL\u00ae spreadsheet software document.","The API also typically permits a user to select a data element in the document, for example a table or a graph. In addition, example APIs permit the user to select a portion of a data element, for example to select a range of rows and columns of a table. Alternatively, in example embodiments, a user identifies a section of a document by opening the document and highlighting a section of the document to be selected.","At operation , the user identifies a web page component on the web page on which to display document data. The example web page component module  provides a plurality of web page components from which the user can choose. Example web page components are a table and a graph. The web page component selected is displayed in the expanded area of the located document widget.","At operation , the example mapping module  maps the selected document section to the selected web page component. Mapping is needed because the size of the selected web page component displayed at the document widget location, for example a table, is typically different than the size of the table in the document. In addition, mapping is needed because the format of the document is typically different than the format of the selected web page component.","At operation , a block of document data is received for the selected web page component from the computer system on which the document is stored, in this example from web server . The block of document data represents changes to the selected section of the document as a result of a user edit. The user edit typically occurs at a client system, for example client ,  or . However, any changes made at the client system are updated to the document stored on web server . Data is sent from the client system to web server  via a secure connection that is established when the user logs in to web server .","At operation , the block of document data received at operation  is displayed on the selected web page component. The block of document data is displayed on the selected web page component because of the connection between the document widget on web server  and the document. This connection ensures that whenever data is updated in the selected section of the document, the selected web page component is automatically updated with the updated data.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 9","FIG. 7"],"b":["900","102","104","106","900","902","102","104","106","904","108","714"]},"At operation , a user on the client computer activates a web hosting interface on the client computer, typically by pressing or clicking a button on the client computer representing web hosting. The button is typically included within a word processing application running on the client computer. When the user activates a web hosting interface, a dialog box is displayed from which, at operation , the user establishes a secure connection to web server . The user typically enters a userID and password to connect to web server . Once the connection to web server  is established, document data transmitted between the client computer and web server  includes a secure identifier, typically by using a cryptographic protocol such as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).","When the connection is established between the client computer and web server , one or more dialog boxes are displayed from which the user enters configuration information. At operation , the user selects a web page component for display of document data on the web page. The selection is typically made from a drop down list box provided on one of the one or more dialog boxes.","At operation , the user selects a location for the web page component on the web page. In some example embodiments, the user selects grid coordinates for an area of the web page. In other example embodiments, a grid of the web page is displayed and the user selects an available section of the grid. Other techniques for selecting a location of the web page are possible.","At operation , data from the selected section of the document is mapped to the web page component. The data is mapped to adjust the size of the selected section of the document, for example a document graph, with the size of the graph as displayed on the web page.","At operation , the selected section of the document is transmitted to web server . Data in the selected section of the document, for example a graph or selected rows and columns of a table, are transmitted to web server  over the secure connection established in operation .","At operation , the user edits the selection section of the document, either by making changes to the content or by adding new content. At operation , the user saves the edited changes. When the user saves the edited changes, at operation , data in the selected section of the document are sent to web server . The data sent to web server  at operation  contains the modified changes. The web page component on the website is automatically updated with the modified changes.","With reference to , example components of server  are shown. In example embodiments, the server  is a computing device, such as a server computer. The server  can include input\/output devices, a central processing unit (\u201cCPU\u201d), a data storage device, and a network device.","In a basic configuration, the server  typically includes at least one processing unit  and system memory .
