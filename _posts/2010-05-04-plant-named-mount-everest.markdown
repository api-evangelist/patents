{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["Botanical designation: ","Cultivar denomination: \u2018MOUNT EVEREST\u2019.","The present invention relates to a new and distinct cultivar of plant, botanically known as , and hereinafter referred to by the name \u2018Mount Everest\u2019.","The new plant is a product of a planned breeding program conducted by the Inventor in Paterswolde, The Netherlands. The objective of the breeding program was to develop new plants with unique and attractive leaf shape and plant form.","The new plant originated from a cross-pollination made by the Inventor in 2004 of a proprietary selection of identified as code name Portugal L52, not patented, as the female, or seed, parent with a proprietary selection of identified as code name Lin 05, not patented, as the male, or pollen, parent. The new plant was discovered and selected by the Inventor in 2006 as a single plant within the progeny of the stated cross-pollination in a controlled environment in Paterswolde, The Netherlands.","Asexual reproduction of the new plant by cuttings in a controlled environment in Paterswolde, The Netherlands since 2007 has shown that the unique features of this new plant are stable and reproduced true to type in successive generations.","Plants of the new have not been observed under all possible environmental conditions. The phenotype may vary somewhat with variations in environment such as temperature and light intensity, without, however, any variance in genotype.","The following traits have been repeatedly observed and are determined to be the unique characteristics of \u2018Mount Everest\u2019. These characteristics in combination distinguish \u2018Mount Everest\u2019 as a new and distinct plant:\n\n","Plants of the new differ primarily from plants of the female parent selection in the following characteristics:\n\n","Plants of the new differ primarily from plants of the male parent selection in the following characteristics:\n\n","Plants of the new can be compared to plants of \u2018Himalaya\u2019, not patented. In side-by-side comparisons conducted in Sappemeer, The Netherlands, plants of the new differed from plants of \u2018Himalaya\u2019 in the following characteristics:\n\n","Plants of the new can also be compared to plants of \u2018Kilimanjaro\u2019, not patented. In side-by-side comparisons conducted in Sappemeer, The Netherlands, plants of the new differed from plants of \u2018Kilimanjaro\u2019 in the following characteristics:\n\n","The aforementioned photographs, following observations and measurements describe plants grown in 12-cm containers during the summer in a glass-greenhouse in Sappemeer, The Netherlands and under conditions and practices which approximate those generally used in commercial production. During the production of the plants, day temperatures ranged from 18\u00b0 C. to 25\u00b0 C. and night temperatures ranged from 15\u00b0 C. to 18\u00b0 C. Plants were 13 weeks old when the photographs and description were taken.
