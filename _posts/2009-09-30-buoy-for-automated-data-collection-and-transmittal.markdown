title: Buoy for automated data collection and transmittal
abstract: A buoy for automated collection and transmittal of data. Select embodiments allow calculation of mass balance using data collected from an ice floe. The buoy is adapted to be inserted into the water through an opening in ice so that the buoy floats with the ice floe, the top of the buoy protruding above the surface of the ice floe. The buoy walls are constructed of white PVC. One section of the buoy incorporates closed cell foam for maintaining buoyancy and a bottom section houses a counterweight for maintaining proper orientation of the buoy in the water, the buoy requiring no support from its surrounds while minimally impacting response of the surrounding ice to it. Multiple sensors are incorporated for gathering data and a satellite transmitter transmits the data to a remote user.

If there is a thinning of the ice, this indicates a net warming over time. Conversely, thicker ice results from a net cooling. The mass balance of the sea-ice cover is a function of its extent and thickness, which combine to give its volume. The extent of the sea-ice cover can be monitored from satellites using passive microwave imagery. Changes in ice thickness cannot be monitored as well from satellites. One alternative is to use drifting buoys to collect ice-thickness measurements. Multi-year sea ice has been extensively studied with drifting buoys. However, thin ice (less than two meters thick and not expected to survive) generally classified as seasonal ice, has not been able to be properly studied with drifting buoys.","What is needed is an inexpensive, robust buoy that automatically and inexpensively obtains the high resolution thickness and melt data unavailable from remote sensors. The robust buoy will operate without the need for human observers. The robust buoy will excel in taking data from \u201cfirst year\u201d (thin) ice. The robust buoy will be deployed down an opening in an ice floe, thus eliminating the need for a team to create multiple holes of different sizes and to carry associated drilling equipment. The robust buoy will float with a strong self-righting moment, enabling its operation in extremely thin ice, and even in the open ocean, with no dependence on ice cover for support. The robust buoy will be self\u2014contained with minimal external wires and protrusions, thus being less vulnerable to damage by ice motion and wildlife. The robust buoy will have minimal effect on surrounding ice, thus enabling accurate multiple measurements on the deployment opening. The robust buoy will comprise material that mimics ice properties, having minimal conductive wiring. Further, convection currents within the robust buoy will be minimized by filler, such as closed cell foam. Finally, the robust buoy may have excessive ballast that facilitates its use as a platform for additional scientific investigations. Select embodiments of the present invention address each of these design considerations.","Select embodiments of the present invention comprise a buoy for automated collection and transmittal of sensor data. Specifically, select embodiments collect mass balance data from a thin ice floe drifting in water. The buoy may comprise a housing adapted to be inserted into water through an opening drilled in an ice floe. The buoy floats with the ice floe with the top of its housing protruding above the ice floe. Select embodiments of the present invention incorporate flotation material for maintaining buoyancy and a righting capability to insure the buoy floats upright and requires no support from surrounding ice, thus minimally impacting surrounding ice. Select embodiments of the present invention incorporate a system for gathering data and transmitting it via transmitters or transceivers. Data include input from sensors for calculating mass balance.","Select embodiments of the present invention comprise a method of collecting sensor data with a specially configured buoy. Select embodiments of the present invention collect sensor data from a thin ice floe drifting in water to enable calculating mass balance. Select embodiments of the present invention include a method comprising: a) inserting a buoy into the water through an opening drilled in an ice floe so that the buoy floats with the ice floe and the top of the buoy protrudes above the ice floe; maintaining buoyancy of the buoy; maintaining balance of the buoy to insure orientation of the buoy is upright with no support from surrounding ice and minimal impact to the surrounding ice; and gathering and transmitting data. In select embodiments of the present invention collected data facilitate at least calculation of mass balance.","Refer to . A buoy  comprises a multi-part tubular housing , ,  that is adapted to be inserted into water through an opening in an ice floe (not shown separately) so that the buoy  floats with the ice floe, the top  protruding above the opening. The top section  is connected to the middle section  via connectors  and the middle section  is connected to the bottom section  via connectors . Select embodiments of the present invention employ polyvinyl chloride (PVC) for the housing , ,  because thermal properties are similar to ice. A PVC housing , ,  does not disturb the thermal gradient in the ice. PVC is also less brittle at low temperatures than other plastics such as ABS or HDPE. For select embodiments of the present invention the housing , ,  is painted white to mimic the optical properties of snow and ice, thus reflecting similar amounts of shortwave radiation and not impacting energy balance in the area the buoy is measuring.","The tubular housing , ,  has top , middle  and bottom  sections able to be disconnected for ease of handling and transport. In select embodiments of the present invention, the connectors ,  are \u201cquick-locking\u201d mechanisms.","Refer to . In select embodiments of the present invention, the top section  houses at least an air temperature sensor , a snow depth sensor , a barometric pressure sensor  and one or more antennas . All wires  run within the housing , , , protecting them from abrasion, such as from ice breakup, wildlife and the like. The wires  are provided with connectors  to ease disassembly of the housing sections , , .","Refer to . The middle section  supports the top section . In select embodiments of the present invention, no electronics are enclosed in the middle section  and the wires  pass through the center of the middle section  in a conduit . In select embodiments of the present invention, the middle section  contains material  for maintaining buoyancy of the buoy . Select embodiments of the present invention may employ a variety of buoyant-keeping material with a preferred material comprising a closed cell foam such as, for example, a two part pourable urethane foam. The material  fills the air space within the middle section and prevents the loss of buoyancy in the event of leakage of water into the housing , , , e.g., through the section connections , . The material  also restricts convective heat transport in the housing , ,  since air inside the top section  that is colder and denser than air at the bottom section  would otherwise sink. In select embodiments of the present invention, one or more strings  of thyristors are mounted on the outside of the middle section  to provide a temperature profile.","Refer to . In select embodiments of the present invention, the watertight bottom section  is the control center of the buoy . In select embodiments of the present invention, the bottom section  contains a satellite transmitter , a data logger  such as, for example, a Campbell Scientific CR-1000, and a battery pack , preferably comprising one or more lithium ion batteries. In select embodiments of the present invention, the data logger  incorporates custom software that at least: budgets power, controls data collection, stores data, and packages and sends data to the satellite transmitter . The wires  enter the bottom section  from both the top and bottom. Affixed to the outside wall of the bottom section  is a continuation of the thyristor string  of the middle section , as well as an underwater pressure sensor  and an underwater acoustic rangefinder  to locate the bottom of the ice floe. The bottom section  also includes a \u201crighting device\u201d  for keeping the buoy  balanced and floating upright so that the housing , ,  requires no support from the surrounding ice and minimally affects the ice around it. In select embodiments of the present invention the righting device  comprises an iron counter weight disposed in the very bottom of the bottom section .","In operation of select embodiments of the present invention, a buoy  is inserted into the water through an opening in an ice floe, e.g., a hole drilled in the ice floe by the person emplacing the buoy , so that the buoy  floats with the ice floe, at least part of the top section  protruding above the ice surface. The flotation material , e.g., closed cell foam, ensures buoyancy in the event of a leak. The righting device , e.g., an iron counterweight, maintains balance to ensure proper orientation of the buoy so that it floats upright, requiring no support from surrounding ice while minimally impacting the ice. In select embodiments of the present invention, sensors gather data, e.g., that data necessary to calculate mass balance, and the data logger  sends the data to the transmitter , alternatively a transceiver, that transmits data by means of antennas  to a satellite network, such as the ARGOS satellite network. In select embodiments of the present invention, the satellite network is linked to a user, such as a scientist or technician in a laboratory. In select embodiments of the present invention, data may include at least location of the snow surface and ice bottom of the ice floe, a temperature profile of the snow, ice, and water, air temperature, snow depth, barometric pressure, and underwater pressure at a fixed distance from the surface of the ice floe. In select embodiments of the present invention, data are post-processed to calculate derivative values that may include ice thickness (both local and integrated over the adjacent ice sheet) and ice melt rate at both the surface and bottom of the ice floe.","The abstract of the disclosure is provided to comply with the rules requiring an abstract that will allow a searcher to quickly ascertain the subject matter of the technical disclosure of any patent issued from this disclosure. 37 CFR \u00a71.72(b). Any advantages and benefits described may not apply to all embodiments of the invention.","While the invention has been described in terms of some of its embodiments, those skilled in the art will recognize that the invention can be practiced with modifications within the spirit and scope of the appended claims. For example, although the system is described in specific examples for taking balance data from an ice floe, it may apply to any number of applications wherein measurements are taken in a fluid, such as liquids, including water and industrial solutions.","In the claims, means-plus-function clauses are intended to cover the structures described herein as performing the recited function and not only structural equivalents, but also equivalent structures. Thus, although a nail and a screw may not be structural equivalents in that a nail employs a cylindrical surface to secure wooden parts together, whereas a screw employs a helical surface, in the environment of fastening wooden parts, a nail and a screw may be equivalent structures.
