The metallic ink used here is desired to sinter at lower temperatures below the heat resistance temperature of the plastic substrate. As such metallic inks for conductive patterning, silver- or copper-containing inks that are sintering at lower temperatures have widely been developed. Among them, copper has advantages over silver for its more excellent electrical characteristics and lower price.","As the inks for copper patterning, there are known inks in which copper carboxylate is used as the copper material (Non-patent Publications 1 and 2) and in which copper fine particles are dispersed (Patent Publications 1 and 2). Since copper is prone to oxidation, sintering of such inks is often performed in a reducing atmosphere, such as of hydrogen or formic acid, which causes safety problems in industrialization. In addition, the sintering temperature is as high as 250\u00b0 C. or higher, and thus can be applied to only some types of plastic substrates.","In order to solve these problems, there are proposed inks achieving low-temperature sintering, such as the one disclosed in Non-patent Publication 3, which is composed of copper formate, amine, and a solvent. This ink is made into a copper pattern by sintering at 120 to 160\u00b0 C. in nitrogen atmosphere. However, sintering of such conventional copper ink which contains an organic copper compound or copper fine particles as a copper material may result in shrinkage of the printed film, and the sintered pattern may be different from the desired, as-printed pattern.","On the other hand, it has been reported that materials containing organic components, which decompose and vaporize at lower temperatures, are useful in inks such as those on plastic substrates, which need to be sintered at lower temperatures. As such compounds, silver \u03b2-ketocarboxylate compounds are known, which are reported to be capable of silver patterning at lower temperatures (Patent Publication 3).","As a corresponding copper compound exhibiting similar decomposition mechanism, a copper \u03b2-ketocarboxylate compound may be envisaged. Copper \u03b2-ketocarboxylate compounds have been studied over a long time, and used as a polymerization catalyst or a silver reducing agent (Patent Publication 4, Non-patent Publications 4 and 5).","However, these compounds have never been used as a material for copper patterning, partly because copper is more prone to oxidation than silver, and conductive copper patterns cannot be obtained by techniques similar to those for the silver \u03b2-ketocarboxylate compounds.\n\n","It is an object of the present invention to provide a composition for copper patterning which is excellently safe in copper patterning, sintering at lower temperatures, and capable of forming a highly conductive copper pattern of a desired shape even on a plastic substrate.","It is another object of the present invention to provide a method of copper patterning that produces with excellent safety a copper pattern of a desired shape with high conductivity by low-temperature sintering at a good yield even on a plastic substrate.","It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a copper pattern having a desired shape and a high conductivity.","According to the present invention, there is provided a composition for copper patterning comprising:","Component A: a copper \u03b2-ketocarboxylate compound represented by the formula (1):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0023"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"19.90mm","wi":"55.29mm","file":"US09157004-20151013-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},"Component B: an amine compound having a boiling point of not higher than 250\u00b0 C. at 0.1 to 500 mol; and","at least one of:\n\n","According to the present invention, there is also provided a method of copper patterning comprising printing with the above-mentioned composition for copper patterning on a substrate, and sintering at 120 to 250\u00b0 C. in an inert gas atmosphere.","According to the present invention, there is further provided a copper pattern obtained by the above-mentioned method.","The composition for copper patterning according to the present invention, containing the above-mentioned components at the particular ratio, is excellently safe in copper patterning, sintering at lower temperatures, and capable of forming a highly conductive copper pattern of a desired shape even on a plastic substrate of which heat resistance temperature is low.
