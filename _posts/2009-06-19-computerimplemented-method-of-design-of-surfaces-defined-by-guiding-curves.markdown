title: Computer-implemented method of design of surfaces defined by guiding curves
abstract: A computer-implemented method of design of ruled surfaces may comprise the step of accessing data defining guiding curves P(u) and Q(v) and a cost function ƒ(t,w). Given P(u) and Q(v), the unknown coupling is a parameterized curve s(t(s),w(s)). The method further comprises defining an objective function of the type J=J(ƒ,t,w), involving both ƒ(t,w) and coordinates t, w of the coupling curve. Then, optimizing the objective function J makes it possible to obtain the target coupling curve. Finally, a ruled surface S(s,λ)=λQ(w(s))+(1−λ)P(t(s))is provided, according to the guiding curves P(t(s)) and Q(w(s)), composed with the coordinates t,w of the coupling curve previously obtained. In addition, the objective function is further constrained at the optimization step such that arguments t,w of the cost function ƒ(t,w) are regulated by a regulation function μ.

CATIA is a multi-platform CAD\/CAM\/CAE software suite, commonly referred to as a 3D Product Lifecycle Management software suite. It supports multiple stages of product development (CAx), ranging from conceptualization, through design (CAD) and manufacturing (CAM), until analysis (CAE). This software suite is customizable via application programming interfaces (API). Some versions can be adapted in various programming languages, under dedicated APIs.","These so-called CAD systems notably allow a user to construct and manipulate complex three dimensional (3D) models of objects or assemblies of objects. CAD systems thus provide a representation of modeled objects using edges or lines, in certain cases with faces. These CAD systems manage parts or assemblies of parts as modeled objects, which are mainly specifications of geometry. In particular, CAD files contain specifications, from which geometry is generated. From geometry, a representation is generated. Specifications, geometry and representation may be stored in a single CAD file or multiple ones. CAD systems include graphic tools for representing the modeled objects to the designers; these tools are dedicated to the display of complex objects\u2014the typical size of a file representing an object in a CAD system extending up to the range of a Mega-byte for part, and an assembly may comprise thousands of parts. A CAD system manages models of objects, which are stored in electronic files.","Designing a mechanical part with a known CAD system can be seen as defining the geometrical shape and dimensions of said part so as to fit functional and manufacturing requirements. Mainly, the resulting shape is a combination of basic features such as pad, pocket, groove, shaft etc. created by the designer. Through complex geometrical and topological computations, the CAD system yields the boundary representation of the solid (mechanical part) as e.g. a closed and oriented surface.","Other basic elements may form the shape of a part or a product, amongst which are the ruled surfaces. Ruled surface design may be part of a computer aided geometric design system. Rigorously, in geometry, a surface S is ruled if through every point of S there is a straight line that lies on S. Celebrated examples are the plane and the curved surface of a cylinder or cone. A ruled surface can accordingly be visualized as the surface formed by moving a line segment, i.e. a \u201cstraight\u201d line in space. For example, a cone is formed by keeping one end-point of a line fixed whilst moving the other end-point in a circle. The line segment motion is for instance governed by two guiding curves, e.g. defined by the user, so that the end points of the line segment move along each guiding curve.","Ruled surfaces are often used in tooling design (e.g. casting, flash zone of forging dies, cutting tool for forged part) as well as shape design (e.g. chamfer in mechanical part design, tilted surface in architecture).","Developable surfaces, which can be unfolded into a plane without deformation, are known as a special case of ruled surfaces, incorporating an extra constraint of developability in addition to the above characteristics of a ruled surface.","Developable surfaces are used in the design of objects which must be manufactured from flat sheets of a (quasi) inextensible material, such that the material is only folded to fit the shape. Many man made objects, such as luxury handbags made of leather, certain buildings, and individual plates for ship hulls, are designed in this manner.","Several computational methods and algorithms related to ruled surface design are known in the art. A main problem is to conveniently couple the two guiding curves. There is an infinity of ways to connect the two input guiding curves by moving a line segment. The coupling strategy is thus a key feature of ruled surface design. Two coupling technologies are used.","The first one is the \u201cimplicit coupling\u201d, wherein, broadly, the CAD system is in charge of the coupling strategy. The CAD system runs an algorithm embedding a \u201ccost function\u201d so that the ruled surface is computed as the solution of an optimization problem, and in particular a cost-minimization problem. The cost function may capture physical properties like minimal surface area, maximal developability, minimal bending energy, minimal mean curvature variation or minimal normal variation. Furthermore, the cost function may linearly combine several of such criteria. In addition, a dedicated \u201ccoupling function\u201d, or equivalently a corresponding \u201ccoupling curve\u201d, captures how each point of the first guiding curve is connected to a point of the other guiding curve.","The coupling function is involved in the cost function together with the geometrical definition of the guiding curves. A basic property of the coupling function is to be monotonous. Otherwise, the resulting surface is singular (folded or pinched), which makes the surface unusable in any further geometrical processing. A typical reference about implicit coupling is \u201cOptimal boundary triangulations of an interpolating ruled surface\u201d, C. C. L Wang, K. Tang, Journal of Computing and Information Science in Engineering, Vol. 5, 2005.","In addition, a \u201clocal repair\u201d may occur. The corresponding technology is the following. A user lets the CAD system compute a ruled surface through its own implicit coupling strategy. Generally, the resulting surface is not satisfactory. Then, thanks to an interactive toolkit, the user removes by hand the \u201cbad\u201d portions of surface and fills the gap with a fill surface. Notice that the fill surface is defined by boundary and tangency conditions, it is not a ruled surface.","A second technology known is the \u201cexplicit coupling\u201d. Here, the CAD system user is in charge of the coupling strategy. The CAD system asks the user to select points on a guiding curve and to select the corresponding points on the other guiding curve. The number of connected points is the user's choice. This results in a finite set of coupled points, connected by line segments. Then the CAD system fills the empty space between consecutive coupling segments using a known interpolation strategy.","The known methods of implicit coupling may further make use of a numerical optimization algorithm. The scientific literature provides a large number of such algorithms.","The above methods are not infallible.","For example, implicit coupling methods involve a cost function driven or inspired by physical properties or the like. Illustrated in  (as from the paper of Wang and Tang cited above), two ruled surfaces obtained from the same guiding curves () through different physical criteria (). Notice the bad quality of surface due to local concentration of line segments. Thus, the quality of resulting surfaces must be improved.","Explicit coupling is the responsibility of the mechanical CAD user. The first drawback of this technology is that a human operator cannot deal with hundreds of coupling segments connecting two guiding curves. A few dozens is a reasonable limit, which restricts the designing scope. Next drawback is that the coupling has to be redefined or updated each time a guiding curve is modified. Even if the CAD system is history-based (meaning that points initially defined on a curve are automatically redefined on the modified curve), there is no guarantee that the updated coupling plugged on the updated guiding curves provides a correct ruled surface. Consequently, the user has to check the modified surface and, in many cases, has to rework the coupling. The last drawback of explicit coupling is that it never works at first shot. It is improved by the user through a tedious try and error iterative process. Furthermore, this try and error process is potentially required each time a guiding curve is modified.","Finally, the methods involving local repair are essentially a manual procedure. It relies on the ability of the user to see where the ruled surface is not correct. A very small singularity can be missed. Obviously, the local repair of an initial ruled surface is not suited to the modified ruled surface. Once more, local repair process has to be redone each time a guiding curve is modified.","In a few words, existing technology provides solutions that result in a bad quality output or a time consuming design process.","In addition, the underlying algorithms of implicit coupling often fail, especially in the case of involved guiding curves. Their robustness is therefore questionable.","Accordingly, the present invention aims at improving the robustness of computer-implemented methods of design of ruled surfaces. Preferably, the solution should improve the quality of surfaces output and, if possible, generalize to any surface defined by coupling two guiding curves.","To achieve this, the present invention proposes a computer-implemented method of design of a surface defined by guiding curves P(u) and Q(v) and a coupling curve s(t(s),w(s)), for improving the manufacture of products modeled by such a surface, the method comprising:\n\n","In given embodiments, the process according to the invention may comprise one or more of the following features:\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0033"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"J","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["t","w"],"mo":","}}},{"msubsup":{"mo":"\u222b","mn":["0","1"]},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"f","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"t","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"s"}},{"mi":"w","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"s"}}],"mo":","}}},{"mi":"\u03bc","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"t","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"s"}},{"mi":"w","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"s"}}],"mo":","}}},{"mo":"\u2146","mi":"s"}],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.2em","height":"0.2ex"}}}}}],"mo":"="},"mo":","}}},"br":{},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0005","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0005-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0006","list-style":"none"},"li":"at the step of defining the objective function, the objective function defined is of the type"}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0035"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"J","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["t","w"],"mo":","}}},{"msubsup":{"mo":"\u222b","mn":["0","1"]},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"f","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"t","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"s"}},{"mi":"w","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"s"}}],"mo":","}}},{"mi":"\u03bc","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mrow":[{"msup":{"mi":["t","\u2032"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"s"}},{"msup":{"mi":["w","\u2032"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"s"}}],"mo":","}}},{"mo":"\u2146","mi":"s"}],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.2em","height":"0.2ex"}}}}}],"mo":"="},"mo":","}}},"br":{},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0007","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0007-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0008","list-style":"none"},"li":"at the step of defining the objective function, the regulation function \u03bc is a scalar, positively homogeneous function;"}}}},"at the step of optimizing the objective function, the objective function is constrained such that the derivatives involved in the regulation function are both positive, whereby an increasing coupling curve is implemented;","at the step of optimizing the objective function, the optimization is constrained such that:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0039"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00003","num":"00003"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":{"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"msup":{"mi":["t","\u2032"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"s"}},{"mi":"\u03bc","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mrow":[{"msup":{"mi":["t","\u2032"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"s"}},{"msup":{"mi":["w","\u2032"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"s"}}],"mo":","}}}]},"mo":["\u2265","\u2265"],"mrow":{"mi":["\u025b","and"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}],"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"msup":{"mi":["w","\u2032"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"s"}},{"mi":"\u03bc","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mrow":[{"msup":{"mi":["t","\u2032"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"s"}},{"msup":{"mi":["w","\u2032"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"s"}}],"mo":","}}}]}},"mi":"\u025b"},"mo":","}}},"br":{},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0009","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0009-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0010","list-style":"none"},"li":["at the step of defining the objective function, the regulation function \u03bc is implemented so as to define a two-dimensional metric;","at the step of optimizing the objective function, the optimization is posed as the following minimization problem:","minJ(t,w);","t\u2032\/\u03bc(t\u2032,w\u2032)\u2267\u03b5;

First, the present invention and preferred embodiments thereof are described broadly. Then, the overall process is described, step by step. Finally, details of the preferred embodiments are investigated.","In a few words, the present invention relates to a method of design of (ruled) surfaces, based on a scheme of implicit coupling. According to the invention, the objective function J=J(\u0192,t,w) is constrained such that arguments t,w of the cost function \u0192(t,w) are regulated by a regulation function \u03bc. Thus, a regulation function \u03bc is here involved, in addition to the cost function. The regulation function acts on the arguments t,w of the cost function \u0192(t,w). More exactly, the function \u03bc regulates the said arguments during the optimization, just as an anti-lock brake controller regulates the rotational speed of the wheels of a car. Similarly, the function \u03bc regulates the said arguments in that it typically acts on the \u201cspeed\u201d (i.e. the first derivative) thereof. Hence, the objective function is further constrained, according to a non-geometrical criterion.","The robustness of the underlying algorithm is thereby improved, as shall be illustrated in various examples below. All the more, results obtained are more meaningful to the user and the quality of surfaces returned by the design system is improved. In contrast, a usual implicit-coupling algorithm is likely to get poorly meaningful results, governed by the geometry only. Interestingly, the present method can be generalized to any surface defined by coupling two guiding curves. In fact, the present inventors have realized that drawbacks of existing methods of implicit coupling arise due to a weakness of the optimization algorithm. In particular, they have realized that the level of constraints of the objective function to optimize is not sufficient to ensure a robust optimization and meaningful results. Moreover, they have understood that the physical-like criteria involved in the cost function do not suffice to secure the optimization algorithm. While taking some criteria is unavoidable to cope with the infinity of coupling solutions, the present inventors have then realized that the required criteria should extend beyond the usual physical criteria. This contrasts with a number of prior art approaches wherein physical criteria have systematically been developed to improve the final surfaces or the robustness of the implicit coupling algorithm.","Relying instead on a regulation function to further constrain the optimization process turns out all the more convenient since physical properties are not particularly significant to the mechanical designer (besides the developability, as discussed below). Indeed, the expectation of the designer is ease of use, performance and robustness. None of these criteria is captured by a physical-like property, whereas the regulation function at stake secures the underlying optimization algorithm.","As said, perhaps the sole physical property that really deals with the ruled property is the \u201cdevelopability\u201d. However, given two arbitrary guiding curves, there exists generally no developable surface to connect them. And even if, locally, a developable surface exists, it is not always regular everywhere. Accordingly, a physical-like cost-function can be concluded not to satisfy the mechanical CAD user expectation.","This being said, the preferred embodiments are now broadly described.","First, the cost-function can be augmented by the above regulation function, hence yielding an effective cost-function that can be adjusted to fit one or more of the following goals: user's expectation, numerical evaluation performance, parallelizable algorithm, robustness. As opposed to background art, the resulting effective cost-function is not driven by physical properties only, possibly no physical property at all.","It is for example designed to provide a smooth surface in the following sense. On one hand, the line segments of the resulting surface are harmoniously arranged all along the way. This can be captured through the effective cost-function itself (or the regulation function). Now, a principle of the invention is to take advantage of the flexibility provided by the above specification of \u201charmoniously arranged\u201d line segments. Within this range of freedom, the effective cost-function can be designed as well to perform efficiently during the numerical solving step. This allows a robust solving algorithm, well suited to the arbitrary complexity of guiding curves.","On the other hand, the tangent plane can be everywhere defined by evaluating first order partial derivatives. This can further be captured by imposing a strictly increasing coupling curve.","In addition and as shall be described in details, the effective cost-function can be adapted to parallel processing. For example, the \u201cParticle Swarm Optimization\u201d (PSO) algorithm turns out to be particularly well suited to the problem as posed. It is able to overcome a local solution trap and converge toward a far and better solution. The PSO algorithm is also trivial to parallelize, because it executes a large number of simultaneous and independent evaluations of the cost function. The reader may for example refer to: \u201cSwarm Intelligence, Focus on Ant and Particle Swarm Optimization\u201d, edited by Felix T.S. Chan and Manoj Kumar Tiwari, Publisher: I-Tech Education and Publishing, Vienna, Austria, December 2007.","Before turning to details of the preferred embodiments, the overall process is briefly described in reference to .","The method of the invention comprises a step S, S of accessing data defining guiding curves P(u) and Q(v) (step S) and a cost function \u0192(t,w) (step S). Given the user selected guiding curves P(u) and Q(v), the unknown coupling is a parameterized curve s(t(s),w(s)), which could else be defined as a function instead of a curve. A cost function \u0192(t,w) defines, as known, a relevant characteristic modeling the quality of the ruled surface. This characteristic is closely related to the guiding curves geometry.","The method further comprises defining (step S) an objective function of the type J=J(\u0192,t,w), as known, involving both the cost function \u0192(t,w) and coordinates t, w of the coupling curve s(t(s),w(s)).","Then, optimizing at step S the objective function J according to the optimization problem posed (see e.g. the problem as posed at S) makes it possible to obtain the target coupling curve s(t(s),w(s)), step S. As said, different optimization algorithms can be contemplated. The choice of the PSO algorithm will be described in details later.","Finally, a ruled surface S(s,\u03bb)=\u03bbQ(w(s))+(1\u2212\u03bb)P(t(s)) is provided, step S, according to the guiding curves P(t(s)) and Q(w(s)). Note that the guiding curves P(u) and Q(v) are actually composed with the coordinates t,w of the coupling curve previously obtained.","What has been just described is merely an implicit coupling scheme. Now, as noted above and according to the invention, the objective function J=J(\u0192,t,w) is further constrained (S-S) such that arguments t,w of the cost function \u0192(t,w) are regulated by a regulation function \u03bc. Obviously, since two arguments are involved, each of the arguments are likely to be regulated independently by the regulation function. Said regulation function \u03bc is for instance accessed through relevant data at step S, e.g. together or parallel with steps S, S.","In contrast with the cost function \u0192(t,w), as long as \u03bc is devoted to the regulation of arguments involved in the cost function, \u03bc is independent of the guiding curves. A simple and practical way of achieving this is to make the regulation function \u03bc depend on derivatives of arguments t,w. Hence, \u03bc(t\u2032,w\u2032) is independent of the guiding curves. Similarly, and as noted earlier, an anti-lock brake controller measures and regulates rotational speed of car wheels; it does not directly depend on the conformation of the road. Other examples could help in understanding the present invention. For instance, we may somehow compare the present context with that of a skater, willing to skate a double-rail structure with each of his\/her skates engaged in respective guiding rails of the structure (each being comparable here to a guiding curve). One can easily grasp the potential difficulty of the exercise, especially in the case of involved guiding rails. However, the skater may realize that the difficulty could be partly overcome by regulating (i.e. adapting by increasing or decreasing temporarily) the speed of each of his\/her skates. Likewise, the arguments of the cost function are likely to be regulated by the regulation function.","Yet, different ways of regulating arguments t,w can be contemplated, e.g. by locally confining arguments t,w in a given interval. Making \u03bc depend on derivatives is however more meaningful to the user and, incidentally, quite efficient on the computational side. Note that higher-order derivatives could be involved in specific applications.","Next, implementation of \u03bc(t\u2032,w\u2032) is preferably such the objective function is independent from the parameterization of the cost function. This notably ensures invariance property of the objective function and contributes to improve the robustness of the underlying algorithm.","In this regard, various possibilities for constraining the objective function J=J(\u0192,t,w) can be contemplated. Yet, instead of implementing the constraint as an external constraint, it is advantageous to implement the constraint implicitly, that is, internally to the objective function J. Accordingly, the underlying algorithm (and corresponding computational cost) is not substantially impacted with respect to the prior art implicit coupling. A convenient example is an objective function J of the type:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0087"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00004","num":"00004"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"J","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["t","w"],"mo":","}}},{"msubsup":{"mo":"\u222b","mn":["0","1"]},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"f","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"t","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"s"}},{"mi":"w","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"s"}}],"mo":","}}},{"mi":"\u03bc","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"t","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"s"}},{"mi":"w","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"s"}}],"mo":","}}},{"mrow":{"mo":"\u2146","mi":"s"},"mo":"."}],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.2em","height":"0.2ex"}}}}}],"mo":"="}}}},"Now, since the regulation function \u03bc depend preferably on derivatives of arguments t,w, a suitable choice is to implement the objective function as J=\u222b\u0192(t,w)\u03bc(t\u2032,w\u2032)ds, which actually amounts to consider an effective cost function \u0192(t,w)\u03bc(t\u2032,w\u2032), involving both the usual cost function and function \u03bc. The optimization problem is posed at step S.","In particular, the derivatives involved in the regulation function are preferably both positive, whereby an increasing coupling curve is implemented.

A suited optimization algorithm may provide an optimal coupling curve, which in turns defines the output ruled surface.","Having in mind the overall process, we now turn to details of the preferred embodiments.","A first point relates to the coupling curve. In particular, the following paragraphs aims at proving that if the coupling curve is not strictly increasing, a singularity always occurs.","In this respect, the input guiding curves are P(u),u\u03b5[0,1] and Q(v),v\u03b5[0,1], as known in the art.

The unknown coupling curve s(t(s),w(s)),s\u03b5[0,1] is a planar curve in the [0,1]\u00d7[0,1] space such that t(0)=0,t(1)=1,w(0)=0 and w(1)=1.","As illustrated in , for each value of parameter s \u03b5[0,1], the coupling curve associates parameter values t(s) and w(s), which defines the line segment joining points P(t(s)) and Q(w(s)).

In fact, here the ruled surface is not injective, meaning that there exists (s,\u03bb) and (s,\u03bb) such that (s,\u03bb)\u2260(s,\u03bb) and S(s,\u03bb)=S(s,\u03bb). Indeed, since the coupling curve oscillates, there exists s,sand ssuch that t(s)=t(s)=t(s)={tilde over (t)} and distinct w(s)=was illustrated in . Then, S(s,\u03bb)=\u03bbQ(w)+(1\u2212\u03bb)P({tilde over (t)}) so S(s,0)=P({tilde over (t)}) for i=1,2,3, as expected.

Let P(u),u\u03b5[0,1] be a parameterized 3D curve and Q a point not on curve P. The triangular surface is defined by S(u, v)=vQ+(1\u2212v)P(u). Then, the tangent plane to surface S at point Q is not defined through first order partial derivatives, that is S(u,1)^S(u,1)=0 for all u \u03b5[0,1]. Furthermore, it can be shown that this tangent plane does not exist, unless curve P is fully included in a plane including point Q. This results in a singularity.","Such a singularity occurs when the coupling curve is locally horizontal or locally vertical, as illustrated in  or B, respectively (note that the situation slightly differs compared with that of  or B). If the coupling curve is locally horizontal or locally vertical, then moving along the guiding curves, one end of the line segment \u201cstops\u201d during a short period of time while the other end goes on moving.","One can understand from the three investigations above that the coupling curve has preferably to be strictly increasing, should it be to improve the quality of the ruled surface output. In particular, it may be strictly increasing in the following sense: t\u2032>0 and w\u2032>0. Else, a singularity occurs, making the surface more difficult to use in a further geometrical process. In this respect, it may be noticed that a cone surface is developable but it features the \u201cnon planar triangular ruled surface\u201d singularity, which may cause rounding and filleting failure.","To conclude on these brief investigations, the objective function is preferably constrained such that the derivatives involved in the regulation function are both positive, whereby a (strictly) increasing coupling curve is implemented. As a result, this notably prevents obtaining folded, pinched or non planar triangular surfaces.","Next, additional details are discussed as to the regulation function \u03bc(u,v). Some of the following aspects are better understood in relation with the flowchart of .","We have seen that as long as \u03bc remains devoted to the regulation of arguments involved in the cost function, \u03bc is independent of the guiding curves. In addition, this function is important inasmuch as it may be implemented so as to yield an invariance property (with respect to reparameterization of the cost function), which shall be detailed later. In particular, opting for a choice of variables which naturally imposes the invariance helps the practical implementation (it does not depend on the guiding curves). Accordingly, choosing a suitable \u03bc(u,v) simplifies the numerical problem and accelerates the solving.","Function \u03bc(u,v) is for instance chosen as a scalar function that is positively homogeneous.

The cost function, or \u0192=\u0192(t,w), is likely to capture the significant geometrical quantity. According to experiments carried out during the development of the present invention, a very convenient function \u0192for a ruled surface is, in practice, defined as \u0192(t,w)=\u2225P(t)\u2212Q(w)\u2225. Notice that the input guiding curves play a symmetrical role so that the resulting ruled surface does not depend on a user selection order, if any. Indeed, reversing curves P and Q and reversing the coordinates of the coupling curve yields \u2225Q(w)\u2212P(t)\u2225, that is, the same value as \u2225P(t)\u2212Q(w)\u2225. This makes the ruled surface creation easier from the user point of view. In this respect, referring back shortly to the flowchart of , it is to be understood that the (user) selection, if any, of the input guiding curves occurs prior to steps S and S.","Next, in an embodiment, the cost function may furthermore capture a \u201cdevelopable\u201d criterion (e.g. related to a developable surface), if necessary. In this respect, one has to keep in mind that this criterion is involved in the cost function only, when explicitly required by the designer, and that it must be combined with another smoothing criterion because the developable surface does generally not exist.","Having defined both the cost and regulation functions, we turn to the objective function J.","As discussed earlier, the objective function is defined as an integral of the product of functions \u0192 and \u03bc. By \u201cintegral\u201d, it is meant a number close to an area bound by said product, it being understood that a discretization of said integral is obviously contemplated.","As mentioned too, function \u0192=\u0192(t,w) captures the geometry, as known in the art. Function \u03bc(u,v) preferably involves the derivatives of the coupling curve \u03bc(t\u2032, w\u2032) in order to provide the invariance property (as detailed later).

Yet, it can be shown that re-parameterization invariance is captured without any more assumption about function \u03bc.","We now briefly revert to the concept of \u201cstrictly increasing\u201d constraint.

more will be said as to the choice of function \u03bc.

This allows the algorithm to handle complex guiding curves, and even arbitrary complex curves, to the knowledge of the inventors. For example, very long curves featuring many small details such as local turns and rounds can be safely handled; in contrast with the known prior art methods.","The discussion is now directed to the implementation of an optimization algorithm. As mentioned above, the present inventors found particularly advantageous to make use of the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. As opposed to traditional optimization algorithms, the PSO algorithm performs ten to thirty optimum searches at the same time. Each searching process communicates with \u201cneighboring processes\u201d in order to take benefit of \u201cgood searching directions\u201d and, nevertheless, is autonomous enough to investigate unexplored regions. The art of PSO algorithm is to define and implement these concepts, as known by the skilled person. Experiments show for instance that good results are obtained with thirty simultaneous searches. PSO algorithm communicates with the application through external calls. It needs to periodically evaluate the objective function during the search process.","When the invention is to be implemented together with strictly increasing coupling curves, a challenge in implementing the PSO algorithm is to guarantee that the search is performed within a set of strictly increasing coupling curves. Different approaches can be contemplated.","One possible implementation is to capture the coupling curve as a hierarchy of n=2variables x\u03b5[0,1]i=1, . . . , 2. Given these variables, the corresponding coupling curve can be e.g. recursively defined as follows, and in reference to .","First, xis the abscissa of the point of the coupling curve located on the second diagonal, starting from top left corner (). This point defines two rectangles, bottom left BL(x) and top right TR(x) (). In each rectangle, a splitting line segment parallel to the second diagonal separates the rectangle into two equal regions.","Then, xis the abscissa of the coupling curve's point located on the splitting line of rectangle BL(x) and xis the abscissa of the coupling curve's point located on the splitting line of rectangle TR(x). These new points define two bottom left rectangles, BL(x), BL(x), and two top right rectangles, TR(x),TR(x) () equipped with their respective splitting lines ().","Then, xis the abscissa of the coupling curve's point located on the splitting line of rectangle BL(x),xis the abscissa of the coupling curve's point located on the splitting line of rectangle TR(x),xis the abscissa of the coupling curve's point located on the splitting line of rectangle BL(x) and xis the abscissa of the coupling curve's point located on the splitting line of rectangle TR(x) as illustrated in .","One understands that, applied recursively, this process uniquely defines a strictly increasing curve, as shown in  (fine scale) and  (converged limiting curve, in the above example).","The flow chart of  illustrates an example of how to compute the Cartesian points (t,w) of the coupling curve from hierarchical coordinates x.","Clearly, the reverse process computes hierarchical coordinates xfrom Cartesian coordinates (t,w) of a strictly increasing curve by intersecting the curve with the rectangles splitting lines, as illustrated in .","Consequently, the PSO algorithm deals with the hierarchical coordinates xof coupling curves. Each time the objective function needs to be evaluated, through an external call, hierarchical coordinates xare transformed into Cartesian coordinates (t,w).","Experiments show that good results are obtained with thirty simultaneous searches and with a coupling curve sampling from 32 points to 128 points. Furthermore, when PSO algorithm gets close to the optimum, a traditional non linear optimization method (typically BFGS) can be used to accelerate the convergence. Although the method and routines described herein above are described in a naive manner, for the sake of pedagogy, it is obvious that improvements can be contemplated with respect to algorithm efficiency considerations. For instance, it is pointed at that the present method generalizes to any surface defined by coupling two guiding curves (e.g. based on guiding curves). Indeed, there are several ways of coupling guiding curves that result in surfaces which are not necessarily ruled surfaces. Accordingly, the present invention extends beyond the sole ruled surfaces.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0140","num":"0170"},"figref":"FIG. 15A"},"Client computer(s)\/devices  and server computer(s)  provide processing, storage, and input\/output devices executing application programs and the like.
