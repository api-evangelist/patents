{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENTAL INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of prior filed U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/349,352, filed May 28, 2010, the contents of which are incorporated by reference herein.","This invention was made with government support under contract number N00014-09-1-0383 awarded by the Office of Naval Research (ONR). The government has certain rights in the invention.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention generally relates to a self-healing coating using metallic microcapsules.","2. Description of the Related Art","The cost of corrosion is estimated to be at least $276 billion per year in the U.S. alone. A 2001 study commissioned by the Federal Highway Administration analyzed  industrial sectors to find that direct costs accounted for approximately 3.2% of the U.S. economy. Often overlooked in these numbers are the costs related to equipment downtime. For example, the time spent replacing or rehabilitating corroded equipment not only ties up valuable manpower, but also makes it necessary to maintain a reserve of excess capital equipment. With service rotations as short as 6 months, even a modest increase in service life can lead to significant savings.","The most common approach to preventing corrosion is to paint the surface with a protective coating. Typically, paints composed of an inorganic powder embedded within a polymer matrix have only limited ability to resist abrasion. Attempts to improve durability are ultimately constrained by the requirements that the coating be relatively thin (e.g., <100 \u03bcm) and easy to apply. While repainting and touch-ups can be performed as part of regular maintenance, many defects go unnoticed before significant damage occurs. Accordingly, self-healing coatings have been developed that autonomously repair scratches below some maximum width, thereby delaying the onset of corrosion and increasing the time between maintenance cycles.","The most common strategies utilized in developing self-healing polymer coatings are to supply energy to the system to form new bonds, or supply additional material to the damage zone. Supplying energy to the system could be as simple as heating a polymeric coating to achieve melt and reflow. Other examples include the use of heat to activate a reversible Diehls-Alder reaction, applying UV light to initiate the polymerization of pendant vinyl groups, and the use of hydrogen bonded polymers near their effective melting temperature. The advantage of energy activation is the potential for unlimited healing capacity. However, heating is logistically impractical for large objects, and UV activation may not provide complete healing if pigments in the coating interfere with light absorption.","Another approach achieves self-healing by supplying additional material to the damage zone. For example, one technique for delivering a reservoir of fresh material to a scratch include the use of embedded polymer microcapsules incorporated into paints and primers. The microcapsules release the self-healing compound or compounds, most commonly as liquids, when the coating system is damaged. However, appropriate materials should be used to fabricate the microcapsule and its contents, else it may \u201cdeploy\u201d before the coating is applied or, upon application, spontaneously deploy improperly, i.e., without a physical compromise of the coating such as abrasion or nicking. Further, unless the microcapsule is compatible with both its contents (the encapsulated repair compound) and its surrounds (the solvent), the \u201capplication\u201d life of the resultant mixed product may be less than desirable.","Accordingly, there is a continued need for improved self-healing coatings that can be made in a simple, cost efficient manner.","In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a metallic microcapsule comprising a polymeric microcapsule containing one or more polymeric precursors encapsulated therein; and a metallic shell enclosing a volume containing the polymeric microcapsule.","In accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a metallic microcapsule suitable for adding to a self-healing coating composition to be cured at ambient temperature to facilitate self-healing of the resultant self-healing coating after curing thereof, the metallic microcapsule comprising a polymeric microcapsule containing one or more polymerizable monomers encapsulated therein; and a metallic shell enclosing a volume containing the polymeric microcapsule; whereupon application of the resultant self-healing coating composition to a substrate and curing of the self-healing coating thereon, and further whereupon damage to the self-healing coating results in rupture of the metallic microcapsule and deployment of the one or more polymerizable monomers to fill and seal the compromised volume within the coating adjacent to the metallic microcapsule.","In accordance with a third embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a self-healing coating composition comprising (a) one or more film-forming binders; and (b) metallic microcapsules, the metallic microcapsules being the same or different and comprising a polymeric microcapsule containing one or more polymeric precursors encapsulated therein; and a metallic shell enclosing a volume containing the polymeric microcapsule.","In accordance with a fourth embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a coated article comprising: a substrate; a self-healing coating adjacent the substrate, the self-healing coating having metallic microcapsules, the metallic microcapsules being the same or different and comprising a polymeric microcapsule containing one or more polymeric precursors encapsulated therein; and a metallic shell enclosing a volume containing the polymeric microcapsule.","In accordance with a fifth embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a method for preparing a self-healing coating composition that repairs itself after application and curing thereof, the method comprising: (a) providing one or more film-forming binders; (b) providing the same or different metallic microcapsules compatible with the one or more liquid film-forming binders and comprising polymeric microcapsules containing one or more polymeric precursors encapsulated therein; and a metallic shell enclosing a volume containing the polymeric microcapsule; (c) mixing the metallic microcapsules with the one or more film-forming binders such that the metallic microcapsules are interspersed throughout the one or more film-forming binders to obtain a self-healing coating composition.","In accordance with a sixth embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a method for producing a self-healing coating upon a substrate, the method comprising (a) providing a one or more film-forming binders; (b) providing the same or different metallic microcapsules compatible with the non-self healing coating composition and comprising a polymeric microcapsule containing one or more polymeric precursors encapsulated therein; and a metallic shell enclosing a volume containing the polymeric microcapsule; (c) mixing the metallic microcapsules into the one or more film-forming binders such that the metallic microcapsules are interspersed throughout the one or more film-forming binders to obtain a liquid self-healing coating composition; (d) applying the self-healing coating composition to the substrate; and (e) permitting the applied self-healing coating to cure.","The metallic microcapsules of the present invention are particularly suitable for adding to one or more film-forming binders to form a self-healing coating composition to be cured at ambient temperature to facilitate self-healing of the resultant coating after being damaged. For example, when the applied self-healing coating is damaged, e.g., by abrasion through the coating to the substrate on which it is applied, the metallic microcapsules burst, thereby releasing the one or more polymeric precursors contained therein. This initiates a self-healing process, i.e., the damaged area of the substrate is covered and repaired. This provides a \u201cself-healing\u201d ability to the coating which protects the substrate even after the coating is damaged. Further, when the one or more polymeric precursors such as an isocyanate are exposed to moisture in the air, it is believed that the one or more polymeric precursors will polymerize thereby forming a polyurethane foam which will expand and fill the crack or fissure. The ensuing volume expansion allows the polymeric precursors to heal a larger scratch for a given volume of released polymeric precursor.","In addition to the self-healing properties, the self-healing coating also provides galvanic protection, which is provided by the metallic shell of the metallic microcapsule. For example, if the repair of the scratch is incomplete, the metallic shell can act as a sacrificial anode to galvanically protect an exposed metal substrate, e.g., steel. The metallic shell also hermetically seals the polymeric microcapsule to achieve a relatively long shelf-life without resorting to a two-part curing system, while providing strength and stiffness to the microcapsule to compensate for the loss of mechanical properties caused by the entrained resin.","One aspect of the present invention is directed to metallic microcapsules comprising a polymeric microcapsule containing one or more polymeric precursors and optional water-immiscible composition comprising a substantially water-immiscible luminescent or colorimetric material encapsulated therein; and a metallic shell enclosing a volume containing the polymeric microcapsule. The metallic microcapsules are particularly suitable for adding to a liquid self-healing coating composition to be cured at ambient temperature to facilitate self-healing of the resultant self-healing coating after its application to a substrate and subsequent curing thereon, wherein damage to the self-healing coating results in rupture of the metallic microcapsule and deployment of the one or more polymeric precursors and optional water-immiscible composition comprising a substantially water-immiscible luminescent or colorimetric material to fill and seal the compromised volume within the coating adjacent to the metallic microcapsule.","In general, the microcapsule can be formed employing conventional microcapsulating methods. In one preferred embodiment, the microcapsule is produced from an oil-in-water emulsion which contains one or more polymeric precursors, then causing interfacial polymerization to occur, so as to form microcapsules with a liquid interior (i.e., the one or more polymeric precursors and optional substantially water-immiscible luminescent or colorimetric material) and thin polymer shell, i.e., a polymeric microcapsule. In the interfacial polymerization method, an oil phase containing a polymer-forming resin is mixed with an aqueous phase in which a water-soluble polymer is dissolved in water followed by emulsifying and dispersing by means such as a homogenizer followed by adding one or more crosslinking agents, thereby a polymer forming reaction is caused at an oil\/water interface, whereby a microcapsule wall made of the polymer-forming resin is formed. In the interfacial polymerization method, microcapsules having uniform particle diameters can be formed in a relatively short time period.","The oil phase is prepared from a mixture of one or more polymer-forming resins and optional water-immiscible composition comprising a substantially water-immiscible luminescent or colorimetric material. Suitable polymer-forming resins include any polymer-forming resins known in the art for making microcapsules. Representative examples of a polymer-forming resin include one or more of polyvalent isocyanate compounds. Representative examples of polyvalent isocyanate compounds include isocyanates such as isophorone diisocyanate, m-phenylenediisocyanate, p-phenylenediisocyanate, 2,6-tolylenediisocyanate, 2,4-tolylenediisocyanate, naphthalene-1,4-diisocyanate, diphenylmethane-4,4\u2032-diisocyanate, 3,3\u2032-diphenylmethane-4,4\u2032-diisocyanate, xylene-1,4-diisocyanate, 4,4\u2032-diphenylpropanediisocyanate, trimethylenediisocyanate, hexamethylenediisocyanate, propylene-1,2-diisocyanate, butylene-1,2-diisocyaate, cyclohexylene-1,2-diisocyanate, and cyclohexylene-1,4-diisocyanate; triisocyanates such as 4,4\u2032,4\u2033-triphenylmethanetriisocyanate, and toluene-2,4,6-triisocyanate; tetraisocyanates such as 4,4\u2032-dimethylphenylmethane-2,2\u2032, and 5,5\u2032-tetraisocyanate; and isocyanate prepolymers such as poly[(phenyl isocyanate)-co-formaldehyde], an adduct of hexanemethylenediisocyanate and trimethylolpropane, an adduct of 2,4-tolylenediisocyanate and trimethylolpropane, an adduct of xylene diisocyanate and trimethylolpropane, and an adduct of tolylene diisocyanate and hexanetriol, and the like. If desired, two or more compounds can be used together as necessary.","If necessary, the oil phase can contain one or more additional additives such as dispersants, surfactants and the like and mixtures thereof. Examples of dispersants include water-insoluble pigment dispersants such as a copolymer with acidic groups marketed by Byk Chemie under the trade name Disperbyk 110, and a high molecular weight block copolymer with pigment affinic groups, marketed by Byk Chemie under the trade name Disperbyk 163 and the like. Examples of surfactants include Air Products DABCO DC197 silicone-based surfactant and the like.","A suitable water-immiscible composition comprising a substantially water-immiscible luminescent or colorimetric material for encapsulation in the microcapsule includes any luminescent or colorimetric material known in the art. Representative examples of such luminescent or colorimetric material are Nile red, Nile blue, rhodamine, fluorescein, 9,10-diphenylanthracene, rubrene, tetracene, 9,10-bis(phenylethynyl)anthracene, and the like and mixtures thereof. In one embodiment, the substantially water-immiscible luminescent or colorimetric material is mixed with the one or more polymeric precursors (i.e., polymerizable monomers) to obtain a water-immiscible composition.","In general, the concentration of the polymer forming resin contained in the oil phase can range from about 50 to about 100 wt. %, based on the total weight of the oil solution.","The aqueous phase in which the oil phase is emulsified and dispersed will contain water and a surface active water-soluble polymer. Suitable surface active water-soluble polymer compounds include polyvinyl alcohol and its modified substances, polyacrylic acid amide and its derivatives, ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer, styrene-maleic anhydride copolymer, ethylene-maleic anhydride copolymer, isobutylene-maleic anhydride copolymer, polyvinylpyrolidone, ethylene-acrylic copolymer, vinyl acetate-acrylic copolymer, carboxylmethyl cellulose, methyl cellulose, casein, gelatin, starch derivatives, gum arabic, sodium alginate, and the like. In one preferred embodiment, the water-soluble high polymers do not react with isocyanate compounds or have a relatively low reactivity therewith. For example, like gelatin, a water-soluble high polymer compound having a reactive amino group in the molecular chain thereof must be previously made nonreactive.","In general, the concentration of the water-soluble high polymer compound contained in the aqueous phase can range from about 0.1 to about 10 wt. %, based on the total weight of the aqueous solution.","As discussed hereinabove, the microcapsule is obtained by (a) forming an oil solution from (i) one or more polymer-forming resins, and optionally (ii) a water-immiscible composition comprising a substantially water-immiscible luminescent or colorimetric material to obtain an oil solution; (b) adding to the oil solution an aqueous solution containing a water-soluble polymer and forming an oil-in-water emulsion, e.g., by means of a homogenizer or the like; (c) adding one or more crosslinking agents to the emulsion; and (d) reacting the one or more polymer-forming resins and the one or more crosslinking agents, thereby producing a plurality of microcapsules having a capsule wall, with at least a major portion of one or more polymeric precursors and optional water-immiscible composition comprising a substantially water-immiscible luminescent or colorimetric material encapsulated within the capsule wall of the microcapsules. In general, the encapsulating may be carried out without using an organic solvent.","In one embodiment, the one or more polymeric precursors are unreacted polymer-forming resins. In other words, in reacting the one or more polymer-forming resins and the one or more crosslinking agents, an excess of the one or more polymer-forming resins is employed to provide unreacted polymer-forming resin(s), i.e., the one or more polymeric precursors, encapsulated in the microcapsule. In another embodiment, the one or more polymeric precursors are different than the polymer-forming resin(s). In this embodiment, one or more polymeric precursors are added to the emulsion and then encapsulated in the resulting microcapsule. Suitable polymeric precursors include by way of example, acrylate monomers, methacrylate monomers, vinyl pyridine monomers, vinyl ether monomers, acrylamide monomers, methacrylamide monomers, pyrrolidone monomers, styrene monomers, nylon monomers, polyamines, e.g., those obtained from the reaction of an acid chloride with amine, isocyanates such as isocyanates, diisocyanates and triisocyanates and the like and mixtures thereof.","Useful cross-linking agents include, but are not limited to, amines, alcohols and the like and mixtures thereof. Suitable amines as cross-linking agents include aliphatic and cycloaliphatic primary and secondary diamines and polyamines. Representative examples of such amines include 1,2-diaminoethane, diethylenetriamine, triethylenetetramine, bis-(3-aminopropyl)-amine, bis-(2-methylaminoethyl)methylamine, 1,4-diaminocyclohexane, 3-amino-1-methylaminopropane, N-methyl-bis-(3-aminopropyl)amine, 1,4-diamino-n-butane, 1,6-diamino-n-hexane, polyethylenimine, guanidine carbonate and the like and mixtures thereof. Suitable alcohols as cross-linking agents include primary or secondary aliphatic dialcohols or polyalcohols. Representative examples of such alcohols include ethanediol, 1,2-propanediol, 1,3-propanediol, 1,4-butanediol, 1,5-pentanediol, 1,6-hexanediol, glycerol, diethylene glycol, poly(vinyl alcohol), and the like and mixtures thereof. Also useful as cross-linking agents include aliphatic aminoalcohols such as, for example, triethanolamine.","If desired, a catalyst to harden the polymer precursor when exposed to moisture during rupture of the metallic microcapsule may be encapsulated in the microcapsule. The catalyst may be, for example, a Grubbs catalyst, a radical initiator, or a combination thereof.","The polymeric microcapsules (primary shells) will typically have an average diameter of about 1 to about 100 \u03bcm. In one embodiment, the shells of the polymeric microcapsules can have an average thickness of about 0.5 to about 10 \u03bcm. The microcapsules can be of any shape, e.g., spherical, circular and the like. However, other shapes, such as filaments, may be used also, with a concomitant loss of efficiency. In one embodiment, the polymeric microcapsule is rod shaped and will have an average diameter of about 1 to about 100 \u03bcm, and a macroscopic length greater than about 1 mm.","A metallic shell is then formed over the microcapsule to provide a metallic shell enclosing a volume containing the polymeric microcapsule. The metallic shell is formed by electroplating a layer of metal on the microcapsule. The layer of metal can be plated onto the microcapsule by electroless plating. In general, electroless plating is carried out until a thickness of about 0.5 to about 10 \u03bcm of the metallic shell is achieved. The metal can be any metal capable of providing galvanic protection to a metal substrate such as steel. Representative examples of such metals include aluminum, nickel, cadmium, zinc and mixtures thereof. In one embodiment, the metal is a mixture of zinc and nickel. The composition is chosen so that the nickel\/zinc alloy acts as an anode with respect to steel.","The metallic microcapsules can have an overall average diameter of from about 1 to about 120 \u03bcm. In one embodiment, the metallic microcapsules can have an overall average diameter of from about 25 to about 50 \u03bcm. As discussed above, the microcapsules can be of any shape, e.g., spherical, circular, rod shaped and the like. However, other shapes, such as filaments, may be used also, with a concomitant loss of efficiency.","The foregoing metallic microcapsules are added to one or more film forming binders to form a liquid self-healing coating composition. The term \u201cfilm forming binder\u201d means a nonencapsulated constituent of the liquid self-healing coating composition which holds other parts of the composition in a continuous layer after application to a selected surface of a substrate. The film-forming binders may be liquid or solid, depending on the particular application. The one or more film-forming binders may comprise a protective coating that would serve the purpose of protecting a substrate but not have the self-healing properties of the coating of the present invention. This non-self healing protective coating composition may be one of a number of commercially available products such as, for example, primer paints, topcoat paints, \u201cone coat\u201d or \u201cself-priming\u201d paints, varnishes, lacquers, polyurethane finishes, shellacs, waxes, polishes, \u201cone step\u201d finishing preparations for wood, metal, or synthetic materials, and the like and combinations thereof. Suitable paint primers include polyurethanes, oil-based enamels, enamel undercoater, latex acrylics, acrylic formulations, epoxy formulations and the like. Suitable topcoat and self-priming paints include polyurethanes, oil-based enamels, enamels, latex acrylics, acrylic formulations, epoxy formulations and the like.","If desired, the self-healing coating composition can contain various additives known in the art. Representative examples of such additives include corrosion inhibitors, flow enhancing agents, and the like and mixtures thereof.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","10","12","14","16","12","12","12","12"]},"The coating  is typically a paint or undercoating. The coating  is applied to the substrate  by conventional processes such as spraying or dipping. The coating  contains a sufficient quantity of the metallic microcapsules . Although a single coating is illustrated it will be understood that a multiple of coating  layers are contemplated.","In an embodiment, each of the metallic microcapsules  (as depicted in the exploded view of  in ) includes a metallic shell  and a polymeric microcapsule  within the metallic shell. The polymeric microcapsule  includes a polymeric shell (or wall ) and, within the polymeric shell, a polymeric precursor  and an optional water-immiscible composition. The metallic microcapsules  are manufactured to contain the polymeric precursor  in a fluid state. The metallic microcapsules  are retained in the coating  to form a matrix of hardened coating  and metallic microcapsules . If desired, a mix of different metallic microcapsules  can be incorporated into coating  such that a multiple of properties can be incorporated directly into the coating .","Referring to , article  is shown in a flexed condition. Continual flexing of the coating article  may cause the coating to crack and form fissures  which can extend to the substrate . These fissures  may also be caused in a more immediate fashion by direct contact with an object that causes a scratch or break in the coating . Typically such a crack exposes the substrate  and leaves the substrate  unprotected against the environment and resulting corrosion.","According to the present invention, however, the cracking of the coating  also breaks open the metallic microcapsules  adjacent the fissure . The broken metallic microcapsules  release the polymeric precursor  contained therein. Because the metallic microcapsules  release the polymeric precursor  in the fluid state the polymeric precursor  flows into the fissure  and fills the exposed substrate . This provides a \u201cself-healing\u201d ability to the coating which protects the substrate  even after the coating  is damaged.","The present invention therefore provides a self-healing coating which may increase the anti-corrosion protection of a metal substrate while maintaining a relatively inexpensive coating application process commonly practiced in the art. The following examples are provided to enable one skilled in the art to practice the invention and are merely illustrative of the invention.

The end of the sample name \u201c\/Xhr\u201d refers to the length of the plating time. For example, Zn25\/3 hr means that a 25% zinc sample was plated for 3 hours. Finally, the word \u201cdry\u201d at the end of the sample name means that the microcapsules were completely solid polymer, with no liquid resin inside. The \u201cdry\u201d samples were all plated for 1 hour.","Unfortunately, batch-to-batch variation also precluded the ability to draw many firm conclusions from the water resistance data. A linear regression fit did show, however, that the corrosion protection was best for intermediate plating times and worst for intermediate scratch widths. The 0.003 in. and 0.125 in. scratches healed relatively well. Overall there was less corrosion in the self-healing coatings than in the chemical agent resistant coatings (CARC) that are typically used by the military. The concentration of Zn in the metal shell was not statistically correlated to the amount of rusting in this data.","It will be understood that various modifications may be made to the embodiments disclosed herein.
