Field of the Invention","This invention relates to vertical cavity surface emitting lasers. More specifically, it relates to bottom mirrors used in vertical cavity surface emitting lasers.","2. Discussion of the Related Art","Vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs) represent a relatively new class of semiconductor lasers. While there are many variations of VCSELs, one common characteristic is that they emit light perpendicular to a wafer's surface. Advantageously, VCSELs can be formed from a wide range of material systems to produce specific characteristics.","VCSELs include semiconductor active regions, which can be fabricated from a wide range of material systems, distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) mirrors, current confinement structures, substrates, and contacts. Because of their complicated structure, and because of their material requirements, VCSELs are usually grown using metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","12","14","16","12","18","16","20","18","22","20","24","22","24","9","8","26"]},"Still referring to , the lower spacer  and the top spacer  separate the lower mirror stack  from the top mirror stack  such that an optical cavity is formed. As the optical cavity is resonant at specific wavelengths, the mirror separation is controlled to resonant at a predetermined wavelength (or at a multiple thereof. At least part of the top mirror stack  includes an insulating region  that provides current confinement. The insulating region  is usually formed either by implanting protons into the top mirror stack  or by forming an oxide layer. In any event, the insulating region  defines a conductive annular central opening  that forms an electrically conductive path though the insulating region .","In operation, an external bias causes an electrical current  to flow from the p-type electrical contact  toward the n-type electrical contact . The insulating region  and the conductive central opening  confine the current  such that the current flows through the conductive central opening  and into the active region . Some of the electrons in the current  are converted into photons in the active region . Those photons bounce back and forth (resonate) between the lower mirror stack  and the top mirror stack . While the lower mirror stack  and the top mirror stack  are very good reflectors, some of the photons leak out as light  that travels along an optical path. Still referring to , the light  passes through the p-type conduction layer , through the p-type cap layer , through an aperture  in the p-type electrical contact , and out of the surface of the vertical cavity surface emitting laser .","It should be understood that  illustrates a typical VCSEL, and that numerous variations are possible. For example, the dopings can be changed (say, by providing a p-type substrate), different material systems can be used, operational details can be tuned for maximum performance, and additional structures, such as tunnel junctions, can be added. Furthermore, with long wavelengths it is often beneficial to insert a reversed biased n++\/p++ tunnel junction between the top spacer  and the active region , and to change the doping type of the top structures to n-type. This is because p-doped materials absorb more light than n-doped materials, and with longer wavelengths the optical gain become more critical. The tunnel junction converts electrons into holes, which are then injected into the active region.","While generally successful, VCSELs have problems. For example, a major problem in realizing commercial quality long wavelength VCSELs is the available mirror materials. Long wavelength VCSELs are often based on InP material systems. For proper lattice matching, an InP-based VCSEL usually uses InP\/InGaAsP or AlInAs\/AlInGaAs mirrors. However, because those materials have relatively low refractive index contrasts, 40-50 mirror pairs are typically needed to achieve the required high reflectivity. Growing that number of mirror pairs takes a long time, which increases the production costs.","Other mirror material systems have been tried. For example, \u201cMetamorphic DBR and tunnel-Junction Injection: A CW RT Monolithic Long-Wavelength VCSEL,\u201d IEEE Journal of Selected topics In Quantum Electronics, vol. 5, no. 3, May\/June 1999, describes an InP-InGaAsP DBR, a GaAlAsSb-AlAsSb DBR, and a GaAlInSb-AlAsSb DBR. Furthermore, that article describes using a reversed biased n++\/p++ tunnel junction for injecting current into the active layer. While such mirror material systems are advantageous, their lattice match, refractive index contrast, and thermal conductivity characteristics are not optimal. Additionally, GaAs\/Al(Ga) is still considered to form the best distributed Bragg reflector mirrors because of its high refractive index contrast, high thermal conductivity, and the feasibility of using oxidation to enable the formation of oxide insulating regions . Thus, new long wavelength VCSELS would be beneficial. Even more beneficial would be new bottom mirror systems for long wavelength VCSELS. Still more beneficial would be new bottom mirror systems that enable GaAs\/Al(Ga) top mirror systems.","Accordingly, the principles of the present invention are directed to new mirror systems for long wavelength VCSELS. Those principles specifically provide for new bottom DBR mirror material systems, and VCSELs that use such new DBR bottom mirror systems. Beneficially, the principles of the present invention provide for VCSELS that incorporate new bottom mirror systems and that use GaAs\/Al(Ga) top mirror DBRs.","A bottom mirror according to one aspect of the present invention provides for AlPSb\/GaPSb DBR mirrors on an InP substrate, beneficially n-doped. Then, an n-doped bottom InP spacer is grown on the AlPSb\/GaPSb DBR. Beneficially, an active region having a plurality of quantum wells is then grown on the n-doped InP spacer. Beneficially, a reversed biased tunnel junction is disposed over the active region. An n-doped top InP spacer is beneficially grown on the tunnel junction. Also beneficially, an n-doped GaAs\/Al(Ga)As top DBR is grown on the n-doped top InP spacer.","Preferably, the GaAs\/Al(Ga)As top DBR is grown by a multi-step process using MOCVD. First, the growth temperature is set to 400-450\u00b0 C. Then, a 20-40 nanometer thick low temperature GaAs layer is grown on the n-doped top InP spacer. After that, the temperature is increased to around 600\u00b0 C. A high temperature GaAs seed layer, about 100 nm thick, is then grown on the low temperature GaAs layer. Then an insulation layer comprised of SiOor SiNis formed on the GaAs seed layer. The insulation layer is patterned to form an opening. A high temperature GaAs layer is then grown on the GaAs seed layer, followed by a GaAs\/Al(Ga)As top DBR. The high temperature GaAs layer and the GaAs\/Al(Ga)As mirror are beneficially grown using lateral epitaxial overgrowth.","According to another aspect of the present invention, a bottom AlGaInAs\/AlInAs DBR is grown on an n-doped InP substrate. Then, an n-doped bottom InP spacer is grown on the grown on the AlGalnAs\/AlInAs DDR. Beneficially, an active region having a plurality of quantum wells is then grown on the n-doped InP spacer, followed by a reversed biased n\/p tunnel junction over the active region. An n-doped top InP spacer is beneficially grown on the tunnel junction. Also beneficially, an n-doped GaAs\/Al(Ga)As top DER is grown on the n-doped top InP spacer.","Preferably, the GaAs\/Al(Ga)As top DBR is grown by a multi-step process using MOCVD. First, the growth temperature is set to 400-450\u00b0 C. Then, a 20-40 nanometer thick low temperature GaAs layer is grown on the n-doped top InP spacer. After that, the temperature is increased to around 600\u00b0 C. A high temperature GaAs seed layer, about 100 nm thick, is then grown on the low temperature GaAs layer. Then, an insulation layer comprised of SiOor SiNis formed on the GaAs seed layer. That insulation layer is then patterned to form an opening. A high temperature GaAs layer is then grown on the GaAs seed layer. Then, a GaAs\/Al(Ga)As top DBR is grown on the high temperature GaAs layer. The GaAs layer and the GaAs\/Al(Ga)As mirror are beneficially grown using lateral epitaxial overgrowth.","Additional features and advantages of the invention will be set forth in the description that follows, and in part will be apparent from that description, or may be learned by practice of the invention.","The principles of the present invention are incorporated in a first embodiment VCSEL having a bottom AlPSb\/GaPSb DBR mirror grown on an InP substrate. An example of such a VCSEL is the VCSEL  illustrated in FIG. .","As shown in , the VCSEL  includes an n-doped InP substrate  having an n-type electrical contact (not shown for clarity). Over the InP substrate  is an n-doped lower mirror stack  (a DBR) comprised of a plurality of alternating layers of AlPSb\/GaPSb. Over the lower mirror stack  is an n-doped InP spacer . The lower mirror stack  is beneficially grown on the InP substrate using TMAl, TMSb, and PHin an MOCVD process. Then, the InP spacer  is grown, also using MOCVD. An active region  comprised of P-N junction structures and a large number of quantum wells is then formed over the InP spacer . The composition of the active region  is beneficially AlInGaAs or InGaAsP.","Over the active region  is a tunnel junction  comprised of a reverse biased n++\/p++ junction. Beneficially, the tunnel junction includes a p-layer comprised of MOCVD-grown GaAsSb. During MOVCD, TMGa (or TEGa), TMSb, and AsH(or TBAs) are beneficially used to produce the GaAsSblayer. Beneficially, that layer's solid composition is controlled by controlling the ratio of As to Sb. The MOCVD growth temperature is between 500\u00b0 C. and 650\u00b0 C. Doping is beneficially performed using CClor CBrsuch that the resulting p-doping is greater 1\u00d710cm. In practice, a p-doping greater than 5\u00d710cmis beneficial. It should be noted that the GaAsSblayer can have a doping as high as 1\u00d710cmwithout annealing. By setting x=0.5 a tunnel junction that is lattice matched to InP is produced (but GaAsSbhas a bandgap of 0.71 eV at 300K). An alternative is to set x=0.4, 0.3, or 0.23, which produce GaAsSblayers with bandgaps of 0.8 eV, 0.91 eV, or 1 eV, but which are not lattice matched to the InP active region . At x=0.3, or 0.23 the strains respectively become 1.4% or 1.95%, which, while not ideal, are much better than the 3.55% strain of AlAs on InP.","The tunnel junction  further includes an n-doped layer of InP, AlInAs, or of a lower bandgap material such as AlInGaAs or InGaAsP. The n-doped layer should also be heavily doped (greater than 5\u00d710cm) and very thin (less than about 10 nanometers). For good lattice matching, the VCSEL  uses an InP n-type layer in the tunnel junction .","Over the tunnel junction  is an n-type InP top spacer . Then, a top mirror structure (which includes another DBR) is disposed over the top spacer .","The top mirror structure is beneficially comprised of a low temperature grown GaAs buffer layer  over the top spacer , a high temperature GaAs buffer layer  (which acts as a seed layer) over the GaAs buffer layer , an insulating structure (beneficially comprised of SiO)  over most of the GaAs buffer layer , and a GaAs\/Al(Ga)As mirror stack  over the insulating structure . A shown, the insulating structure includes an opening , which enables current flow through the VCSEL .","The top mirror structure implements a device quality GaAs\/Al(Ga)As mirror stack  over the top spacer . In many applications, GaAs\/Al(Ga)As is considered the best material for Bragg mirrors because of its high refractive index contrast (GaAs:AlAs=3.377:2.893), high thermal conductivity (GaAs:AlAs=0.46:0.8), and its oxidation potential. However, GaAs\/Al(Ga)As is seriously lattice mismatched with InP. Thus, to produce a device-quality GaAs\/Al(Ga)As mirror stack, MOCVD is used in a two-step process to form intermediate GaAs buffer layers.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["126","124","126","126"]},"Referring now to , after the low temperature GaAs buffer layer  is formed, the temperature is increased to around 600\u00b0 C. Then, the high temperature GaAs buffer layer  is grown. The GaAs buffer layer  acts as a seed layer for subsequent growths.","Referring now to , after the GaAs buffer layer  is grown, a dielectric layer of SiO(alternatively of SiN) is deposited and patterned to form the insulating structure . To do so, the intermediate structure shown in  is removed from the MOCVD reactor vessel. Then, a dielectric layer of SiO(alternatively SiN) is deposited on the insulating structure . Then, the deposited dielectric layer is patterned to produce the insulating structure  having the opening . The insulating structure  provides a suitable surface for lateral epitaxial overgrowth. After the insulating structure  formed, the intermediate structure of  is inserted into the MOCVD reactor vessel. Referring once again to , the GaAs\/Al(Ga)As mirror stack  is then grown by MOCVD. That mirror stack is produced by lateral epitaxial overgrowth from the GaAs buffer layer  through the opening . The result is a high-quality mirror stack  having current confinement.","With the mirror stack  formed, an n-type conduction layer (similar to the p-type conduction layer  of FIG. ), an n-type GaAs cap layer (similar to the p-type GaAs cap layer  of FIG. ), and an n-type electrical contact (similar to the p-type electrical contact  of ) are produced.","An alternative embodiment VCSEL  that is in accord with the principles of the present invention is illustrated in FIG. . The VCSEL  includes an n-doped InP substrate  having an n-type electrical contact (which is not shown for clarity). Over the InP substrate  is n-doped lower mirror stack  (a DBR) comprised of a plurality of alternating layers of AlGaInAs and AlInAs. Over the lower mirror stack  is an InP spacer . The lower mirror stack  is beneficially grown on the InP substrate using TMAl, TMSb, and PHin an MOCVD process. Then, the InP spacer  is grown, also using MOCVD.","An active region  comprised of P-N junction structures and a large number of quantum wells are then formed over the InP spacer . The composition of the active region  is beneficially InP. Over the active region  is a tunnel junction  comprised of a reverse biased n++\/p++ junction. Beneficially, the tunnel junction  is as described above (and thus includes a MOCVD-grown GaAsSblayer).","Over the tunnel junction  is an n-type InP top spacer . Then, a top mirror structure (which includes another DBR) is disposed over the top spacer . The top mirror structure is beneficially comprised of a low temperature GaAs buffer layer  over the top spacer , a high temperature GaAs buffer layer  over the GaAs buffer layer , an insulating structure (beneficially comprised of SiO)  over most of the GaAs buffer layer , and a GaAs\/AI(Ga)As mirror stack  over the insulating structure . Beneficially, the top mirror structure is fabricated in the same manner as the top mirror structure of  (as discussed with regard to FIGS. -).","With the mirror stack  formed, an n-type conduction layer (similar to the p-type conduction layer  of FIG. ), an n-type GaAs cap layer (similar to the p-type GaAs cap layer  of FIG. ), and an n-type electrical contact (similar to the p-type electrical contact  of ) are produced.","The VCSELs  and  have significant advantages over prior art long wavelength InP VCSELs. First, the two-step MOCVD process enables a device quality GaAs\/Al(Ga)As top mirror to be used with an InP active region  and an InP top spacer . Another advantage is that the tunnel junction  enables n-doped top layers to be used, which reduces optical absorption (which can be critically important in long wavelength VCSELs). Yet another advantage is the avoidance of InP\/InGaAsP mirror stacks, which requires a large numbers of mirror pairs. Consequently, a reduction in mirror growth times and costs is possible. Furthermore, the mirrors stacks used in the VCSEL  and in the VCSEL  enable improved thermal performance. Still another advantage is the ease of forming current confinement in the top mirror structure, and the use of lateral epitaxial overgrowth to produce the top mirror. The overall result is VCSELs having improved performance, increased reliability, faster fabrication, and reduced cost.","It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variation can be made in the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention.
