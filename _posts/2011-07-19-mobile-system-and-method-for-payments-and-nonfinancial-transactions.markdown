{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","TECHNICAL FIELD","DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART","BRIEF SUMMARY OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/399,793, filed on. Jul. 19, 2010 and to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/344,563, filed on Aug. 23, 2010, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.","The present invention relates generally to mobile systems and methods for payments and non-financial transactions.","An emerging technology in the industry of payment processing is mobile payments. Mobile payments addresses many needs including offering greater convenience to consumers through eliminating the use of plastic cards, stickers, or key tags that use magnetic-striped, radio frequency identification (RFID), barcodes, blue tooth, or chips to store and transmit payment account data to authorize and conduct payment transactions at point of sale terminals. Current mobile payment solutions might include the use of near-field communication (NFC), barcodes including two dimensional barcodes, Bluetooth, or significant software upgrades to the point of sale (POS) system. Each solution has significant unique setbacks for merchant and consumer adoption.","Conventional cards store payment account data on the card and payment terminal readers at point of sale in stores will read and capture the data required to submit and gain a transaction authorization and approval for the transaction from the card issuer. Since the invention of the magnetic striped cards and their readers, new inventions have been centered around improving the security and speed by which transactions occur, but most methods still employ using a physical or virtual card that is read by a point of sale terminal. Through a variety of means, the payment account data by which the consumer is going to make a payment to a merchant is captured by the merchant payment terminal, via magnetic-stripe, RFID, Bluetooth, barcodes or chips and submitted for authorization and approval. The industry method of capturing card payment data has created the necessity for merchants to have payment terminal readers that are able to read the cards being used to make payments at their stores.","Virtual mobile or web enabled software applications are now in use which display an electronic barcode on the mobile phone screen. This requires the card data encoded in the barcode to be read by barcode readers at the POS to initiate the transaction. RFID or NFC technology transmits the payment card data to merchant payment terminals equipped to receive the radio signal. The cards or stickers that utilize this NFC solution must be swiped by the NFC enabled payment terminal reader in order to capture the payment card data and thus initiate the transaction. This NFC technology has also been used in phones to transmit the card data. The payment card data may be stored on the phone in a software application or it may be accessed via a mobile or web accessed software application that supplies the card data from an electronic wallet. With the prescribed NFC tag stored on the phone through a software application method a payment card or sticker equipped with NFC is not required to be present to capture the payment card data and to initiate the transaction as the NFC technology is embedded into the mobile phone itself. This NFC technology embedded into mobile phones or devices still requires a payment terminal capable of reading the payment card data transmitted via the NFC technology. In the United States, this technology is as of yet mainstream and intermediate solutions have also been developed that plug NFC technology into a port on the mobile phone.","Security remains a significant concern for most, if not all mobile solutions, as they send the consumer card data at point of sale to the merchant. This opens the transmission of the card data to hack attempts as was observed when the Hannaford Brothers regional grocery company announced a data breach on Mar. 17, 2008. In the Hannaford Brothers case, when the consumer swiped their magnetic payment card at a POS terminal, the track data from the customer card (the PAN and possibly the expiration date and PIN with PIN related transactions) was transmitted from the POS terminal to the store server and then from the store server out to the bank responsible for authorizing the transaction. The criminals were able to steal this data while it was moving through this authorization process (in-transit) by inserting a malware program onto the store server. It was estimated over 4.2 million credit and debit card numbers were compromised through every one of the chain's 300 grocery stores.","The Hannaford Brothers case was cause for even greater concern as the data theft was occurring despite the fact that Hannaford Brothers had a security firm to monitor its network security and their stores used a modern POS system that should have been secure (in fact, Hannaford Brothers had been featured in a 2005 Computerworld article as an example of a retailer aggressively updating and modernizing their POS system (Hoffman, 2005)). An NFC solution could increase risk as the ability to intercept in-transit data is greatly increased when the medium of exchange is no longer limited to a magnetic card swipe and instead broadened by the use of radio technology. The inventors of this patent application have observed that by eliminating the transmission of the sensitive financial card data at the point of sale, security measures are able to be greatly increased in protecting the financial transaction and account information exchanged during the transaction process whereby the financial account data is only exchanged between trusted financial institutions and not the merchant or POS system.","A recent alternative payment solution developed by Mocapay, Inc. offers a mobile payment solution whereas consumers pre-authorize payment to a store from a virtual electronic gift card. While yet to be seen in the form of a product, Mocapay discloses in US Patent Publication No. 2009\/0063312 A1 an ability to use a credit card transaction; however the processing and interaction with the merchant's point of sale remains the same. The consumer utilizes a mobile application to pre-approve a transaction at a specific merchant. After the user submits their approval, the software issues an authorization code. This code is displayed numerically or in the form a barcode on their phone. When the user is at checkout they tell the merchant or cashier they will be paying using Mocapay. The consumer then shows the merchant the approval code to be entered into the point of sale payment terminal to complete the transaction or they may scan the barcode to complete the transaction. Either method requires that the merchant's point of sale payment terminal or software system be changed or reprogrammed to be able to enter in and accept the authorization code generated and provided to the consumer's mobile device upon displaying it to the merchant.","Other methods of conducting payment or loyalty transactions require a physical chip or card or virtual card displayed in the form of a barcode to capture the payment card data at point of sale from which the funds will be drawn upon.","In view of the above-identified drawbacks, there exists a need for an alternative mobile commerce system and method. Embodiments of the present invention provide systems and methods for mobile commerce, communication, and transaction processing to real-world POS, web, E-commerce, virtual terminal, mobile PDA, mobile phone, or other computer based transactions involving either financial and\/or non-financial transactions (such as loyalty based transactions) as a mobile payment system. Some embodiments of the invention provide a more readily available product for market adoption through a highly secure, non-card data transmitting POS process. Such a product provides a relatively low cost solution to implement at the merchant, and is a scalable product for ease of distribution to address both consumer and merchant adoption needs.","One embodiment of the invention is directed toward using a mobile phone or mobile device via a consumer mobile software application of the mobile payment system (hereinafter referred to as the consumer mobile application or CMA) in lieu of a consumer card (e.g., a physical card, virtual card, or chips) to conduct payment transactions in the real or virtual world of commerce. One implementation is related to making payments to real-world stores by having only the mobile phone or mobile device on behalf of the consumer to conduct transactions and requiring no card or exchange of card account information.","The transaction route may be initiated as any conventional payment transaction to gain authorization for the transaction from the card issuer. In cases where an authorization request is made to an issuer to gain an additional authorization from the mobile payment service provider for a merchant initiated mobile payment transaction, the transaction is rerouted to obtain additional authorization prior to issuing a standard authorization request to the issuer (such as account status and fund verification).","The various embodiments of the invention can include pre-set and designated cards (hereinafter referred to as mobile payment cards) used for the express purpose of requiring the prescribed additional authorization. Such cards may be any type of payment card such as a credit, debit, gift, alternative payment, or loyalty card. This additional method of authorization allows consumers to directly authorize a payment transaction via their mobile device using proprietary software such as the CMA. These pre-set or designated mobile payment cards, with a pre-designated card range, are used to initiate mobile payment transactions and may be initially programmed for use only at merchant locations where the cards are permitted for use. However, these mobile payment cards are read and routed by POS terminals or systems as would be any type of payment card. Again, these cards may comprise credit cards, debit cards, pin-debit cards, gift cards, or alternative form of payment, and therefore may be open or closed-loop. Therefore, they may comprise cards using a payment network such as MasterCard, Visa, Discover, American Express, STAR Network (or any other pin-debit card) or any host-to-host or proprietary non-financial, gift or private payment or communication network of any type used to conduct payment or loyalty transactions, not excluding mobile carrier network communication channels.","These specific use and merchant restricted access mobile payment cards are used to initiate a mobile payment transaction. As described above, the pre-set or pre-designated card number is in one illustrative embodiment read by a POS payment terminal or system and an authorization request is forwarded to a processor in a conventional manner or method. Upon reaching the processor, the issuer Identification Number (TIN) or Bank Identification Number (BIN) is read to route to the payment network (Visa\/MasterCard\/Discover\/American Express\u2014open loop) or a proprietary (closed-loop) gift card network.","In embodiments using an open-loop IIN or BIN (together herein referenced as IIN) as assigned by a payment network, the IIN is forwarded to the payment network as per current industry standard routing methods. Thereafter, the payment network routes the authorization to a backend switch where the transaction is then forwarded to the mobile payment service provider (mimicking an issuer's card management system) through a conventional or proprietary message format that is used to route to card management systems. Most processor systems are set up to accommodate specific routing for third parties that have a specified IIN. As such, when the processor reads a closed-loop IIN, the transaction may be rerouted to the mobile payment service provider through a conventional or proprietary message format that is used to route to card management systems. The additional authorization is routed to the mobile payment service provider's TAS (transaction authorization system) to match the merchant's authorization request with the consumer's transaction approval for the request.","Upon the merchant request matching the consumer approval of the transaction, the transaction is routed from the TAS to a mobile electronic wallet containing the payment account information as previously selected by the consumer from which to make the mobile or web enabled payment. From here the transaction is routed to gain a conventional authorization from the card issuer of the payment method of choice as selected by the consumer from a mobile electronic wallet (herein referenced as e-wallet). Upon approval from the card issuer, the transaction authorization approval is sent back to the TAS from the payment gateway partner that stores the e-wallet. At this point, the authorization data is sent back to the phone and originating POS system or terminal in the required format of the phone or system, thereby completing the transaction.","One illustrative embodiment of this invention from the consumer's perspective allows mobile payment system users to utilize the CMA on their mobile web enabled phone or device by: (i) opening the CMA, (ii) entering their user PIN, (iii) selecting the specific merchant listed in the CMA, (iv) selecting a method of payment available to the user (e.g., credit, debit, gift or alternative payment form), (v) entering the TID (terminal identifier) of the merchant, (vi) selecting the \u201cPay Now\u201d button, and (vii) announcing the merchant to process the mobile payment transaction. This announcement can be non-verbal by simply displaying the \u201cShow Phone to Cashier\u201d screen to the trained merchant. Regarding the step of selecting the specific merchant listed in the CMA, GPS geo-location services may be employed to identify the phone's or device's physical location and match that against the merchant's store front in the CMA so that a listing of merchants displays the merchant's store on top of the list. In some embodiments, a search function is available for the user by merchant's store name or ID should the mobile device's GPS service be absent or disabled by the user. Groups can be utilized during the search process for the merchants having multiple locations or for displaying merchants associated with a specific group such as a store mall, plaza, or special interest.","Another illustrative embodiment of this invention from the consumer's perspective allows for pre-authorization transactions such as those found in full service restaurants, hotels, and car rental agencies. Such a method may comprise the user: (i) opening the CMA, (ii) entering their user PIN, (iii) selecting the specific merchant listed in the CMA (such as through prescribed GPS or search functions of the CMA), (iv) selecting a method of payment available to the user (e.g., credit, debit, gift or alternative payment form), (v) entering the virtual table, ticket, invoice, or order number assigned by the merchant POS, (vi) selecting the \u201cPay Now\u201d button, and (vii) announcing the merchant to process the mobile payment system transaction. The announcement can be non-verbal by simply displaying the \u201cShow Phone to Cashier\u201d screen or in lieu of showing the phone screen to cashier. The mobile phone user may be instructed to place a mobile payment instruction\/marketing card [paper or plastic] into the end of the bill fold in place of where the credit card is normally placed. This embodiment therefore does not require a pay-at-table device to conduct a mobile transaction as might be required by NFC type solutions. As used herein, a merchant POS system may comprises a POS system used for electronic commerce or a conventional POS system located in a real world store.","Another illustrative embodiment includes the TID (terminal identifier) as a number posted in the form of either an adhesive sticker adhered to the merchant's terminal or location nearby that the consumer either scans as a barcode version or enters in a numeric value representing the TID. The barcode version of the TID can be a standard or 2D barcode such as a QR (Quick Response) code that is scanned by the consumer's mobile device through the use of a camera on the mobile device. Another illustrative embodiment allows the TID to be represented by the use of a two-factor authentication token device (such as might be supplied by RSA, the security division of EMC), whereby a code is generated according to an algorithm set by the device and displayed by the merchant at the POS to allow the consumer to enter in the code into the CSA.","Another illustrative embodiment of this invention from the merchant's perspective allows the merchant to use a merchant mobile payment card with a magnetic stripe or NFC equipped card to initiate the mobile payment system transaction. This solution allows the merchant to participate in mobile transactions without POS interface hardware upgrades (such as NFC and Bluetooth), use of barcodes, SMS text messaging, or software (such as Mocapay's authorization code software), and still affords the consumer the convenience of paying by phone and not sharing their financial data with the merchant or storing it on the phone. The merchants also gain by not obtaining the consumer's sensitive financial data that becomes a responsibility and liability of the merchant. The mobile payment system transaction is initiated by swiping the merchant's mobile payment card through the merchant's existing payment terminal or POS when prompted by the consumer's announcement to conduct a mobile payment system transaction. The merchant receives a standard confirmation of successful payment or error code at their existing POS as is already programmed to handle. This process is accomplished by utilizing an IIN to route transactions through the merchant POS, middleware software provider, frontend switch, gateway, processor, payment network, or backend switch.","In one example, the mobile payment service provider may enter into an agreement with one of the payment networks (such as Discover, Visa, MasterCard, American Express, or JCB). Upon receiving the card number during the normal transaction authorization process used for financial and non-financial payments and identifying the unique IIN assigned to the mobile payment service provider (such as in accordance with ISO\/IEC 7812), the payment network routes the transaction to TAS (Transaction Authorization System) for transaction authentication prior to routing for payment authorization. At the TAS, the transaction is used to link the process with the consumer's device, authenticate the transaction, seek payment authorization through the TPPN (third party payment network or gateway provider for mobile payment system services) and send a response (approval or related error code such as non-sufficient funds\u2014NSF) to the merchant's existing POS terminal. Such an agreement with a payment network or other entity requires the company to integrate with the mobile payment service provider's TAS system for transaction rerouting. As such, the TAS system has an API (application programming interface) model that is compliant with the payment network or other party using the standard adopted by such entity. One example of a standard that might be used is International Organization for Standardization or ISO 8583 on Financial transaction card originated messages.","Another illustrative embodiment may utilize an identification card number with the mobile payment service provider's IIN. IIN and BIN are terms used interchangeably herein and represent the number (commonly the first 6 digits) used for determining the transaction routing destination. The merchant simply enters the mobile payment card number utilizing the mobile payment service provider's IIN into their POS system in lieu of swiping a mobile payment card through the payment terminal or POS.","Another illustrative embodiment may utilize a software button programmed in the POS system in lieu of a merchant mobile payment card. In this embodiment, the software button redirects the merchant's transaction to the mobile payment service provider's TAS solution through the use of the mobile payment system's API. No authorization code is required for the merchant to input on their POS system and the merchant may only be required to initiate the mobile payment system's transaction process by pushing or selecting the software button.","Another illustrative embodiment may utilize a virtual terminal in lieu of a merchant mobile payment card. Such a virtual terminal solution functions similar to the software button option for the POS. However this solution comprises a standalone software or hardware device such as a mobile personal digital assistant, mobile phone, other mobile device, or computer based system or device or software application installed alongside the POS software and residing on the same platform and hardware of the merchant POS.","Another illustrative embodiment involves a system d method that records payment transaction data, such as merchant ID, terminal ID, payment amount, transaction ID, time and date of the transaction, and user ID. Accordingly, the system possesses sufficient information for running a variety of loyalty programs and offerings for the merchant. This embodiment allows users to conduct loyalty only transactions using the mobile phone as well. In some cases, the user may tell the store clerk that she will be using her mobile rewards card, and then she will pay with cash or card as usual.","Another illustrative embodiment may be used to pay mobile, web or Internet merchants from the CMA. As for a web or Internet related transaction enabled via the merchant's website, the merchant only needs to add a button programmed in conjunction with the mobile payment service provider's API to enable the transaction to begin. Upon the consumer clicking on the button via the merchant's web or Internet site or link to begin the mobile payment system transaction, the transaction may be routed according to several methods. A first method entails a conventional payment transaction using the same method as a mobile payment card solution as described above. A second method involves routing the transaction directly to the mobile payment service provider's TAS (Transaction Authorization System) that matches the merchant request with the consumer authorization and approval of a transaction. The transaction proceeds normally from this point. A third method involves clicking on a button such that the authorization is sent first through the online or e-commerce merchant gateway, and is then routed directly or through a processor or payment network to gain consumer authorization. Each of these methods utilizes the method of matching merchant authorization request with consumer authorization approval via the CMA, as described.","In each of the three routing methods, the actual card number is not provided to the e-commerce merchant. Instead, an authorization system first authorizes and authenticates each transaction and then accesses the e-wallet software to gain the payment card data to run a secondary, but conventional payment authorization. The e-wallet is consumer centric because it enables consumers to upload all types of card accounts to the e-wallet. The e-wallet is a service provided by the TPPN (third Party payment network or gateway provider for mobile payment services) and may be a customized e-wallet solution for the mobile payment system. The CMA has ability to select the tokenized payment method data used by the TAS for calling the TPPN's e-wallet according to the corresponding token and card account of the user. This enables the user to select a method of payment available to the user and in accordance with the card information the user has uploaded to the mobile payment system directly or via the TPPN's web portal. As for a mobile merchant related transaction, any person can act as a merchant and accept mobile payments by downloading and installing the software related to their mobile device such as through the use of the virtual terminal software provided by the mobile payment service provider. In some cases, the virtual terminal software may be unique from the CMA and exist as a separate mobile software application for merchant related transactions. Additionally, the CMA of the mobile payment system could enable a function to allow a consumer to send a payment to any other mobile payment service provider's users or consumers, thus creating a consumer-to-consumer transaction relationship.","Another illustrative embodiment involves adding a peripheral that connects to a merchant POS system or payment terminal via a communication wire or cable or via any type of wireless data connection. This peripheral could simply be a \u201cButton\u201d to push and could be a plastic, metal or glass button. The button can serve to initiate a mobile payment system transaction solution. In some cases, the button may also be part of a separate device, such as a mobile phone, pager or a keychain to be used by the cashier to initiate payments for the invention's mobile payment solution. This embodiment can be enabled via a hardware and software solution on the independent device. The button could also be displayed virtually on a touch screen enabled monitor and pressed by the cashier or the consumer to initiate a payment transaction for the solution. In one implementation, the button requires a minimal amount of coding to enable the button such that it processes the transaction with the mobile payment service provider's IIN (in place of card swipe that transmits card data) and forwards it to TAS (directly from POS or indirectly such as through middleware, frontend switch, gateway, processor, payment networks, or a backend switch). In such embodiments, the button may be pressed to begin the transaction by either the consumer or the merchant cashier to initiate a mobile payment system transaction for the invention's solution. When the button is pushed it replicates the swiping of a card or having to manually enter a card number to initiate a mobile payment transaction to the mobile payment service provider's system.","Another illustrative embodiment entails allowing a consumer to utilize the CMA to access an ATM (Automated Teller Machine, Cash Point, or Cash Machine) used for consumer financial transactions including obtaining cash withdrawals or making cash deposits. The CMA obviates the need and use of an issuer's magnetic card for account access and authorization as the necessary card account information is stored in the e-wallet of the mobile payment system. The ATM only requires a button added prior to conducting any transaction for mobile ATM transactions. The button replaces the card swipe fun on and otherwise allows the ATM to behave in a similar fashion as it is customarily used.","Other features and aspects of the invention will become apparent from the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, which illustrate, by way of example, the features in accordance with embodiments of the invention. The summary is not intended to limit the scope of the invention, which is defined solely by the claims attached hereto.","The figures are not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed. It should be understood that the invention can be practiced with modification and alteration, and that the invention be limited only by the claims and the equivalents thereof.","Various illustrative embodiments of the invention address the problem of establishing merchant services (i.e., processing electronic payments) in a mobile environment, while increasing financial and personal identity data security and minimizing equipment and merchant adoption costs. Such embodiments may be accomplished through the use of additional authentication in place of financial account exchange between merchants and consumers. This is enabled by multiple optional paths for additional authentication including IIN transaction rerouting, direct communication with POS software, or a virtual terminal solution utilizing similar transaction rerouting processes.","Referring now to , one embodiment of a mobile payment system is depicted. In particular, a TPPN  may comprise any processing platform, card association, or other processing host that is responsible for the formal authorization and settlement of the consumer and merchant payment information (See ). The TPPN  should be an entity that is compliant and certified according to the industry rules, regulations, and best practices. In addition to authorization and settlement processing, the TPPN  may provide additional features and functionalities including transaction reporting, cardholder data storage, fraud screening and protection, and related processing offerings.","Still referring to , a TAS  coordinates the activities among a customer device  that hosts the CMA (consumer mobile software application), a POS system , and the TPPN , in order to authorize and void transactions. The TAS  may also store and retrieve loyalty information from a loyalty data store  that may be used by merchant  to offer discounts and additional services to the customer  through the device . The TAS  may also be used by the customer  to store payment method data at the TPPN . In order to protect the customer's data, TAS  only stores tokenized versions of the payment methods in a tokenized payment method data store . The tokenized versions reference the actual payment methods stored at the TPPN . A tender type button serves to initiate the transaction by the merchant. In some embodiments, the tender type button may be replaced with a merchant mobile payment card having a magnetic swipe or a card number that can be keyed into the POS system . In some cases, a virtual terminal solution or device can be employed that acts in much the same manner as the tender type button ","With further reference to , a terminal ID  serves to link the customer  and merchant  upon the transaction reaching the TAS . One method of this communication can be by the merchant posting a sticker, label, or other display of the terminal ID  on or near the POS  in order for the customer  to read and enter the terminal ID  into the CMA. The terminal ID  can exist as a numeric value, a barcode, or other representation including technology opportunities such as Bluetooth, RFID, NFC, QR codes, Two Factor Authentication, etc., that can be shared with the CMA. The CMA on the device submits a transaction to the TAS  for a purchase at a merchant POS and the transaction is stored by the TAS  as a pending transaction . The POS  then submits a transaction to the TAS  and the next available pending transaction with the same terminal ID  for that merchant  completes the additional authentication step required by the mobile payment system prior to submitting the transaction to the TPPN  for account authorization. In some embodiments, historical transactions  are available for review by the customer and merchants as facilitated by the TAS . The merchant marketing plan  (described below with respect to ) relates to the plan used for action upon loyalty data accumulated through transactions.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["10","7","13","4","1","4","1","2","2","1","4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["10","7","11","3","14","10","4","4","10","7","11","11","14","10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["14","11","13","14","11","11","11","14","4","14"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["8","10","11","4","7","4","4","6","4","6","8","11","1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["4","7","4","10","11","9","6","4","9","8","1","10","2","4","1","4","10","1","4","4","3","5","7"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 9"],"b":["15","16","21","16","19","16","17","18","17","18","19","19","19","20","21"]},"One embodiment of such an enhancement involves a transaction process beginning at the merchant , whereby a consumer makes a card transaction purchase at the POS  via a mobile device and without exchanging card account data.
