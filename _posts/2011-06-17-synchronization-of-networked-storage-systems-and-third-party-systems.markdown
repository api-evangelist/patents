{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["A file system is a method of storing and organizing computer files and their data. Traditionally, file systems have been tied to physical devices. For example, each floppy disk, optical disk, hard drive, flash drive, etc. may have a file system. In addition, file servers may map a file system across multiple drives using technologies such as redundant arrays of inexpensive disks (RAID), network file systems, and\/or other technologies.","The present disclosure relates to providing a networked storage system. With the ubiquitous availability of network connectivity for computing devices, users are increasingly seeking ubiquitous availability for their data files. For example, users may want to listen to an audio file from their smartphone, from their office workstation, from their laptop at home, and\/or from other computing devices. Additionally, users may seek to upload or backup files within a remote or networked storage system that provides data redundancy, improved data accessibility, and other benefits. Various embodiments of the present disclosure relate to remote storage of data files and subsequent uploading of certain of these data files to third party systems. In the context of this disclosure, a third party system can include another networked storage system, media storage system, social networking system, publishing system (e.g., blogging network, microblogging network, etc.), or any other third party system in which data files can be published and\/or stored.","A networked storage system may be employed to provide access to files stored in a cloud computing resource comprising a networked plurality of computing devices. In some embodiments, the networked storage system may correspond to a virtual file system where the actual data objects of the files are stored in a separate data storage system. A metadata service may be used to associate metadata with the files, thereby facilitating searches of the files using the metadata. By storing files in such a networked storage system, users may access the files from any computing device that has network connectivity.","In one embodiment, a user can access a user interface provided by or in connection with a networked storage system to upload data files for storage in the networked storage system. In other embodiments, a communications medium such as electronic mail (email) is employed to inject files into the networked storage system. Specifically, users who are associated with networked storage accounts in the networked storage system generate emails that are sent to an email destination defined by a destination address. Upon receiving a file destined for storage in the networked storage system, embodiments of the disclosure can also upload certain data files to a third party system as described herein. In the following discussion, a general description of the system and its components is provided, followed by a discussion of the operation of the same.","With reference to , shown is a networked environment  according to various embodiments. The networked environment  includes one or more computing devices  in data communication with at least one third party system  as well as one or more clients  by way of a network . The network  includes, for example, the Internet, intranets, extranets, wide area networks (WANs), local area networks (LANs), wired networks, wireless networks, or other suitable networks, etc., or any combination of two or more such networks.","The computing device  may comprise, for example, a server computer or any other system providing computing capability. Alternatively, a plurality of computing devices  may be employed that are arranged, for example, in one or more server banks or computer banks or other arrangements. For example, a plurality of computing devices  together may comprise a cloud computing resource, a grid computing resource, and\/or any other distributed computing arrangement. Such computing devices  may be located in a single installation or may be distributed among many different geographical locations. For purposes of convenience, the computing device  is referred to herein in the singular. Even though the computing device  is referred to in the singular, it is understood that a plurality of computing devices  may be employed in the various arrangements as described above.","Various applications and\/or other functionality may be executed in the computing device  according to various embodiments. Also, various data is stored in a data store  that is accessible to the computing device . The data store  may be representative of a plurality of data stores  as can be appreciated. The data stored in the data store , for example, is associated with the operation of the various applications and\/or functional entities described below.","The components executed on the computing device , for example, include a networked storage system  that includes an email injection application , a file storage application , a third party system uploader , and other applications, services, processes, systems, engines, or functionality not discussed in detail herein. The networked storage system  is executed to maintain a file hierarchy of files and folders in networked or metadata-based file systems for users. To this end, the networked storage system  may support various file-related operations such as, for example, creating files, deleting files, modifying files, moving files, copying files, setting permissions for files, downloading files, modifying file attributes or meta data, and\/or other operations.","The email injection application  is executed to provide for the receipt of files to be stored by the networked storage system  using email as a communication mechanism. The email injection application  receives files as attachments to emails sent to an email destination set forth by the email injection application  itself. Such file attachments are removed by the email injection application  to be stored by the networked storage system  as will be described.","The file storage application  is executed to provide for the receipt of files to be stored by the networked storage system  using other mechanisms with which a file can be received. In one embodiment, a user can upload a file to the file storage application  via a browser interface. Users may also upload files to the file storage application  via a special purpose application executed on a client  (e.g., a mobile device, desktop computer, etc.) that is configured to interact with the file storage application  according to a specified protocol. The file storage application  can also allow a user to modify, copy, move, delete or perform other operations to files, folders, or other storage locations associated with an account of the user.","A metadata service may be executed in association with or as part of the networked storage system  to maintain metadata items in association with files. To this end, such a metadata service may support various operations such as, for example, creating metadata items, deleting metadata items, retrieving metadata items, searching on metadata items, and\/or other operations. The metadata service may also implement one or more searchable indices of the metadata items. Additionally, the networked storage system  can also provide a tagging service the allows users to tag certain files, folders, or other constructs that are provided with which to categorize files with meta data. In one embodiment, this meta data can include one or more tags that identify a third party system with which a file, folder, or storage location should be uploaded upon storage of the file in the networked storage system . This meta data can also include information regarding authentication credentials for a third party system, a storage or publishing location within a third party system where files should be uploaded or published, and other attributes as will be described herein.","Various applications may be provided that correspond to hosted applications that may access the data stored in the networked storage system. Such applications may, for example, have a web-based interface and may serve up network pages, such as web pages or other forms of network content, to facilitate user interaction. Other applications may be internal applications and may not have a web-based interface. Non-limiting examples of such applications may include a mobile uploader application allowing a user to upload files from a mobile device to the networked storage system , a desktop uploader allowing a user to upload and\/or sync files with the networked storage system , photo organizing tool, a music file organizer and playback tool, a word processor, a spreadsheet, an email application, and so on.","The third party system uploader  is executed to upload files stored in a networked storage system to a third party system . The third party system uploader  can identify files associated with a storage account to upload to a third party system . The third party system uploader  can also initiate upload of a file to the third party system  when a file is tagged as associated with a third party system  by the user, when the file is stored in a folder, tag, label and\/or directory that is also associated with a third party system  as will be described in more detail herein.","The data stored in the data store  includes, for example, storage accounts . Associated with each storage account  are account settings  and one or more third party system identifiers . The third party system identifiers  can include, for example, information about third party systems  with which a user wishes to associate his or her storage account . The storage account  may also include information about a user with which the storage account  is associated. Such information may comprise, for example, name, address, payment instruments, and other information. The account settings  may be employed to specify and track various settings and other functionality with respect to a given storage account  such as passwords, security credentials, file management permissions, storage quotas and limitations, authorized access applications, billing information, and\/or other data.","The computing device  can maintain an upload queue  associated with the third party system uploader  in which one or more pending files  can be stored or referenced. The pending files  can be those which are identified by the third party system uploader  to be uploaded to a third party system . In one embodiment, the third party system uploader  can be configured with one or more connectors or modules that allow the third party system uploader  to communicate with and upload files from the upload queue  to a third party system . In this respect, the third party system uploader  can be configured with various third party system configurations that can describe authentication protocols, application programming interface (API) definitions, and upload workflows, and other information on which the third party system uploader  can rely to determine an upload protocol required to upload a file to a third party system.","Each storage bucket  provides for long term storage of files  for a given storage account . The files  can be arranged in a storage bucket  associated with a storage account  in a folder structure or any other structure by which files can be organized. In one embodiment, files  can be stored in a flat structure with tags assigned to the various files  by which they can be categorized by the user. Additionally, files  in a storage bucket can also include folders or directories, which can include other files and\/or subfolders. Accordingly, a user can tag certain files  as associated with a third party system . In this way, a user can designate files  and\/or folders that the user desires the third party system uploader  to upload to a third party system .","A third party system  can include one or more computing devices that facilitate a third party site and\/or service in which files stored by the user in the networked storage system  can also be stored and\/or published. In this regard, a third party system  can represent a social networking system, a media storage or backup system, another networked storage system or service, a publishing system, such as a blogging site or microblogging site, or other third party systems as can be appreciated. A third party system  can be accessible via the network  as well as via an application programming interface (API) that allows the third party system uploader  to upload files to a respective third party system .","The client  is representative of a plurality of client devices that may be coupled to the network . The client  may comprise, for example, a processor-based system such as a computer system. Such a computer system may be embodied in the form of a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a personal digital assistant, a cellular telephone, set-top box, music players, web pads, tablet computer systems, game consoles, or other devices with like capability.","The client  may be configured to execute various applications such as an email application , a browser , and\/or other applications. The email application  is executed in the client  to facilitate communication with others via email. The browser  may be executed in a client , for example, to access and render network pages, such as web pages, or other network content served up by the computing device  and\/or other servers. The client  may be configured to execute applications beyond the email application  or the browser  such as, for example, instant message applications, word processing applications, spreadsheet application, drawing applications, and\/or other applications. In addition, various files  may be stored in the client  and attached to emails. Specifically, according to one embodiment, a user may employ the email application  to generate an email and attach one of the files  to the email as an attached file and send the same to a destination address associated with the email injection application . Additionally, a user may access email sites via browser  that provide email functionality as well as the ability to generate an email with a file attachment.","Additionally, the user may interact with the file storage application  to upload, modify, copy, move, delete, or perform other file operations with regard to the networked storage system in a browser  user interface or via a special purpose application configured to interact with the file storage application . Additionally, the file storage application  can facilitate a user interface in which a user can create associations between files, folders or other storage constructs and a third party system .","Next, a general description of the operation of the various components of the networked environment  is provided. According to one embodiment, the networked storage system  is considered to be a storage cloud as can be appreciated. To begin, it is assumed that a user is associated with a storage account  in the networked storage system . Accordingly, users can add files  to the networked storage system  for storage in a respective storage bucket  in various ways as referenced above. A user can add files  to the networked storage system  by interacting with a user interface facilitated by the file storage application . The file storage application  can provide a browser interface in which a user can add files or perform other file operations. As also noted above, a user on a client  can employ a special purpose application configured to allow the user to perform various file operations on files in the networked storage system .","As noted above, a user can add files to the networked storage system  via email or other messaging. In some embodiments, the process of addition of a file via email can include user validation, security checks, and other processes not discussed in detail herein. Additional detail regarding injection of a file into the networked storage system  via email is disclosed in U.S. application Ser. No. 13\/047,247, filed Mar. 14, 2011 and entitled \u201cEmail Injection of Files into Networked Storage Systems,\u201d which is hereby incorporated herein in its entirety.","In one embodiment, the third party system uploader  can allow a user to designate one or more folders or directories as associated with a third party system . Therefore, the third party system uploader  can be configured to upload and\/or publish any files added by the user to the designated folder to the designated third party system . In one example, the user can designate a folder as associated with a social networking system. Accordingly, any files added to the folder and\/or a subfolder within the folder can be uploaded by the third party system uploader  to the social networking system. In this scenario, the user can also specify certain upload attributes or rules associated with the third party system . For example, the user can specify that all files in a particular folder in the networked storage system  be added to a particular photo album in a social networking system, media storage or backup system, etc. As another example, the user can specify that all files in a particular folder be added to a particular storage location in a third party system  and designated with particular privacy level or access rights in the third party system .","In another embodiment, a user can designate a file type specific association with a third party system  via the third party system uploader . For example, the third party system uploader  can allow the user to associate files of a specific type (e.g., images, audio, video, etc.) in a specific folder and\/or subfolder, with a third party system . In this example, the third party system uploader  can determine whether a file added to a particular folder is of the type specified by the user and initiate upload of the file to the third party system  if the file type meets the specified criteria.","Additionally, the user can specify a publishing rule associated with a third party system  and\/or a specific file or folder in the user's storage account , which can provide additional customization capability. In this example, the user can specify a rule that a public link to a file added to the networked storage system  be generated by the third party system uploader  and that the public link be published in a blogging site, social networking system, microblogging site, or any publishing system as can be appreciated.","The third party system uploader  can maintain a third party system data structure such as a map, lookup table, or other type of data structure that includes entries for the various folders and\/or files within the networked storage system  that are associated with a third party system  as designated by the various users of the system. In one embodiment, each file and\/or folder so designated by the various users of the system can be associated with a unique identifier that identifies the file or folder within the networked storage system . Each entry in such a data structure can also identify a third party system  with which the file and\/or folder is associated as well as authentication credentials that allow the third party system  to access an account in the third party system  that is designated by the user. In one embodiment, authentication credentials associated with a third party system  can include a username\/password pair, an authentication token, or other credential with which the third party system uploader  can access an account in a third party system  specified by the user.","Such a third party system data structure can be maintained in memory in some embodiments to facilitate performance considerations. In other embodiments, such a data structure can be stored in a disk and\/or data store. Each entry in the data structure can also be associated with one or more upload attributes in the third party system . An upload attribute can vary depending on the type of third party system  with which it is associated. Upload attributes can describe a storage location, folder name, album name, privacy level, account name, or any other meta data that can be associated with and supported by an upload to a third party system .","Therefore, in one embodiment, the third party system uploader  can be implemented as a listener process that receives messages from the email injection application  and\/or file storage application  regarding any files that are added and\/or modified in the networked storage system  on behalf of a user. Accordingly, the third party system uploader  can receive such a message and determine whether the file associated with the message is stored within a folder identified in the third party system data structure that is designated as associated with a third party system . If the third party system uploader  determines that such an association exists, it can then retrieve an entry from the data structure associated with file and\/or folder that identifies the third party system  as well as any potential authentication credentials or other upload attributes associated with the third party system .","The third party system uploader  can then generate an entry in the upload queue  that identifies the file  in the networked storage system as well as the third party system  to which the file  is to be uploaded. In this way, by decoupling the process of adding and\/or modifying a file in the networked storage system  from the process of uploading a file to a third party system  as facilitated by the email injection application  and\/or file storage application , the third party system uploader  can synchronize files added to certain folders in the networked storage system  without significantly impacting the performance of the process of modifying files in a user's storage bucket . In other words, a file can be stored in a storage bucket  associated with a user's storage account  and confirmation provided to the user that the storage was successful. Meanwhile, upload to a third party system associated with the storage location can be initiated asynchronously by the third party system uploader  in a process that is decoupled from the user's direct interactions with the networked storage system .","In some embodiments, a user, via a user interface provided by the networked storage system , may modify meta data associated with a file and\/or folder by designating a third party system , credentials associated with the third party system , upload attributes associated with the third party system , and other data that can be associated with a file and\/or folder in the data structure maintained by the third party system uploader . Accordingly, the modification of a file and\/or folder in the networked storage system  in this way can cause a message to be generated by the file storage application  that can be received by the third party system uploader . The third party system uploader  can then upload one or more files associated with such a modification to the designated third party system .","In the case of files added to user's storage bucket  via the email injection application  that are subsequently uploaded to a third party system  by the third party system uploader , embodiments of the disclosure can allow a user to designate instructions regarding upload of the file to the third party system uploader . In one embodiment, an account alias associated with the third party system  can be stored in the storage account  that allows the third party system  to be identified by a string in a From address, subject line and\/or body of an email containing a file attachment. The email injection application  can verify that the sender of the email is authorized to add files to the networked storage system  in a particular account and generate a message for the third party system uploader  that identifies the file as well as the account alias identified in the email. Accordingly, the third party system uploader  can retrieve an entry in the third party system data structure associated with the third party system  and initiate upload of the file to the third party system .","In this embodiment, account settings  can also allow a user to specify more than one account alias for a given account in a social networking system. Account aliases can also include other upload attributes associated with the third party system , such as a folder name, album name, or other upload attribute associated with an upload to the third party system .","A user can also specify a folder name in which a file attached to an email processed by the email injection application  is stored in a From address, subject line and\/or body of the email. In this scenario, when the email injection application  stores the file attachment in the networked storage system , a message is generated and transmitted to the third party system uploader , which can initiate upload to a designated third party system  as described above.","Referring next to , shown is a flowchart that provides one example of the operation of at least a portion of the email injection application  and third party system uploader  according to various embodiments. It is understood that the flowchart of  provides merely an example of the many different types of functional arrangements that may be employed to implement the operation of the corresponding functionality of the email injection application  and third party system uploader  as described herein. As an alternative, the flowchart of  may be viewed as depicting an example of steps of a method implemented in the one or more computing devices  () according to one or more embodiments. The flowchart of  depicts one example of the functionality of the email injection application  in receiving files  () as file attachments in emails, taking action to store such file attachments as files , and uploading files  to a third party system  as described above.","Beginning in box , the email injection application  determines whether a file is attached to an incoming email. If not, then the email injection application  proceeds to box  in which a reply is generated and sent to the sender that indicates an error has occurred due to the fact that no file attachment existed. Thereafter, the email is discarded and the email injection application  ends as shown.","However, assuming that the received email includes a file attachment, then the email injection application  proceeds to box . In box , the email injection application  identifies a storage account associated with the sender of the email. In box , the email injection application  can identify a storage account associated with the sender. The storage account associated with the sender can be extracted from a string included as a part of a \u201cFrom\u201d address associated with the email, an identifier embedded within the header, body, or other portion of the email, or the email address to which the email was sent may uniquely identify the storage account .","Once the storage account has been identified in box , then the email injection application  proceeds to box  to store the file in a storage bucket associated with the storage account. The file can be stored in various storage locations in the storage bucket  as configured by the user and\/or specified in the account settings  associated with the storage account . In box , the third party system uploader  can determine whether the storage location in which the file was stored in the networked storage system  is associated with a third party system . As noted above, this process can be decoupled from or asynchronous in relation to the process of storing the file in the networked storage system . In box , the third party system uploader  can retrieve credentials and\/or other upload attributes associated with the designated third party system  and initiate upload to the third party system in box .","Referring next to , shown is a flowchart that provides one example of the operation of at least a portion of the file storage application  and third party system uploader  according to various embodiments.
