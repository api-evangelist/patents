title: Fast response fluid flow control valve/nozzle
abstract: Disclosed herein is a fast response fluid flow control valve/nozzle that combines the technology used to rupture the frangible discs found in pressurized container-based fire protection/suppression systems with that found in fixed pipe spray/sprinkler systems. The apparatus' design projects a small, localized pressure wave at the underside of a frangible disc that is sufficient to rupture the disc in a very rapid manner. The present invention generally comprises an assembly of six primary components; a chamber base, a jet core threaded into the chamber base, a commercially-available rupture/frangible disc assembly, a disc retention ring, a nozzle port threaded onto the chamber base to hold the retention ring and rupture disc against the jet core and to tie the components together as a unitized assembly, and a pressure cartridge actuator.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to high-speed fire protection\/suppression systems and, more particularly, to fast response fluid flow control nozzles incorporating a frangible element that is designed to be ruptured to release said material.","2. Description of the Background","The ongoing development of increasingly hazardous (i.e. energetic or explosive) materials requires concurrent improvements in the safety systems associated with their handling and storage. High-speed fire protection\/suppression systems represent one of the most important safety systems associated with those evolving materials. High-speed fire protection\/suppression systems take a number of forms. Common forms include (1) fixed pipe pilot-actuated spraying\/sprinkler systems incorporating poppet valve-based nozzle assemblies and (2) pressurized containers of fire extinguishing\/suppressing material (e.g. water) in combination with some means of fire detection. As one might expect, both forms possess certain pros and cons.","Pressurized containers have been historically used for the discharge of fire suppression agents in explosion suppression systems. Testing conducted by the Fire Research Laboratory at Tyndall Air Force Base has demonstrated that a pressurized container-based system, in this case a spherical container, can provide a significantly faster response time, in discharging a fire extinguishing\/suppressing material to control various fire-related hazards, than a pilot-actuated spraying\/sprinkler system. However, the limited, or finite, volume of fire extinguishing\/suppressing material present in a pressurized container-based system, as opposed to the essentially unlimited supply available with a fixed pipe pilot-actuated spraying\/sprinkler system, can be problematic. Additional deficiencies of pressurized container-based systems include (1) their typically bulky size\/shape, (2) the significant cost and effort required to rearm\/refill them, (3) their inability to be utilized\/deployed in areas of limited size or accessibility, and (4) their initial purchase price.","The fast response time of a pressurized container-based system is generally provided by a fluid flow control valve incorporating a frangible element (e.g. a disc) and some means for rupturing that element upon the detection of a fire. The present invention is not the first to address the issue of fast response fluid flow control devices for fire protection\/suppression systems. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,647,738 to Chatrathi et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,458,202 to Fellows et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,232,053 to Gillis et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,031,701 to McLelland et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,006,780 to Zehr, and U.S. Pat. No. 3,834,463 to Allard et al. disclose a variety of means for releasing the flow of a fire extinguishing\/suppressing material via the rupturing of a frangible element.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,647,438 to Chatrathi et al. discloses an explosion suppressant dispersion nozzle for dispersing suppressant material from a pressurized suppressant storage vessel to a protected zone or room upon the rupturing of a frangible element by an actuator.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,458,202 to Fellows et al. discloses a pressurized extinguishant release device with a penetrator affixed to a rolling diaphragm. The penetrator is positioned above a frangible membrane that encloses a pressurized extinguishant. Heating of a liquid filled sensor tube to a certain temperature will cause vapor pressure to push against the diaphragm, causing a shear pin to fail, and propel the penetrator into the membrane and thus allow the extinguishant to flow.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,232,053 to Gillis et al. discloses an explosion protection system including a container with a discharge outlet adapted to contain an explosion suppressant under pressure, a frangible member covering the discharge outlet, an explosive charge disposed in the container adjacent to the frangible member and adapted to create explosive forces that rupture said member, and a somewhat compressible explosion suppressant retained under pressure.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,031,701 to McLelland et al. discloses a suppressant delivery and release nozzle structure for an explosion protection system. The nozzle is a reducing elbow, concentric or eccentric mounting a rupture disc at its small end. A selectively actuatable detonator housed in the nozzle adjacent the disc permits substantially instantaneous opening of the disc upon command for release and delivery of suppressant to a zone to be protected from an explosion hazard.","U.S. Pat. No. 4,006,780 to Zehr discloses a device for rupturing a pressurized cylinder containing a fire extinguishing product. When the temperature is high enough to melt a fusible link, a spring-loaded punch is forcibly propelled downwardly to rupture a frangible disc in the cylinder to allow the contents to be discharged.","U.S. Pat. No. 3,834,463 to Allard et al. discloses a sensitive sprinkler that includes a rupture disc valve positioned to block fluid flow through the flow path. An explosive squib is mounted in the fluid flow path upstream of the rupture disc so that when exploded an expansive gas directs a pressure through said fluid to rupture the disc. A fire detector assembly electrically activates the squib substantially immediately upon detection of a fire.","The ideal fire protection\/suppression system would combine the fast response of a container-based system with the essentially unlimited extinguishing\/suppressing material supply of a fixed pipe system. Unfortunately, due to the nature of fixed pipe fire protection\/suppression systems, each of these prior art devices possesses certain limitations with respect to the specific needs addressed by the present invention. The Chatrathi et al., Gillis et al., McLelland et al., and Allard et al. patents incorporate the storage and use of an explosive device\/detonator to rupture the frangible element. The use of any explosive device\/detonator does provide the required activation speed of a system, however the type and size of the device being considered is essential as it may be exposed to highly energetic\/explosive materials. Additionally, the Gillis et al. and Allard et al. patents operate in a manner that generates an omni-directional pressure wave that momentarily disrupts the outward flow of the fire suppressing material. With highly energetic\/explosive materials, every fraction of a second counts and, therefore, any process that delays the outward flow of the fire suppressing material is one that must be eliminated. The Fellows et al. and Zehr patents disclose components used to rupture the frangible elements that are positioned within the flow pathway for the fire extinguishing\/suppressing material. This configuration, in a best case scenario, results in a marginal occlusion of the orifice through which the fire extinguishing\/suppressing material is meant to flow. In a worst case scenario, the orifice might become completely occluded.","Therefore, there remains a need for a fast response fluid flow control valve\/nozzle incorporating a frangible element that is designed to be ruptured to release fire suppressant material from an essentially unlimited supply. While the use of an explosive or energetic actuator may be required to provide the required speed of activation of a system, significant consideration should be given to reducing the potential hazard. The fluid flow control valve\/nozzle should also be scalable to provide for use in a variety of applications, fabricated of materials that provide the durability\/longevity required by the nature of its use, capable of being retrofitted to existing fire protection\/suppression systems, and economical to manufacture in order to provide for widespread use.","It is, therefore, the primary object of the present invention to provide a fast response fluid flow control valve\/nozzle for use in high-speed fire protection\/suppression systems of the type having an essentially unlimited supply of fire extinguishing\/suppressing materials.","It is another object of the present invention to provide a fast response fluid flow control valve\/nozzle with frangible element that cannot block, to any degree, the flow of the fire extinguishing\/suppressing materials.","Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a fast response fluid flow control valve\/nozzle with a frangible element for use in high-speed fire protection\/suppression systems that controls and significantly reduces the hazard introduced by the actuator into the protected area to break the frangible element.","It is another object of the present invention to provide improved fast response fluid flow control valves\/nozzles for use in high-speed fire protection\/suppression systems that are scalable to provide for use in a variety of applications.","Another object of the present invention is to provide improved fast response flow control apparatus for use in high-speed fire protection\/suppression systems that are fabricated of materials that provide the durability\/longevity required by the nature of its use.","Yet another object of the present invention is to provide improved fast response flow control apparatus that may be retrofitted to existing fire protection\/suppression systems.","Still another object of the present invention is to provide improved fast response flow control apparatus for use in high-speed fire protection\/suppression systems that are economical to manufacture to provide for widespread use.","These and other objects are accomplished by a fast response fluid flow control valve\/nozzle that generally comprises an assembly of six primary components. A chamber base provides a threaded connection for a typical high-speed fire protection\/suppression piping system. The base forms one half of a chamber that is pressurized by the initiation of a commercially available actuation device that is connected to a port in the side of the base. A jet core is threaded into the chamber base to form the other half of the chamber. The jet core includes the channels connecting the chamber with the under side of a rupture (i.e. frangible) disc assembly. A disc retention ring holds the rupture disc assembly against the jet core. A nozzle port threads onto the chamber base applying the pressure to the disc retention ring to seat the rupture disc assembly and tie the components together as a complete assembly. The nozzle port also provides a threaded connection to facilitate the installation of a water spray nozzle. The final component is a pressure cartridge actuator threaded into the chamber base and used to generate the pressure required to rupture the disc assembly.","The fast response fluid flow control valve\/nozzle according to the present invention combines the technology used to rupture the frangible discs found in pressurized container-based fire protection\/suppression systems with that found in fixed pipe, high-speed spray\/sprinkler systems. The present invention applies over-pressurization technology to a significantly smaller chamber contained within the fast response fluid flow control valve\/nozzle that is virtually isolated from the essentially unlimited supply of fire extinguishing\/suppressing material. The apparatus' design directs the over-pressurization created in the chamber through the channels in the jet core to create a small, localized pressure wave on the underside of the frangible disc. The pressure wave is, due to its localized nature, sufficient to rupture the disc in an extremely rapid manner without generating any flow disrupting back pressure that would delay the discharge of the fire extinguishing\/suppressing material through the fast response fluid flow control valve\/nozzle.","The present invention fulfills its purpose while significantly limiting the introduction of hazards (e.g. explosive devices) into the area it protects. The present invention is scalable to provide for use in a variety of applications, fabricated of materials that provide the durability\/longevity required by the nature of its use, capable of being retrofitted to existing fire protection\/suppression systems, and economical to manufacture in order to provide for widespread use.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIGS. 1 and 2","b":["10","10","20","30","40","50","60","70","73","75"]},"As can be seen in , the chamber base  comprises a base and outer walls of a chamber  of varying diameters, internal threads A at one end, internal threads B and external threads  at the opposite end, an actuator mounting port , an air bleed port , a plurality of key pin holes  formed in the end  proximate the external threads , and an o-ring groove . The actuator mounting port  and the air bleed port  are in fluid communication with the internal chamber  and positioned 180E apart on the external surface near the end with the internal threads A. The internal threads A represent the means (i.e. a fire suppressant inlet port \u2014see ) for creating a threaded connection between the valve\/nozzle  and a typical high-speed fire protection\/suppression piping system (not shown in the Figures). A hexagonal cross-section  is formed in the external surface of the chamber base , at the end that includes the internal threads A, to further facilitate the making of the aforementioned threaded connection.

The two commercially-available o-rings ,  are placed in the o-ring grooves , , respectively, found in the chamber base  and on the external surface  of the jet core . The jet core  is inserted into the internal chamber  of the chamber base  such that its external threads  engage the base's internal threads B.

The joining of these components serves to compress o-ring  within groove  against end surface  of the jet core  and to engage o-ring  with an internal surface B of the chamber base , thereby trapping the disc assembly  between the core  and the ring . The nozzle port  is attached to the resulting sub-assembly by engaging the internal threads  of the nozzle port  with the external threads  of the chamber base . Finally, the cartridge actuator  is attached in a releasable manner to the chamber base  via the internal threads  located within the mounting port .","The operation of the valve\/nozzle , after its installation in a typical fixed pipe high-speed fire protection\/suppression system, once any entrapped air is removed from the chamber through bleed port  (a conventional bleeder valve can be used for this purpose but is not shown in Figures), is as follows. The valve\/nozzle assembly  contains an internal chamber  that is pressurized to more than 300 PSI by the initiation of the cartridge actuator  upon the detection of a fire\/explosion. The pressure wave created by the actuator's initiation is directed through the channels  and against the underside (i.e. convex) surface  of the frangible disc  in order to rupture the disc  and release the fire extinguishing\/suppressing material that enters through inlet port  and exits through a dispersing nozzle attached to discharge port .","As is readily perceived in the foregoing description, the fast response fluid flow control valve\/nozzle  of the present invention combines the technology used to rupture the frangible discs found in container-based fire protection\/suppression systems with that found in fixed pipe, high-speed spray\/sprinkler systems. The present invention applies over-pressurization technology to a significantly smaller chamber  contained within the fast response fluid flow control valve\/nozzle  that is virtually isolated from the essentially unlimited supply of fire extinguishing\/suppressing material.
