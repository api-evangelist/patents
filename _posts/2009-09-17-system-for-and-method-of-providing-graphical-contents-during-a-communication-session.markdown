{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND INFORMATION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["Traditional ring tones and\/or on-hold recording messages may be boring and irritating to callers. For example, a callee may play a musical ring tone of their favorite song to callers instead of the dull and repetitive ring before the callee may answer the call from the caller. Sometimes, a businesses owner may play recording of a soft-sell sales pitch regarding their products and services in an effort to entice callers to purchase their products and services. Other times, callers may become more aggravated than appeased when the businesses owner selects to play tiresome music from a local radio station for the on-hold recording messages. Therefore, traditional ring tones and\/or on-hold recording messages may be deficient to appease and capture the attention of callers.","An exemplary embodiment provides a system and process for providing graphical contents during a communication session (e.g., video calls, video teleconferencing calls, or telephone calls). In an exemplary embodiment, the system and process may allow user to provide one or more graphical contents to another user during a communication session. For example, a user may provide graphical contents in the form of broadcasting or advertising commercials during a communication session. Also, the user may provide the graphical contents in the form of pictures, videos, slides shows, drawings\/paintings, graphs\/charts and\/or other forms of graphical illustrations during a communication session. The system and process may allow a first user to provide one or more graphical contents to a second user when the second user may be put on-hold during a communication session. The system and process may allow a first user to provide one or more graphical contents to a second user during an initiation, of or before establishing, a communication session. Further, the system and process may allow a user to provide different graphical contents to different users. The system and process may allow a user to upload one or more graphical contents to an application system or a graphical content system in order to provide the one or more graphical contents to other users. The system and process may allow a user to provide desired graphical contents to other users from a local storage device associated with the user.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","102","104","108","106","106","118","120","106","122","128","124","106","122","126","106","128","102","118","120","124","126","104","108","104","104","102","104","108"]},"The user communication device  may be a computer, a personal computer, a laptop, a cellular communication device, a workstation, a mobile device, a phone, a handheld PC, a personal digital assistant (\u201cPDA\u201d), a thin system, a fat system, a network appliance, an Internet browser, or other any other device that may allow a user to communicate with the application system  via one or more networks (not shown) as known in the art.
