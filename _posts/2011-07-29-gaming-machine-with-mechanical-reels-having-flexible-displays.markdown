The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure, as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent files or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.","Over the years, gaming machines have grown in both sophistication and gaming features to maintain player interest. Gaming machines have gone from relatively simple devices providing a player with an opportunity to win cash awards to sophisticated, multi-media devices. Even more, the games presented on the gaming machines have become increasing intricate. For example, slot-style games include may include five or more reels with twenty or more paylines. Furthermore, games may include one or more bonus games or different game modes that allow a player to participate in a community game or a tournament. While current gaming machines are successful, there is a continuing need for slot machines variants that provide a player with enhanced excitement without deviating from the traditional slots game.","Briefly, and in general terms, various embodiments are directed to changing gaming machine hardware while maintaining the software component of the gaming machine. In one embodiment, a video-based slots gaming machine is reconfigured into a gaming machine having physical, spinning stepper reels with a flexible display affixed to the each reel. In another embodiment, a conventional mechanical reel-based gaming machine is reconfigured into a gaming machine in which conventional reel strips are upgraded to flexible displays affixed to the periphery of the reels.","For example, one embodiment of a gaming machine includes a plurality of mechanical reels each operatively coupled to a stepper motor. Each mechanical reel further includes a flexible video display affixed to an outer circumference of the mechanical reel. The gaming machine also has a main central processing unit for executing instructions for a native mechanical reel game, and a multiplexer engine that is in communication with the main central processing unit. The multiplexer engine intercepts and converts the native signals into video images for presentation on the flexible displays on the plurality of mechanical reels. The gaming machine also includes a display control system in communication with the flexible video display. The control board system has a central processing unit for decoding and transmitting processed video-based reel game data for display on the flexible video display.","In addition to gaming machines and mechanical reel structures, various methods for presenting an upgraded stepper reel games are disclosed herein. According to one method, an upgraded mechanical reel game is presented on a gaming machine, and the method includes sending a native signal for spinning a plurality of mechanical reels in response to player input initiating game play. Further, the method includes intercepting the native signal and converting the native signal into a video signal, and spinning the mechanical reels while presenting the video signal on the flexible video displays of the spinning mechanical reels.","Other features and advantages will become apparent from the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, which illustrate by way of example, the features of the various embodiments.","Other features and advantages will become apparent from the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, which illustrate by way of example, the features of the various embodiments.","Various embodiments and methods are directed to repurposing a conventional reel-based gaming machine presenting a slots-style game. In one embodiment, a video-based slots gaming machine is reconfigured into a gaming machine having physical, spinning stepper reels having a flexible display affixed to the each reel. In another embodiment, a conventional mechanical reel-based gaming machine is reconfigured into a gaming machine in which conventional reel strips are upgraded to flexible displays affixed to the periphery of the reels. While the hardware for the gaming machine has been altered, the underlying software running the video game has not been changed. Consequently, the gaming machine may be upgraded and used without further regulatory approval.","Referring now to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals denote like or corresponding parts throughout the drawings and, more particularly to , there are shown various embodiments of a gaming machine having been converted into a gaming machine having physical, spinning stepper reels with flexible displays affixed to the reels.","More specifically,  is a gaming machine  having five reels . Each reel  has a plurality of symbols  appearing on the circumference of the reel. As shown in , three symbols  are visible to the player. In other embodiments, the gaming machine (not shown) may have at least three reels and may have one, two, three or more symbols visible to the player.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["102","106","106","108","102","102","110","108","110","102","112","102","114","116","116","106"]},"In another embodiment, a reel (not shown) has a plurality of flexible displays applied to the periphery of the reel. The flexible displays are mounted end to end so the flexible displays wrap completely around the physical reel. In one embodiment, there are flexible displays for each symbol position on the reel. In another embodiment, a reel has a plurality of flexible displays layered on top of each other. The layering of the plurality of displays generates a three-dimensional effect to the symbols displayed on the displays. In this embodiment, the displays may be transmissive (i.e., opaque in a first state and transparent in a second state).","As shown in , control circuitry  to drive the display  is separated into a fixed portion  and a rotating portion . In one embodiment, the rotating portion  is fixed to the spokes  of the reels. In other embodiments, the rotating portion  of the control circuitry  may be coupled to the hub, spoke, reels or any other portion of the reel. In , the rotating portion  of the control circuitry  is fixed to the inside of the reel  and rotates with the reel. The rotating portion  of the control circuitry  drives the flexible display and also includes an MPEG decoder or video and audio compression methods. Additionally, a network interface, such as an Ethernet interface, may be associated with the control circuitry allowing for wired or wireless communication of data to the control circuitry.","Power for the rotating portion  of the control circuitry  and the display  is transferred across a slip ring from the fixed control board . In another embodiment, a commutator transfers power to the control circuitry  and display . Alternatively, power may be supplied to the rotating portion  of the control circuitry  and the display  through inductance methods know or developed in the art.","As shown in , an infra-red (IR) transmitter  and receiver , such as but not limited to the Agilent Technologies Models HSDL-3020\/3021, is used to transfer control signals to the rotating control board  and the flexible display . Alternatively, a transmitter receiver using wireless transmission technology such as, but not limited to, ultra wideband is used to transfer control signals to the rotating control board  and the flexible display . Optionally, the slip ring  also transfers control signals for the operation of the flexible display . In one embodiment, a mercury-based electronic slip ring, such as the Mercotac (Model 830), is used to transmit control signals. Alternatively, conventional slip rings in combination with an electrical filter may be used to transfer control signals to the flexible display.","As shown in , the IR transmitter  is coupled to the mounting plate  that is adjacent to the reel , and the IR receiver  is coupled to the end of the shaft of the reel axle . Alternatively, the locations of the IR transmitter  and receiver  may be swapped. As shown in , an IR transmitter data cable  is used to couple the IR transmitter  and the stepper control board . This configuration reduces the need for extra physical components and ensures that the upgraded physical reel can fit in a conventional arrangement.","As shown in , the reel  includes a stepper optical wheel  and sensors  that are used to locate the designated \u201ctop\u201d of the OLED display. The optical wheel  is coupled to the reel , and the sensors  are coupled to the control board  or alternatively, the mounting plate . Each reel is also associated with a stepper motor  that causes the reel to move a fixed angle of rotation for a fixed time duration.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["200","204","202","208","206","210","210"]},"The video cut up and multiplexer engine  is able to process video outputs ,  for presentation on the reconfigurable displays . The video cut up and multiplexer engine  receives the video output  from the original video reel spin game and divides the video into individual spinning reel portions for display on the displays of the separate physical reels. By way of example and not of limitation, if the original video reel spin game is a three-reel game, the engine  divides the original image into three separate video streams and each video stream is presented on a flexible display .","Additionally, the video cut up and multiplexer engine  also receives video output from the player tracking system . As shown in , the video content can be reformatted and presented on the flexible displays . The flexible displays may present multiplier values and award values. In one embodiment, a bonus prize is the product of the multiplier value and the award value. In other embodiments, promotional game and bonus awards that are presented on the player tracking system may be presented on one or more flexible displays. Also, the player's loyalty account status may be presented on the flexible displays. For example, a meter showing the player's point status and the point goal to the next level may be shown on the displays .","Referring back to , the video cut up and multiplexer engine  is also communication with a motor control unit  that is used to control the stepper motors for each reel. The video cut up and multiplexer engine  also is in communication with a MPEG encoder  to convert the video streams into the proper format for presentation on the flexible displays . In an alternate embodiment, the reconfigurable reel system does not include the MPEG encoder because the video streams are in a format directly playable on the flexible displays . As shown in , the video cut up and multiplexer engine  outputs data to the LCD information display . The output sent to the LCD information display  includes all the game-associated information that does not include the video reels. The game associated information includes, but is not limited to, player's credits, wager denomination, credits won, credits wagered, wagers per payline, or active paylines.","As shown in , the system  includes a first network interface  in communication with the MPEG encoder  and the motor controller unit . The first network interface  communicates video image data to the network interfaces that are associated with each reel. As shown in , each reel  has its own network interface . In other embodiments, two or more reels may share a network interface. In those embodiments, the network interface may include a multiplexer to send the appropriate video signal to each reel.","As shown in , each physically-rotatable reel includes a flexible display . The images provided on the flexible displays are provided by a MPEG decoder . The MPEG decoder  is associated with the rotatable control circuitry . As shown in , an IR transmitter and receiver  are in communication with the MPEG decoder . Additionally, each video stepper reel is associated with a network interface . Each reel is also given an IP address. The network interface may pass data to the MPEG decoder over a wired or wireless Ethernet network.  also depicts a casino management system  in communication with the flexible displays  via the network interface  and may even provide the content to be presented on the flexible displays.","In one embodiment, standard MPEG, MPEG2 or MPEG4 encoders and decoders (such as the DaVinci TMS320DM355) are modified to only generate I and P frames and eliminate the use of bidirectional encoding (i.e., B frames which are generally used to increase the perceived visual quality for a given bitrate). Bi-directional encoding is not used because it typically introduces a delay of anywhere up to 15 frames (which could be as much as half a second) in video passing through the encoder\/decoder. That is, when using B-frames, each group of pictures (GOP) is encoded and decoded out of order\u2014frame  of a GOP may be decoded before it is possible to decode frame . A potential delay of half a second would be unacceptable to a player of a slot machine because the delay would be introduced at the point when the player presses the \u201cspin\u201d button and before the video images are presented on the video display to the player. The delay may create apprehension in the player that the game is not properly operating properly.","The Video Cut Up and Multiplexer engine  takes the output from a video reel spin game  and cuts out the spinning reel portions for display on the separate physical reels. The Video Cut Up and Multiplexer engine  also receives a spin button signal  along with the video reel spin game, which allows the multiplexer engine to stay in sync with the video output from the video reel spin game. As a spin button is pressed, the multiplexer  is immediately able to change state to anticipate the movement of video reels.","In , the network interfaces  for the reconfigurable reels  are in communication with a casino management system . The casino management system  allows the individual reels  to be remotely controlled provided that the external system is an authorized system. Accordingly, an authentication system (not shown) confirms that an associated casino management system  is an authorized system. In one embodiment, the casino management system  generates a certificate that is compared to a certificate stored in the memory of the video stepper reel . The generated certificate must exactly match or be signed by the certificate stored in the video stepper reel memory. The authentication system prevents any rogue system from displaying illegal content to the player.","If an external system such as the central management system  wishes to take control of one or more video stepper reels , the external system needs to further perform a negotiation process with the associated multiplexer  so that only one video content is shown at one time. Alternatively, a priority system within the video stepper reel software that prioritizes video content from the multiplexer or an external system so that video content from one source is presented at one time.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0068"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 5"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0069"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["100","102","102","102","310","102","302","304","306"],"i":["a","c ","a","e","a","e ","a","e ","a","e ","a","e "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0070"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 7","FIG. 7"],"b":["400","402","400","400","402","402","400","406","412","402","406","408","416","418"]},"Data is transmitted via the infra-red link  from the encoder  on the stepper control\/Ethernet interface board  to the infra-red decoder  on the video decoder and display control board . As shown in , the CPU  on the display control board  sends and receives data from the system memory , and receives data from the infra-red decoder , and sends data to the MPEG decoder . The data received from the infra-red decoder  may be processed by the CPU , and the processed data is then sent to the MPEG decoder . The data is sent to and may be stored in the video memory . The data is then sent to a low-voltage differential signalling (LVDS) encoder , which in turn, sends the data to the flexible display  for presentation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0072"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 8"],"b":["500","502"]},"In use, the sensing device (not shown) first determines the location of the player's eyes. According, to one method, the CPU of the gaming device computes a ray from the located eye through the point touched on the touchscreen to a point on the video stepper reel. In an alternate method, the CPU first computes a ray from the player's eye location to the point touched on the touch screen. Next, the CPU determines the point at which the ray contacts the video stepper reel. In either method, a more accurate position on the video stepper reel is determined because the height and distance of the player from the point of contact is accounted for. As a result, the gaming machine is able to use smaller contact areas. Alternatively, these methods provide for finer gesture control, which can lead to a plurality of games.","Conversion of Existing Stepper Game\/Cabinet to Video Stepper","In another embodiment, the physical stepper reels in an existing are upgraded to a stepper reels having one or more flexible displays applied to the circumference of the reels. That is, the static reel strips are replaced with one or more flexible displays. The displays may be layered one on top of the other, end to end so that the entire circumference of the reel is covered, or a combination thereof. In this embodiment, the original signals may be repurposed and\/or supplemented to provide an enhanced gaming experience. For example, the original stepper motor signals may be supplemented so that the artwork of the original stepper game is enhanced by downloading a new symbol bitmap images into the video memory associated with the CPU. Accordingly, when the original stepper motor signal is sent, the new symbol bitmap images are presented on the flexible displays. Optionally, new mathematics and other control logic may be incorporated into the game without swapping out the physical reels.","Generally, the CPU intercepts the various signals sent by the native\/original program, and the CPU may send new or supplemental images, sound effects, or any combination thereof. Alternately, the original signal may be passed through the CPU without any decoding. Examples of these originals include, but are not limited to, stepper motor signals may be sent to the stepper motors, the original game signals that drive the light sources (e.g., lamps or LEDs) used to backlight a reel, and\/or to highlight a winning payline are repurposed as inputs for the flexible displays.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0077"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["600","600"],"i":["a","h "]},"As shown in , the existing stepper output  includes outputs for the mechanical reels and information displays. The mechanical reel outputs include played line indicators , win line indicators , reel symbol illumination signals , game state illumination signals , and stepper motor control signals . The information displays are typically 7 segment displays that present information regarding number of lines played , win amount paid , credits on gaming machine , and total bets . Each of these outputs is processed by the CPU  and interpreted as video to be displayed either on the LCD information display  or on one or more of the OLED displays  on the video stepper reels (via the Ethernet interface ).","By way of example but not of limitation, the reel symbol illumination signals are used to illustrate the conversion of illumination signals into video output signals for the flexible displays. Each visible symbol on the reels of a reel stepper game is associated with a reel symbol illumination signal. In a five-reel game in which three symbols from each reel are visible, there is a total of 15 reel illumination signals. In one embodiment, the CPU includes decoding software having tables associated with each possible payline.

the end of each reel spin, the inputs are interpreted, and the appropriate payline graphic image(s)  are overlaid on the video stepper reels -as shown in . For example, if Line 5 were to be illuminated, the signals would be as above, and the interpretation logic would be:\n\n","This condition being met would result in the control logic retrieving the overlay images for payline 5. The overlay image  is then delivered to each of the video stepper reels -as shown in .","Referring back to , the win\/played line indicator lights are used to indicate that a line is being played. When player input increases or decreases the number of lines to be played (via a physical button or virtual control panel), light sources associated with the paylines are either turned on or off. The CPU takes the existing output signal and converts the signal into a video image. Alternatively, the CPU receives the existing output signal and determines a corresponding video image(s) and sends the image to the LCD information display and\/or the flexible displays via the multiplexer\/cut up engine and Ethernet interface. Accordingly, the video image presented on the flexible display and\/or the LCD information display reflects the active play lines. Similarly, the CPU may also be used to convert player input into signals that may be converted into a signal that the existing gaming machine can process. For example, if player input is received by a touchscreen selecting active play lines, the signal may be re-routed to the back to the stepper game as if the physical line or bet button were pressed on the gaming machine.","As shown in , game state illumination signals may also be converted to a video image that is presented on the LCD display and\/or flexible displays. The game state illumination signals are used to illuminate the reels in order to signify to the player that the game is in an altered state (e.g., bonus game is activated). For example, in Bally's \u201cInstant Spin\u201d game, the game state illumination signal is sent to illuminate all of the reels with a red tint to indicate to a player that the instant spin feature is active and to look up at the Instant Spin wheel. Upon receipt of the original game state illumination signal, the CPU  can send instructions to instead display content on the video stepper wheels such as shown in . Alternatively, the CPU  may send a signal to cause the flexible displays  to be tinted red and present any message to notify the player that the game state has changed.","As shown in , the CPU  can decode  segment signals to represent the data on the LCD information display . Additionally, the CPU  can determine the state of the stepper game based on the 7 segment signal received at the CPU. The CPU  can then send one or more additional signals to provide additional effects and\/or information. By way of example and not of limitation, if the CPU  receives a \u201cwin paid\u201d signal which indicates a winning event has occurred, the CPU  may provide an additional animation sequence on the OLED display or sound effects to augment the winning event provided by the underlying stepper game. Alternately, the CPU  may sample sound output from the gaming machine to determine the state or operation of the stepper game rather than decoding the signals.","In some embodiments, the flexible display is an electronic paper (e-paper) display. Various methods are contemplated to account for the comparatively long refresh times associated with e-paper displays. According to one method, a portion of the e-paper display is updated rather than updating the entire display. For example, a portion of the display corresponding to one, two, or three game symbols on the display is only updated. In yet another method, the portion of the display that is directly below the visible portion is refreshed. Because this portion of the reel has to travel the longest distance, the e-paper is given the maximum time to refresh before it becomes visible to the player.","Refreshing the portion of the video display that has just left the player's view is useful for those games having a \u201cvirtual reel,\u201d which includes more symbol positions than physical spaces for such symbols. That is, a physical reel may have, for example, twenty-two spaces for game symbols, yet the \u201cvirtual reel\u201d includes, for example, 100 symbols. The CPU includes an algorithm that allows an e-paper display to refresh itself during the spin cycle of the reel. Using the above reel configuration, if symbol positions - are currently visible, then the spin algorithm would (1) determine the final stopping position of the reel; (2) determine the number of symbols to be rotated through and reel spin speed (e.g., if the reel spin speed is one rotation per second, and the spin time is three seconds, the number of symbols to be rotated would be 66); (3) start spinning the reel; (4) replace the lowest symbol with the final stopping position symbol (e.g., the symbol from position  moves downward as the reel spins and is replaced with the symbol from the \u201cfrom\u201d position, which is initially the (final stopping position )); (5) increment the \u201cfrom\u201d position in the reel by one; (6) repeat steps (4) and (5) for 66 iterations; and (7) end with the correct final position. In this example, the final stopping position  is calculated by taking the number of symbols to rotate (66) and subtracting one revolution (22) and adding the number of visible symbols (3).","In another method, the reels are programmed to spin faster so that the symbols on the display are not discernable so that the display has adequate time to refresh to the image to be shown to the player when the reels stop. In another method, the reels spin slower in order to provide the maximum time for the display to refresh.","When implemented as a replacement output for a stepper game, the images displayed on the reels  can use the video methods described above, or alternatively static bitmap images  can be sent once to the video steppers over the infra red link. In another embodiment, a preferred solution is to use a hybrid approach; each video stepper has static symbol bitmaps drawn over the whole of the OLED display . When rotating, this appears to a player as very similar to a conventional stepper reel display. Once stopped, however, the reel displays are fed MPEG streams so that system and\/or player tracking content may be rendered onto the reels and\/or more animation may be shown on the display as compared to a conventional reel.","Touch Gestures",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0100","num":"0100"},"figref":["FIGS. 12-14","FIG. 12"],"b":["700","702","704","702","706","706","708","704"]},"Additionally, the transducers  are able to adhere to the skin of the glass-like materials of the touch panel  sufficiently to pass around curves.

However, those skilled in the art will appreciate the conventional video game may have any number of reels, wheel, or any combination thereof.","The following is one method for reconfiguring a convention video slots machine into a mechanical stepper motor game having reconfigurable displays. First, the areas of the video screen occupied by the video reels are identified.  illustrates one process for gathering data during one or more video spins. At step , a suitable number of video frames are chosen to be sampled or captured. By way of example and not of limitation, the number of frames to be captured (N) is selected to be thirty. In other methods, more or less frames may be selected to be captured. More frames may be captured with the requirement of adequate memory.","At step , video reel spin is started by either manual intervention or via a signal from the video capture software. Once the video reel spin is initiated, the video images are read from the frame buffer at step . For the required number of N frames, a video image is captured every time the video screen updates. Screen updates occur at a rate of either 30 Hz or 60 Hz, depending upon the game. The captured image is stored and an image counter (I) is incremented at step . At step , this process continues until the required number of video images are captured. In this example, thirty images would need to be captured and stored in memory.","Once the N frames, thirty frames in this example are captured, the differences between the frames are calculated. Steps - provide an overview of one method of calculating the differences between the frames. By calculating frame differences, the parts of the image that have changed from frame to frame are isolated and stored.  provides one process for calculating the differences between frames. In this process, frame I is assigned to frame A and frame I+1 is assigned to frame B. The pixels between frame A and frame B are compared at step . At steps ,  each pixel in frame A (i.e. by iterating across each row in A, and within each row, iterating across each column) a comparison is made against the equivalent pixel in frame B. If the pixels match at , then most likely no movement took place at this location in the image, and a 0 is stored at the equivalent position in the difference frame D at step . If the pixels do not match, then some movement has occurred at this position, and a 1 is stored at the equivalent position in the difference frame D at step .","Referring back to , this comparison process, shown in , is repeated for every pixel in the image for each frame N. Once all the different frames (D) are calculated and stored for each N frame, a mask frame is produced at step . The mask frame is produced by iterating over each pixel in the mask frame (both in the X and Y directions), and setting that pixel to be the logical OR of the corresponding pixel in the all of the stored difference frames.

A widescreen display in a \u201cportrait\u201d orientation may be 32 inches tall by 18 inches wide.  illustrates an example of a portrait mode game display  having widescreen dimensions in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. Additionally, game display  preferably includes a touch screen or touch glass system (not shown) and presents player interfaces such as, but not limited to, credit meter (not shown), win meter (not shown) and touch screen buttons (not shown). An example of a touch glass system is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,942,571, entitled \u201cGaming Device with Direction and Speed Control of Mechanical Reels Using Touch Screen,\u201d which is hereby incorporated by reference. Furthermore, as described above, game display  may include transparent portions which cover and may interact with displays on mechanical reels, as described in U.S. application Ser. No. 12\/113,112, entitled, \u201cMechanical Reels With Interactive Display,\u201d filed on Apr. 30, 2008, hereby incorporated in its entirety by reference.","Game display  may also present information such as, but not limited to, player information, advertisements and casino promotions, graphic displays, news and sports updates, or even offer an alternate game. This information may be generated through a host computer networked with gaming machine  on its own initiative or it may be obtained by request of the player using either one or more of the plurality of player-activated buttons ; the game display itself, if game display  comprises a touch screen or similar technology; buttons (not shown) mounted about game display  which may permit selections such as those found on an ATM machine, where legends on the screen are associated with respective selecting buttons; or any player input device that offers the required functionality.","Cabinet housing  incorporates a single game display . However, in alternate embodiments, cabinet housing  or top box  may house one or more additional displays  or components used for various purposes including additional game play screens, animated \u201ctop glass,\u201d progressive meters or mechanical or electromechanical devices (not shown) such as, but not limited to, wheels, pointers or reels. The additional displays may or may not include a touch screen or touch glass system.","Referring to , electronic gaming machine  is shown in accordance with one or more embodiments. Electronic gaming machine  includes base game integrated circuit board  (EGM Processor Board) connected through serial bus line  to game monitoring unit (GMU)  (such as a Bally MC300 or ACSC NT), and player interface integrated circuit board (PIB)  connected to player interface devices  over bus lines , , , , , . Printer  is connected to PIB  and GMU  over bus lines , . EGM Processor Board , PIB , and GMU  connect to Ethernet switch  over bus lines , , . Ethernet switch  connects to a slot management system (SMS) and a casino management system (CMS) network over bus line . GMU  also may connect to the SMS and CMS network over bus line . Speakers  connect through audio mixer  and bus lines ,  to EGM Processor Board  and PIB . The proximity and biometric devices and circuitry may be installed by upgrading a commercially available PIB , such as a Bally iView unit. Coding executed on EGM Processor Board , PID , and\/or GMU  may be upgraded to integrate a game having an interactive wheel game as is more fully described herein.","Peripherals  connect through bus  to EGM Processor Board . For example, a bill\/ticket acceptor is typically connected to a game input-output board  which is, in turn, connected to a conventional central processing unit (\u201cCPU\u201d) board , such as an Intel Pentium microprocessor mounted on a gaming motherboard. I\/O board  may be connected to CPU processor board  by a serial connection such as RS-232 or USB or may be attached to the processor by a bus such as, but not limited to, an ISA bus. The gaming motherboard may be mounted with other conventional components, such as are found on conventional personal computer motherboards, and loaded with a game program which may include a gaming machine operating system (OS), such as a Bally Alpha OS. Processor board  executes a game program that causes processor board  to play a game. In one embodiment, the game program provides a slot machine game having an interactive wheel feature game. The various components and included devices may be installed with conventionally and\/or commercially available components, devices, and circuitry into a conventional and\/or commercially available gaming machine cabinet, examples of which are described above.","When a player has inserted a form of currency such as, for example and without limitation, paper currency, coins or tokens, cashless tickets or vouchers, electronic funds transfers or the like into the currency acceptor, a signal is sent by way of I\/O board  to processor board  which, in turn, assigns an appropriate number of credits for play in accordance with the game program. The player may further control the operation of the gaming machine by way of other peripherals , for example, to select the amount to wager via electromechanical or touch screen buttons. The game starts in response to the player operating a start mechanism such as a handle or touch screen icon. The game program includes a random number generator to provide a display of randomly selected indicia on one or more displays. In some embodiments, the random generator may be physically separate from gaming machine ; for example, it may be part of a central determination host system which provides random game outcomes to the game program. Thereafter, the player may or may not interact with the game through electromechanical or touch screen buttons to change the displayed indicia. Finally, processor board  under control of the game program and OS compares the final display of indicia to a pay table. The set of possible game outcomes may include a subset of outcomes related to the triggering of a feature game. In the event the displayed outcome is a member of this subset, processor board , under control of the game program and by way of I\/O Board , may cause feature game play to be presented on a feature display.","Predetermined payout amounts for certain outcomes, including feature game outcomes, are stored as part of the game program. Such payout amounts are, in response to instructions from processor board , provided to the player in the form of coins, credits or currency via I\/O board  and a pay mechanism, which may be one or more of a credit meter, a coin hopper, a voucher printer, an electronic funds transfer protocol or any other payout means known or developed in the art.","In various embodiments, the game program is stored in a memory device (not shown) connected to or mounted on the gaming motherboard. By way of example, but not by limitation, such memory devices include external memory devices, hard drives, CD-ROMs, DVDs, and flash memory cards. In an alternative embodiment, the game programs are stored in a remote storage device. In one embodiment, the remote storage device is housed in a remote server. The gaming machine may access the remote storage device via a network connection, including but not limited to, a local area network connection, a TCP\/IP connection, a wireless connection, or any other means for operatively networking components together. Optionally, other data including graphics, sound files and other media data for use with the EGM are stored in the same or a separate memory device (not shown). Some or all of the game program and its associated data may be loaded from one memory device into another, for example, from flash memory to random access memory (RAM).","In one or more embodiments, peripherals may be connected to the system over Ethernet connections directly to the appropriate server or tied to the system controller inside the EGM using USB, serial or Ethernet connections. Each of the respective devices may have upgrades to their firmware utilizing these connections.","GMU  includes an integrated circuit board and GMU processor and memory including coding for network communications, such as the G2S (game-to-system) protocol from the Gaming Standards Association, Las Vegas, Nev., used for system communications over the network. As shown, GMU  may connect to card reader  through bus  and may thereby obtain player card information and transmit the information over the network through bus . Gaming activity information may be transferred by the EGM Processor Board  to GMU  where the information may be translated into a network protocol, such as S2S, for transmission to a server, such as a player tracking server, where information about a player's playing activity may be stored in a designated server database.","PID  includes an integrated circuit board, PID processor, and memory which includes an operating system, such as Windows CE, a player interface program which may be executable by the PID processor together with various input\/output (I\/O) drivers for respective devices which connect to PID , such as player interface devices , and which may further include various games or game components playable on PID  or playable on a connected network server and PID  is operable as the player interface. PID  connects to card reader  through bus , display  through video decoder  and bus , such as an LVDS or VGA bus.","As part of its programming, the PID processor executes coding to drive display  and provide messages and information to a player. Touch screen circuitry interactively connects display  and video decoder  to PID , such that a player may input information and cause the information to be transmitted to PID  either on the player's initiative or responsive to a query by PID . Additionally soft keys  connect through bus  to PID  and operate together with display  to provide information or queries to a player and receive responses or queries from the player. PID , in turn, communicates over the CMS\/SMS network through Ethernet switch  and busses ,  and with respective servers, such as a player tracking server.","Player interface devices  are linked into the virtual private network of the system components in gaming machine . The system components include the iVIEW processing board and game monitoring unit (GMU) processing board. These system components may connect over a network to the slot management system (such as a commercially available Bally SDS\/SMS) and\/or casino management system (such as a commercially available Bally CMP\/CMS).","The GMU system component has a connection to the base game through a serial SAS connection and is connected to various servers using, for example, HTTPs over Ethernet. Through this connection, firmware, media, operating system software, gaming machine configurations can be downloaded to the system components from the servers. This data is authenticated prior to install on the system components.","The system components include the iVIEW processing board and game monitoring unit (GMU) processing board. The GMU and iVIEW can combined into one like the commercially available Bally GTM iVIEW device. This device may have a video mixing technology to mix the EGM processor's video signals with the iVIEW display onto the top box monitor or any monitor on the gaming device.","In accordance with one or more embodiments,  is a functional block diagram of a gaming kernel  of a game program under control of processor board , uses gaming kernel  by calling into application programming interface (API) , which is part of game manager . The components of game kernel  as shown in  are only illustrative, and should not be considered limiting. For example, the number of managers may be changed, additional managers may be added or some managers may be removed without deviating from the scope and spirit of the invention.","As shown in the example, there are three layers: a hardware layer ; an operating system layer , such as, but not limited to, Linux; and a game kernel layer  having game manager  therein. In one or more embodiments, the use of a standard operating system , such a UNIX-based or Windows-based operating system, allows game developers interfacing to the gaming kernel to use any of a number of standard development tools and environments available for the operating systems. This is in contrast to the use of proprietary, low level interfaces which may require significant time and engineering investments for each game upgrade, hardware upgrade, or feature upgrade. The game kernel layer  executes at the user level of the operating system , and itself contains a major component called the I\/O Board Server . To properly set the bounds of game application software (making integrity checking easier), all game applications interact with gaming kernel  using a single API  in game manager . This enables game applications to make use of a well-defined, consistent interface, as well as making access points to gaming kernel  controlled, where overall access is controlled using separate processes.","For example, game manager  parses an incoming command stream and, when a command dealing with I\/O comes in (arrow ), the command is sent to an applicable library routine . Library routine  decides what it needs from a device, and sends commands to I\/O Board Server  (see arrow ). A few specific drivers remain in operating system 's kernel, shown as those below line . These are built-in, primitive, or privileged drivers that are (i) general (ii) kept to a minimum and (iii) are easier to leave than extract. In such cases, the low-level communications is handled within operating system  and the contents passed to library routines .","Thus, in a few cases library routines may interact with drivers inside operating system , which is why arrow  is shown as having three directions (between library utilities  and I\/O Board Server , or between library utilities  and certain drivers in operating system ). No matter which path is taken, the logic needed to work with each device is coded into modules in the user layer of the diagram. Operating system  is kept as simple, stripped down, and common across as many hardware platforms as possible. The library utilities and user-level drivers change as dictated by the game cabinet or game machine in which it will run. Thus, each game cabinet or game machine may have an industry standard processor board  connected to a unique, relatively dumb, and as inexpensive as possible I\/O adapter board , plus a gaming kernel  which will have the game-machine-unique library routines and I\/O Board Server  components needed to enable game applications to interact with the gaming machine cabinet. Note that these differences are invisible to the game application software with the exception of certain functional differences (i.e., if a gaming cabinet has stereo sound, the game application will be able make use of API  to use the capability over that of a cabinet having traditional monaural sound).","Game manager  provides an interface into game kernel , providing consistent, predictable, and backwards compatible calling methods, syntax, and capabilities by way of game application API . This enables the game developer to be free of dealing directly with the hardware, including the freedom to not have to deal with low-level drivers as well as the freedom to not have to program lower level managers , although lower level managers  may be accessible through game manager 's interface  if a programmer has the need. In addition to the freedom derived from not having to deal with the hardware level drivers and the freedom of having consistent, callable, object-oriented interfaces to software managers of those components (drivers), game manager  provides access to a set of upper level managers  also having the advantages of consistent callable, object-oriented interfaces, and further providing the types and kinds of base functionality required in casino-type games. Game manager , providing all the advantages of its consistent and richly functional interface  as supported by the rest of game kernel , thus provides a game developer with a multitude of advantages.","Game manager  may have several objects within itself, including an initialization object (not shown). The initialization object performs the initialization of the entire game machine, including other objects, after game manager  has started its internal objects and servers in appropriate order. In order to carry out this function, the kernel's configuration manager  is among the first objects to be started; configuration manager  has data needed to initialize and correctly configure other objects or servers.","The upper level managers  of game kernel  may include game event log manager  which provides, at the least, a logging or logger base class, enabling other logging objects to be derived from this base object. The logger object is a generic logger; that is, it is not aware of the contents of logged messages and events. The log manager's () job is to log events in non-volatile event log space. The size of the space may be fixed, although the size of the logged event is typically not. When the event space or log space fills up, one embodiment will delete the oldest logged event (each logged event will have a time\/date stamp, as well as other needed information such as length), providing space to record the new event. In this embodiment, the most recent events will thus be found in the log space, regardless of their relative importance. Further provided is the capability to read the stored logs for event review.","In accordance with one embodiment, meter manager  manages the various meters embodied in the game kernel . This includes the accounting information for the game machine and game play. There are hard meters (counters) and soft meters; the soft meters may be stored in non-volatile storage such as non-volatile battery-backed RAM to prevent loss. Further, a backup copy of the soft meters may be stored in a separate non-volatile storage such as EEPROM. In one embodiment, meter manager  receives its initialization data for the meters, during startup, from configuration manager . While running, the cash in () and cash out () managers call the meter manager's () update functions to update the meters. Meter manager  will, on occasion, create backup copies of the soft meters by storing the soft meters' readings in EEPROM. This is accomplished by calling and using EEPROM manager .","In accordance with still other embodiments, progressive manager  manages progressive games playable from the game machine. Event manager  is generic, like log manager , and is used to manage various gaming machine events. Focus manager  correlates which process has control of various focus items. Tilt manager  is an object that receives a list of errors (if any) from configuration manager  at initialization, and during game play from processes, managers, drivers, etc. that may generate errors. Random number generator manager  is provided to allow easy programming access to a random number generator (RNG), as a RNG is required in virtually all casino-style (gambling) games. RNG manager  includes the capability of using multiple seeds.","In accordance with one or more embodiments, a credit manager object (not shown) manages the current state of credits (cash value or cash equivalent) in the game machine, including any available winnings, and further provides denomination conversion services. Cash out manager  has the responsibility of configuring and managing monetary output devices. During initialization, cash out manager , using data from configuration manager , sets the cash out devices correctly and selects any selectable cash out denominations. During play, a game application may post a cash out event through the event manager  (the same way all events are handled), and using a callback posted by cash out manager , cash out manager  is informed of the event. Cash out manager  updates the credit object, updates its state in non-volatile memory, and sends an appropriate control message to the device manager that corresponds to the dispensing device. As the device dispenses dispensable media, there will typically be event messages being sent back and forth between the device and cash out manager  until the dispensing finishes, after which cash out manager , having updated the credit manager and any other game state (such as some associated with meter manager ) that needs to be updated for this set of actions, sends a cash out completion event to event manager  and to the game application thereby. Cash in manager  functions similarly to cash out manager , only controlling, interfacing with, and taking care of actions associated with cashing in events, cash in devices, and associated meters and crediting.","In a further example, in accordance with one or more embodiments, I\/O server  may write data to the gaming machine EEPROM memory, which is located in the gaming machine cabinet and holds meter storage that must be kept even in the event of power failure. Game manager  calls the I\/O library functions to write data to the EEPROM. The I\/O server  receives the request and starts a low priority EEPROM thread  within I\/O server  to write the data. This thread uses a sequence of 8 bit command and data writes to the EEPROM device to write the appropriate data in the proper location within the device. Any errors detected will be sent as IPC messages to game manager . All of this processing is asynchronous.","In accordance with one embodiment, button module  within I\/O server , polls (or is sent) the state of buttons every two milliseconds. These inputs are debounced by keeping a history of input samples. Certain sequences of samples are required to detect a button was pressed, in which case the I\/O server  sends an inter-process communication event to game manager  that a button was pressed or released. In some embodiments, the gaming machine may have intelligent distributed I\/O which debounces the buttons, in which case button module  may be able to communicate with the remote intelligent button processor to get the button events and simply relay them to game manager  via IPC messages. In still another embodiment, the I\/O library may be used for pay out requests from the game application. For example, hopper module  must start the hopper motor, constantly monitor the coin sensing lines of the hopper, debounce them, and send an IPC message to the game manager  when each coin is paid.","Further details, including disclosure of lower level fault handling and\/or processing, are included in U.S. Pat.
