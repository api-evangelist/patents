Single features of different embodiments may also be combined to provide other embodiments. Like reference numerals refer to like elements throughout.","Embodiments are applicable to any base station, user equipment, server, corresponding component, and\/or to any communication system or any combination of different communication systems that support required functionalities.","The protocols used, the specifications of communication systems, servers and user terminals, especially in wireless communication, develop rapidly. Such development may require extra changes to an embodiment. Therefore, all words and expressions should be interpreted broadly and they are intended to illustrate, not to restrict, the embodiments.","Modern communications systems under development provide a possibility to install local area (LA) base stations in the network. These base stations may be installed within buildings to provide additional coverage and capacity in homes and offices. These base stations may utilize so-called \u201cplug-and-play\u201d operation with a self-organizing network (SON) and flexible spectrum use (FSU) techniques.","Main targets of these techniques are to minimize the need for network configuration and enable new types of communications networks, such as decentralized ad hoc networks. The techniques enable self-tuning and reconfiguration of network parameters of the LA base stations. In addition, the techniques provide some solutions for utilizing and sharing spectrum resources among communication systems of the same or different operators serving in an overlapping or even common spectrum and\/or geographical area.","In the following, different embodiments will be described using, as an example of a system architecture whereto the embodiments may be applied, an architecture based on Evolved UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA, UMTS=Universal Mobile Telecommunications System) without restricting the embodiment to such an architecture, however.","Many different radio protocols to be used in communications systems exist. Some examples of different communication systems are the universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS) radio access network (UTRAN or E-UTRAN), long term evolution (LTE, also known as E-UTRA), long term evolution advanced (LTE-A), Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN), worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX), Bluetooth\u00ae, personal communications services (PCS) and systems using ultra-wideband (UWB) technology.","In an E-UTRA network the base stations may be called Enhanced Node Bs (eNB). These base stations may be called Wide Area (WA) base stations.","In the E-UTRA network the local area (LA) base stations may be called home node Bs (HNB) or local node Bs (LNB). A home node B may be a wireless access point that may be purchased and\/or installed by a private user, for example in the user's home.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"]},"In the example of , the radio system is based on LTE\/SAE (Long Term Evolution\/System Architecture Evolution) network elements. However, the invention described in these examples is not limited to the LTE\/SAE radio systems but can also be implemented in other radio systems, such as HSDPA (high speed downlink packet access), HSUPA (high speed uplink packet access), or in other suitable radio systems.","The exemplary radio system of  comprises a service core  of an operator including the following elements: a service management , IMS (IP multimedia subsystem) , a MME (Mobility Management Entity) , and a SAE GW (SAE Gateway) .","Traffic between mobile terminals , ,  and the service core network  is carried out via a national IP backbone network , a regional transport network , and a local area aggregation network . eNBs (Enhanced node Bs)  to  of the radio system host the functions for Radio Resource Management: Radio Bearer Control, Radio Admission Control, Connection Mobility Control, Dynamic Resource Allocation (scheduling). The MME  is responsible for distributing paging messages to the eNBs  to .","The example of  comprises a local area base station HNB  forming a cell . The HNB may be privately purchased and owned. The owner of the HNB  may form a user group of the UEs which are allowed to access the HNB. Such a group may be called a closed subscriber group CSG. Typically, only the members of the CSG of a HNB are allowed to contact the HNB. In an embodiment, more than one HNB form a CSG Network. For example, one home may be covered by more than one HNB sharing the same CSG.","Current radio networks are based on a single switch model. This is implemented in the LTE\/SAE network by the SAE GW (SAE Gateway) . All calls are \u201clong distance\u201d because the user traffic is forced to pass via the SAE GW . For example, a connection from a mobile terminal  (connected to the eNodeB ) to an external IP network , such as to the Internet , is typically guided via a route indicated with a dashed line . Likewise, a speech call from the mobile terminal  to another mobile terminal of the system is routed through the SAE GW .","Recently, cellular operators have started to offer local IP (Internet Protocol) connectivity within a certain area (local IP breakout). The user equipment , ,  may connect to the Internet using a local gateway via a eNodeB instead of the SAE GW . Thus, all data is not required to traverse via the centralized SAE GW . The local gateway may be implemented as a separate IP Gateway server (or access router) .","In an embodiment, the server functionality is implemented in the eNodeB. For example, a HNB may be implemented to connect to the Internet through a high-speed DSL Internet connection available in the location of the HNB. Thus, the user equipment  may connect to the Internet through the HNB  which acts as a gateway to the Internet.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","202","204","206","208","204","200","212","214","216","212","202"]},"In this example, the HNB  and HNB  are configured to act as a gateway and connect to the Internet .","Conventional phone call between the CGS networks is a long distance call. A conventional Voice-over-IP call via Internet are realized by 3party software and they do not use wireless cellular access. Therefore, many Voice-over-IP implementations are not supported by the cellular operators.","In the regular cellular-access end-to-end call operation, an eNodeB or an HNB provides a radio-access link to user equipment and an end-to-end call between two UEs is set up through one or more operators networks which are interconnected via transport networks such as the Internet or public telephone networks, etc. In this operation, the eNodeB or HNB is not visible on a transport layer for end-to-end data forwarding between the UEs. That is, point-to-point or peer-to-peer transport between the eNBs or HNBs which provide radio links to the UEs is not applied.","In an embodiment, virtual IP connectivity  between the CGS networks is created. The connectivity creates a tunneled connection through cellular operator(s)'s network(s) and\/or the Internet between the CGS networks. The connection may be called a Virtual Breakout (VBO) connection. The VBO may be realized, for example, by utilizing an Internet Protocol tunneling mechanism within the network of an operator or between the networks of more than one operator. In an embodiment, the VBO is realized by utilizing an IP-connectivity-service-control mechanism such as registering at a common server  and advertising about reachability over the Internet. The server may belong to a 3party.","In an embodiment, the common server may identify requesting acquainted HNBs and distribute keys and configurations to them to set up a secure VBO connection.","In an embodiment, a first HNB may register itself to a 3rd party server and check whether an acquainted HNB is also on-line. Then, the first HNB may select and connect to the acquainted HNB via the 3rd party server.","As a result of the VBO the HNBs and UEs of the CGS networks are aware of each other's on-line reachability and end-to-end connections between devices of different CGS networks can be fast and easily set up and utilized.","The UE  of a CGS network  may utilize the VBO connectivity  and request a Voice-over-IP call  to a UE  camped on the other CGS Network .","In an embodiment, the VBO connection of the HNBs is targeted to IP call services. Other Internet connections of the user equipment connected to an HNB are not utilizing the VBO connections. When the user equipment wishes to utilize Internet services it is required to connect to Internet before accessing the services. However, when user equipment wishes to place a call utilizing the VBO there is no need to set up an Internet connection. The user equipment may merely send a call set-up request to the HNB over the air interface using a normal call set-up control channels.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIGS. 3A to 3C","FIG. 3A"],"b":["300","302","302","304","306","308","308","300","310","312","308","314"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 3B","b":["320","320","322","322","324","326","328","328","320","330","328","332","334","328"]},"In an embodiment, the network element comprises a second controller  for acting as a gateway between the network element and the Internet.

In an embodiment, the network element is configured to assign or map an identifier to the user equipment allowed to be in wireless connection with the apparatus. The identifier may be a customized nickname or user ID that may be used in end-to-end calls instead of regular phone numbers. In an embodiment, the identifier is generated by the UE which registers the identifier to the HNB.","In step  the first network element is connected to the Internet. An HNB may comprise software  instructing the controller of the HNB to connect the HNB to the Internet automatically when powered up. Alternatively, the HNB may be commanded to connect to the Internet by the user or owner of the device.
