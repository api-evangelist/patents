Certain ways of organizing a data structure, and the data contained therein, may result in large savings in terms of time needed to search and produce search results. Further, certain data structures may result in more accurate search results being produced for a given query.","Example methods and systems to facilitate video mail in a peer to peer network are illustrated. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of example embodiments. It will be evident, however, to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details.","In some embodiments, a system and method is disclosed for building a searchable data structure wherein each node in the data structure contains clusters of data. These clusters are generated based upon a variety of factors, including, for example, relevancy weighting, seller factors, price factors, category factors, image factors, and other suitable factors. In one embodiment, this data structure (e.g., a merged cluster map) is generated from a trie or some other data structure that has constant time (O(1)) search performance, or near constant time search performance (e.g., amortized O(1)). These other data structures may include hash tables, binary search trees, red-black trees, heaps, or other suitable data structure. In one embodiment, a Suffix Tree Clustering (STC) algorithm is implemented.","Example embodiments may include an implementation of an STC algorithm building a suffix trie using the terms in documents that are to be divided into groups of clusters based upon the commonality of phrases in the documents. In some embodiments, there are 3 steps to implementing STC\u20141. Document preparation; 2. Identifying base clusters; and 3. Merging clusters. During the merging of clusters, various relevance weighing factors (e.g., multi-factor clustering) may be utilized to merge the clusters in more or less desirable ways depending upon the selected factors.","A System for Implementing STC",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","101","107","102","102","103","104","105","106","101","108","108","108","109","110","110","108","111","108","111","113","112","111","112","113","114","101","107"]},"In some embodiments, the query  may be sent to more than one web server . Further, this web server  may be connected to more than just the application server  and may in fact be connected to a plurality of application servers. Additionally, this application server  may be connected to a plurality of item listing databases in addition to item listing database . Further, though not depicted, this application server  and\/or a plurality of application servers may be operatively coupled to any one of a number of database servers that may serve as an intermediary between the application server  and databases such as the item listing database .","In some embodiments, for a given query (e.g., a search query), the system may obtain search result  for that particular query. This may be achieved through an API call made to a search back end. Subsequently, a HTTP based method call is made to obtain relevance weighting for that particular query from a Relevance-Weighting System. In some embodiments, different queries return relevance weightings specific to that query. Next, the search results obtained are then clustered on the fly using the standard STC algorithm with influencing factors like the relevance-weighting factor, pre-defined merge threshold and pre-defined base cluster score. The clustered results are then sent to the labeling algorithm. The labeling algorithm uses some statistical measure to provide descriptive tags that represent the clusters on the whole, such that the clusters have meaning for the person performing the search.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","108","111","201","201","108","202","112","201","202","204","204","204","203","204","206","205","206","205","205","206","204","204","207","204","208","201","208","111"]},"Document Preparation","In some embodiments, text in the form of strings are processed, wherein these strings are capable of reversible mapping to other strings. These strings may appear in documents such as web pages, or other types of electronically generated documents. Strings in the form of advertisements appearing on web pages advertising the sale of goods or services may be one example of a document. These advertisements may contain titles, seller information, and other descriptive string based information.","Example embodiments may include the populating of an item listing database  for the purpose of providing data upon which to conduct a search. In some embodiments, a rule set (e.g., an eXtensible Markup Language (XML) based file) is provided to an parsing operation, wherein the rule set outlines a grammar based upon which parsing may occur. This parsing operation may, in some embodiments, remove (e.g., filter) noise words from an electronic document in the form of, for example, an advertisement. These noise words may be duplicate words in the electronic document, or words that otherwise do not add meaning to the electronic document. After the completion of the parsing operation, the remaining words are stored into a data structure residing on, for example, the item listing database . These remaining words (e.g., item listings) may be organized by price of the item to which they refer, date and time the advertisement was created, or organized based upon other properties to be used in the selecting of item listing for the purpose of satisfying a query such as query .","In some embodiments, a mapping in the form of, for example, a bayesian network, decision tree, or other suitable data structure is generated wherein all the words in a document (e.g., both noise words and the keywords) are placed into a data structure as nodes with weighted links connecting the nodes. These weighted links may represent probability values for determining whether a word or combination of words appearing in a item listing are noise or key words.","Some embodiments may include the populating of an item listing database  for the purpose of providing data upon which to conduct a search. In some embodiments, demand data and attribute data are used to determine which words are noise and which are not during the course of populating an item listing database . Titles, as entered by users, have high degree of variability. For example, for any single phrase\/item we can have a large number of variations in occurrence location in the title along with the combination of noise words like adjectives and prepositions. Example embodiments may include the use of demand data and attribute data to find the important\/relevant words in the item listings. This demand data may be data relating to how often a word has been used by all users, or a portion of users conducting a search. Attribute data may be data that defines some other piece of data such that the attribute is dependant upon this other piece of data. In one embodiment, a set of relevant words for a query q is built through the following steps:\n\n","In some embodiments, item listing data may be retrieved via the execution of the operation  from the item listing database  for the purpose of identifying and building a trie of possible search results based upon a particular search query, such as query . Further, this query  may be classified through the execution of an operation  prior to the building of the trie. This trie may be a suffix trie, or even a prefix trie. Further, as discussed above, other types of data structures may be used in lieu of a trie for the purpose of organizing item listing data for searching. Once built, the trie may be compacted so as to generate clusters of electronic documents (e.g., base clusters), wherein the clustering is based upon strings and similarities or even differences in strings. This clustering may be performed using various types of logical operations such as intersection (\u2229) so as to eliminate duplicate strings contained in two or more clustered electronic documents. Other operations may include joins (e.g., inter join, outer join), difference (\u2212), and other operations common to query languages such as a Structured Query Language (SQL) and the Multidimensional Expressions (MDX) language.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["201","108","301","301","108","303","303","301","302","302","301","304","304","304","302","302","305","305","108","306","204"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["202","108","401","401","108","108","112","401","112","402","402","204","401","112"]},"Some embodiments may include the various databases (e.g., ) being relational databases, or, in some cases, On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) based databases. In the case of relational databases, various tables of data (e.g., item data, or data that is related to or part of the electronic document) are created and data is inserted into and\/or selected from these tables using an SQL or some other database-query language known in the art. In the case of OLAP databases, one or more multi-dimensional cubes or hyper cubes, containing multidimensional data from which data is selected from or inserted into using an MDX may be implemented. In the case of a database using tables and SQL, a database application such as, for example, MYSQL\u2122, MICROSOFT SQL SERVER\u2122, ORACLE 8I\u2122, 10G\u2122, or some other suitable database application may be used to manage the data. In this, the case of a database using cubes and MDX, a database using Multidimensional On Line Analytic Processing (MOLAP), Relational On Line Analytic Processing (ROLAP), Hybrid Online Analytic Processing (HOLAP), or some other suitable database application may be used to manage the data. The tables or cubes made up of tables, in the case of, for example, ROLAP, are organized into an RDS or Object Relational Data Schema (ORDS), as is known in the art. These schemas may be normalized using certain normalization algorithms so as to avoid abnormalities such as non-additive joins and other problems. Additionally, these normalization algorithms may include Boyce-Codd Normal Form or some other normalization or optimization algorithm known in the art.","Building an Example Data Structure","In some embodiments, once the item data is retrieved by the operation  and the classification of the query  is determined, an uncompacted trie is built. Consider, for example, the following five item titles retrieved in response to the search query \u201cPepsi Cola\u201d: \u201cPepsi Cola Bottle Cap,\u201d \u201cPepsi Cola Bottle Opener,\u201d \u201cOld Pepsi Cola Lighter,\u201d \u201cPepsi Cola Coin Bank,\u201d \u201cVintage Pepsi Cola Bottle Opener.\u201d Using these five retrieved titles, an uncompacted trie may be built.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","204","501","502","503","503","504","504","505","50","506","502","506","506"]},"In addition to the subtree , further subtrees are illustrated in this uncompacted tree . For example, a subtree  contains a variety of nodes -. More to the point, a node 13, referenced as 508, is connected to a node 14, referenced as , via an edge labeled \u201cBottle.\u201d Further, the node 14 labeled as  is connected to a node 15 labeled as  via an edge labeled \u201cCap.\u201d Moreover, this node 14 labeled as  is connected additionally to a node 16 labeled as  via an edge labeled \u201cOpener.\u201d Further, the node 13 labeled as  is connected to a node 17 labeled as  by an edge labeled \u201cLighter.\u201d This node 13 labeled as  is also connected to a node 18 labeled as  via an edge labeled \u201cCoin.\u201d The node 18 labeled as  is further connected to a node 19 labeled as  via an edge labeled as \u201cBank.\u201d This subtree  is in turn connected to a further node 12 by an edge labeled \u201cCola.\u201d This node 12 is in turn connected to another root node by an edge labeled \u201cPepsi.\u201d Traversing through the subtree  and utilizing the node 12 and root node, the following substrings may be generated. For example, the substring \u201cPepsi Cola Bottle Cap\u201d may be generated, wherein the leaf node at the end of this path (e.g., node 15 labeled as ) denotes that document 0 contains this substring. Again, traversing through this subtree  and the connected node 12 and root node, the further substring of \u201cPepsi Cola Lighter\u201d may be generated wherein this substring is contained in documents 2 and 1 as referenced by node 17 (e.g., ). A further substring may be generated in the form of \u201cPepsi Cola Bottle Opener,\u201d wherein this substring is contained in documents 0, 1 and 4 (see e.g., node 16 referenced herein as ). An additional substring contains the terms \u201cPepsi Cola Coin Bank,\u201d wherein this substring is contained in documents 0 and 3 (see e.g., node 19 referenced herein as ).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["600","601","508","601","602","510","603","600","512","604","600","515","605","511","606","514","607","502","608","503","609","504","610","600","505"]},"In some embodiments, once a trie is built, compaction occurs and base clusters are generated. A base cluster may be a set of electronic documents (e.g., online transactions) that share common phrases in their item titles, or other type of common string based data. A suffix trie is then constructed for the purpose of organizing these electronic documents so as to allow for the retrieval of relevant search results. For example, a suffix trie of a string \u201cS\u201d of words may be a compact trie containing all the suffixes of \u201cS.\u201d Specifically,\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["700","700","700","701","702","703","702","704","705","702","703","705","704","706","704","707","704","707","706","707","700","708","708","709","709","710","711","710","711"]},"In some embodiments, not only may a plurality of nodes make up a subtree, but also a singular node may make up a subtree.

This function can be illustrated as follows:\n\n","Some embodiments may include sorting the compacted trie so as to order the nodes within the trie. For example, if key phrases can be extracted from the title of an item, then the nodes can be ordered based upon these extracted terms. This order may be ascending or decending. Further, once ordering occurs, then further compaction may take place for certain nodes, and their new position may be duplicative of other nodes.","Combining Clusters","Some embodiments may include strings that are common to more than one document. There might be significant overlap in the document sets between clusters. In some cases, similar clusters are identified, and those that are similar are merged. The idea is that clusters that have document sets that significantly overlap are probably related to the same theme and hence need to be merged. For example, given two clusters qand qwith sizes |qi| and |qj|, respectively, we can say bi and bj are \u2018similar\u2019 if |qi\u2229qj|\/|bi|>\u03bc and |qi\u2229qj|\/|qj|>\u03bc, where \u03bc is a predefined threshold. Similarity between clusters can be defined as a function \u03b6(qi,qj)=1 if |qi\u2229qj|\/|qi|>\u03bc and |qi\u2229qj|\/|qj|>\u03bc, and =0, otherwise.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0061"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["900","901","902","903","713","810","904","907","904","907","904","905","906","908","712","809","910"]},"In some embodiments, bidirectional edges are used to connect the various nodes that make up this merged cluster map. In one case, the use of bidirectional edges denotes that the substrings or a combination of substrings may be searched or understood bi-directionally such that the substring \u201cOld Pepsi Cola Lighter\u201d may be held as an equivalent to \u201cLighter Cola Pepsi Old\u201d for the purposes of searching and retrieving search results such as search result . Moreover, in certain cases, an overlap value may be based upon some percentile value wherein, for example, where there is a 50% overlap in documents containing strings or substrings, then the nodes that reference these strings or substrings may be merged with other nodes containing similar (e.g., at least 50% similar) similarity. In addition to a bare overlap value, additional factors such as a relevancy weighting factor, a seller factor, a price factor, a category factor, an image factor or some other suitable factor may be used as a basis for merging clusters. Further, these clusters are built purely based on the title text and not based on any additional information available in the transaction. For example, we could use price information as an additional parameter into the clustering system, such that clusters that are closer to each other in the price range might contribute as additional factor for merging criteria.","In some embodiments, the various clusters illustrated in  can be shown as various numerical scores. For example, the clusters in  may be merged into five clusters as given below:\n\n","In some cases, the clustering search results with the standard STC algorithm do not take into account other factors that may influence the quality of clusters. Using the STC algorithm, the title text may be the only parameter for the clustering system. In some cases, however, the title information alone may not suffice for retrieving. Additional factors may need to be taken into consideration during the clustering process. For instance, one factor to be used could be the demand factor which, in one embodiment, is the relationship of items and categories to the query terms. Other factors may include the price of the items, the sellers, feedback, the categories into which the items belong, and other suitable categories. These factors may be applied at any one of the stages of filtering out noise, building an uncompacted trie (e.g., data structure), building a compacted trie (e.g., data structure), building the merged cluster map, or even after these stages.","Demand Factor","In some embodiments, the demand factor indicates what buyers search for and click on based upon the search query. This factor may, for example, be applied during the filtering of noise data. The demand factor may be computed based upon the relationships of items and categories to query terms generated via, for example, a user's actions (e.g., their selection by a user using a mouse or other input device) Further, the demand factor can play a role in improving the quality of clusters. Consider the following item listings:\n\n","Taken within the context of a search query, demand data could be explained in the following manner. Given a query q we could classify the demand data relevant to q in two ways. For example if the query q is \u201cjohnny depp\u201d the demand data could be gathered by examining contained and related queries. Contained queries may be all the demand data\/queries entered by users which have the query q contained in the queries. For example for a query \u201cjohnny depp,\u201d the contained queries can be \u201cjohnny depp dvd,\u201d \u201cjohnny depp purse,\u201d \u201cjohnny depp doll,\u201d \u201cjohnny depp shirt,\u201d and \u201cjohnny depp photo.s\u201d By contrast, related queries of query Q may be those queries entered by those users who searched for Q.

The nodes of the network may then be traversed based upon the weighted values expressed in the edges. Decision trees or bayesian networks are not the only type of AI based structure that may be employed, for other types of AI structures and algorithms may be utilized to understand the relationship between the item and\/or category and query terms.","AI structures, and the algorithms that underlie them, used to ascertain a relationship between an item and\/or category and query terms fall into one of two categories: deterministic or stochastic. Some example deterministic algorithms include case-based reasoning, the aforementioned bayesian networks (including hidden markov models), neural networks, or fuzzy systems. The bayesian networks may include: machine learning algorithms including\u2014supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, reinforcement learning, transduction, learning to learn algorithms, or some other suitable bayesian network. The neural networks may include: kohonen self-organizing network, recurrent networks, simple recurrent networks, Hopfield networks, stochastic neural networks, boltzmann machines, modular neural networks, committee of machines, Associative Neural Network (ASNN), holographic associative memory, instantaneously trained networks, spiking neural networks, dynamic neural networks, cascading neural networks, neuro-fuzzy networks, or some other suitable neural network. Example stochastic algorithms include: genetic algorithms, ant algorithms, tabu search algorithms, or monte carlo algorithms (e.g., simulated annealing). Common to these algorithms is the use of randomness (e.g., randomly generated numbers) to avoid the problem of being unduly wedded to a local minima or maxima.","Relevance-Weighting Factor","Some embodiments may include the use of a relevance-weighting factor to generate a purely statistical measure to produce a list of keywords (e.g., corresponding to a particular query) that may appear in search results. This factor may, for example, be applied just before the generation of the merged cluster map. These keywords may be words that are extremely relevant, or even totally irrelevant, to a particular query. The resulting statistical measure or score is achieved by looking at, among other things, the historical information of the query terms typed by the user, the set of results returned, and the set of results that the user actually clicked through.","For example, suppose that for the query term \u201cdell laptop\u201d the results returned included \u201cdell laptop bags,\u201d \u201cdell laptop batteries,\u201d \u201cdell laptop cases,\u201d and \u201cdell laptop d410.\u201d If most users clicked on \u201cdell laptop d410,\u201d then d410 would be more relevant and the terms bags, batteries, and cases would be less relevant. And again, if, for example, we were to search for \u201cPersian rugs,\u201d a table could be generated containing a list of words with assigned weighting:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0081"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"147pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},"Terms","Relevance Weights"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"147pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Antique","0.632"]},{"entry":[{},"Engraved","0.5"]},{"entry":[{},"Italian","0.5"]},{"entry":[{},"Knotted","1.017"]},{"entry":[{},"Rare","0.33"]},{"entry":[{},"Black","1.211"]},{"entry":[{},"10 \u00d7 3","0.5"]},{"entry":[{},"Oriental","0.5"]},{"entry":[{},"Silver","0.587"]},{"entry":[{},"Beautiful","1.5"]},{"entry":[{},"Rugs","1.741"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}},"br":{}},"Additionally, from the above table various conclusions can be drawn. First, it can be inferred that the seller uses terms like Oriental and Italian to attract buyers, but the buyer behavior states that these are less relevant to the term \u201cPersian Rugs.\u201d Moreover, words with weights closer to 2 are words that are most relevant to the query, and words with weighting lower than 1 are words that are irrelevant to the query. Here, for the purpose of simplicity, the relevance weights have been normalized to range from 0 to 2. Based on the above table, we can say that words like \u201cantique,\u201d \u201cknotted\u201d and \u201crugs\u201d are indeed relevant to the query \u201cPersian Rugs.\u201d In some embodiments, this form of weighting may be primarily used to filter out \u201cgood\u201d search results from a pool of random results.","Seller Factor","In some embodiments, a factor that takes into account the overlap of sellers between clusters may enforce the sanctity or legitimacy of the merge. The use of seller information to influence the clustering process is based upon the assumption that sellers who sell similar items tend to appear in related clusters. For instance, assume there are two base clusters in the merging phase (e.g., when base clusters are identified) with the tags \u201cipod nano 4 gb\u201d and \u201cipod nano 2 gb.\u201d Using the standard merge threshold (e.g., 0.5), these two clusters may never have been merged if it didn't satisfy the basic merge criterion. Hence, a second measure that takes into account the overlap of sellers between clusters may be needed to enforce this necessary underlying relationship. When the overlap of sellers between the two base clusters mentioned above is high (e.g., >0.5) and the two base clusters have a reasonable merge score below the threshold, we can then allow this merge which otherwise would have been declined but for the use of the seller factor.","Price Factor","Some embodiments may also use price to measure the effectiveness of a cluster. This factor may, for example, be applied just before the generation of the merged cluster map. For example, in certain cases a fixed price exists for an item offered for sale (e.g., a \u201cbuy it now\u201d price). One purpose of this fixed price is to be able to purchase an item immediately without having to go through, for example, an auctioning process. Assuming an efficient market, the \u201cbuy it now\u201d price may be a reasonable price for that item. Applied to the clustering context, assume we have a cluster that is solely related to \u201cipod nano 4 gb black.\u201d If we take all the new items within this cluster, intuitively the \u201cbuy it now\u201d prices within this cluster should not vary beyond a certain point. Therefore, by using a function of simple statistical measures like the mean, mode and variance, it may be possible to measure the cohesiveness of clusters. If, in applying one of these measures, the prices vary a little too much, this is may be an indication of a bad cluster, and the cluster may be dropped, or discarded. Likewise, if the function of the mean, mode and variance indicate that the prices within the cluster are indeed consistent, then this would be a signal of a tight cluster.","Category Factor","Example embodiments may also include a category factor, wherein the association between items in a category in a database is taken into account when generating clusters. This factor may, for example, be applied just before the generation of the merged cluster map. For example, while a seller mostly lists items under the correct category, the complexity of the category structure and the seller's own motive might preclude items from going into the correct categories. Correctness here may be understood as based upon certain norms related to the categorization of items for sale. Here a category factor could be used to mean that items belong to the same category and to indicate that the items in the cluster are homogeneous.","Image Factor","In some embodiments, items have images attached to them. Image similarity can be used as a factor for clustering. This factor may, for example, be applied just before the generation of the merged cluster map, assuming, for example, that comparing similar items visually could also be a useful factor. Specifically, the strength of a cluster (e.g., the extent to which it is homogenous) may be based upon a correspondence between the image of a query (e.g., query ) and the images of the query results as existing in clusters.","An Additional Approach to Multi-Factor Clustering","In some embodiments, an additional approach to multifactor clustering is implemented that supplements, or in some cases replaces the multi-factoring approach outlined above. This approach may be applied after, for example, a merged cluster map is built.","Demand Factor","Some embodiments may include demand data that is utilized in an additional approach to improve the relevancy of clusters extracted and prune the irrelevant clusters or phrases for the given query Q (e.g., query ). In some cases, there could be some phrases in the search results that occur frequently, but might not be very relevant to the current input query from the user. These may need to be removed or pruned, for such phrases may not be relevant to the current input query. One may, for example, compute a relevancy score for each cluster, and keep those clusters that are appropriate for the current input query.","This concept of pruning may be illustrated in the following manner. For a phrase P, several demand attributes may be used for demand factor analysis. These demand attributes are collected by aggregating activity of several users who searched for a keyword P. These activities may include:\n\n","Once the demand attribute data is collected, a relevancy score may be computed. The relevancy score of a cluster may be computed to determine how relevant the cluster is with respect to a given input query. Several factors may be utilized to compute the relevancy score of a cluster including demand attributes and category histogram match score. The relevance score of cluster may be weighted over several such factors. In some embodiments, the weights are normalized to a sum of one over all the factors involved (e.g., 1\/factors involved). New attributes can be added into the computation of relevancy score and the weights can be tuned so that appropriate relevancy can be achieved. For example, the below equation illustrates how a relevancy score might be generated where C, is the relevancy score, CHMis a category match histogram score, NBids is the number of bids, VItemCounts is the number of views, and w, w, and Wrepresent a number of weighting factors together expressed as:\n\nItemCounts\n","such that: \u03a3w=1","With regard to the CHM, this score is may be computed to measure how closely the demand category histogram of the cluster C matches the supply category histogram of the original query Q. Several histogram distance measures may be used including Euclidean and intersection measures are analyzed and can be used to compute the category histogram match score.","In some embodiments, a relevancy score may be computed for an example cluster such as is illustrated below:","Relevancy Scores for example clusters of query \u201cjohnny depp\u201d",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0076","num":"0097"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00004","num":"00004"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"98pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"98pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},"Cluster Name","Relevancy score"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"98pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"98pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"\u201cpirates of the caribbean movie","0.0129"]},{"entry":[{},"poster\u201d",{}]},{"entry":[{},"\u201cfrom hell\u201d","0.6667"]},{"entry":[{},"\u201chell\u201d","0.8154"]},{"entry":[{},"\u201cwow\u201d","0.9133"]},{"entry":[{},"\u201cedward\u201d","0.9295"]},{"entry":[{},"\u201cedward scissorhands\u201d","0.3259"]},{"entry":[{},"\u201corlando\u201d","0.9507"]},{"entry":[{},"\u201corlando bloom\u201d","0.1747"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}},"br":[{},{}],"b":"108"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0077","num":"0098"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["111","1001","1002","1003","1004","1005","1006","1012","1007","1008","1009","1010","1011"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0099"},"figref":"FIG. 11","b":["203","1101","1102","1102","1104","1103","1105","1104","1106"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0079","num":"0100"},"figref":"FIG. 12","b":["205","1201","1202","1203","1204"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0080","num":"0101"},"figref":"FIG. 13","b":["206","1301","1302","1302","1303","1304"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0081","num":"0102"},"figref":["FIG. 14","FIG. 7","FIG. 9"],"b":["204","1401","1402","1404","1405","205","1403","1406","201","1406","1403","1405","1407","1408","1408","1303","1409","206","1410","1410","1408","1407","1410","1411"]},"Cluster Exapansion","In some embodiments, the STC algorithm takes into account the order of the phrases when base clusters are formed. For example, for a base cluster \u201cipod nano\u201d only those items that have the exact phrase \u201cipod nano\u201d in the same order are included in the clustering. However, some sellers might enter the words \u201cipod,\u201d and \u201cnano\u201d in their listings, but in different order and possibly separated by other words. Penalizing these items for not in the right order would affect the recall of the algorithm. On the other hand, if we ignore the order of the words when the data is input to the algorithm, a large number of low quality clusters would be output. Some embodiments may include taking into account the order of the words illustrating an item when the initial clusters are formed. Then, however, we explore the remaining unclustered documents and check if each of them can be added to the clusters formed by not taking the order of the words into account.","Labeling Algorithm","In some embodiments, cluster labels are used to depict compact information about the type of documents present in the cluster. The labels may act as navigation criteria for the user . In one embodiment, the cluster label acts as the label of the base cluster that contains the highest number of documents. In another embodiment, the labeling of the cluster is performed using the most frequent phrases in the cluster.","In some embodiments, the actual labeling is implemented using the Cluster Tags Extraction (CLE) approach or the Best Document Extraction (CLE) approach. In the CLEapproach, an important multiple tags concepts within the cluster is applied, while in the CLEapproach, the best document (e.g., a centroid or average) that best represents the majority of the documents within the cluster is selected. As will be more fully illustrated below, the terms frequency score, density score, and document score address how to compute different term statistics used to extract cluster labels. In contrast, CLEand CLEaddress how to extract labels using these statistics.","Some embodiments may include defining the Cluster Term Frequency (CTF) of phrase p, with respect to cluster C, as the number of documents or titles that contain the phrase p. In some embodiments, we would ignore common stop words and also duplicate occurrences of the same word or phrase in any document or title. Further, a phrase p could be defined as strongly present in a cluster Cif the CTFof p is above a threshold F. The property of being strongly present is boolean (e.g., a phrase is strongly present or not). Next, we define the Term Density (TD) score of a phrase p as the number of clusters in which phrase p is strongly present.","Example embodiments may include defining a document score. Let us assume the document dof Cluster Chas a collection of m phrases P, P, . . . , Pwhich are strongly present. A Cluster Document Score (CDS) of document dm with respect to cluster Ccould be defined as: CDS=w1*m+w2* \u03a3CTF(P) k=1 . . . m, where w1 and w2 are pre-chosen weights.","In some embodiments, a CLEapproach is implemented wherein tags or phrases are extracted that represent important concepts within a cluster. Tags extracted this way may be used to navigate across the items within the cluster based on the chosen tags. Specifically, for each cluster we extract all the strongly present phrases in the cluster in which a TD score is less than a threshold term density score (Th). Thmay be defined as the NumOfClusters\/4 (e.g., we pick all the strongly present phrases in the cluster Cwhich are not present in more than Thof the clusters globally). In this way, tags are identified that most represent a cluster in a way that it is reasonably distinguished from others.","A CLEapproach may be implemented, in some embodiments, where one would like to have the single best concept within the cluster rather than multiple tags that could occur within the cluster. The single best concept could be extracted by selecting the best document that best represents the majority of the other documents within the cluster. This may be accomplished in the following manner, one could rank all the documents in the Cluster Cbased on document score (e.g., creating a CDS value), and picking the best document that has the highest document score. Next, the cluster label of Cis picked as a sequence of all the strongly present phrases in the selected best document.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0089","num":"0110"},"figref":["FIG. 15","FIG. 9"],"b":["207","1501","1502","1503","101","108"],"sup":["BD ","Tags "]},"Presenting Clustered Search Results",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0090","num":"0111"},"figref":"FIG. 16","b":["208","1601","1602","1602","108","101"]},"Evaluating the STC Algorithm and the Multi-Factor Clustering","In some embodiments, a mechanism is provided to measure and validate the clustering system. One measure that may be provided for evaluating the clustering system is to determine coverage and precision for the clustering system. For example, one goal of the clustering system is to cluster as many of the results into clusters as possible; coverage could be measured using the ratio of all those result items that belong to at least one cluster of size>1 to the total number of items in the result set. Further, in an extreme situation, one could define a single cluster with all the result documents in it to achieve coverage of 1.","Precision may be determined, in some embodiments, through approximations like cluster overlap or cluster independence. While the STC algorithm allows for overlapping clusters, its also may facilitate the creation of clusters that are fairly unique in their theme. We can say that the cluster independence measure is high when we can separate out clusters through their distinction from others. One way to achieve high cluster independence is by putting each item in a separate cluster, or by creating random buckets of clusters, each of which has independent sets of items. Since our algorithm is designed with the sincere goal of achieving clustering based upon commonality of terms and other factors, we can define a measure based upon how much clusters overlap.","For example, given clusters {C, C, . . . , C} where |C|>1 for all i, i=1 . . . n, we can say that we have good cluster separation if for any C, Cwhere i, j=1, . . . , n, if C\u2229C=\u03c6. Since we have n clusters, each pair C, Cmakes a contribution into the overall measure. The contribution made by the pair is proportional to the size of the way we define cluster separation measure \u03bc=1\u2212|C\u2229C|\/|CUC|. Since there are <n,2> combinations of pairs of the form (C, C) we give each \u03bca certain weight of contribution to the overall measure. This weight would be w=|CUC|\/|UC|. Thus, the overall cluster separation measure \u03bc is given by \u03a3\u03bcw. JJ","In some embodiments, cluster quality is an important measure. Cluster quality may be defined as follows. For each cluster, we have defined cluster tags. Cluster tags aggregated define the theme of that cluster. If the cluster tags are fairly independent of each other that indicate that the cluster quality is good. If clusters are to be fairly separate in nature, the tags defining the clusters should be fairly distinct. The overall cluster quality may be defined as 1\u2212\u03a3(|Ti\u2229Tj|\/|TiUTj|), for all i,j. If there is no overlap in tags, then cluster quality is 1. If cluster themes overlap then the tags are shared.","Some embodiments may include cluster quality as defined in terms of the category distribution of the items in a cluster. In some cases, items in a cluster may be defined in a hierarchical category structure, such that every item belongs to a leaf level category in this hierarchy. The actual category is chosen by the seller of the item. The categories themselves, however, may be pre-defined. A seller may try his\/her best to put an item in the right leaf category. However, items sometimes are wrongly listed either because the seller could not identify the right category or the seller deliberately incorrectly lists\/mislabels an item. Ignoring this factor (e.g., incorrect lists\/mislabels), if one were to look at the distribution of items within a cluster across categories, it will give one an understanding of how well the items are clustered. To do this, we would do the following. We would define the category entropy (CE) of cluster Cas\n\nlog \n\nwhere wrepresents the weight of the category k, w=d\/Ndis the number of documents present in cluster Cthat belong to category k and Nis the total number of documents in the cluster C. One could define CE across all the clusters as the weighted entropy of the individual cluster category entropies:\n\n=()\/\n\nA Three-Tier Architecture\n","In some embodiments, a method is illustrated as implemented in a distributed or non-distributed software application designed under a three-tier architecture paradigm, whereby the various components of computer code that implement this method may be categorized as belonging to one or more of these three tiers. Some embodiments may include a first tier as an interface (e.g., an interface tier) that is relatively free of application processing. Further, a second tier may be a logic tier that performs application processing in the form of logical\/mathematical manipulations of data inputted through the interface level, and communicates the results of these logical\/mathematical manipulations to the interface tier, and\/or to a backend or storage tier. These logical\/mathematical manipulations may relate to certain business rules or processes that govern the software application as a whole. A third, storage tier, may be a persistent storage medium or non-persistent storage medium. In some cases, one or more of these tiers may be collapsed into another, resulting in a two-tier architecture, or even a one-tier architecture. For example, the interface and logic tiers may be consolidated, or the logic and storage tiers may be consolidated, as in the case of a software application with an embedded database. This three-tier architecture may be implemented using one technology, or, as will be discussed below, a variety of technologies. This three-tier architecture, and the technologies through which it is implemented, may be executed on two or more computer systems organized in a server-client, peer to peer, or so some other suitable configuration. Further, these three tiers may be distributed between more than one computer system as various software components.","Component Design","Some example embodiments may include the above-illustrated tiers, and their processes or operations, as being written as one or more software components. Common to many of these components is the ability to generate, use, and manipulate data. These components, and the functionality associated with each, may be used by client, server, or peer computer systems. These various components may be implemented by a computer system on an as-needed basis. These components may be written in an object-oriented computer language such that a component oriented or object-oriented programming technique can be implemented using a Visual Component Library (VCL), Component Library for Cross Platform (CLX), Java Beans (JB), Java Enterprise Beans (EJB), Component Object Model (COM), Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM), or other suitable technique. These components may be linked to other components via various APIs, and then compiled into one complete server, client, and\/or peer software application. Further, these APIs may be able to communicate through various distributed programming protocols as distributed computing components.","Distributed Computing Components and Protocols","Some example embodiments may include remote procedure calls being used to implement one or more of the above illustrated components across a distributed programming environment as distributed computing components. For example, an interface component (e.g., an interface tier) may reside on a first computer system that is remotely located from a second computer system containing a logic component (e.g., a logic tier). These first and second computer systems may be configured in a server-client, peer-to-peer, or some other suitable configuration. These various components may be written using the above illustrated object-oriented programming techniques and can be written in the same programming language or different programming languages. Various protocols may be implemented to enable these various components to communicate regardless of the programming language used to write these components. For example, an component written in C++ may be able to communicate with another component written in the Java programming language through utilizing a distributed computing protocol such as a Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA), a Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), or some other suitable protocol. Some embodiments may include the use of one or more of these protocols with the various protocols outlined in the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model, or Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol (TCP\/IP) protocol stack model for defining the protocols used by a network to transmit data.","A System of Transmission Between a Server and Client","Some embodiments may utilize the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model, or the Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol (TCP\/IP) protocol stack model for defining the protocols used by a network to transmit data. In applying these models, a system of data transmission between a server and client, or between peer computer systems, is illustrated as a series of roughly five layers comprising: an application layer, a transport layer, a network layer, a data link layer, and a physical layer. In the case of software having a three tier architecture, the various tiers (e.g., the interface, logic, and storage tiers) reside on the application layer of the TCP\/IP protocol stack. In an example implementation using the TCP\/IP protocol stack model, data from an application residing at the application layer is loaded into the data load field of a TCP segment residing at the transport layer. This TCP segment also contains port information for a recipient software application residing remotely. This TCP segment is loaded into the data load field of an IP datagram residing at the network layer. Next, this IP datagram is loaded into a frame residing at the data link layer. This frame is then encoded at the physical layer, and the data transmitted over a network such as an internet, LAN, WAN, or some other suitable network. In some cases, internet refers to a network of networks. These networks may use a variety of protocols for the exchange of data, including the aforementioned TCP\/IP, and additionally ATM, SNA, SDI, or some other suitable protocol. These networks may be organized within a variety of topologies (e.g., a star topology) or structures.","A Computer System",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0100","num":"0121"},"figref":"FIG. 17","b":"1700"},"The example computer system  includes a processor  (e.g., a Central Processing Unit (CPU), a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) or both), a main memory  and a static memory , which communicate with each other via a bus .

While increased computing power may be one solution, another solution is to generate a more effective sorting, and search algorithm. When determining what is an effective sorting and search algorithm, one place to begin is with the data structure and the ability of that data structure to process a set of data.
