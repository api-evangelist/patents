{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)"],"p":["The present invention was made under Contract No. F33657-91-C-007 with the United States Department of Air Force. The Government of the United States of America may have rights under this contract.","The present invention relates to an improved shimable bumper system for use in a compressor variable vane system that fully traps the shim in case of lost screw preload and that has an anti-rotation feature.","The main components of a compressor variable vane system are the stator vanes, vane arms, synchronizing rings, bumpers, linkage system, and the actuator. The vane arms are used to control the incidence angle of the vanes in the compressor of gas turbine engines. The vanes are arranged as a stage set around the circumference of the compressor. The arm attaches to each vane spindle which rotates in a bearing mounted in the compressor case. The set of vanes are actuated by a circumferential synchronizing ring that rotates about the engine axis. The vane arm imparts motion from the synchronizing ring to the vane spindle. The linkage system and actuator imparts motion to the synchronizing ring. The bumper is used to control the concentricity and the deflection of the synchronizing ring throughout this motion by running at a pre-determined operating gap. Currently, thread adjustment and shimable adjustment are used to set this gap at assembly, taking into account the thermal resultant at operating temperature.","One current bumper configuration, shown in , uses thread adjustment to set the bumper gap. The configuration consists of a stud adjuster , a metallic bumper  with a bonded on composite liner, and a shear lock collar . The bumper  is anti-rotated via a matched milled feature  in the synchronizing ring . There are two technical issues with this configuration. The first is that the load path is through the threads which results in thread wear which leads to an increase in bumper gaps. The second issue is the bonding of a composite liner to a metallic bumper housing. Dis-bonding of the composite liner could occur due to loading and thermal cycling. The dis-bond of the liner also leads to an increase of bumper gaps. Increased bumper gaps decrease the synchronizing ring concentricity and increases the synchronizing ring distortion which leads to an increase in vane angle variation and loss in stall margin.","Thus, there is a need for a new bumper configuration.","Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide an improved bumper system which avoids thread wear that leads to an increase in bumper gaps.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide an improved bumper system which avoids dis-bonding of a composite liner which can lead to an increase in bumper gaps.","It is still a further object of the present invention to provide an improved bumper system which can be retrofitted onto current gas turbine engine hardware.","The foregoing objects are attained by the bumper system of the present invention.","In accordance with the present invention, a bumper system for use with a compressor variable vane system broadly comprises a synchronizing ring, a bumper, a shim for defining a gap between a bumper pad and the bumper, means for fully trapping the shim, and means for preventing rotation of the bumper relative to the synchronizing ring.","Other details of the bumper system of the present invention, as well as other objects and advantages attendant thereto, are set forth in the following detailed description and the accompanying drawings wherein like reference numerals depict like elements.","Referring now to the drawings,  illustrate a bumper system for use on a gas turbine engine in accordance with the present invention. The bumper system uses shims to set the bumper gaps. As shown in , the bumper system  includes a fastener , such as a screw or a bolt having a thread at one end, a one-piece composite bumper , a shim-lock sleeve , a dowel pin , a shim , and a threaded shear lock collar  for engaging the threaded end of the fastener . The fastener  passes through a bore  in the bumper  and through a hole  in the synchronizing ring . As can be seen from , the hole  has a diameter greater than the diameter of the fastener .","A suitable composite material for the bumper  requires low coefficient of friction (lubricity) to minimize the frictional loading in the system. The material also needs to have dimensional stability and wear resistance to maintain running gaps to minimize the vane angle error. The temperature capability and material strength (compression, torsional, and fracture toughness) must be sufficient to meet assembly and operation conditions.","As shown in , the shim  is used to set the gap  between the bumper  and a bumper pad  which is a machined feature on the high pressure compressor case. As shown in , the shim  has a slot  which allows the shim  to slide over the diameter of the fastener . Additionally, the shim  has an inner diameter greater than the diameter of the fastener .","The shim-lock sleeve  has a shoulder portion  which abuts the surface  of the synchronizing ring  and a cylindrical shaft portion  having an opening  through which the fastener  passes. The cylindrical shaft portion  has a length greater than the thickness of the synchronizing ring  so that the shaft portion  extends into the shim . The slot  has width which is less than the diameter of the cylindrical shaft portion . As a result, the shim  is fully trapped by the sleeve .","Referring now to , a dowel pin  fits into a hole  in the synchronizing ring  and a hole  in the bumper  and serves to prevent rotation of the bumper system. Because of the holes  and , the dowel pin  is fully trapped if there is a loss of screw pre-load.","After all of the elements have been positioned in the proper manner, the shear lock collar  is threaded onto the fastener  so that the shear lock collar  abuts the shoulder portion  of the shim lock sleeve .","One of the advantages to the bumper system of the present invention is that the primary load path is changed so that it goes through the synchronizing ring, not the threads, hence eliminating thread wear. The use of a one-piece composite bumper eliminates the dis-bond concern. Another advantage to the system of the present invention is that the shim remains fully trapped even if there is a loss of screw preload. Further, the shim is circular which allows symmetrical assembly and the shim lock sleeve is mistake proof during assembly. Other advantages include cost and weight reductions with respect to current systems and production benefits.","While the bumper system of  has been illustrated as having one shim, more than one shim could be used if desired.","Referring now to , an alternative bumper system \u2032 is illustrated. In this system, the synchronizing ring  is provided with a groove  and a hole . The shim  fits within the groove . As before, a fastener  and a lock collar  are used to mount a one-piece composite bumper  to the synchronizing ring . The fastener  passes through a bore  in the bumper , through the slot  in the shim , and then through the hole  in the synchronizing ring . As before, the shim  is used to provide a gap between the bumper  and a bumper pad . Also, the alternative bumper system \u2032 could use more than one shim .","To prevent rotation of the bumper  during use and to trap the shim , a pin  with a washer  is provided. The pin  is inserted into a through bore  in the synchronizing ring, into a mating engagement bore  in the shim  and then into a receiving bore  in the bumper . The pin  may be threaded at its end to engage and mate with a thread in the bore . When the pin  is engaged with the bumper , the washer  abuts against a surface of the synchronizing ring .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["38","20","20","30","82","30","32","38","52","30","84","82","38","84","30","82"]},"It is apparent that there has been provided in accordance with the present invention a shim lock\/pin anti-rotation bumper design which fully satisfies the objects, means, and advantages set forth hereinbefore.
