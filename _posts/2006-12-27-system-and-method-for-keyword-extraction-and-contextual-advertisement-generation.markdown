{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED PATENT APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","Introduction to the Keyword Extraction Engine"],"p":["This patent application claims the benefit of the filing date of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60\/804,387, filed Jun. 9, 2006, and entitled, \u201cSYSTEM AND METHOD FOR KEYWORD EXTRACTION AND CONTEXTUAL ADVERTISEMENT GENERATION\u201d, the content of which is incorporated by reference herein.","1. Technical Field","This disclosure relates to methods and systems supporting online advertising and online transactions by a user. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to keyword extraction and contextual advertisement generation.","2. Related Art","An increasingly popular way of delivering Internet advertisements is to tie the presentation of advertisements to particular user behaviors and\/or user profiles, and\/or user demographics. Such user behaviors include user access to a particular web page, user selection (also called mouse-clicking or clicking) of a particular location on a web page, user entry of a particular search string or keyword, and the like. In order to target advertising accurately, advertisers or vendors pay to have their advertisements presented in response to certain kinds of events\u2014that is, their advertisements are presented when particular user behaviors warrant such presentation. If a particular advertisement (ad) leads to some user action, an advertiser may receive remuneration for the ad.","Using other systems and processes on the Web, users can search for goods and services via the Internet and shop or make purchases of goods or services over the Internet. Unfortunately, conventional systems have not been able to create an effective way of extracting keywords from web pages and create contextual advertisements that may lead to a user purchase transaction.","Some conventional web-based merchants use affiliate programs. In an affiliate program, the merchant itself must track purchase transactions and reward 3party affiliates when purchase transactions are completed. This transaction tracking and rewarding process imposes a significant administrative burden on the merchant. Moreover, the tracking\/reward functionality must be replicated for each merchant that chooses to use such a system. Current technology does not provide a solution for off-loading this tracking\/reward functionality to a 3party without risking an increase in fraudulent transactions and a decrease in the time-efficiency of processing purchase transactions.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,948,061 discloses methods and apparatuses for targeting the delivery of advertisements over a network such as the Internet. Statistics are compiled on individual users and networks and the use of the advertisements is tracked to permit targeting of the advertisements of individual users. In response to requests from affiliated sites, an advertising server transmits to people accessing the page of a site an appropriate one of the advertisements based upon profiling of users and networks.","A computer-implemented system and method for keyword extraction and contextual advertisement generation are disclosed. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth. However, it is understood that embodiments may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known processes, structures and techniques have not been shown in detail in order not to obscure the clarity of this description.","As described further below, according to various example embodiments of the disclosed subject matter described and claimed herein, there is provided a computer-implemented system and method for keyword extraction and contextual advertisement generation. The system includes a keyword extraction engine operable to extract keywords from various sources based on user interaction with networked content. Further, the system includes a contextual advertisement generator to produce advertising or information content correlated with content with which a user is or has interacted. Various embodiments are described below in connection with the figures provided herein.","Overview of Various Embodiments","Functionality for various embodiments includes components for: 1) building the core components to analyze content and perform keyword extraction for a Host platform; 2) building the additional components to enable the Editor Kit to integrate with the keyword extraction system and provide contextual advertisements; 3) enabling contextual advertising capabilities for the Editor Kit by providing ranked and scored suggestions for: searches (keywords+category constraint), categories, products and catalog properties; 4) using the keyword extraction system in multiple system features both on and off the Host where unstructured text content is read by users.","The Host may lack the capability to analyze large volumes of unstructured text and determine if that text contains any keywords that would be of value to the user reading the text with relation to the Host. Creating this capability will enable several short-term and long-term product opportunities for on-Host product features, the Host related sites and off-Host third-party deals.","The first use case of this capability is contextual advertising with the use of the Editor Kit. This will help content oriented affiliates who publish diverse content frequently and across large numbers of pages and sites.","Basic Functionality for Various Embodiments","In various embodiments described herein, functionality is included to analyze content from any URL via HTTP; extract searches (keyword+category constraint), categories, products and catalog properties that are relevant to the content; rank the relevant results according to measures of popularity, supply and other performance measures obtained from tracking aggregate user behavior on the site; and use feedback to improve the rankings and results over time.","Use Cases","The following use cases illustrate how the keyword extractor service of an example embodiment is used in different system features.

Any invalid parameter should cause the front end to return an error code to the consumer application.","Fetch Initiation","If the URL is brand new (actually if the URL-Site ID-Category ID Hint-Algorithm-Algorithm Version combination is new; since this combination defines the primary key) then the URL needs to be fetched and analyzed. If the same URL is submitted again but any of the other parameters in the combination is different, then a new fetch and analyze is required since these parameters will influence the result. In addition, various embodiments can initiate a re-fetch of the content of a particular page based on the observed changes in the keywords extracted for that page. In this manner, the keywords extracted for a page can act as a proxy for the content of the page. Thus, as observed changes in the keywords extracted for a page occur, changes to the content of the page can be inferred and a re-fetch of the page can be automatically initiated.","URL Uniqueness","If URLs are submitted with session specific parameters embedded in the query string (i.e. session ID), then the system will treat each of these URLs as unique (even if they display essentially the same content). The system may not attempt to identify these types of URLs.","URL-Keyword Cache","This database contains the information that is generated by the Extractor Service for each URL and returns the data to the Editor Kit Server FE (Front End) when a particular URL is requested again in order to eliminate the latency associated with the fetch-and-extraction process. The cache needs to be periodically flushed (e.g. every 7 days) of URLs that have not been accessed during the previous time period in order to save space. The time period for performing the check and flushing the cache should be made configurable. The cache needs to be extensible enough to hold different result data types in the future (i.e. Listings, Reviews, Guides, Kijiji postings) or the system should be able to support multiple types of caches, depending on the use case. The cache should support all languages, including double-byte ones.","URL Database","This component contains queues for unfetched and fetched URLs as well as associated metadata for those URLs.","Fetch\/Extract Consumer","The Fetch\/Extract Consumer component is responsible for consuming URL.FETCH events via BES. For each event consumed the component will fetch the HTML content and any associated external CSS files from the target URL. Once the HTML and CSS have been fetched from a URL, the information is passed to the Extractor Service for processing.","Pages Fetched","The fetcher will save content on only single pages identified by the URL in the URL.FETCH BES event. The fetcher will not identify additional URLs (i.e. links) on the page in order to crawl deeper into the site.","Page Re-Fetch","Any URL submitted needs to be periodically re-fetched (unless the re-fetch time was set to zero) in order to determine if the content on the page has changed and caused a different set of keywords to be created. Each page has an optimal re-fetch time that is algorithmically determined by the system. The goal is to refresh the cache contents at or near the same frequency as the URLs publishing frequency.","There are two methods for initiating a page re-fetch: batch job and impression triggered.","Batch Job","The traditional method of determining whether to re-fetch a page would be to schedule a periodic batch job that would check the re-fetch times on all URLs to determine if any of them had expired. Those URLs whose re-fetch times had expired would be queued up for fetching and re-analysis.","Impression Triggered","Instead of having a batch job periodically examine all URLs for those whose re-fetch times have expired, the alternative is to examine re-fetch times of those URLs that are requested as a result of an impression event. If a URL is served and its re-fetch time has expired or is close to expiring (i.e. within 30 minutes, configurable without a train roll) then an event to re-fetch and analyze the URL is published.","Content Fetched","All page source content should be fetched, this includes everything unless there is a specific exception noted in the following table.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0076","num":"0075"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00004","num":"00004"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"161pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Content Type","What to do with it"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Scripts","The Fetcher should not execute any scripting"]},{"entry":[{},"commands on the page, but the script code should be"]},{"entry":[{},"saved along with everything else in the page source"]},{"entry":[{},"content.

The purpose of calculating the re-fetch interval is to determine the optimal frequency at which a URL changes or updates its content, on average, so that the results that are cached for the URL are as up-to-date as possible. The system should continuously monitor and adjust as the publishing patterns of the URL change. To start with, all URLs receive a default re-fetch interval (i.e. 24 hours). In order to determine if a URL's content has changed a fingerprint needs to be generated for each extract and analysis. In this case, the fingerprint will be generated from the top n Searches (keyword and category) for a given URL. To determine if a fingerprint has changed a set comparison needs to be made between the Searches in the previous fingerprint and the current one. If any of the individual Searches has changed (keyword or category) or the sets have a different number of Searches in them then the fingerprint has changed; ranking or scores are not relevant. If the sets are equivalent then the fingerprints and therefore the URL contents can be considered the same. Based on changes in a URL's fingerprint the following decisions need to be made: 1) whether to increase, decrease or not change the re-fetch interval; and 2) how much to increase\/decrease the re-fetch interval.

The dataset should be easily extended to hold new types of data (i.e. Listings, Reviews, Guides, Kijiji postings). Each data type should have its own section in the data. Each section should its results sorted by rank in ascending order.","No Results Default","No results can occur in two situations:\n\n","In either situation when no results can be extracted or returned for the given URL (i.e. not enough content or content that does not overlap well with the Host community) then a default set of results should be provided. The default results will be the top n ranked keywords within one or more categories. If no category hints were provided, then the category root will be used. In situation #2, when no keywords can be extracted from the content, the system should remember this so that the page is not re-fetched and a useless extraction performed each time the URL gets an impression.","HTML-to-Text Parsing","This requirement is for taking the raw HTML and CSS, if it exists, and generate clean text for easier processing by the Keyword Extractor\/Ranker SIBE service. The parsing will also analyze the content and provide weightings for certain pieces of text that it thinks are more important. These weightings will influence the final weighting of the keywords.","Extracting Text","The main goal of the parser is to extract the content and remove all the extraneous elements that are needed to format a page. In general all tags for structural and formatting should be removed, unless specifically mentioned in the table below, and all the content in the body of the document should be kept. Note that some of the tags and CSS directives will be used to generate weightings to influence keyword ranking. Additionally, meta information tags can be used to determine keywords and context of a page.","Content Indicator Tags","The page being parsed may implement content indicator tags. These are the Host proprietary tags that indicate which ranges of text are actual content (as opposed to UI (user interface) navigation elements). These will allow better accuracy on pages that contain a lot of irrelevant content on the pages. The tags are optional and may not be embedded in all of the pages that the system fetches. A page may have multiple pairs of content indicator tags embedded in it. If the one or more pairs of content indicator tags are present, then only the text in those sections should be parsed. Any content outside of those tags will be thrown away, unless there are no tags present at all\u2014then the entire page should be analyzed. The content indicator tags should not be nested or overlapping in any manner. The content indicator tags should be easily parsed and should not cause the page they are embedded in to render differently. Possible implementations are using a DIV tag with a custom class or using a comment tag with a specific string. Comments are probably preferred because they will not cause browsers to place a line break before and after the DIV element.","Weighting Scheme","The weighting scheme will apply a set of rules that are based on the formatting and metadata of a page. The rules will assign a weighting to the areas of text and metadata that meet the requirements of a rule. Text that does not meet any of the rules will be classified as neutral weight (zero). Note that this does not mean that neutral weighted text has zero weighting. Adding new rules and changing weightings for existing rules should be easily configured without a train roll. The weighting of the text should not destroy any of the context in the document (i.e. phrases should not be broken up). This is because formatting boundaries are not guaranteed to coincide with token boundaries; therefore weighting chunks of text should not create artificial token boundaries. There will be only one set of weighting rules for all sites (having per-site rules is too much of a maintenance problem).","Rules can apply to various elements on a page but will mostly apply to meta tags, HTML tags and CSS rules.","Weighting Rules Per Site\/Language","The ability to configure a different set of rules for different languages or groups of sites should be supported by the system. Different languages use different text sizes, but that doesn't mean words in one language are more important than words in another language. For instance, compared to English words, Chinese words must use a larger text size to be readable. Since other languages will be sized differently due to character set differences, the default weightings may produce undesired results.","Text Scrubbing","The text should be pre-processed in order to normalize all variations and put the text into a consistent format. Some scrubbing procedures may not apply to all languages. The scrubbing process should be identical to the one used for scrubbing queries on the site in order to ensure that both processes are generating the same output.","Text-to-Keyword Extractor\/Ranker","The Text-to-Keyword Extractor\/Ranker component consumes the output (derived from the actual content) of the HTML-to-Text Parser and analyzes it with the aid of the data in the Keyword Store. The output is a set of assets that is contextually related to the analysis and metadata for each asset. An asset represents anything that could be surfaced to the user reading the original content. This document will only focus on specific assets that exist on the Host (.com and country sites) but the system should be designed to be extensible enough so that other assets could be added, whether from the Host (i.e. Reviews and Guides) or come from affiliated sites such Kijiji (i.e. postings).","Spell-Check, Stemming and Transliteration","All of the tokens should be run through three operations: spell-check, stemming and transliteration. Each token should be spell-checked and replaced with the top spell-check suggestion if there is an error in the original token. Perform stemming and transliteration on all the tokens in order to normalize them. After these three processes are performed on the tokens then the metrics should be combined according to pre-defined rules.","Combine Metrics","After spell-check and stemming operations, tokens that are identical should be combined into one metric along with their associated metrics. All the metrics should be added together.","Relevance Ranking","The general framework of the ranking system in an example embodiment is to use multiple inputs in the form of histograms and combine the data from the histograms in an equation that will produce a numerical value for each token. The framework should be flexible enough to add additional algorithms in the future and also change the equation that combines the data from the histograms into producing a numerical value for each token. This is needed to support A\/B testing of different algorithms.","New algorithms can be created either by: 1) configuring the weightings of various histogram inputs into an existing algorithm. This should be done by without requiring a new train roll. Different weightings for the same basic algorithm should be available simultaneously for A\/B testing; or 2) creating a brand new algorithm that computes the ranking in a brand new manner. This can be done with a new train roll.","In an example embodiment, rankings will be produced for the following: Searches (keyword+category constraints) and Categories. The ranking system should be extensible to allow the addition of other types of rankings (i.e. reviews, guides, Kijiji postings, etc.).","Detailed Keyword Ranking Algorithm","Ranking keywords will use both relevance data and financial data to rank each [keyword+category]. Both sets of information may be combined in order to create a single value for each [keyword+category] that indicates the relative value of the [keyword+category] compared to the other [keyword+category] items in the same result set.","The overall keyword ranking process in an example embodiment is illustrated in  and explained as follows:\n\n","The step of categorization and tokenization of the content is based on site-wide supply and demand data as well as URL specific data all of which are processed by the pseudocode set forth below. Note that site-wide bid\/BIN data will not be used in this step.","Keyword Scoring Step 2","Each [keyword+category] will have a relevance score computed for it as part of the categorization and tokenization step.","Keyword Scoring Step 3","The relevance score for each [keyword+category] is transformed into a probability score based on the relative difference between [keyword+category] elements for the page.","Keyword Scoring Step 4","Given a set [keyword+category] items from the relevance scoring steps, the system should use the combination of \u201cHost ID\u00d7URL\u00d7[keyword+category]\u201d to look up the historical financial performance of that combination (recency-weighted average of bid, BIN and registration activity). If the historical financial performance is not available then an estimate should be used by looking up the alternate aggregate financial information for the keyword. The financial score will be in the currency of the Site ID used and represent the expected value of bid\/BIN and registration activity created per one thousand impressions of a given \u201csite ID\u00d7URL\u00d7[keyword+category]\u201d combination.","Keyword Scoring Step 5","The expected financial value for each [keyword+category] is transformed into a probability similar to relevance probability in step 3, where the expected value of the [keyword+category] combination is considered in relation to the combined expected value of all the other [keyword+category] combinations for the page.","Keyword Scoring Step 6","The relevance probability and financial probability for each [keyword+category] item are mathematically combined to produce a single probability score for each [keyword+category] item.","Once the single probability score is calculated for each of the [keyword+category] items in the set, the results can be stored in the URL to keyword cache for a front-end application to access.","Keyword Store","The Keyword Store, contains the various histograms that act as inputs to the ranking algorithm. Each country site on the Host should have its own set of histogram data to provide accurate results for content-driven ads that will be driving users to that specific site. This component should also be made extensible so we can add sets of metrics from additional platforms to the system (i.e. Rent.com or Kijiji sites) when we extend keyword extraction to those platforms and suggest assets from those systems. Different platforms will likely have different sets of histograms. The histograms in this section are those that will specifically run the keyword extractor system for the Host platform. The data for the following histograms do not necessarily need to be implemented as separate data structures. They are separated logically in the diagram for clarity. The histogram data should be refreshed on a regular basis in order to accurately track trends and provide accurate recommendations.","Demand Histogram\u2014Query Frequency","This histogram will associate with each search query the frequency with which users clicked through to a view item page on a per category basis.  illustrates a graph showing association of category ID to query term in an example embodiment. For each listing that a user views after a search, the category ID of the listing is associated with query term and the count of view item actions for that particular query term-category ID combination is incremented by 1. If a user views multiple listings after a search (i.e. repeatedly clicking back in their browser and clicking on different listings in the search results), then all of those actions should be counted. View item counts at child categories should be aggregated up the category tree to parent categories.","Supply Histogram\u2014Supply Frequency","This histogram will associate with each keyword (i.e. search query) the number of listings available on the site on a per category basis. This histogram should be built by determining the number of listings (all formats) whose listing title and description match the given keyword available across all categories (i.e. execute a search). This data should be broken out on a per category basis and the number of listings at child categories should be aggregated up the category tree to parent categories.","Site Bid Histogram","This histogram will associate with each keyword the frequency with which users bid or BIN on listings related to those keywords on a per category basis.  illustrates a graph showing association of bid amounts to query term. For each listing that a user bids on after performing a search then the category ID of the listing, as well as the bid amounts (absolute and differential), are associated with the query term and the count of bid actions for that particular query term-category ID combination is incremented by 1. The event should be tracked regardless of how it was generated (i.e. manual bid or proxy bid). Bid counts and amounts at child categories should be aggregated up the category tree to parent categories.","Site BIN Histogram","This histogram will associate with each keyword the frequency with which users BIN-through on those keywords on a per category basis.  illustrates a graph showing association of BIN amount to query term. For each listing that a user BINs on after performing a search then the category ID of the listing, as well as the BIN amount (absolute), are associated with the query term and the count of BIN actions for that particular query term-category ID combination is incremented by 1. BIN counts and amounts at child categories should be aggregated up the category tree to parent categories.","Site Product Reference ID Histogram","This histogram will associate with each keyword the frequency with which users clickthrough to an item which is associated with specific product on a per category basis.  illustrates a graph showing association of product reference ID to query term. For each listing that a user views after a search, the product reference ID of the listing, if available, is associated with query term and the count of view item actions for that particular query term-product ID combination is incremented by 1. If a user views multiple listings after a search (i.e. repeatedly clicking back in their browser and clicking on different listings in the search results) then all of those actions are counted, if a product reference ID is available. If no product reference ID is associated with the listing then no event is registered and not stored in the histogram. Product reference ID counts at child categories should be aggregated up the category tree to parent categories. Only the top n products within each category need to be stored. The rest of the data accumulated by the query index does not need to be held in the Keyword Store since, for Keyword Extractor purposes, we will only be interested in suggesting the top few products associated with a keyword and\/or the products that show the greatest acceleration in search to view item clicks.","Editor Kit CTR Histogram","Based on the total number of impressions and clickthrough events, the clickthrough rate (CTR) can be calculated for any asset that is made available in ads via the Contextual Editor Kit. By tracking the clickthrough rate (CTR) for Contextual Editor Kit ad placements, the system can be influenced to rank assets with better CTRs higher and produce better results.

The calculation needs to be statistically significant, so an adequate number of impressions need to be shown to reach a desired confidence interval.","Keyword Store Builder","This component will periodically update the histograms stored in the Keyword Store from various data sources. The Keyword Store should be refreshed on a regular basis.","Blacklist","A blacklist should be used to filter keywords, based on precise match, prior to the keywords entering the Keyword Store. This will prevent these keywords from being recommended (assuming the Keyword Store gets rebuilt and not incrementally updated). There will be an additional blacklist check in the Editor Kit Server Front-End in order to catch keywords that are added to the blacklist between refreshes of the Keyword Store.","Query Index","The query index will use data generated by various embodiments to find queries entered by users searching on the Host and aggregate metrics about the user's actions after they obtain their search results and associate those aggregate metrics to the query terms. The user's search and related activity must all occur within the same user session. The query index should support all languages used by on-platform sites. The index should be refreshed periodically (i.e. ideally daily refresh, minimum weekly refresh) in order to accurately track changes in aggregate user actions.","Metric Sources","The system will be extensible to incorporate additional sources of data to be used in the keyword extracting and ranking algorithms.","Keyword Data Mart Metrics","Additional data will be sourced from the Keyword Data Mart (KWDM). The metrics will be used in the token scoring algorithm to influence the final ranking of keywords towards those keywords that are expected to generate more revenue.

The first class is feedback events. These events will allow the system to improve its performance, over time, by incorporating actual user activity into the system. The second class is performance tracking events. These are for internal reporting purposes in order to evaluate the system's performance. The tracking system should be extensible enough to add different events for different use cases or to track new performance measures in the future. The feedback events will be aggregated on a regular basis by a batch job in order for easier consumption by the Keyword Store Builder. The events should be tracked only for users that are shown an impression and clickthrough on one of those impressions and navigate the site. Events should be tracked at 100%.

The batch job should aggregate data on a weekly basis. For the feedback data at the Editor Kit level, the primary purpose is to separate the data out at a keyword-URL level so when the aggregated data is folded back into the ranking algorithm that keywords on URLs that have higher clickthrough rates or higher onsite activity will have those keywords rank higher as time progresses. When ranking keywords for a given URL, if specific {URL|Page|Domain} level aggregated feedback data exists, then this should be used in the ranking algorithm to refine the final ranking of the keyword. The feedback data should only be used if a statistically adequate number of data points (i.e. impressions) for the given keyword-{URL|Page|Domain} had been received. This should be set to 100 data points initially and be made configurable without a train roll. Otherwise the ranking algorithm should simply leverage the existing site-wide tracking data for the keyword.","Aggregated Tracking Data","The feedback data should be aggregated according to the dimensions described herein. Each week of aggregate data should be maintained so that historical trends can be taken into account during the ranking of tokens.","Data Extract Keyword Data Mart","The aggregated keyword level data should be made easily accessible. It may be advantageous to pull the entire dataset on occasion to analyze the data for various correlations to paid search performance.","Keyword Extractor and Related Searches","Feature Overview","Keyword Extractor (KE) currently suggests keyword+category combinations only if the keyword appears on a page that it processes. KE cannot suggest keywords that do not appear on the page even if they are highly relevant to the context of the page. By leveraging the existing data that powers the Related Searches feature on a particular host, KE can gain the capability to suggest new and relevant keywords that do not appear in the original content of a page.","The current Related Searches feature works by aggregating data about consecutive searches performed by users. This data allows the website to know that users who search for, say \u201charry potter\u201d, are also likely to search for \u201charry potter wand\u201d and \u201charry potter dvd\u201d afterwards. These follow-on searches are automatically suggested whenever a person types in a search on a particular host.","KE combines Related Searches data with the keyword data extracted from a page. This could be done in a variety of circumstances, such as when page content is sparse, the page content is of the type that does not yield an adequate number of keyword matches or when related searches may yield better relevance or have a higher expected return.","For instance, the top ranked keyword+category combination extracted from a page would be used to look up all the related searches for it. Then the related searches returned would be scored according to their relevance and expected return (although, since the related searches do not appear on the page they will not have any context data which will need to be compensated for during scoring; this could involved the use of Related Searches clickthrough rate data). The keyword+category combinations and related searches can then be combined and rank ordered as usual. The combined data can then be passed to various applications for use, such as AdContext.","All standard tracking (impression, click and post-click activity) may be monitored for keywords that are surfaced through Related Searches data so that their performance is optimized over time.","Introduction to the Contextual Advertisement Generator","Definitions",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0152","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0005","list-style":"none"},"li":["Affiliate\u2014a person or company who drives traffic to the Host via advertising placements.

The process to perform this assignment does so with a probabilistic selection process. Each [keyword+category] combination has a value assigned to it. This value indicates the probability that this keyword can be selected for a given ad slot. For each ad slot, starting with the first slot, a game must be played to determine which [keyword+category] from the entire set will win the ad slot. Once a [keyword+category] combination wins a slot, it is removed from consideration, for the current instance of the ad, and the game is played for the next slot and the remaining [keyword+category] combinations left in the set. To play the game, normalize the entire set of [keyword+category] values and assign each on a range from zero to one proportional to their value. [keyword+category] values that are relatively higher than other values in the set will be assigned a larger range. Then randomly generate a number from zero to one; the random number generator should have an even distribution. The random number will fall into the range of one of the [keyword+category] combinations and indicates that it has won the game for the specific ad slot. The winning [keyword+category] combination should be removed from gameplay and then the range assignments should be re-calculated for the next ad slot based on the remaining [keyword+category] combinations. The game should be played until all the ad slots are filled or all the [keyword+category] combinations are used. Note that each time an ad is played the game should be played, which may result in a different keyword-to-slot assignment each time.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0183","num":"0250"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00018","num":"00018"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"133pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":"R","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"msub":{"mi":["KW","n"]}}},"mo":"=","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mi":"V","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"msub":{"mi":["KW","n"]}}},{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"i","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"k"},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":{"mi":"V","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"msub":{"mi":["KW","i"]}}}}]}}}}},"R(KW) is the range of the n[keyword + category] V(KW) is the value of the ncached [key- word + category]"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0184","num":"0251"},"figref":"FIGS. 14-17"},"Editor Kit Ads","This section describes the formats, colors, sizes and components of the EK ads in an example embodiment.","Ad Formats","In an example embodiment, there are three types of EK ads as follows:\n\n","The graphic and text ads incorporate the following content in an example embodiment.\n\n","Graphic and text ads are available with a fixed color scheme as pictured in  in an example embodiment.","Graphic and text ads are also available as customizable ads.

Various embodiments will further enhance the ad as follows.\n\n","Host AdContext may only display content from the site ID of the Host site in which the ad was created. The ad may not take into account the site ID of the user who is viewing the ad. For example, if a German user views an American website, the Host AdContext should display a DE intems and links.","Primary Requirements:","The location of a user viewing a Host AdContext advertisement generator (eAC) created advertisement should be identified and used to generate more targeted content.\n\n","Geo-targeting should be added to the Advanced Options section of the Create flow. Multiple site IDs can be supported for geo-targeting. The default site ID will be set to the site ID of the create flow (e.g. US create flow will have a default of 0). The default should be configurable by the Affiliate. Geo-targeting must be explicitly enabled by the Affiliate. Tracking geo-targeted impressions, clicks, conversion metrics, etc. should also be captured by site ID and by tracking provider.","Keyword Extractor Requirements:","The KE should use the viewer's location to determine which site ID to use for generating keyword\/category recommendations. For example, if a viewer is identified as being in France, the Keyword Extractor will use Host.fr's supply, demand and conversion data to determine the most relevant keywords. The first time a viewer from a new site ID visits the Affiliate page, top keywords from the new site ID are returned. The Affiliate page for the new site ID is added to the queue to be scanned for keywords. This is how the KE currently functions when a user visits an Affiliate URL for the first time. Geo-targeting is only turned on for site IDs that have been set up by the Affiliate in the Create flow.","Affiliates can create ads featuring products with the Product Kit (non-contextual). This feature will add product data to the Host AdContext.","There should be different levels of how product data is displayed in the ads.

A site product Reference ID histogram will associate with each keyword the frequency with which users clickthrough to an item which is associated with specific product on a per category basis.  illustrates a graph showing association of product reference ID to query term in an example embodiment. For each listing that a user views after a search, the product reference ID of the listing, if available, is associated with query term and the count of view item actions for that particular query term-product ID combination is incremented by 1. If a user views multiple listings after a search (i.e. repeatedly clicking back in their browser and clicking on different listings in the search results) then all of those actions are counted, if a product reference ID is available. If no product reference ID is associated with the listing then no event is registered and not stored in the histogram. Product reference ID counts at child categories should be aggregated up the category tree to parent categories. Note that the category ID may not be required, pending further investigation by ERL. Only the top n products (n=5, configurable parameter) within each category need to be stored. The rest of the data accumulated by the query index does not need to be held in the Keyword Store since, for Keyword Extractor purposes, we will only be interested in suggesting the top few products associated with a keyword.","Hybrid KW Model","The Host AdContext may only allow an Affiliate to choose either Keyword Extractor recommendations or a static list of keywords provided by the Affiliate. This feature will allow a hybrid of both sources to drive ad content.","An Affiliate can use the automated Keyword Extractor to drive content, in addition to providing keywords. These keywords can be used in the following ways.\n\n","If two or more eAC units are on the same webpage, all could potentially show the same ad content. The system can detect if multiple eAC units are displaying on one page. The system can ensure that the items displayed across multiple ads are not duplicated. The system can allow the user to differentiate between different placements, either on the same page or on different pages in their reporting.","Express\/Magellan Integration","There are two methods of adding Express links to eAC. The Express Front-end feature only affects the items and URLs that are displayed in eAC.

Computer system  further comprises a random access memory (RAM) or other dynamic storage device  (commonly referred to as main memory), coupled to bus  for storing information and instructions to be executed by processor . Main memory  also may be used for storing temporary variables or other intermediate information during execution of instructions by processor . Computer system  also comprises a read only memory (ROM) and\/or other static storage device  coupled to bus  for storing static information and instructions for processor .","An optional data storage device  such as a magnetic disk or optical disk and its corresponding drive may also be coupled to computer system  for storing information and instructions. Computer system  can also be coupled via bus  to a display device , such as a cathode ray tube (CRT) or a liquid crystal display (LCD), for displaying information to a computer user. For example, image, textual, video, or graphical depictions of information may be presented to the user on display device . Typically, an alphanumeric input device , including alphanumeric and other keys is coupled to bus  for communicating information and\/or command selections to processor . Another type of user input device is cursor control device , such as a conventional mouse, trackball, or other type of cursor direction keys for communicating direction information and command selection to processor  and for controlling cursor movement on display .","Alternatively, the client  can be implemented as a network computer or thin client device. Client  may also be a laptop or palm-top computing device, such as the Palm Pilot\u2122. Client  could also be implemented in a robust cellular telephone, where such devices are currently being used with Internet micro-browsers. Such a network computer or thin client device does not necessarily include all of the devices and features of the above-described exemplary computer system; however, the functionality of an example embodiment or a subset thereof may nevertheless be implemented with such devices.","A communication device  is also coupled to bus  for accessing remote computers or servers, such as web server , or other servers via the Internet, for example. The communication device  may include a modem, a network interface card, or other well-known interface devices, such as those used for interfacing with Ethernet, Token-ring, or other types of networks. In any event, in this manner, the computer system  may be coupled to a number of servers  via a conventional network infrastructure such as the infrastructure illustrated in  and described above.","The system of an example embodiment includes software, information processing hardware, and various processing steps, which will be described below.
