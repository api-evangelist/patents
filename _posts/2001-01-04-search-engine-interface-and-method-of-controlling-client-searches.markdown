title: Search engine interface and method of controlling client searches
abstract: A method for controlling access provided to content files during an information search initiated by a client device and performed by a search engine. The method includes receiving a search request from the client. A modified search request is generated by applying a search profile for the user of the client device to the received search request. The modified search request is then routed to the search engine to apply search criteria in the modified search request to search engine collections populated from the content files. The user's search profile includes restrictions defining which of the search engine collections can be searched and how such collections can be searched. The search profile may be generated at the time the search request is received based on login information for the user of the client and based on stored user profile or account information. According to this method, the client is not provided direct access to the search engine and is particularly useful in client-server environments, such as clients with browsers linked to the Internet that search networked devices for information.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention.","The present invention relates, generally, to search engines and search engine interface tools and methods, and, more particularly, to a system, method, and architecture for providing in the client-server environment of the Internet an interface between a client and a search engine to control the search process to selectively and restrictively provide the client and search engine with access to data files or content.","2. Relevant Background.","A significant and growing problem is the controlling or restricting of access to content provided on the Internet. One of the most prevalent uses of the Internet, e.g., the World Wide Web portion of the Internet, is searching for and quickly browsing information. Generally, an individual or user performs a search by using a client node (such as a personal computer, wireless device, and the like) with a browser application to link and communicate with content providers over the Internet. The user generally enters a search request that specifies their search criteria, such as by typing in search terms with Boolean logic or other symbols including \u201cand,\u201d \u201cor,\u201d \u201cnot,\u201d and the like, and a search engine then performs the search for the user. The search engine often includes a front end application or interface for receiving the search request and processing the search results into an expected or useful form including appropriate format and meeting communication protocols (e.g., HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)). Each interface is configured or adapted for communicating with only one of the many search engines, such as Ultraseek\u2122, Webcrawler\u2122, Excite\u2122, Alta Vista\u2122, and the like, and consequently, such interfaces are tied to a specific search engine and are not useful with more than one search engine.","Search engines are software applications or programs that return a list of Web sites or pages (or the Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) for those sites or pages) that match the criteria in the user's search request. The user can then select from the results in the list to hotlink to a particular Web site. Search engines typically maintain in separate storage or memory only a small subset of the content providers' information to quicken searching. In this regard, search engines first perform a process called spidering, indexing, or populating in which the search engine directly accesses the content providers' content files or databases, gathers and stores linking and summary information for searching and including in the results list, and indexes or tags the stored information into collections for later searching. Typically, the search engine has direct and complete access to all of the information in the content providers' files that are designated for viewing by one or more of the providers' customers. Because the search engine controls the information it collects from the content provider, the search engine also controls what information is provided to the user. Generally, once access is granted to a search engine, the user is allowed to freely search the entire contents of the search engine's collections, which corresponds to searching all of the information provided by the content provider.","However, there are many situations for which a content provider does not want searchers to have unlimited access to all of their content. For example, an online education service provider may offer numerous courses and have information for these courses stored in content files, but each student typically will only be registered for and have paid for a few of the courses. In this case, the education service provider only wants the student to be able to access information pertaining to the courses for which they have registered, not to all course content. Similarly, an entertainment service provider may offer many types of entertainment (such as audio, video, pictures, and the like) but would want to restrict a searcher to the information covered by their subscription. Another example includes content that is categorized into differing levels of security, e.g., public information, minimal security information, and high-level security information. In this case, the content provider may wish to allow any searcher to access the public information but place restrictions on access to the other types of information. Existing Web servers and search engines generally do not function to restrict a searcher's access to content based on the searcher's information (e.g., paid enrollment, paid subscription, security clearances, and the like). Instead, access to content is provided on an all or nothing basis.","Some content providers try to limit access by requiring users or searchers to successfully initiate a login session prior to searching content. For example, the host, e.g., a Web server, may execute a login procedure that matches the client (i.e., the searcher) and their identification information with an access control list. For example, students registered for an online class may be placed on an access control list for access as a student to a host Web server. However, once access is granted to the Web server, the searcher, e.g., the student, typically has access to all of the content serviced by the Web server and its associated search engine. Separate host servers, login sessions, and content databases can be provided to limit access, but this is often expensive and creates maintenance problems.","Accordingly, there remains a need for methods and systems for providing, on a selective and restrictive basis, access to a client or searcher to the content or information provided by content providers, e.g., direct access to the content is preferably blocked. Preferably, such a method or system would not be tied or locked to a single type of search engine or server configuration. Additionally, it is preferable that searchers be selectively provided access to content while still being allowed to perform searches in the manner they are accustomed, such as performing free form searches and the like, without knowledge of the restrictions (i.e., the search request is entered as in unrestricted search systems and the results appear unrestricted to the searcher).","The present invention addresses the above and other problems by providing an Internet-based search control system with a search engine interface that functions as a restrictive or protective layer between a search engine and the client or searching party. In a preferred embodiment, the search engine interface restricts access at the programmatic level, not merely at a user interface level, by limiting the client's access when the client initiates the search. Briefly, the search engine interface receives a search request, creates or retrieves a profile for the client, and modifies the search request with the profile to limit the client's search access. The modified search request is then passed by the interface to the search engine, which performs a search of its collections with the modified search request and returns the results to the search engine interface. The search engine interface parses the results to place the results in proper form for return to the client and may also modify the results to further limit what information is returned to the client. The search engine interface may provide another level of access control by initially controlling the populating or indexing of the search engine's collections by requiring that index requests and the indexing results be passed through the interface (i.e., the search engine is not provided direct access to the content files as is generally the case with search engine systems).","According to one aspect of the invention, the present invention provides a method for controlling access to content files during an information search initiated by a client device and performed by a search engine. The method includes receiving a search request from the client. A modified search request is then generated by applying a search profile for the user of the client device to the received search request. The modified search request is then routed to the search engine to apply search criteria in the modified search request to search engine collections populated from the content files. Significantly, the user's search profile includes restrictions (such as which courses a student is registered for) that define which of the search engine collections can be searched (such as only the collections pertaining to the registered courses). In one preferred embodiment, the search profile is generated at the time the search request is received based on login information for the user of the client and\/or based on stored user profile or account information. According to this method, the client is not provided direct access to the search engine.","According to another aspect of the invention, a method is provided for restricting direct access to content files by a search engine and by a client during an information search initiated by the client and performed by the search engine. The method begins with positioning a search engine interface between the client and the search engine. The search engine interface is also positioned between the search engine and the content files. The method continues with receiving with the search engine interface an indexing request from the search engine for a set of information from the content files to populate search engine collections. The search engine interface operates to retrieve the requested set of information and then to modify the retrieved information (such as by removing metatags or adorning the information with additional information).","The modified set of information is then passed to the search engine for creating or populating the search engine collections used by the search engine during searches. The method continues with receiving at the search engine interface a search request from the client and then passing the search request to the search engine, which applies criteria in the search request to the search engine collections. To further limit access, the search engine interface may modify the received search request based on a client search profile, thereby defining select ones of the collections for use during the search by the search engine.","The present invention is directed to an Internet-based search control system including a search engine interface for controlling client searches of a content provider's data or files. Generally, the search engine interface provides access control by functioning as a restrictive layer between the searching client and a search engine with its data collections. In this regard, the search engine interface controls the content of the search engine collections and also modifies the search request prior to passing it to the search engine to control which of the data collections maintained by the search engine the searcher can access. In this manner, direct access to the content is restricted for the searching client and for the search engine.","The invention is described mainly in terms of client-server communications on the Internet, including communications between a host Web server (e.g. an HTTP Web server or applications server) and a search engine, such as Ultraseek\u2122, Webcrawler\u2122, Excite\u2122, Alta Vista\u2122, and the like. Additionally, the Web server is described as supporting the Java\u2122 programming language and, particularly, the Java\u2122 Servlet API, with one embodiment of the search engine interface comprising a Java\u2122 API (Application Programming Interface). While providing an easily described and understood working example of the invention, this specific example is not intended as a limitation. As will be recognized by those skilled in the computer arts, the invention is readily extendable to more general applications in which a client is attempting to access content stored and served by a computer device utilizing a search engine. Accordingly, such general applications of the invention are considered to be within the breadth of the following description.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","104","110","120","104","110","100","104","110","108","114","104","110","120","110","118","110","118","110"]},"In operation, searchers operate the browsers ,  to search for information stored on or served by devices, such as server , linked with the Internet . Preferably, the search requests are free format searches in which the searcher is allowed to search for documents that contain one or more words or phrases, such as all documents that include \u201capplet\u201d or \u201cservlet\u201d for a an online Java\u2122 student. The search requests generally comply with or use HTTP or other protocol to make search requests for documents and to view search result lists (e.g., hyperlinks to HyperText Markup Language (HTML) and other mark up language documents and titles and summaries for the located documents). The browsers ,  are also useful for responding to requests from contacted devices for additional information, including login identification information and the like.","The search control system  includes a server  (e.g., an HTTP Web server or applications server configured for, but not limited to, supporting Java\u2122 including servlets and Java\u2122 API) for communicating with the Internet  to receive search requests and return search results to the clients , . As illustrated, the Web server  includes a Web server application  for receiving search requests and routing the search requests to the search engine interface . The server  also includes a page generator  for dynamically generating a results page (e.g., an HTML or other mark up language document) including the search results for transmittal to the clients , .","The search engine interface  is a significant feature of the search control system . The search engine interface  functions as the restrictive layer between clients ,  and the search engine . Additionally, the search engine interface  blocks direct access by the clients ,  and the search engine  to the content files . The content files  include the content provided by a content provider (not shown) that is serviced by the server  (and although shown as one, independent device, the content files  may be stored in numerous varieties of data storage, including within the server ). For example, the content files  may include all the information provided by an online educational service, such as information relevant to the courses provided by the service.","As discussed previously, it is preferable to be able to selectively allow clients ,  (students in this example) to access the information. For example, clients ,  may be restricted to access that portion of the content files  for which they have enrolled, subscribed, paid, and the like. The search engine interface  provides an access control function by intercepting and modifying search requests from the clients ,  (and passed on by the Web server application ). The search engine interface  is linked to the client account files  to retrieve information pertaining to the requesting client ,  (and\/or the user of the client , ) and to retrieve or create a client search profile. The client search profile is utilized by the search engine interface  to modify the search request (e.g., indicate what collections the search is restricted to). The search engine interface  also controls search access by intercepting and modifying or filtering indexing requests by the search engine , thereby limiting the content that can be searched prior to receiving a search request.","During operation, the modified search requests are transmitted to the search engine  by the search engine interface . The search engine  uses the modified search requests to search the search engine collections . The results of the search are received by the search engine interface , processed to standardize the results, and passed to the Web server application . The Web server application  calls the page generator  to create a results page which is then transmitted by the Web server application  to the requesting client ,  via the Internet .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["170","160","166","170","100","174","170","174","136","170","166","150","136","136","170","166"]},"With a general understanding of the components of the search control system  and the steps involved in a controlled search, it may be useful in more fully understanding the invention to discuss the operation of the search engine interface  in more detail.  illustrates with flow arrows the data or information that flows to and through the search engine interface . The search engine interface  performs important functions that allows it to protect the content files  from direct access while allowing the clients ,  to freely search information for which they have rights or full access.","Referring to , during operation, the search engine  first operates to populate the search engine collections , which are a subset of the information (such as titles, brief summaries, and link information) in the content files  that is indexed or sorted into collections for easier searching and retrieval. Briefly, a search request from a client ,  will only be useful in locating information in the content files  if a link or other data representing that information is first placed in the search engine collections  by the search engine .","The search engine  initiates indexing or spidering by transmitting an indexing request  to the search engine interface  (no direct access provided). In one embodiment, the search engine interface  modifies the indexing request  and then calls and gathers the requested information in the indexing communication . The results are then transmitted to the search engine  in the indexing reply  for storage in the search engine collections . In another embodiment, the search engine interface  is configured to pass the indexing request  to the content files  to gather all the request information in the indexing communication . In this embodiment, the search engine interface  then acts to inspect the retrieved information and to modify the information by deleting information, adding additional information, or otherwise modifying the retrieved information. For example, the search engine interface  may remove select metatags from HTML documents, address information, or other specific information relating to documents in the content files . This modified information is then passed on to the search engine  in the indexing reply . In the above manner, the search engine interface  functions to limit or control access to the content files  by tightly controlling the populating of the search engine collections  (the information that is searched by the search engine ), rather than allowing the search engine  full and direct access to the content files .","With the population or indexing step completed, the search process may continue with the transmittal of a search request  from the client ,  to the server . The Web server application  passes the search request  to the search engine interface  for further processing. For example, if the user of the client ,  is a student, the search may be for documents containing the word \u201capplet.\u201d In HTTP format, the search request  may take the following form:\n\n","According to an important feature of the search engine interface , access to the search engine collections  is restricted by modifying the client-submitted search request  by utilizing information pertaining to the client ,  (e.g., what courses are they enrolled in, what services have they subscribed to, what is their level of security, and other user-based criteria). This information can be formatted as a client search profile , which, as shown in , is added to the search request  to specify which of the collections in the search engine collections  can be searched with the modified search request . The modified search request  is then passed by the search engine interface  to the search engine . If a searcher has full access, no restrictions are added, but otherwise, limitations or restrictions are added to the search request  to form the modified search request . For example, if the collections represent online course information and the client ,  has signed up for a course, the client search profile  may be formatted to identify a collection tagged with a keyword (i.e., an added search restriction). In the above example, the modified search request  with the addition of the client search profile  would then appear:\n\n","The client search profile  may be a previously created file or object (e.g., Java\u2122 object) that is stored in the client account files  or the client search profile  can be dynamically created by the search engine interface  when the search request  is received by the search engine interface  based on information in the client account files . In either case, the search engine interface  first determines the identity of the client , . The searcher identification can be done by retrieving information contained in the search request , such as in a Cookie. Alternatively, the Web server application  may be configured to initiate a login procedure prior to accepting search requests . The client ,  in this case will have entered identification information prior to the receipt of the search request  that allows the search engine interface  to retrieve a client search profile  from the client account files  or to create a client search profile  with information in the client account files  pertaining to the logged-in client , .","Alternatively, the search profile  may be passed into the search engine interface  with the search request . For client , this allows the client  to specify which collections they have access to search. This, however, only provides limited access control (by controlling the populating of the search engine collections ). For client , the search request  may be modified to include the search profile  by the intermediate client . For example, the intermediate client  may be a subscription service provider, ASP, or ISP, and may desire to intercept all search requests  to monitor and control searching activities of its subscribers by adding, when appropriate, a restrictive add-on to limit access to the content provided by the server .","In the above examples, the modified search request  is created by adding on a restrictive term (i.e., the client search profile ) to the search request . In an alternative embodiment, the search engine interface  is configured to be context sensitive to modify the search terms in the search request  to better suit information in the content files  or to control access. For example, the search engine interface  may be linked to a glossary database (not shown) that includes listing of terms used in the content files  that are similar to those that may be submitted by the clients , . In this example, the client may submit \u201cserver application\u201d and the glossary database may include the term \u201cservlet\u201d for this phrase. The server engine interface  may be configured to replace the submitted search term with the more appropriate (e.g., accurate) search term. In more general terms, the search engine interface  is functional to control access to the search engine collection by modifying the received search request  in numerous ways to restrict access and\/or to improve the searching efficiency.","According to another significant feature of the search engine interface , the modified search request  is formatted by the search engine interface  to suit the particular search engine  included in the search control system . Preferably, the search engine interface  is interchangeable and is not tied to a specific search engine specification. In this regard, the search engine interface  in one embodiment is adapted for modifying the received search request  into a modified search request  based on the search engine . For example, the search engine  may be Ultraseek\u2122, Webcrawler\u2122, Excite\u2122, Alta Vista\u2122, or any number of other search engines. The search engine interface  preferably includes applications or instances of classes that enable the search engine interface  to determine the type of search engine  and then communicate the modified search request  in a format acceptable to search engine . Alternatively, the search engine interface  may be initialized upon installation in the server  to include applications or instances of classes configured for the search engine . For example, when search engine  is an Ultraseek\u2122 search engine, an instance of a search engine class can readily be constructed to allow reformatting of the search request  into a modified search request  recognized by the search engine .","Referring again to , in response to the modified search request , the search engine  searches the search engine collections  and returns the search results  to the search engine interface . For example, the results may be a list or an array of files or objects containing the link and summary information for matching documents in the content files . Typically, the search results  are in a format that is not standardized for transmittal to the clients ,  and\/or that is specific to the search engine .","To address this issue, the search engine interface  preferably is configured to modify the search results  into a more standard form and to transmit the standardized search results  to the Web server application  for use in generating a results page (e.g., an HTML document) with page generator . For example, the search engine interface  may include a parser application to parse the \u201craw\u201d search results into a standard format. In this example, the search results  may be in HTTP format, and the search engine interface  may parse the search results  to place them into Java\u2122 object form and pass these objects in standardized search results . The standardized search results  are then returned to the appropriate client ,  by the Web server application .","In a preferred embodiment illustrated in , the search engine interface  comprises a Java\u2122 API that is useful in any server  which supports Java\u2122 servlets, interfaces, and APIs. As shown in class diagram form, the search engine interface  includes a general search engine interface  with a specific instance or implementation labeled MySearchEngine . MySearchEngine  is an object that is specific to a particular search engine , such as Ultraseek\u2122, to enable it to communicate with the search engine . With reference to , during operation, a search request  is received at the search engine interface . In response, MySearchEngine  retrieves or creates client search profile  (if not provided in search request ). As illustrated, the search engine interface  includes SearchProfile  (e.g., a Java\u2122 interface) to create or instantiate an object or instance called MySearchProfile  with passed client information.","MySearchEngine  then creates modified search request  by calling an appropriate method to add MySearchProfile  to the search request  (or by other techniques discussed above). MySearchEngine  then functions to pass the modified search request  to the search engine  which searches the search engine collections  and returns search results . SearchResult  is then instantiated by MySearchEngine  and passed the set of raw results  to create the standardized search results  to pass to the Web server application . SearchResult  in turn calls or instantiates MySearchResultParser  which is an instance of interface SearchResultParser  that is specific to the search engine  (e.g., specific to Ultraseek\u2122 or other utilized search engine configuration). MySearchResultParser  returns SearchResultItem , such as an array of results that are standard objects rather than search engine-specific results, which is then passed by the search engine interface  to the Web server application  to create with page generator  a results page (e.g., HTML document). The results page is then transmitted back to the client ,  by the Web server application  via the Internet .","Although the invention has been described and illustrated with a certain degree of particularity, the present disclosure is by way of example, and numerous changes in the combination and arrangement of parts can be resorted to by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, as hereinafter claimed. Control over search engine indexing is independent of the exemplary classes shown in , and numerous class configurations may be utilized to provide this functionality of the invention."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":"1"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
