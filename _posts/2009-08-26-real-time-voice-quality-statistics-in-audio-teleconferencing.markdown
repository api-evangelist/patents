{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS"],"p":["The current invention is related to audio conferencing networks. More specifically, the invention is related to a voice quality monitoring device that provides real-time or near real-time statistics about per call quality statistics in an audio conferencing networks.","Audio conferencing network, i.e. conference calls let groups of people, from a few to hundreds, communicate by phone. Conference calls connect people through a conference bridge which is essentially a server that acts like a telephone and can answer multiple calls simultaneously. Software may play a large part in bridge's capabilities beyond simply connecting multiple callers. Businesses typically have a private exchange branch (PBX) within their offices. The PBX is a switched network of telephone connections inside the office. Each phone coupled to a PBX has an extension, and multiple phones share lines to the public switched telephone network (PSTN) outside the office.","Conference calls play a significant role in today's business life. In conference calls, where some users share a common conference room, while others are at remote locations, the voice quality from users speaking in the conference room is often poor when using a standard conference phone with a hands free feature. This is also true when using a speaker phone from a home office, automobile or commercial office. Also, several states (such as California) are required to use hands free headsets or handsfree kits, etc. for their cellular telephones. This can interfere with the sound quality and background noise quite a bit. Sound quality impairments include background noise, acoustic echoes, air interface delays from cell phones, etc. IP phones have the added quality impairments that include packetization delay and hybrid echo delay.","When voice quality is impaired, customers often blame the carrier. Recent studies indicate that customers experiencing at least one voice quality control problem are three times more like to say they will switch carriers in the future. Carriers, vendors service providers, etc. can benefit greatly from the comprehensive ability to measure voice quality, identify impairments, and mitigate the impact the impact on impairment rates.","However, there is currently no method or device that presents the real-time or near real-time voice quality statistics of the calls to the attendees, operators or moderators that are external to the audio conferencing network. Thus, a method and device are needed which can measure the voice quality of call and exchange that information with an application server in a real-time manner. The application server, in turn, will present the voice quality statistics of the audio conferencing network call impairments that originate both internally and externally of the audio conferencing network in real-time or near real-time to the operator, moderator, customer or API through an interface.","There is currently no method or device that presents, in real-time, near real-time or contemporaneously, a voice quality statistics report to the operators, moderators or customers regarding impairments that are external to (i.e. per-call quality impairments coming from the public switched telephone network (PSTN) or other communications networks into the conference system and\/or internal to the conferencing system. Thus, a method, system and computer readable medium is needed which can collect quality measurements on a per-call basis and present the voice quality statistics of the conferencing system's call impairments that originate both externally (i.e., the quality of the participant's call) and internally to the conferencing system in real-time, near real-time or contemporaneously through an interface such as a web page or graphical user interface, to the operator, moderator, automatic application programming interface and\/or customer.","A method for determining real time voice quality statistics for each participant in an audio conference bridge is disclosed. The method comprises generating the audio conference bridge through a plurality of participant's calls; coupling a voice quality measuring device with the audio conference bridge to collect and measure voice quality statistics concerning at least one of the participant's calls; and reporting in real-time or near real-time voice quality statistics collected and measured from the voice quality measuring device communicatively coupled to an application server to an operator, a moderator, an automatic application programming interface and\/or customer.","A system for providing real-time or near real-time voice quality statistics for a conference call customers in an audio conference bridge that allows the customers to obtain information about real time impacts from their calls coming from the public switched telephone network (PSTN) or any communication network into the audio conference bridge is disclosed. The system comprises a conference bridge adapted to accept a plurality of conference calls from attendees in a conference call; a voice quality measuring device adapted to be communicably coupled to the conferencing bridge, wherein the voice quality measuring device provides real time statistics regarding at least one of the plurality of conference call's quality impacts from the PSTN into the conference bridge; and an application server communicably coupled to the voice quality measuring device, the conferencing bridge and the PSTN, wherein the application server dispatches voice quality statistics between the voice quality measuring device and an operator, a moderator, an automatic application programming interface and\/or customer through a web page or a graphical user interface or other interface.","Customers involved in a teleconferencing situation most often currently dial into an audio conference and can optionally login to a web interface to see their conference information real-time on a web page that updates periodically or as needed. A customer may be the participant themselves or may be a company that regularly uses teleconferencing as a method of communication, either internally within the company or as a tool to communicate externally, for example, with business associates of a company. In the latter scenario, a company may have a few to hundreds of participants in a teleconference.","Most web-based conferencing companies\/carriers offer a web-based moderator tool to see and mute participants in an audio conferencing bridge. However, while most conferencing companies already clear out, for example, background noise from a cell phone user in a car, there are no tools or software packages that are able to provide real-time or near real-time statistics about each call leg's (participant's) quality impairments internal or external to the audio conferencing bridge. Near real-time is defined as the timeliness of data or information which has been delayed by the time required for electronic communication and automatic data processing. This implies that there are no significant delays.","A voice quality measuring device as disclosed in the invention will be able to provide real-time or near real-time voice quality statistics about the impairments from conferencing companies'\/carrier's calls that coming from the public switched telephone network (PSTN) or any other type of communication network into the audio conferencing voice quality system. The voice quality statistics provided by the voice quality measuring device will also provide the customer with caller-by-caller voice quality statistics about their participant's calls coming from the PSTN or any other type of communication network into the audio conferencing voice quality system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["5","5","14","16","5"]},"Audio conferencing voice quality system  comprises a simplified general organization of audio conferencing voice quality system  that contains a number of units. In the embodiment shown, a number of conference participant stations (A, B and C) are communicably coupled through PSTN and\/or any type of now known communication network  or any type of communication network to be developed in the future with a media server  and a voice quality measuring device , an application server , and interface . Note that the number of participant stations is exemplary only. The media server (MGW)  is generally responsible for receiving and collecting data from the participant stations  and transferring that data into voice quality measuring device . Voice quality statistics  are either pushed to the application server or pulled from the application server  (as discussed in detail below). Voice quality statistics  are transferred via application server  coupled to an interface . Voice quality statistics  both external to and internal to the audio conferencing voice quality system  are analyzed, summarized and reported to an operator, a moderator, an automatic application programming interface (as will be discussed in detail below) or a customer through a web page, other graphical user interface (GUI), or any other interface now known or o be developed in the future, to be viewed in real-time or near real-time. Impairments can be corrected in real-time, near real-time or contemporaneously by an operator, a moderator, an API or a customer. For example, the operator, moderator, or customer viewing interface  through connection  may decide to disconnected the participant station, mute the volume, etc. if the impacts from a participant station from the PSTN and\/or communication network  into the audio conferencing voice quality system are disrupting the conferencing experience of the rest of the participants. In another embodiment, to be discussed fully below, an automatic application programming interface can be used by an operator or moderator to facilitate automatic actions to be taken by the application programming interface (API). In another embodiment, the automatic application programming interface may interact directly with the interface. For example, if participant A, has a high degree of echo and background noise as shown from the voice quality statistics  as measured through the voice quality measuring device , and the system provides a command to reduce the high degree of echo and background noise as shown from the voice quality statistics, the automatic application programming interface can react directly to that command and correct the deficiency.","In another example, if participant A, has a high degree of echo and background noise as shown from the voice quality statistics  as measured through the voice quality measuring device , the operator, the automatic application programming interface, through and operator or moderator (as discussed below) or moderator can review this data in real time through the interface  and disconnect or mute the call of participant A.","As used herein, a user is referred to in its broadest sense as in that it may include person or thing that utilizes a particular resource. Depending on the context in which the invention is used, a user may be, for example, a participant in a conference call employing an audio bridging unit, a caller calling into a call center, a software program utilizing computing resources of a processor, a communication device utilizing transmission media having a finite bandwidth and the like.","Although both the media gateway , application server , and voice quality measuring device , unit could be implemented purely in hardware, it is preferred that the each and\/or all units , , and , comprise a computer program running on an appropriate hardware platform.","In an embodiment of the invention, the media interface between the conference participant stations  and the audio conferencing voice quality system  may be over a separate communications network, such as the public switched telephone network (PSTN), a packet-switched network, or a combination of the two in which a PSTN-to-packet-switched network gateway is traversed. The participant stations , however, can be connected to the present system by any communications network, including local area networks (LAN), private networks, circuit-switched networks, etc.","Customer-participant stations  (A, B and C) are communicably coupled to the media server  though PSTN and\/or communication network . The media server (MGW)  acts as a translation unit between disparate telecommunications networks, such as PSTN; Next Generations Networks, etc. Because the MGW  connects different types of networks, one of its main functions is to convert between the different transmission and coding techniques. The MGW  performs functions such as media stream packetization and depacketization, automatic gain control acoustic echo cancellation, and lower layer protocol handling (such as RTP and TCP\/IP). MGW's  are controlled by a media gateway controller (not shown) which provides the call control and signaling functionality, for example, Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP). MGWs  perform the conversion between time division multiplexing (TDM) voice and VoIP. Mobile access MGWs  connect the radio access networks of public land mobile network (PLMN) to a Next Generation Core Network. Media gateway controllers use signaling commands that establish and terminate the call as well as provide may other functionalities including conference calling. For example, the signal commands are defined in a signaling protocol including, but not limited to as H.323, MGCP or MEGCO as well as any other signaling protocols now known or to be developed in the future. Signaling protocols are well known by those of ordinary skill in the art.","Audio conferencing voice quality system  contains voice quality measuring device . Participant stations  (A, B and C), are each coupled to voice quality measuring device  through MGW  and PSTN and\/or communication network . Voice quality measuring device  derives a standards based MOS (discussed in detail with regard to ) value that includes impairments that are external to the network, i.e. the audio conferencing voice quality system .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["5","50","5","14","14","40","40"]},"In one embodiment, incoming audio signals  from the participant stations  to the audio conferencing voice quality system  are received through the MGW  to the voice quality measuring device  where they are measured and reported as voice quality statistics . As will be discussed, reported voice quality statistics will give the conferencing companies or carrier and\/or customer the ability to proactively detect and eliminate sources of external or internal impairment in their respective networks.","In this embodiment, voice quality measuring device  comprises a tool that measures and reports a comprehensive set of voice quality statistics including, but not limited to, transmission rating (R) factors (listening quality (R-LQ) and conversational quality (R-CQ), mean opinion scores (MOS) (listening quality (MOS-LQ) and conversational quality (MOS-CQ), noise levels, speech levels, hybrid echo delay, hybrid echo return loss, acoustic echo delay, weighted acoustic echo path loss echo objection rate per ITU-T g.131, packet jitter, packet delay, packet counts, etc. The data are collected continuously and non-intrusively on all channels on a per-call basis.","For example, an increasing number of calls originate from noisy urban environments where call quality can be negatively affected by background noise. The voice quality measuring device  measures per-call speech level, noise level, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in both directions to identify and report unwanted noise in a call. Moreover, the migration of voice networks from circuit to packet technologies is resulting in greater and more variable latency. The majority of legacy hybrid echo cancellers are unable to handle this added delay, leaving callers unprotected from annoying hybrid echo. In addition, the proliferation of participant choices in terminal equipment (handsets, headsets, and hands free kits) continues to expand rapidly without necessarily providing adequate acoustic isolation, exposing more users to acoustic echo. Voice quality measuring device  provides comprehensive statistics about echo delay and return loss for both hybrid (linear) echo and acoustic (non-linear) echo. The voice quality measuring device  monitors from 0 to 400 ms in both directions, ensuring complete and accurate measurement of echo. For a statistical understanding of how echo and delay combine to affect customer satisfaction, voice quality measuring device  also provides Echo Objection Rates per ITU-T G.131.","Transmission Rating Factors R factors and Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) pertaining to per-call listening and conversational R factor and MOS values are also computed continuously and non-intrusively based on the measured voice quality impairments (speech, noise, and echo) as well as codec type. The voice quality measuring device  objective scores follow the ITU-T G.107 E-Model standard and use a unique DSP-based approach to analyze live voice signal. The voice quality measuring device  employs a computational model to provide R factors and MOS scores for the following: listening quality (LQ), this score includes speech quality, noise, and voice level. It does not include impairments that affect conversation, such as delay and conversational quality (CQ), this score includes the impairments measured for the LQ score and adds echo and delay, which affect conversational quality.","In VoIP networks, packet characteristics can have a significant impact the quality of a call. The voice quality measuring device  measures and collects these statistics non-intrusively on an ongoing per-call basis to identify the source of the IP issues that affecting voice quality. For instance, the variation of inter-arrival time between packets adds to the delay because the jitter buffer adjusts to establish a constant input for decoding voice packets. Also, congestion, queuing, packet processing, and routing all affect the amount of delay a packet experiences when crossing an IP network. The packet delay affects the overall delay of the call and the amount of noticeable echo within a call. The voice quality measuring device  provides a packet jitter profile and packet delay information for each call. Per-call packet count measurements help determine whether speech quality issues are related to the packet network or are a result of other issues. The voice quality measuring device  provides a packet jitter profile for each call. The voice quality measuring device  packet count statistics include the total packets received per call, the number of discarded packets received per call and the number of lost packets per call.","The voice quality measuring device  reporting element analyzes and summarizes all network statistics. The report can include summary views of transmission quality at each network element, i.e. participant station, etc., detailed views of voice quality impairments, and historical data for trend analysis. The report comprises the comprehensive detail of the voice quality statistics .","In another embodiment, if an application programming interface or API language and message format is used in addition to an operator or moderator (as will be discussed in detail below), the API interface can automate actions and in effect is an automated action system. For example, an operator, moderator can predefine automatic actions for the API to take when certain voice quality impairments are summarized in the API's self created report (discussed below) or an audio conferencing voice quality system  created report.","An application programming interface or API is a language and message format used by an application program to communicate with the operating system or some other control program such as a database management system (DBMS) or communications protocol. APIs are implemented by writing function calls in the program, which provide the linkage to the required subroutine for execution. Thus, an API implies that some program module is available in the computer to perform the operation or that it must be linked into the existing program to perform the tasks. APIs are well known by those of ordinary skill in the art and those of ordinary skill in the art will perceive the vast performance value of presenting data to an API rather than to an operator or moderator. For example, the use of an API could trigger external systems. The API could be programmed to send out the report and simultaneously resolve the problem that is indicated in the report. For example, if the report states that the comprehensive detail of the voice quality statistics is an issue internal to a vendor's system, then the API can perform the operation to repair the problem. As one of ordinary skill in the art would see, there are many possibilities using API.","In yet another embodiment, an interactive voice response (IVR) or voice response unit (VRU) may be used in conjunction with an application programming interface to create an automatic API system. For example, if the command spoken by the interactive voice response (IVR) or voice response unit (VRU) is pre-defined phrase or key words programmed by the computer when a report is acknowledged on the interface, the automatic API would acknowledge the pre-defined phrase or key words, knowing that a command would issue. The interactive voice response (IVR) or voice response unit (VRU) would speak a pre-defined phrase or key word that would alert the automatic API that a command was going to be generated and to respond to the command. The automatic API would take action based on the command.","Whereas the in the above-mentioned embodiments, the application server , will exchange this information with an interface  to present the voice quality statistics of the calls from the PSTN or communication network into the audio conferencing voice quality system . In another embodiment, the application server  has the ability through a communicably coupled device such as a voice-enabled console in an automobile, a mobile telephone, a voice enabled personal computer, a interactive voice response unit, or any other voice enabled device or directly spoken words through a telephone, etc., wherein the corrective actions required are spoken as commands to the audio conferencing voice quality system . In this embodiment, the interface is a speech recognition interface. As with most speech recognition interfaces, usually a pre-defined phrase or key word is spoken first to inform the audio conferencing voice quality system  that a command is ready to be presented to the system. The operator, moderator, automated API, customer, VRU, etc. would speak the pre-defined phrase or key word which would alert the audio conferencing voice quality system  to listen for commands. Thus, allowing a user to speak commands from their conference connection. Action would be taken by the system based on the required action need for each command.","The voice quality statistics  can be collected from the voice quality measuring device  at preconfigured periodic intervals or only when specific voice quality statistics  change and reach certain detailed views of specific quality impairments based on quality thresholds. The voice quality statistics  might be pulled by the application server  from the voice quality measuring device  or pushed from the application server  to the voice quality measuring device.","The application server , in turn, will exchange this information with an interface  communicably coupled to the application server , such as, for example, a web page or operator\/automatic API\/customer interface to present the voice quality statistics of the calls from the PSTN or any other type of communication network into the audio conferencing voice quality system .","It will be recognized that other tools and interfaces may be coupled between the application server  and the voice quality measuring device . These tools may include, among others, a load balancer  and\/or a conferencing media server . Note, that the tools may also be bundled together, for example, in many instances the application server and conferencing media server reside on the same unit, a single server performing the functionalities of both devices. Interface  can either act as a direct source to the operator, moderator, automatic API, application programming interface, customer or may be coupled to including, but not limited to, a personal computer, workstation, processor, CPU, telephone, or any other means for presenting data to, for example, an operator, automatic API, moderator or customer.","Referring now to , a voice quality measuring system flow chart for an audio conferencing voice quality system  is depicted. The flow begins at step , the audio conference network is initiated, for example, by coupling to an audio conferencing voice quality system  through the Public Switching Telephone Network (PSTN) or any communication network . At step , signals generated from the audio conferencing voice quality system  are communicably coupled to a voice quality measuring device . The voice quality measuring device  comprises a tool that measures and reports a comprehensive set of voice quality statistics  as set forth in detail in reference to . The voice quality statistics  of each call are measured at step . The voice quality measuring device  measures and collects the voice quality statistics  on a per call basis of all calls coming into the audio conferencing voice quality system  from the PSTN or any communication network . At step , the voice quality statistics  are presented in real-time or near real-time to an operator, moderator or customer or automatic API actions  through a presentable interface , such as, for example, a web page, a graphical user interface (GUI), or any other user interface  now known or to be developed in the future. The voice quality statistics  of one or more individual call(s) in an audio conference can then be collected and presented back to the conference the operator, moderator or customer or automatic API actions  through the interface such that the conference the operator, moderator or customer or automatic API actions  can detect impairments that originate both inside and outside of audio conferencing voice quality system . Finally, at step , the operator, moderator or customer or automatic API actions can take action with regards to the caller or callers that are causing impairments to the system by muting the line, disconnecting the call or any other means necessary to preserve a valuable audio conferencing experience for those callers causing no impairments (internal or external) to the system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["300","302","310","304","304","316","326","306","310"]},"MGW  is communicably coupled to voice quality measuring device , which in turn, is communicably coupled to media server , application server  and load balancer  through an exchange of voice quality statistics , , and  respectively. In addition, media server  and load balancer are also communicably coupled to application through an exchange of voice quality statistics  and  respectively. Application server is communicably coupled through an exchange of voice quality statistics  to interface to external applications . Operator  or moderator  may have their own PCs communicably coupled through an exchange of voice quality statistics ,  or view interface  directly.","Through the PSTN , impairments that are external to the audio conferencing system that the voice quality measuring device includes when measuring and collecting the voice quality statistics include: background noise, mismatched voice levels, acoustic echoes, air interface delay from cell phones; and background noise mismatched voice levels and acoustic echoes from a POTS phone. Through IP Network, impairments that are external to the system on the IP phone and cell phone, POTS phone the impairments are the same except the IP phone has the added impairment of packetization delay and hybrid echo delay from the PSTN. Impairments that are internal to the audio conferencing system that the voice quality measuring device includes when measuring and collecting the voice quality statistics include: packetization delay, packet delay, packet loss and packet jitter are due to the IP Network and variable network delay and hybrid echoes from the PSTN. The MGW  is then communicably coupled as set forth above to all other devices in the system through an exchange of voice quality measurements. As is shown in the logical diagram of the system, all the arrows in the exchange of voice quality measurements point in both directions. Thus, showing that the voice quality measuring device is consistently measuring, collecting and reporting data on both internal and external impairments in the audio conferencing system on a non-intrusive, per-call basis.","Operator  and\/or moderator , once they have seen the report on both internal and external impairments in the audio conferencing system, may be communicably coupled to application server  via a session initiation protocol (SIP), a signaling protocol used for setting up or tearing down multimedia communications sessions over the internet such as voice or VoIP calls over the Internet. Thus, an operator  or a moderator  has the ability to address an impairment reported by the voice quality measuring device  via SIP lines  and  respectively. For example, if a call needs to be disconnected to a severe disturbance, the operator  or moderator  can review the report, see what call is causing the impairment and disconnect the call through the SIP line(s) ,  through the application sever .","Although an exemplary embodiment of the system of the invention has been illustrated in the accompanied drawings and described in the foregoing detailed description, it will be understood that the invention is not limited to the embodiments disclosed, but is capable of numerous rearrangements, modifications and substitutions without departing from the spirit of the invention as set forth and defined in the following claims.
