{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The invention relates generally to modifying business objects, and more specifically, to extending business objects on demand via extension fields.","Enterprise Information Systems (EIS) provide a technology platform for the modelling and management of business processes and activities. An EIS typically models activities related to the operation of an enterprise, such as human resources, accounting, finance, plant management, sales and distribution, marketing, fleet management, warehouse management, and others. An EIS may model business processes via business objects that could represent tasks or activities of an enterprise, for example.","Extending an EIS is a time-consuming and resource-consuming process and runtime extensions are generally not available on an EIS. Because of the complexity associated with an EIS, extending an EIS involves modelling additional components for the system in a design time environment, testing such additional components, and deploying such additional components in the runtime of the EIS.","These and other benefits and features of embodiments of the invention will be apparent upon consideration of the following detailed description of preferred embodiments thereof, presented in connection with the following drawings.","In various embodiments, a system is presented. The system of the embodiments displays business processes in a graphical user interface. The system of the embodiments displays business objects and data flows between business objects in a graphical user interface.","In various embodiments, the system receives an extension field for a source business object and a selection of a data flow from the source business object to a target business object. The system stores the extension field for the source business object and the selection of the data flow from the source business object to the target business object in the form of metadata in a repository. Using the metadata, a backend module propagates the extension field to the target business object.","In various embodiments, a method is presented. The method includes receiving an extension field to propagate from a source business object to one or more business objects along data flows between business objects.","Embodiments of techniques for process field extensibility for business objects are described herein. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of embodiments of the invention. One skilled in the relevant art will recognize, however, that the invention can be practiced without one or more of the specific details, or with other methods, components, materials, etc. In other instances, well-known structures, materials, or operations are not shown or described in detail to avoid obscuring aspects of the invention.","Reference throughout this specification to \u201cone embodiment\u201d, \u201cthis embodiment\u201d and similar phrases, means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the present invention. Thus, the appearances of these phrases in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment. Furthermore, the particular features, structures, or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments.","In various embodiments, an Enterprise Information System (EIS) is presented. An EIS enables organizations to manage their business processes and tasks on an Information Technology (IT) platform. Typically, an EIS includes modules for business activities, such as, but not limited to accounting, finance and controlling, human resources, sales, distribution, procurement, warehouse management, and other modules.","A business object in an EIS represents a physical or logical object pertaining to the business activities of an organization. Business objects may encapsulate business logic for a business process or business task. Examples of business objects may be a sales order, an invoice, an account, and others.","In various embodiments, business objects are implemented as structures of nodes (e.g., each field of a business object belongs to a node). For example, an invoice business object may have a \u201cheader\u201d as a root node and one or more \u201citems\u201d as children nodes, where the items may store the actual data of the invoice, e.g., invoices items to be paid.","Business objects include one or more fields to specify data needed for the business object. For example, in a \u201csales order\u201d business object, fields may be specified to store data about the sales order such as a customer that places the order, a good or service that is ordered, and others.","In various embodiments, a business process may include one or more business objects. The business objects in a business process are logically connected to enable the business process to achieve a business goal. In the example above, the \u201csales order business object\u201d may be part of a \u201csales\u201d business process. The \u201csales\u201d business process may include other business objects, for instance, a \u201clead\u201d business object to specify when sales activities with a customer may develop in a potential sale. Further, the \u201csales\u201d business process may include an \u201copportunity\u201d business object to specify when further sales activities have led to a more definite prospect for a sale. Finally, if a sale is accomplished, a \u201csales order\u201d business object in the \u201csales\u201d business process may store information about the actual sale.","As mentioned above, business objects in a business process are logically connected. Such logical connections enable the business process to \u201cflow\u201d from one business object to another and achieve the business goal.","Further, connections between one business object and another business object are referred to as \u201cdata flows.\u201d A data flow is used to specify the flow of data in a business process. For example, if in a \u201csales\u201d business process initial sales activities result in a lead that might lead to a sale, a \u201clead\u201d business object is filled with data pertaining to the sales lead. This data may include information about the customer, the sales personnel that performed the sales activity, and details about the lead. At a later point in time, if an opportunity for a sale has been determined, an \u201copportunity\u201d business object will be filled with data.","However, as a data flow exists between the \u201clead\u201d business object and the \u201copportunity\u201d business object, the data from the \u201clead\u201d business object may be propagated to the \u201copportunity\u201d business object (e.g., data may \u201cflow\u201d from one object to another). Finally, if a sale is to be accomplished, a \u201csales order\u201d will be created and the data from the \u201copportunity\u201d business object will be propagated to the \u201csales order\u201d business object. Thus, data in a business process is propagated between objects via data flows.","In various embodiments, business objects, data flows between business objects, and fields in business objects may be defined using metadata. Such metadata may be stored in a repository on a database and retrieved for use when needed.","In a graphical user interface, business processes, business objects, and data flows are modeled using graphical elements to enable professionals with little or no technical knowledge to use an EIS.","Typically, and EIS includes a graphical user interface and a backend module to realize the functionality required by the graphical user interface. In various embodiments, an EIS may be hosted on one or more servers and may use one or more databases to store business processes, business objects, data flows, and actual data.","In a backend module, business object fields from a graphical user interface are mapped to physical data fields in a database and data flows between business objects (e.g., connections between fields) are mapped to reference fields. Such mappings may be performed via metadata. Thus, in a backend module, metadata is used to map graphical user interface artifacts to physical data in a database via metadata definition and metadata objects. Metadata may be stored in a metadata repository.","In various embodiments, customers of an EIS may need additional fields in business objects. Such additional fields may not have been envisioned as necessary by an EIS provider. It may be necessary for reporting purposes to add additional fields to business objects to enable diverse reporting scenarios, or to enable grouping of data in business reports in a specific way. For example, a customer of an EIS may need to create reports in which data is grouped by a category field that is not available in the relevant business object that stores the data for the report. Because customer businesses and thus requirements change over time, an EIS provider may not envision every customer requirement or need over an extended period of time. Thus, it may be beneficial to enable customers of EIS to extend business objects with data fields as needed, over time.","In various embodiments, a system may be implemented to provide extensibility for business objects. Such extensibility may be in the form of adding extension fields (e.g., customer-defined data fields) to business objects and propagating such extension fields to other business objects via data flows between the business objects.","In various embodiments, a system may be implemented to enable the generation of extension fields on business objects in a graphical user interface and the propagation of extension fields along data flows between business objects in a backend module.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["102","104","102","102","112","102","102","114","116","102"]},"In various embodiments, a user may add a field to the items panel . To add the field, a user selects the items panel  (shown highlighted to specify it is selected). Referring to , the Properties panel  displays the fields of the items panel . After adding the field \u201cadditional ID\u201d  it is added to the Properties Panel . The additional ID field  is shown highlighted to specify that the field is created and currently selected. The visibility column  of the field  table shows a tick to specify that the additional ID field is visible and to be displayed.","In various embodiments, a user may select to propagate the newly created additional ID field  by selecting process extension . In response to the user selecting process extension , a system of an embodiment displays a process extension screen. In various embodiments the displayed process extension screen may be a process extension screen such as exemplary screen of .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["120","221","221","202","218","202","206","220","238","238","212","202","202","218","202","218"]},"The properties panel  displays a business context panel  for business contexts  through to . It should be appreciated that the exemplary screen may not fit all available business contexts for all available business objects. If the process extension panel  is zoomed to show a specific area of the business process model, the business context panel  is updated accordingly.","A business context for a business object describes where a field is added to a business object and is derived from a selected screen area. For example, in , purchase order  is highlighted to show purchase order  is a source object an extension field is created in. Further, purchase order item  is highlighted to show that the extension field is added to the purchase order  items panel (e.g., items  in ).","Further, the properties panel  displays process templates available in the system in the process templates panel . The process templates panel  displays process templates procure-to-pay (stock)  and procure-to-pay (non-stock) . Further process templates may be displayed if available. The process templates are displayed to show processes created according to the templates and available for extension.","In various embodiments, an extension field may be created for a business object (e.g., additional ID field  in ). For example, an extension field \u201cadditional ID\u201d may be added to purchase order  (e.g., purchase order  of ). Following the addition of the extension field to the business object purchase order , one or more of the data flows  through to  may be selected to specify that the extension field \u201cadditional ID\u201d should be propagated to the business objects connected to the purchase order  via the selected data flows. Data flows are selected via selection boxes  through to . For example, if the extension field \u201cadditional ID\u201d is to be propagated to purchase request  and supplier invoice , the relevant boxes  for data flow  and  for data flow  may be selected. In various embodiments, purchase order  is referred to as \u201csource object\u201d and purchase request  and supplier invoice  are referred to as \u201ctarget objects.\u201d","Thus, via the selection boxes  through to , a backend module may receive instructions to propagate the extension field \u201cadditional ID\u201d from a source object to one or more target objects.","In various embodiments, the process extension panel  may show a process model. However, sub-processes may also exist within the process and may not be initially displayed. Sub-processes may be displayed on demand in response to a user input. For example, the purchase request  may be connected to further business objects such as \u201cpurchase proposal\u201d and \u201cproject purchase request.\u201d Such business objects may be displayed if a user chooses a user interface control to expand data flows of the purchase request business object via the plus box . If further objects are displayed via a selection of a plus box, such objects may be selected so that an extension field is propagated to them from their parent object (for example, the purchase request ), when such parent object is also selected for propagation. Thus, a system of various embodiments ensures propagation is consistent.","After the propagation of the extension field to the selected business objects, the extension field is available in the business objects it was propagated to. Thus, users are able to extend an EIS without any development effort in a graphical environment.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 2"]},"Referring to , business objects  through to  are displayed in the process extension panel  (e.g., process extension panel  and business objects  through to  of ). The process extension panel  displays data flows  through to  (e.g., data flows  through to  of ); and selection boxes  through to  for each data flow (e.g., selection boxes  through to  of ).","The properties panel  displays business contexts  through to  in the business context panel . The properties panel  further displays process templates  and  in process templates panel .","The process extension panel  displays the source object purchase order  and target objects purchase request  and supplier invoice  and corresponding data flows  and  in a highlighted way (e.g., with different color and size) to show that these objects and data flows are to be extended because selection boxes  and  are selected.","In various embodiments, a system may collect data from the graphical user interface in the form of metadata and send such metadata to a backend module on a server to perform the propagation of extension fields.","Further, after the propagation of an extension field to one or more business objects, the extension field is available in the runtime environment of the EIS and can be used for practical purposes, such as, but not limited to, creating reports based on criteria derived from extension fields, including more content in business objects for business activities, and so on. After the propagation of an extension field to one or more target objects, screens in the graphical user interfaces of various embodiments may display extended business objects in highlighted form to indicate such business objects have been extended with additional fields.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIGS. 2 and 3","FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 2"],"b":["400","402","408","402","402","202","218"]},"Data flows between business processes may be displayed via directed edges (e.g., data flows  through  of ). The backend module  stores the elements displayed on the GUI  in the metadata repository  in the form of metadata.","In various embodiments, metadata may include field definition data, such as field type and label; further, metadata may include persistency data, such as a definition of a field in a database and the logical attachments of the field; metadata may also include data about a position of a field on a screen, and others. Metadata is used as an abstraction between user interface data and underlying database data. The backend module  processes metadata. The backend module  receives user interface data translated to metadata from the layout builder ; or vice versa, the backend module  sends metadata to the layout builder  and the layout builder  translates such metadata to graphical user interface elements.","The layout builder  receives metadata from the metadata repository  and transforms the metadata in graphical elements to display on the GUI . If an extension field on a business object displayed in the GUI  is created and one or more data flows and one or more corresponding business objects are selected for the extension field to be propagated to, the layout builder  creates metadata definitions from instructions received in the GUI  and sends the metadata definitions to the backend module  to store in the metadata repository .","The backend module  includes logic to use these metadata definitions to extend underlying business objects (stored in the database ) by including the extension field in the target business objects. To extend underlying business objects, the backend module  uses the metadata to extend the definitions of business objects in the metadata repository  and modify the definitions of reference fields in the metadata repository  (e.g., reference fields represent data flows in the metadata repository). Using the updated definitions and reference fields, the backend module  modifies data representing the business objects and data flows in the database . After the extension fields have been propagated to selected business objects and saved to the database , the GUI  displays business objects in their modified form (e.g., including the extension field) In various embodiments, extended business objects may be displayed in a different manner as compared to non-extended business objects, for example, extended business objects may be highlighted or displayed in a different color. Thus, users can modify business objects to include fields on demand to service a specific business use.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 4"]},"Referring to , at process block , an extension field on a source business object is created (that is, extension field associated with a source business object). At process block , a data flow is selected. In various embodiments, one or more data flows may be selected.","At process block , a target business object correspondingly relevant to the data flow and to the source business object is highlighted (e.g., the source business object and the target business object are connected via a directed edge in a GUI such as the GUI  of ). In various embodiments, if more than one data flow is selected in process block , all of the business objects connected to the selected data flows are highlighted.","At process block , metadata describing the extension field and the selection of business objects and data flow is stored to a repository (e.g., metadata repository  of ). Such metadata enables a descriptive approach to extending business objects. At process block , the extension field is propagated to the target business object using the metadata stored in the repository. The metadata stored in the repository can be translated to lower level instructions to programmatically change business objects and data flows (e.g., change in a database such as database  of  by a backend module such as backend module  of ). However, this functionality is transparent to a user of the system and to a GUI such as the GUI  of . Thus, the user does not need to have any technical knowledge to add an extension field to a business object and propagate the extension field to another business object.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6","FIG. 4"]},"Referring to , at process block , metadata definitions of a source and target business objects are retrieved from a metadata repository (e.g., metadata repository  of ). At process block , the metadata definitions are updated with the extension field. At process block , a reference field defining the selected data flow is retrieved. At process block , the reference field is extended to include information about the extension field. At process block , persistence metadata is retrieved for the source and target business objects and the data flow. The persistence metadata specifies how the source and target business objects and the data flow are mapped to data fields in the database. Using the persistence metadata, at process block , the business objects and the data flow are updated in the database.","The architecture described in  and the processes described in  allow for the implementation and configuration of an EIS that enables end users with no technical knowledge to extend business objects in the system. Thus, time, funds, and resources may be saved. Further, with the opportunity to extend business objects descriptively (as opposed to programmatically), users can create and adapt scenarios relevant to their business and business needs over time with minimal effort.","Some embodiments of the invention may include the above-described methods being written as one or more software components. These components, and the functionality associated with each, may be used by client, server, distributed, or peer computer systems. These components may be written in a computer language corresponding to one or more programming languages such as, functional, declarative, procedural, object-oriented, lower level languages and the like. They may be linked to other components via various application programming interfaces and then compiled into one complete application for a server or a client. Alternatively, the components maybe implemented in server and client applications. Further, these components may be linked together via various distributed programming protocols. Some example embodiments of the invention may include remote procedure calls being used to implement one or more of these components across a distributed programming environment. For example, a logic level may reside on a source computer system that is remotely located from a target computer system containing an interface level (e.g., a graphical user interface). These source and target computer systems can be configured in a server-client, peer-to-peer, or some other configuration. The clients can vary in complexity from mobile and handheld devices, to thin clients and on to thick clients or even other servers.","The above-illustrated software components are tangibly stored on a computer readable medium as instructions.
