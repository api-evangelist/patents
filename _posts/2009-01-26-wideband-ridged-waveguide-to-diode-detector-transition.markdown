No. 12\/172,481 filed 14 Jul. 2008, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by this reference.","This invention relates to passive imaging technologies where detectors rely on ambient millimeter wave radiation naturally radiated by an object to detect its presence. The present invention may be used to couple an antenna, such as a horn antenna, directly to a detector diode without the need for intermediate pre-amplification. The detectors may be arranged in a two dimensional array.","Millimeter wave imaging technology, particularly at frequencies from about 70-150 GHz, is actively being pursued for concealed weapons detection, all-weather landing aids, and imaging of building interiors. Passive imaging, where no active source is used (such as compared to radar technologies), has the advantage of not requiring a transmitter thus reducing the cost of the system. It relies on detection of the various levels of millimeter wave radiation naturally radiated by an object (that is its' emissivity) to differentiate between the object and its' background. Detection can be direct to a DC voltage which is proportional to the received integrated noise power, or else the received noise can be mixed down to a lower frequency and then detected. Direct detection has the advantage that it requires fewer parts, but the very small millimeter wave noise levels before detection generally require amplification (see L. Yujiri, \u201cPassive Millimeter Wave Imaging,\u201d IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest, 2006, pp. 98-101, June 2006). HRL Laboratories of Malibu, Calif. has developed a Sb-heterostructure diode that has been optimized to operate as a direct detector without bias voltage (see H. P. Moyer, R. L. Bowen, J. N. Schulman, D. H. Chow, S. Thomas, J. J. Lynch, and K. S. Holabird, \u201cSb-Heterstructure Low Noise W-Band Detector Diode Sensitivity Measurements,\u201d IEEE MTT-S international Microwave Symposium Digest 2006, pp, 826-829, June 2006). Thus, direct detection without pre-amplification is possible (see J. Lynch, H. Moyer, J. Schulman, P. Lawyer, R. Bowen, J. Schaffner, D. Choudhury, J. Foschaar, and D. Chow, \u201cUnamplified Direct Detection Sensor for Passive Millimeter Wave Imaging,\u201d Proc. Of SPIE on Passive Millimeter-Wave Imaging Technology, eds. R. Appleby and D. Wilkner, Vol. 6211, 2006), which could enable a low-cost millimeter wave focal plane array if a suitable means for coupling an arrayable antenna to an array of the aforementioned Sb-heterostructure diodes could be devised. The present disclosure is directed to techniques for coupling an antenna, such as a horn antenna, to a diode without the need for intermediate pre-amplification.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"figref":["FIGS. 1A-1C","FIG. 1A","FIG. 1B","FIG. 1A","FIGS. 1A and 1B","FIG. 2A","FIG. 1C"],"b":["1","1","1","2","2","4","2","4","2","4","4","1","2","3","4","2","1","5","5","4","5","5","7","8","1","6","5","5","8","4","2"],"i":["a ","c ","c ","b ","c ","a","b","d ","a ","b ","a","b ","c "]},"While there are some common features between these initial efforts and the technology described subsequently herein, the present disclosure addresses some shortcomings of the this initial effort. In particular, the original diode chip  had RF pick-up antennas on the diode chip . It was subsequently discovered through electromagnetic simulation that the RF pick-up antennas needed to be on a printed circuit board substrate for wide band operation. Also, a back-short tuning cavity was fabricated using the printed circuit board itself, whereas in the present disclosure, an air-filled back-short cavity is explicitly made and used for increased operational bandwidth. The other major difference in these initial efforts is that the video output for a particular input polarization is single-ended, whereas in the present disclosure a differential output is described that can reduce interference on the DC lines, although for single linearly polarized field.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":["FIGS. 2A-2D","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2B","FIG. 2C","FIG. 2D"],"i":["Proc. of SPIE on Passive Millimeter","Wave Imaging Technology"],"b":["1","2","4","1","1","2"]},"The new technology described in this disclosure integrates an RF choke into the RF pick-up probes (antennas) so that the DC lines can come directly off of the probe. This eliminates a lot of excess metal within the transition that causes parasitic reactance and DC\/RF isolation in the DC lines. Also, the use of an air-filled back-short cavity of this disclosure rather than a fused silica filled cavity enables broader bandwidths to be achieved.","This disclosure teaches how to make a very wide-band millimeter wave transition from a ridged waveguide input to a millimeter wave imaging diode detector. This transition is designed for operation from 70 GHz to greater than 140 GHz. Novel features of this disclosure are believed to include:\n\n","The transition is designed to couple to a ridged waveguide which is know in the art to have a wider bandwidth than a standard rectangular waveguide (for coupling to the pick-up horn antenna).","The DC output lines come directly off of the RF pick-up probes, thus minimizing parasitic RF pick-up by the DC line and facilitating a differential DC output.","This invention has improved RF isolation from the DC line due to the RF choke and a cut-off DC output waveguide channel.","Two embodiments are described below, one for fused silica and one for alumina. Alumina substrates are not typically used at frequencies 70 GHz+.","In one aspect the present invention provides a transition for coupling a horn antenna to a matched diode detector. The transition preferably comprises a ridged waveguide operatively coupled to the horn antenna; a substrate for supporting a diode chip (carrying the matched diode detector) adjacent the waveguide, the substrate also supporting a pair of RF pick-up probes, each RF probe having a portion which is coupled with the diode chip; and a waveguide short circuit at least partially enclosing the diode chip and disposed adjacent said substrate.","In another aspect the present invention provides a combination of a RF pick-up probe, RF choke, and DC output line that simultaneously receives RF radiation from a waveguide and provides a detected DC voltage provided by a diode RF detector disposed in said waveguide to one or more output video lines via the RF choke.","An exploded system level view of a passive millimeter wave imaging pixel  that utilizes the transition disclosed herein is shown in . This pixel can be replicated in a periodic fashion in two directions to create a two dimensional array of pixels  as shown by . The array of pixels  may be a planar array as shown in  or it may conform to a non-planar shape and hence a surface defined by the leading surfaces of the pixels  may assume a three dimensional shape.","As can be seen in , each pixel  preferably comprises three basic parts:","(1) a horn antenna  that collects incoming millimeter wave energy and transitions the incoming electromagnetic fields from free-space to a ridged waveguide . The horn antenna  is depicted in an exploded perspective in the upper portion  and greater detail in  and D which present a top down view and a cross sectional view, respectively, of the horn antenna . The sectional view of  is taken along lines D-D shown in . The horn antenna  is preferably formed from a block  of electrically conductive material such as a metal. Lines  represent small indentations which may (or may not) occur on the interior walls of the horn antenna  as a byproduct of machining the horn antenna from a block of metallic material. These indentations  do not seem to affect the RF performance of the antenna  in any appreciable way and therefor the indentations may be omitted. The block  has the horn antenna  formed at one end thereof and a ridged waveguide  coupled to a distal end or throat of the horn antenna .","(2) a transition substrate  preferably contains a detector diode chip , RF pick-up probes  which receive millimeter wave energy from the ridged waveguide  and brings it to the detector chip  via conductors , and differential DC video lines  for carrying a rectified millimeter wave signal to pads \u2032 which are coupled to the center conductor of coaxial lines  depicted in . The detector diode chip  is preferably flip-chip bonded to conductors on the transition substrate . The transition substrate  is depicted in perspective in the middle portion of  and greater detail in a perspective view of . It ends up being sandwiched between block  and a block . The transition substrate  is preferably formed of a dielectric material, such as fused silica (quartz), alumina, liquid crystal polymer or any other suitably rigid material preferably having a millimeter wave loss tangent less than 0.01.","(3) a pixel back structure formed by a electrically conductive block  with an cavity  therein that forms a waveguide tuning short circuit. The block  also has differential video signal output coaxial lines  for connection to post processing electronics (not shown). The pixel back structure  may be formed of a metal and is depicted in perspective view in the lower portion of  and its preferred internal arrangement is depicted in greater detail in a perspective view of . In order to simply , this figure shows the internal structure of the block  without showing its external shape or configuration, as its external shape or configuration is of less importance than its internal shape or configuration. This figure also shows that the detector chip  is received in cavity  when the transition substrate  is positioned adjacent block .  also shows the two co-axial transmission lines  whose center conductors are each coupled to an associated pad \u2032 shown in . Pads \u2032 mate with conductors  as shown. The exterior shields of the two co-axial transmission lines  are preferably formed by the body of block , which is preferably metallic. The two co-axial transmission lines  completely penetrate block  for connection to the aforementioned post processing electronics, while the cavity  does not penetrate the depth of block  and thus is open on one side of block  for receiving the detector chip  as already mentioned. The space between the coaxial transmission lines  to the block  may be filled with a dielectric material as is common with coaxial cables.","The size of the cavity  may be bigger than needed to just accommodate the detector chip . The cavity  preferably acts as a short circuit at the frequencies of interest to the antenna. It can be best sized using software such as Ansoft HFSS\u00ae to simulate the transition .","This pixel  can be part of a larger array, such as that depicted by , which would typically be located at the focus of an optical lens or reflector system as part of a millimeter wave imaging camera, for example. An exemplary the use of the millimeter wave pixels  described herein is in a two dimensional focal plane array  of pixels  as shown in . The blocks  forming the horn antenna  and ridged waveguide  may be formed as one larger integral block when formed in an array such as that described with reference to . Similarly, blocks  and insulating substrates  make likewise be formed as larger electrically conductive block and a larger insulating sheet when disposing a plurality of pixels in an array.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 5A","FIG. 5B","FIG. 4D","FIGS. 4C and 4D","FIGS. 4A and 4B"],"b":["18","18","10","14","12","18","18","32","32","16","18","20","17","16"],"i":["IEEE Microwave and Guided Wave Letters","IEEE Trans. On Electronics Packaging Manufacturing"]},"Other dielectric materials than fused silica may be used for the substrate  which supports detector chip and its associated conductors  and RF probes . As will be seen, openings may be placed in substrate  in order to accommodate different dielectric constants of the substrate  when different insulating materials are used.","The horn antenna  is preferably formed in electrically conductive plate or block  as shown in , but  only shows the ridged waveguide portion A of block  and not the horn antenna portion B of block  for ease of illustration.  are also drawn as if the depicted structure were transparent for ease of illustration and understanding the internal structures of and adjacent waveguide . A ridge preferably occurs in the waveguide  on either side thereof projecting in an inwardly direction as can perhaps be best seen in  so that the throat of the waveguide  preferably assumes what might be called a figure eight configuration. The ridge may extend all the way up the horn antenna with a more or less constant width as shown in  as opposed to decreasing to a knife edge as shown in . Likewise, the edge  of the horn antenna  may decrease to a knife edge as also shown in  or it may have a flatten surface as shown in .","A perspective close-up view of the detector chip  mounted on the substrate  is shown in . In this figure, the detector chip  and those portions of the elements on and in layer  are drawn in solid lines, while elements in or on the underside of chip  or hidden by layer  are shown in dotted or dashed lines. For the most part, block  is omitted, but openings forming channels in block  are shown, and in dashed lines, to show their arrangement relative to conductors  defined on substrate .","The detector chip  may have monolithic delay line inductors and silicon nitride capacitors (shown in dashed lines on ) for impedance matching of the detector diode in chip  to the transmission line  and the aforementioned post processing electronics. The monolithic matching circuit for the diode in chip  is preferably of the type disclosed in related U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/172,481. For a particular diode chip , the dimensions of the transition are preferably determined simultaneously with the dimensions of the MMIC tuning elements on the chip  in order to create an impedance match from the horn antenna input to the diode in the detector chip .","The transition shown in  preferably uses the following distributed tuning features to achieve a wideband impedance matched transformation from the horn antenna  to the diode in chip . First, the ridged waveguide  is formed in metal plate or block . The ridged waveguide  is used to expand the bandwidth over what is available for a rectangular waveguide by decreasing the cut-off frequency of the waveguide (see S. Ramo, J. R. Whinnery, and T. Van Duzer, \u201cField and Waves in Communications Electronics,\u201d 1st edition, John Wiley and Sons, 1965, pp. 465-467). In , the ridged waveguide  is defined by two intersecting cylinders (although other geometric shapes could be used) formed in a metal plate or block , the cylinders intersecting each other to help to define ridges . The ridges are elongated flat surfaces formed between the two cylinders (or other geometric shapes) near where they intersect. The two elongated flat surfaces in the throat of the waveguide  are each disposed parallel to, but spaced from, a plane intersecting the centers of the two cylinders . The two intersecting cylinders form a \u201cfigure eight\u201d configuration in with waveguide .","The operational frequency of the input signal to a pixel  and the bandwidth of the input signal to a pixel  as well as its impedance match to the RF pick-up probes  on the fused silica substrate  are controlled by the dimensions of the ridged waveguide . The maximum bandwidth of the input signal to pixel  is constrained on the lower frequency end by the cutoff frequency of the ridged waveguide and on the higher frequency end by the cutoff frequency of the next order mode (which is typically the second order mode). The reason for limiting the higher frequency end of the bandwidth is that otherwise going into the next (typically second) order mode would allow energy from a direction away from the imaged target to enter the pixel .","For the particular embodiment shown in , the cylinder radii are preferably 0.5 mm and their centerline-to-centerline distance is preferably maintained at 1.0 mm. A preferably 0.4 mm gap forms the ridges which are located in-between the cylinders on opposing sides of the waveguide  facing one another. This approach to creating ridged waveguide  in electrically conductive plate or block  should facilitate machining of the ridged waveguide  with standard metal working tools when block or plate  is made of a metal. Alternatively, block  and  could be injection molded out of a plastic material and then metal coated\u2014see the related copending U.S. Patent application referred to above. Second, a waveguide cavity  is also used to help tune the transition to the detector diode chip . Waveguide cavity  is formed in electrically conductive plate or block . For the particular embodiment of , the waveguide cavity  dimensions are preferably 1.85 mm\u00d71.0 mm\u00d70.7 mm. Finally, the fused silica substrate  is disposed between the electrically conductive plate or block  containing the ridged waveguide  and the electrically conductive plate or block  containing the back-short waveguide cavity . In order to prevent RF losses by parallel plate electromagnetic modes within the substrate , conductive via posts  are preferably located around the cavity\/ridged waveguide. These conductive via posts  may be fabricated using known thin film processing techniques (see, for example American Technical Ceramics \u201cThin Film Products Guideline,\u201d at www.atceramics.com\/products\/thinfilm.asp).","The arrangement and design of the detector diode chip  is depicted and described in greater detail in the above-mentioned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/172,481 filed 14 Jul. 2008. The diode attachment and RF probe metallization of the detector diode chip  is disposed on the side of the substrate  facing the back-short cavity . No metal RF signal connection is needed from the side of the substrate  attached to the ridged waveguide  to the side of the substrate  attached to the back-metal cavity . Posts  tie the ground planes on both sides of the substrate and prevent spurious substrate modes. The details of the RF probes  of this embodiment is best shown in . The two RF probes  are disposed symmetrically on the substrate  and receive the millimeter wave signal from the ridged waveguide  and also serve as differential terminals for the video output lines . In the related U.S. Patent Application referred to above, the video lines come off a capacitor on the chip . The technique shown here improves the bandwidth of the antenna. The dimensions of each RF probe  are adjusted for the optimum impedance match looking in from the ridged waveguide \u2014this adjustment can be made using software such as Ansoft HFSS\u00ae to simulate the transition . Each probe  in this embodiment is preferably 0.265 mm long, 0.25 mm wide near the chip , and 0.3 mm wide near the edge of cavity . Slots cut into each probe  form a short slotted transmission line that serves as an RF choke. The length of the slotted line is optimized for maximum isolation between the RF and video signals along the video output lines  preferably by using the simulation software noted above. The video output signal supplied to lines  originates on the diode chip  (see ) and is transmitted on conductors and via the probes  and thence to the video output connection pads \u2032 via conductors , as shown in . Conductors  are preferably arranged to pass through the back-side block  using channels (see ) cut or otherwise formed in the back-side block . The video lines  are preferably 0.025 mm wide and the channel dimensions in the back metal block  are preferably 0.08 mm\u00d70.1 mm. This channel is preferably sized to be too small for the millimeter wave signal of interest to propagate therethrough and therefore contributes to the RF isolation of the video output lines , yet each channel is big enough to accommodate one of the conductors .","This structure was simulated using Ansoft HFSS\u00ae for a Sb-heterostructure diode in chip  that was 0.8 \u03bcm\u00d70.8 \u03bcm in diameter (see the above-mentioned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/172,481 filed 14 Jul. 2008). The reflection from the transition  looking in from the waveguide is shown in the graph of , and the RF isolation from the video output line is shown in the graph of . The \u22125 dB bandwidth is 45 GHz, and an effective bandwidth (see J. Lynch, H. Moyer, J. Schulman, P. Lawyer, R. Bowen, J. Schaffner, D. Choudhury, J. Foschaar, and D. Chow, \u201cUnamplified Direct Detection Sensor for Passive Millimeter Wave Imaging,\u201d Proc. Of SPIE on Passive Millimeter-Wave Imaging Technology, eds. R. Appleby and D. Wilkner, Vol. 6211, 2006) of 68.4 GHz for an average detector sensitivity of about 7000 V\/W over the frequency band from 70 GHz to 140 GHz. The diode was modeled as a parallel combination of junction resistance of 1300\u03a9 and junction capacitance of 8 fF. A parasitic series resistance was also included in the diode model of 25\u03a9. Monolithic delay line inductors and capacitors were used to match the diode chip to the transition as taught by related U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/172,481; for this particular design the series delay line were 0.06 mm long, the parallel serpentine line had 0.02 mm ripples, and the parallel capacitor area was 0.055 mm\u00d70.055 mm with a 1900 \u212b layer of SiN.","Another embodiment of the wideband transition is fabricated with an alumina substrate  is shown in . In this embodiment, the transition uses an alumina substrate , preferably 0.1 mm thick, which substrate  has two openings therein to account for the higher dielectric constant of alumina as compared to the fused silica shown in the embodiment of . Electromagnetic simulation of the transition on a solid slab of alumina revealed spurious in-band resonances in the frequency dependent reflection coefficient. This was caused by the high dielectric constant of alumina, which is 9.8, that makes the substrate  appear electrically larger than that of the fused silica substrate  (which has a dielectric constant of 3.8) of the first described embodiment. This problem is solved in this latter embodiment by removing much of the alumina substrate  in way of the waveguide  of transition  using standard commercial processes, such as laser drilling (see, for example American Technical Ceramics \u201cThin Film Products Guideline,\u201d at www.atceramics.com\/products\/thinfilm.asp). Compare  with  noting the openings which occur in the alumina embodiment of  and not the fused silica embodiment of .","In , the detector diode chip  and transition probes  are located on a bridge of alumina, as shown in , which occurs between openings . In this figure, the width of the bridge is preferably 0.4 mm. The RF probe  dimensions are the same as for earlier fused silica embodiment, however, the slots for the RF choke need not be as long because of the higher dielectric constant of alumina compared to fused silica. All other waveguide and cavity dimensions are preferably the same as in the earlier fused silica embodiment. The simulated reflection coefficient as seen from the ridged waveguide and video line RF isolation is shown in . For this case the detector model was again the 0.8 \u03bcm\u00d70.8 \u03bcm diode, with monolithic diode matching elements of 0.08 mm for the series delay line inductors, 0.02 mm for the parallel delay line inductors, and a capacitor size of 0.05 mm\u00d70.05 mm. The \u22125 dB bandwidth is 45 GHz and the effective bandwidth is 62.4 GHz. is a graph of the RF isolation from the video output line according to a computer simulation of this second embodiment.","The openings in the embodiment of  are depicted as being rectangular, but any convenient and preferably geometric shape will likely serve the intended purpose of reducing the bulk dielectric constant of substrate .","It should be understood that the above-described embodiments are merely some possible examples of implementations of the presently disclosed technology, set forth for a clearer understanding of the principles of this disclosure.
