{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["Mobile-terminated messages may be sent from a valid mobile directory number (MDN), a valid telephone number (TN), or a valid Internet-to-mobile message provider to mobile subscribers from sources on different carrier networks. Such messages may be sent in a broadcast manner such that a large volume of message traffic may be generated from the same MDN or TN in a short period of time. Some mobile-terminated messages are unwanted and are also known as SPAM.","The leading number of each reference number within the drawings indicates the figure in which that reference number is introduced and\/or detailed. As such, a detailed discussion of reference number  would be found and\/or introduced in . Reference number  is introduced in , etc.","This disclosure details the implementation of methods, systems and computer program products for a mobile-terminated message SPAM restrictor (hereinafter, \u201cM-SPAM Restrictor\u201d). In one embodiment, M-SPAM Restrictor systems implement a live application at a mobile network element that interacts with message services, whereby a message rate limit is set on the network element, and a message source may be blocked from further messaging activity if it exceeds the rate limit, until the offending source has resolved the issue with the service provider (carrier).","For example, in one embodiment, the M-SPAM Restrictor application may be installed in the Short Message Peer-to-Peer (SMPP) gateway of a mobile cellular network. A rate limit, e.g. 10 Mega bits per second (Mb\/second) for a message source, is set in the SMPP gateway to monitor the Short Message Service (SMS) traffic from any possible message source. In another implementation, the rate limit may be set as the average number of messages received per second from a message source, e.g. 10 SMS per second. Once the SMPP gateway detects that one message source, e.g. a valid mobile directory number (MDN), is generating large volumes of SMS traffic which exceed the rate limit of 10 Mb\/s, the SMPP gateway may block the offending MDN for any further SMS traffic by refusing to route SMS data from the offending MDN to any message delivery platforms, e.g. a Short Message Service Center (SMSC). The restraint on the offending MDN may be removed by a system administrator after the registered user of the MDN has negotiated with the carrier and received approval for further SMS service.","In one embodiment, a method is disclosed, comprising: receiving a plurality of mobile terminated messages from a message source; estimating an instant message rate of the message source based on the received plurality of mobile terminated messages; accessing a message rate limit for the message source; comparing the estimated message rate of the message source with the accessed message rate limit; and identifying the message source as a SPAM suspect and suspending all subsequent messages sent from the message source if the estimated message rate of the message source exceeds than the accessed message rate limit.","It is to be understood that, depending on the particular needs and\/or characteristics of a M-SPAM Restrictor application, administrator, server, data payload, monetization model, hardware configuration, network framework, and\/or the like, various embodiments of the M-SPAM Restrictor may be implemented that enable a great deal of flexibility and customization. The instant disclosure discusses embodiments of the M-SPAM Restrictor primarily within the context of message SPAM of wireless cellular communications. However, it is to be understood that the system described herein may be readily configured\/customized for a wide range of other applications or implementations. For example, aspects of the M-SPAM Restrictor may be adapted for wired telephony services (e.g. telephone call SPAM, etc), computer-based communications (e.g. E-mail SPAM, online instant message SPAM, etc.), and\/or the like applications. It is to be understood that the M-SPAM Restrictor may be further adapted to other implementations or communications and\/or data transmission applications, such as but not limited to Internet Protocol Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), and\/or the like.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["110","120","111","140","150","113","113","122","124","110","110","110","113","122","124","122","111"]},"In one embodiment, an M-SPAM Restrictor server  may be equipped at the gateway . The M-SPAM Restrictor server  may be applied on any network element that processes messages, such as, but not limited to SMPP Gateway, SMSC, Multimedia Message Service Center (MMSC), Wireless Intelligent Gateway (WIG), and\/or the like. In another embodiment, an M-SPAM Restrictor may be directly installed at the device of a message source .","As will be illustrated in one embodiment in , the M-SPAM Restrictor server  may monitor the messaging traffic generated from the message source , and determine if there is any SPAM activity. Once a SPAM source has been identified, the M-SPAM Restrictor server  may inform the message source  by sending a notice and blocking further messaging activity, and then submit the information of the SPAM source to a system administrator . In one embodiment, the system administrator  may be a managing operator of the carrier of the communication network .","In one embodiment, the M-SPAM Restrictor server  may also communicate with an M-SPAM Restrictor database . In some embodiments, an M-SPAM Restrictor server  may be integrated with a local M-SPAM Restrictor database . In other embodiments, an M-SPAM Restrictor server  may access a remote M-SPAM Restrictor database  via a network backbone , or the communication network . In one implementation, the M-SPAM Restrictor server  may send information of a SPAM source to the database , such as once the SPAM source is identified. The M-SPAM Restrictor server  may also submit and store data recording messaging traffic associated with one or more message sources in the M-SPAM Restrictor database . In one embodiment, the M-SPAM Restrictor database may provide historical data of messaging traffic to the M-SPAM Restrictor server  for functional purposes, e.g. for determining a rate limit (as will be illustrated in ).","A message source  blocked for message service as being a SPAM source may in one implementation, communicate with the system administrator  and the system administrator  may send indications to the M-SPAM Restrictor server  establishing whether to resume message service for the offending source. In another embodiment, the system administrator  may communicate with the M-SPAM Restrictor server  and the M-SPAM Restrictor database  for regular maintenance, service failure, system updates, database renewal, and\/or the like. In one embodiment, the system administrator  may directly operate with the M-SPAM server  and the M-SPAM Restrictor database  on an in-house basis. In another embodiment, the system administrator  may remotely access the M-SPAM Restrictor server  and the M-SPAM Restrictor database  to engage its functionality via the communication network . In one implementation, the system administrator  may report to a regulatory authority  regarding an offending source, for example, when the offending source has violated the law, e.g. the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act (CAN-SPAM Act) of 2003.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["201","205"]},"In one embodiment, the M-SPAM Restrictor controller  may be housed separately from other modules and\/or databases within the M-SPAM Restrictor system, while in another embodiment, some or all of the other modules and\/or databases may be housed within and\/or configured as part of the M-SPAM Restrictor controller. Further detail regarding implementations of M-SPAM Restrictor controller operation, modules, and databases is provided below.","In the implementation illustrated in , the M-SPAM Restrictor controller  may be configured to couple to external entities via a communications interface . The communications interface may, for example, configure messages sent from a message source, SPAM report information to a regulatory authority, and receipt and\/or transmission of data to an external and\/or network database. In various implementations, a communications interface  may, for example, serve to configure data into application, transport, network, media access control, and\/or physical layer formats in accordance with a wireless cellular communication protocol, such as, but not limited to Global System for Mobile communications (GSM), Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), and\/or the like. The communications interface  may further be configurable to implement and\/or translate Wireless Application Protocol (WAP), TCP\/IP, and\/or the like data formats and\/or protocols. The communications interface  may further house one or more ports, jacks, antennas, and\/or the like to facilitate wired and\/or wireless communications with and\/or within the M-SPAM Restrictor system. In one implementation, the M-SPAM Restrictor controller  may also be configured to couple to a user interface . The user interface  may, for example, receive control indications and data information from an external user input, or output information to an external user. In one embodiment, the user interface  may include, but is not limited to, keyboard(s), mouse(s), display screen(s), electronic stylus(es), printer(s), and\/or the like.","In one implementation, the M-SPAM Restrictor controller  may further be coupled to a plurality of modules configured to implement M-SPAM functionality and\/or services. A messaging activity analysis module  may, in one implementation, be configurable to monitor the messaging traffic of one or more message sources, and determine a message rate limit, such as may be based on stored traffic data, simulation models, and\/or the like. The messaging activity analysis module  may, in one implementation, be further configurable to communicate with a messaging activity database  to record historical data of message traffic. For example, in one embodiment, the message activity analysis module  may generate message traffic reports based on the historical data stored in the messaging activity database  as will be illustrated in . In one embodiment, the messaging activity analysis module  may determine a message rate limit based on historical data and human behavioral simulation models, as will be illustrated in one implementation in . For example, in one embodiment, the message rate limit may be determined by the simulated message rate by human behaviors, wherein associated with sending a message, including consideration of the time associated with selecting a messaging mode (text, picture or video), entering message destination, composing the message, sending the message, waiting for a \u201cmessage sent\u201d response, clearing the \u201cmessage sent\u201d response, and\/or the like.","A messaging control module  may, in some embodiments, block an offending message source for any further message activity if the message rate from such source is equal to and\/or higher than the rate limit determined by the messaging activity analysis module , and\/or remove blockage of message service of the offending message source upon approval of the system administrator of the carrier. In some embodiments, the messaging control module  may be configured to communicate with messaging activity database  to record offending sources, and\/or update the information accordingly in a users database . For example, the messaging control module  may record the activity of the offending source in an associated user profile in the users database . A violation report module  may, in some embodiments, communicate with the messaging control module  to collect SPAM information and submit it to a regulatory authority.","In one implementation, the M-SPAM Restrictor controller  may further be coupled to one or more databases configured to store and\/or maintain M-SPAM Restrictor data. A users database  may contain information pertaining to message sources and\/or destinations, contact information, profile information, identities of hardware devices, Customer Premise Equipments (CPEs), and\/or the like associated with users, message service preferences, message history, SPAM history, system settings, and\/or the like. In one implementation, the users database  may record a SPAM history of a user, e.g. if a user is once identified as a SPAM source, relevant data of the SPAM violation such as date and time, instant message rate, may be recorded. A hardware database  may contain information pertaining to hardware devices with which the M-SPAM Restrictor system may communicate, such as but not limited to message servers, user telephony devices, CPEs, gateways, routers, and\/or the like. The hardware database  may specify transmission protocols, data formats, and\/or the like suitable for communicating with hardware devices employed by any of a variety of M-SPAM Restrictor affiliated entities. A messaging activity database  may contain data pertaining to messaging traffic recorded previously and\/or updated by the message activity analysis module, which includes information such as, but not limited to real-time data workload of messaging traffic, statistical results of messaging traffic (e.g., classified by geographical distributions, message type, source type, and\/or the like; in one implementation, statistical results may be dynamically updated based on characteristics of identified SPAM sources), records of offending SPAM sources, and\/or the like (as will be illustrated in ). A rules database  may store related regulatory rules of message SPAM.","The M-SPAM Restrictor database may be implemented using various data-structures, such as, but not limited to, an array, hash, (linked) list, struct, structured text file (e.g., XML), table, and\/or the like.

This information may be stored associated with the messaging activity in the messaging activity database .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":"305"},"The M-SPAM Restrictor server may constantly, periodically, and\/or intermittently monitor and record the messaging activity of the message source  and estimate a message rate of the message source . For example, in one embodiment, the M-SPAM Restrictor server may record the total volume of message traffic originated from the message source within a fixed short time interval starting at the instant time, and the instant message rate may then be calculated by dividing the recorded message traffic by the length of the short time interval. In one implementation, the length of the short time interval may be predetermined by a system administrator (e.g., 10 milliseconds). The M-SPAM Restrictor server may then access a determined rate limit , and compare the instant message rate of the message source with the rate limit. The message rate limit may be determined  in different ways, which will be further illustrated in one implementation in . In one implementation, the rate limit may be a constant value specified for a particular message source, or a constant value over a period of time and\/or geographical location. In another implementation, the rate limit may be a dynamic formula of several variables. For example, in one embodiment, the rate limit of a message source may be a function of various factors, such as, but not limited to time and date, geographical location, messaging activity of interrelated message sources, weighing factors from historical statistics and\/or the like. If the instant message rate does not exceed the rate limit , the message may be directed to a message delivery platform  e.g. an SMPP gateway, SMSC, etc., for further processing. If the estimated instant message rate exceeds the rate limit , the M-SPAM Restrictor server may then, in one embodiment, record and count the violation  and further determine whether the degree of violations exceeds a tolerance level defined by the system administrator , such as, but not limited to the accumulated number of violations exceeding a predetermined maximum value, and\/or the like. If the recorded violations have not exceeded the tolerance level, the system may then route the message to its destination via the delivery platform . Otherwise, if the recorded violations have met the upper bound, the M-SPAM Restrictor server may discard any intended messages from the source, and block and\/or instruct the blockage of the message source for any further messaging activity . For example, in one embodiment, the M-SPAM Restrictor server may filter the SPAM message at the SMPP gateway. In one implementation, the M-SPAM Restrictor may store unsent messages in a repository, such as for subsequent review by a system administrator. In one embodiment, the M-SPAM Restrictor server may block the message service  once a SPAM violation is detected without counting accumulations. In one embodiment, if the M-SPAM Restrictor server receives indications from the system administrator requesting permission for the offending source to resume message service , the M-SPAM Restrictor server may then resume regular message service of the message source , and keep monitoring the message activity of the source. If no permission request is received from the system administrator, then the message source may remain prohibited from any message activity and may wait  until the blockage is removed.","In some embodiments, the M-SPAM Restrictor server may periodically collect and process messaging activity data . In one implementation, the M-SPAM Restrictor server may then mark the frequently offending sources  based on the collected messaging activity data, and\/or report the SPAM sources to a message SPAM regulatory authority . In one embodiment, the M-SPAM Restrictor server may also determine to report to a message SPAM regulatory authority  when severe violations have been committed by the message source at . In another implementation, the M-SPAM Restrictor server may utilize collected messaging activity data to generate message activity summary reports , which will be further illustrated in one implementation in . The generated reports of messaging activity may be applied in one implementation as historical data to facilitate modeling and determining the message rate limit .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIGS. 4A-4C","FIG. 4A","FIG. 4C","FIG. 4B"],"b":["430","435","405"]},"For example, in some embodiments, as shown in , a Monte Carlo simulation may be implemented to simulate the process of sending a message. The M-SPAM Restrictor may determine a maximum number of trials for the Monte Carlo simulation , and a counting variable for trial number as zero . At every trial, the simulator may record a first timestamp tand then simulate messaging activities such as selecting messaging mode as text, picture or video , entering the message destination , composing the message , sending the message , waiting for the \u201cmessage sent\u201d response , and clearing the display of \u201cmessage sent\u201d response , wherein the time to accomplish each step may be assumed to follow certain probabilistic distributions, such as, but not limited to, Poisson distributions, exponential distributions, normal distributions, and\/or the like. The simulator may then record a second timestamp t and calculate a simulated message rate for the instant trial by 1\/(tt) , and update the trial number  by adding one. The simulator may then determine whether the trial number has met the set maximum value of trial number . If not, the simulation may continue at step . If the maximum number of trials has been reached, the Monte Carlo trial is terminated and an average message rate may be calculated based on the recorded message rates of past trials . In one embodiment, the time to accomplish each step may be assumed to be a constant, and the message rate limit may be determined by summing up all of the estimated times to accomplish each message activity. The M-SPAM Restrictor server may then leverage the simulated message rate to determine a rate limit for a message source, for example, by increasing the simulated message rate with a predetermined percentage. In another embodiment, dynamic factors  may be further incorporated into the framework of determining the rate limit, such as time , location , administrative weighting factors , and\/or the like. For example, the message rate limit may differ by time , as holiday seasons may witness higher non-SPAM message volumes. In another embodiment, message sources may be grouped as interrelated message sources  by their contact relations, such that frequent message activity between close contacts may not be identified as SPAM activity. In one implementation, certain administrative weighting factors  may also be included, such as, but not limited to the service plan of the message source, and\/or the like.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 4C","FIG. 4C","FIG. 4C"],"b":["450","455","460","451","452","453","454","451","452","453","454","451","454"]},"In one embodiment, message rate limits determined based on the messaging activity reports may be different over time, geographical regions, message types, message origin types, and\/or the like. For example, in , the third quarter of the year has, been shown to have higher message traffic and may be set with a higher message rate limit during the time period. For another example, Internet originated messages may be set with a higher message rate limit than other origin types as Internet-to-mobile message traffic is higher than the other two origin types as shown in the sample report  of .","M-SPAM Restrictor Controller",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":"501"},"Typically, users, which may be people and\/or other systems, engage information technology systems (e.g., commonly computers) to facilitate information processing.

The system clock typically has a crystal oscillator and provides a base signal. The clock is typically coupled to the system bus and various clock multipliers that will increase or decrease the base operating frequency for other components interconnected in the computer systemization. The clock and various components in a computer systemization drive signals embodying information throughout the system. Such transmission and reception of signals embodying information throughout a computer systemization may be commonly referred to as communications. These communicative signals may further be transmitted, received, and the cause of return and\/or reply signal communications beyond the instant computer systemization to: communications networks, input devices, other computer systemizations, peripheral devices, and\/or the like. Of course, any of the above components may be connected directly to one another, connected to the CPU, and\/or organized in numerous variations employed as exemplified by various computer systems.","The CPU comprises at least one high-speed data processor adequate to execute program components for executing user and\/or system-generated requests.

In one example, the power source  is connected to the system bus component . In an alternative embodiment, an outside power source  is provided through a connection across the I\/O  interface. For example, a USB and\/or IEEE 1394 connection carries both data and power across the connection and is therefore a suitable source of power.","Interface Adapters","Interface bus(es)  may accept, connect, and\/or communicate to a number of interface adapters, conventionally although not necessarily in the form of adapter cards, such as, but not limited to: input output interfaces (I\/O) , storage interfaces , network interfaces , and\/or the like.

The video interface composites information generated by a computer systemization and generates video signals based on the composited information in a video memory frame. Typically, the video interface provides the composited video information through a video connection interface that accepts a video display interface (e.g., an RCA composite video connector accepting an RCA composite video cable; a DVI connector accepting a DVI display cable, etc.).","User input devices  may be card readers, dongles, finger print readers, gloves, graphics tablets, joysticks, keyboards, mouse (mice), remote controls, retina readers, trackballs, trackpads, and\/or the like.","Peripheral devices  may be connected and\/or communicate to I\/O and\/or other facilities of the like such as network interfaces, storage interfaces, and\/or the like.

Other commercially available specialized cryptographic processors include VLSI Technology's 33 MHz 6868 or Semaphore Communications' 40 MHz Roadrunner 184.","Memory","Generally, any mechanization and\/or embodiment allowing a processor to affect the storage and\/or retrieval of information is regarded as memory . However, memory is a fungible technology and resource; thus, any number of memory embodiments may be employed in lieu of or in concert with one another. It is to be understood that the M-SPAM Restrictor controller and\/or a computer systemization may employ various forms of memory . For example, a computer systemization may be configured wherein the functionality of on-chip. CPU memory (e.g., registers), RAM, ROM, and any other storage devices are provided by a paper punch tape or paper punch card mechanism; of course, such an embodiment would result in an extremely slow rate of operation.

These components may be stored and accessed from the storage devices and\/or from storage devices accessible through an interface bus. Although non-conventional program components such as those in the component collection, typically, are stored in a local storage device , they may also be loaded and\/or stored in memory such as: peripheral devices, RAM, remote storage facilities through a communications network, ROM, various forms of memory, and\/or the like.","Operating System","The operating system component  is an executable program component facilitating the operation of the M-SPAM Restrictor controller. Typically, the operating system facilitates access of I\/O, network interfaces, peripheral devices, storage devices, and\/or the like. The operating system may be a highly fault tolerant, scalable, and secure system such as: Apple Macintosh OS X (Server); AT&T Plan 9; Be OS; Unix and Unix and Unix-like system distributions (such as AT&T's UNIX; Berkley Software Distribution (BSD) variations such as FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and\/or the like; Linux distributions such as Red Hat, Ubuntu, and\/or the like); and\/or the like operating systems.

An operating system may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or the like. Most frequently, the operating system communicates with other program components, user interfaces, and\/or the like. For example, the operating system may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, and\/or responses. The operating system, once executed by the CPU, may enable the interaction with communications networks, data, I\/O, peripheral devices, program components, memory, user input devices, and\/or the like. The operating system may provide communications protocols that allow the M-SPAM Restrictor controller to communicate with other entities through a communications network . Various communication protocols may be used by the M-SPAM Restrictor controller as a subcarrier transport mechanism for interaction, such as, but not limited to: multicast, TCP\/IP, UDP, unicast, and\/or the like.","Information Server","An information server component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU. The information server may be a conventional Internet information server such as, but not limited to Apache Software Foundation's Apache, Microsoft's Internet Information Server, and\/or the like. The information server may allow for the execution of program components through facilities such as Active Server Page (ASP), ActiveX, (ANSI) (Objective-) C (++), C# and\/or .NET, Common Gateway Interface (CGI) scripts, Java, JavaScript, Practical Extraction Report Language (PERL), Hypertext Pre-Processor (PHP), pipes, Python, WebObjects, and\/or the like. The information server may support secure communications protocols such as, but not limited to, File Transfer Protocol (FTP); HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP); Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTPS), Secure Socket Layer (SSL), messaging protocols (e.g., America Online (AOL) Instant Messenger (AIM), Application Exchange (APEX), ICQ, Internet Relay Chat (IRC), Microsoft Network (MSN) Messenger Service, Presence and Instant Messaging Protocol (PRIM), Internet Engineering Task Force's (IETF's) Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), SIP for Instant Messaging and Presence Leveraging Extensions (SIMPLE), open XML-based Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) (i.e., Jabber or Open Mobile Alliance's (OMA's) Instant Messaging and Presence Service (IMPS)), Yahoo! Instant Messenger Service, and\/or the like. The information server provides results in the form of Web pages to Web browsers, and allows for the manipulated generation of the Web pages through interaction with other program components. After a Domain Name System (DNS) resolution portion of an HTTP request is resolved to a particular information server, the information server resolves requests for information at specified locations on the M-SPAM Restrictor controller based on the remainder of the HTTP request. For example, a request such as http:\/\/123.124.125.126\/myInformation.html might have the IP portion of the request \u201c123.124.125.126\u201d resolved by a DNS server to an information server at that IP address; that information server might in turn further parse the http request for the \u201c\/myInformation.html\u201d portion of the request and resolve it to a location in memory containing the information \u201cmyInformation.html.\u201d. Additionally, other information serving protocols may be employed across various ports, e.g., FTP communications across port , and\/or the like. An information server may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the information server communicates with the M-SPAM Restrictor database , operating systems, other program components, user interfaces, Web browsers, and\/or the like.","Access to the M-SPAM Restrictor database may be achieved through a number of database bridge mechanisms such as through scripting languages as enumerated below (e.g., CGI) and through inter-application communication channels as enumerated below (e.g., CORBA, WebObjects, etc.). Any data requests through a Web browser are parsed through the bridge mechanism into appropriate grammars as required by the M-SPAM Restrictor system. In one embodiment, the information server would provide a Web form accessible by a Web browser. Entries made into supplied fields in the Web form are tagged as having been entered into the particular fields, and parsed as such. The entered terms are then passed along with the field tags, which act to instruct the parser to generate queries directed to appropriate tables and\/or fields. In one embodiment, the parser may generate queries in standard SQL by instantiating a search string with the proper join\/select commands based on the tagged text entries, wherein the resulting command is provided over the bridge mechanism to the M-SPAM Restrictor system as a query. Upon generating query results from the query, the results are passed over the bridge mechanism, and may be parsed for formatting and generation of a new results Web page by the bridge mechanism. Such a new results Web page is then provided to the information server, which may supply it to the requesting Web browser.","Also, an information server may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, and\/or responses.","User Interface","The function of computer interfaces in some respects is similar to automobile operation interfaces. Automobile operation interface elements such as steering wheels, gearshifts, and speedometers facilitate the access, operation, and display of automobile resources, functionality, and status. Computer interaction interface elements such as check boxes, cursors, menus, scrollers, and windows (collectively and commonly referred to as widgets) similarly facilitate the access, operation, and display of data and computer hardware and operating system resources, functionality, and status. Operation interfaces are commonly called user interfaces.

Of course, in entity of a Web browser and information server, a combined application may be developed to perform similar functions of both. The combined application would similarly affect the obtaining and the provision of information to users, user agents, and\/or the like from the M-SPAM Restrictor system enabled nodes. The combined application may be nugatory on systems employing standard Web browsers.","Mail Server","A mail server component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU . The mail server may be a conventional Internet mail server such as, but not limited to sendmail, Microsoft Exchange, and\/or the like.

Cryptographic processor interfaces will allow for expedition of encryption and\/or decryption requests by the cryptographic component; however, the cryptographic component, alternatively, may run on a conventional CPU. The cryptographic component allows for the encryption and\/or decryption of provided data. The cryptographic component allows for both symmetric and asymmetric (e.g., Pretty Good Protection (PGP)) encryption and\/or decryption. The cryptographic component may employ cryptographic techniques such as, but not limited to: digital certificates (e.g., X.509 authentication framework), digital signatures, dual signatures, enveloping, password access protection, public key management, and\/or the like. The cryptographic component will facilitate numerous (encryption and\/or decryption) security protocols such as, but not limited to: checksum, Data Encryption Standard (DES), Elliptical Curve Encryption (ECC), International Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA), Message Digest 5 (MD5, which is a one way hash function), passwords, Rivest Cipher (RC5), Rijndael, RSA (which is an Internet encryption and authentication system that uses an algorithm developed in 1977 by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman), Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA), Secure Socket Layer (SSL), Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTPS), and\/or the like. Employing such encryption security protocols, the M-SPAM Restrictor system may encrypt all incoming and\/or outgoing communications and may serve as node within a virtual private network (VPN) with a wider communications network. The cryptographic component facilitates the process of \u201csecurity authorization\u201d whereby access to a resource is inhibited by a security protocol wherein the cryptographic component effects authorized access to the secured resource.

The cryptographic component may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, and\/or responses.","The M-SPAM Restrictor Database","The M-SPAM Restrictor database component  may be embodied in a database and its stored data. The database is a stored program component, which is executed by the CPU; the stored program component portion configuring the CPU to process the stored data. The database may be a conventional, fault tolerant, relational, scalable, secure database such as Oracle or Sybase. Relational databases are an extension of a flat file. Relational databases consist of a series of related tables. The tables are interconnected via a key field. Use of the key field allows the combination of the tables by indexing against the key field; i.e., the key fields act as dimensional pivot points for combining information from various tables. Relationships generally identify links maintained between tables by matching primary keys. Primary keys represent fields that uniquely identify the rows of a table in a relational database. More precisely, they uniquely identify rows of a table on the \u201cone\u201d side of a one-to-many relationship.","Alternatively, the M-SPAM Restrictor database may be implemented using various standard data-structures, such as an array, hash, (linked) list, struct, structured text file (e.g., XML), table, and\/or the like. Such data-structures may be stored in memory and\/or in (structured) files. In another alternative, an object-oriented database may be used, such as Frontier, ObjectStore, Poet, Zope, and\/or the like. Object databases can include a number of object collections that are grouped and\/or linked together by common attributes; they may be related to other object collections by some common attributes. Object-oriented databases perform similarly to relational databases with the exception that objects are not just pieces of data, but may have other types of functionality encapsulated within a given object. If the M-SPAM Restrictor database is implemented as a data-structure, the use of the M-SPAM Restrictor database  may be integrated into another component such as the M-SPAM Restrictor component . Also, the database may be implemented as a mix of data structures, objects, and relational structures. Databases may be consolidated and\/or distributed in countless variations through standard data processing techniques. Portions of databases, e.g., tables, may be exported and\/or imported and thus decentralized and\/or integrated.","In one embodiment, the database component  includes several tables -.

A regulatory rules may include fields such as, but not limited to: rule_ID, rule_content, rule_authority, rule_time, and\/or the like. These tables may support and\/or track multiple entity accounts on the M-SPAM Restrictor controller.","In one embodiment, the M-SPAM Restrictor database may interact with other database systems. For example, employing a distributed database system, queries and data access by search M-SPAM Restrictor component may treat the combination of the M-SPAM Restrictor database, an integrated data security layer database as a single database entity.","In one embodiment, user programs may contain various user interface primitives, which may serve to update the M-SPAM Restrictor system. Also, various accounts may require custom database tables depending upon the environments and the types of clients the M-SPAM Restrictor system may need to serve. It should be noted that any unique fields may be designated as a key field throughout. In an alternative embodiment, these tables have been decentralized into their own databases and their respective database controllers (i.e., individual database controllers for each of the above tables). Employing standard data processing techniques, one may further distribute the databases over several computer systemizations and\/or storage devices. Similarly, configurations of the decentralized database controllers may be varied by consolidating and\/or distributing the various database components -.

Similarly, the component collection may be combined in any number of ways to facilitate deployment and\/or development. To accomplish this, one may integrate the components into a common code base or in a facility that can dynamically load the components on demand in an integrated fashion.","The component collection may be consolidated and\/or distributed in countless variations through standard data processing and\/or development techniques. Multiple instances of any one of the program components in the program component collection may be instantiated on a single node, and\/or across numerous nodes to improve performance through load-balancing and\/or data-processing techniques. Furthermore, single instances may also be distributed across multiple controllers and\/or storage devices; e.g., databases. All program component instances and controllers working in concert may do so through standard data processing communication techniques.","The configuration of the M-SPAM Restrictor controller will depend on the context of system deployment. Factors such as, but not limited to, the budget, capacity, location, and\/or use of the underlying hardware resources may affect deployment requirements and configuration. Regardless of if the configuration results in more consolidated and\/or integrated program components, results in a more distributed series of program components, and\/or results in some combination between a consolidated and distributed configuration, data may be communicated, obtained, and\/or provided. Instances of components consolidated into a common code base from the program component collection may communicate, obtain, and\/or provide data. This may be accomplished through intra-application data processing communication techniques such as, but not limited to: data referencing (e.g., pointers), internal messaging, object instance variable communication, shared memory space, variable passing, and\/or the like.","If component collection components are discrete, separate, and\/or external to one another, then communicating, obtaining, and\/or providing data with and\/or to other component components may be accomplished through inter-application data processing communication techniques such as, but not limited to: Application Program Interfaces (API) information passage; (distributed) Component Object Model ((D)COM), (Distributed) Object Linking and Embedding ((D)OLE), and\/or the like), Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA), local and remote application program interfaces Jini, Remote Method Invocation (RMI), process pipes, shared files, and\/or the like. Messages sent between discrete component components for inter-application communication or within memory spaces of a singular component for intra-application communication may be facilitated through the creation and parsing of a grammar. A grammar may be developed by using standard development tools such as lex, yacc, XML, and\/or the like, which allow for grammar generation and parsing functionality, which in turn may form the basis of communication messages within and between components.
