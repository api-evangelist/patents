{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present disclosure generally relates to treatment management, and more particularly to the use of mobile devices to manage treatment regimens.","Many diseases are treated with courses of treatment that can involve several different prescription drugs that should be taken at specific intervals. For example, new prescription drugs have come into the market for the treatment of hepatitis C. These drugs include boceprevir and teleprevir, and can have a complex treatment regiment identified by a doctor.","Example methods and systems for treatment regimen management are described. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of example embodiments. It will be evident, however, to one of ordinary skill in the art that embodiments of the invention may be practiced without these specific details.","The treatment of some diseases or ailments may utilize relatively complex treatment regimens that may involve multiple treatments. The treatments may include medications of various types and administration modalities, such as injections, or administration, or the like. For example, some treatment regimens for hepatitis C, HIV, as well as other diseases and\/or ailments, may utilize three or more different medications that have different administration modalities, including injection and oral administrations that may be undertaken at different intervals and over different time periods. The efficacy of the treatment may require relatively consistent compliance to the treatment regimen. That is, the efficacy of the treatment may require that the patient generally follow the treatment regimen, in terms of consistently undertaking the prescribed treatments in manner and at the times recommended by the treatment regimen. The methods and systems may generally be used to assist a person who is undergoing a treatment regiment to manage the various medications, tests and other aspects of their treatment. Each of the various aspects of the treatment regimen, including medications and tests, are commonly referred to as a treatment herein.","In some embodiments, treatments associated with the treatment regimen may be scheduled through a mobile electronic device or portable communication device, and reminders, or other indicators, of a scheduled treatment may be received.","In some embodiments, the ability to schedule treatments and receive reminders or indicators of a scheduled treatment may increase compliance with a treatment regimen. Therefore, a patient undertaking a complicated treatment regimen may be more likely to adhere to the treatment regimen and receive successful treatment.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","100","102","106","104"]},"The mobile electronic device  is generally used to facilitate management of a treatment regimen by a device operator. The device operator may be a patient undergoing a treatment regimen. However, the device operator may be another person operating the mobile electronic device  on behalf of the patient. Examples of such people include parents, guardians and caregivers. Accordingly, while some illustrative embodiments may be described herein in which the device operator may be the patient, it should be appreciated that the device operator may be an individual other than the patient.","In some embodiments, the patient may utilize the mobile electronic device  manage the treatment regimen to assist them in undertaking the appropriate treatment at the appropriate time, according to a treatment schedule defined, at least in part, by the treatment regimen. For example, some treatment regimens may require multiple medications, or treatments such as lab tests, to be undertaken at designated times and\/or on a continuous or regular basis over a defined period of time.","The mobile electronic device  may be a stand-alone device that solely provides at least some of the functionality to enable treatment regimen management, or may be a multi-use device that has functionality outside of treatment regimen management as described herein. Examples of the mobile electronic device  include an IPHONE device by Apple, Inc., mobile electronic devices powered by ANDROID by Google, Inc., and a BLACKBERRY device by Research In Motion Limited.

The multiple networks may communicate in series with each other to link the devices , ,  or in parallel to link the devices , , .","In some embodiments, at least some of the functionality of the application provider device  may be included in the treatment management device . In such embodiments, the application may be downloadable directly from the treatment management device  or at direction of the treatment management device  from the database , which may store the application.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["102","102","102","100"]},"The mobile electronic device  may include a treatment regimen management subsystem , and a treatment diary subsystem . While the various subsystems will be described as discrete subsystems for the purpose of explanation, the various functions of the subsystems may overlap with one another, and\/or be performed, at least in part, by another of the subsystems. For the purpose of description, the subsystems and modules of the treatment regimen management subsystem  may be described as being embodied within the treatment management app. However, in some embodiments, one or more of the subsystems, modules, or both, may be fully, or partially, embodied in hardware, or may be fully, or partially, embodied in a separate application.","In general, the treatment regimen management subsystem  may allow the device operator to manage a treatment regimen to assist a patient, who may be the device operator or other individual, in undertaking the appropriate treatment at the appropriate time, according to a treatment schedule defined, at least in part, by the treatment regimen. For example, some treatment regimens may require multiple medications, or treatments such as lab tests, to be undertaken at designated times and\/or on a continuous or regular basis over a defined period of time. Management of the treatment regimen may include, for example, identifying a treatment regimen associated with the patient, as well as scheduling and providing alerts corresponding to times at which a treatment should be undertaken.","Treatment diary subsystem  may enable the device operator to input and\/or store information regarding aspects of the treatment regimen. Aspects of the treatment regimen may include, for example, information regarding compliance\/noncompliance with the treatment regimen, side-effects of the treatment, and\/or other information relevant to the treatment regimen. In some embodiments, the diary subsystem  may allow the device operator to input and\/or store information in a free form format, responsive to specific questions, and\/or a combination thereof. According to some embodiments, the treatment diary subsystem  may be capable of transmitting at least a portion of the treatment diary information, e.g., to a physician treating the patient, or to another third party. Transmission of treatment diary information may be controlled and\/or configured by the device operator.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["106","106","100"]},"The treatment management device  may include the treatment regimen management subsystem , and\/or the treatment diary subsystem . In some embodiments one or more of the various subsystems - when used may provide server-side functionality to the mobile electronic device . By way of example, the treatment regimen management subsystem  may be deployed in both the mobile electronic device  and the treatment management device . The mobile electronic device  may then perform some of the functionality while other functionality is performed by the treatment management device .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["202","102","106","202","202","402","404","406","408","410"]},"In some embodiments, the treatment regimen determination module  enables the device operator of the mobile electronic device  to identify a treatment regimen that has been prescribed for the device operator. The treatment regimen may, in some embodiments, include a systematic plan for the treatment, control, or management of a disease or ailment. In an example embodiment, the treatment regimen may include the use of a first treatment component and a second treatment component. In some embodiments, the treatment regimen may include one, or more than one, additional treatment components (e.g., a third treatment component, etc.). The treatment components (i.e., the first treatment component and the second treatment component, as well as any additional treatment components that may be utilized in connection with the treatment regimen) may each include a particular medication, prescription or nonprescription drug, pharmaceutical, and\/or one or more other courses of treatment or activities involved in the treatment regimen, for example lab work that may be recommended as part of the treatment regimen. Each of the treatment components may also include a dosage associated with each of the particular medications, prescription or nonprescription drugs, pharmaceuticals, a type of lab work recommended, or the like.","A first treatment schedule may be associated with the first treatment component and a second treatment schedule may be associated with the second treatment component. In an embodiment including one or more additional treatment components, one or more additional treatment schedules may be associated with the additional treatment components (e.g., a third treatment schedule may be associated with the third treatment component, etc.). The treatment schedule associated with each of the treatment components may include an interval, timing, or frequency associated with the treatment component, for example, twice daily, once a week, or the like. For example, in an illustrative embodiment, the treatment regimen may include three different medications, and\/or treatments such as lab work, and\/or one or more medications to be taken in different dosages as different times. Each of the medications and\/or treatments may have an associated treatment schedule. For example, a first medication may be prescribed at a given dosage to be taken twice daily. A second medication may be prescribed at a given dosage to be taken three times daily, and lab work may be recommended weekly.","In various embodiments, the treatment management app may be specific to the management of one specific disease or ailment, and\/or the treatment management app may be capable of managing the treatment of various diseases or ailments. In embodiments in which the treatment management app may be capable of managing the treatment of various diseases or ailments, the treatment regimen determination module  may receive an indication of the disease or ailment being treated. For example, the treatment regimen determination module , and\/or another subsystem or module of the treatment management app, may prompt (via a display device associated with the mobile electronic device ) the device operator to input (via a user interface associated with the mobile electronic device ) the disease or ailment to be treated. For example, the treatment regimen determination module  may receive a direct input of the disease or ailment and\/or may receive a selection from a provided list of diseases or ailments.","As discussed above, in an embodiment the treatment regimen includes two or more treatment components, which each identify the medications or other treatments involved in the treatment regimen, as well as corresponding dosages or attributes of the medications or other treatments. The treatment regimen also identifies a treatment schedule associated with each of the treatment components. The treatment schedule associated with each of the treatment identifications may indicate the timing and\/or frequency with which the treatment of the treatment component should be undertaken.","Further, and as generally discussed above, the treatment regimen may include a multi-component treatment regimen. For example, the treatment regimen may include a multi-dose treatment regimen in which the patient may undertake a treatment at varying dose, such as treatment quantity and\/or treatment frequency, over time. In other examples, a multi-component treatment regimen may include a multi-modal treatment regimen, for example including a combination of injections, oral\/topical medications, and\/or recommended lab tests. In still other examples, a multi-component treatment regimen may include multi-dose and multi-modal treatment. Further, a multi-component treatment regimen may include a combination of any of the foregoing examples. Additionally, depending upon the nature of the disease or ailment, the treatment regimen may change over time. For example, the treatment regimen may include multiple discrete segments, in which each segment may have one or more treatment components and\/or treatment schedules.","Some diseases or ailments may be treated by one of several generally defined protocols. Each protocol may include two or more medications or treatment procedures having associated treatment schedules. The medications or treatment procedures, as well as the associated treatment schedules, may be defined by the protocol. Determination of the treatment regimen may, in some embodiments, be made by the treatment regimen determination module . In some embodiments the treatment regimen determination module  may receive a selection of the treatment regimen from one or more available treatment regimens, which may, for example, correspond to one of the established treatment protocols for the disease or ailment. The available treatments may be, for example, preloaded on the mobile electronic device  as part of the treatment management app, or otherwise downloaded to the mobile electronic device  to enable the device operator to make a selection from one or more available treatment regimens. For example, the treatment regimen determination module  may provide, via a display associated with the mobile electronic device , a list of available treatment regimens stored on the mobile electronic device . The device operator may select, using a device user interface associated with the mobile electronic device , a treatment regimen from the list of available treatment regimens that corresponds to a treatment regimen prescribed to the device operator.","In some embodiments, the treatment regimen determination module  may determine the treatment regimen by accessing the database  including treatment regimen data . In such an embodiment, the treatment regimen determination module  may receive a user input indicative of the treatment regimen. Further, the treatment regimen determination module  may query the database  including treatment regimen data  (either directly or via the treatment management device ) for the treatment regimen based upon, at least in part, the user input. For example, the treatment regimen determination module  may receive an input (via a user interface associated with the mobile electronic device ) from the device operator identifying one or more aspects of the treatment regimen. Examples of aspects of the treatment regimen may include one or more medications included in the treatment regimen, the device operator's treatment history, one or more attributes of the device operator, or the like. The treatment regimen determination module  may receive the inputs as selections from provided lists of treatment regimen aspects, as inputs into specified fields, or otherwise.","The treatment regimen determination module  may issue a query to the database  including treatment regimen data  and\/or to a database manager associated with the database  based upon the received user input. The query of the database  may return results including one, or multiple treatment regimens based upon the user inputs. The results may be transmitted to, and received by, the treatment regimen determination module . In some embodiments, the returned treatment regimen(s) may be presented to the device operator (e.g., via a display device associated with the mobile electronic device ) for confirmation that the returned treatment regimen matches the treatment regimen prescribed for the device operator, or for a selection by the device operator indicating which one of the returned treatment regimens matches the treatment regimen prescribed for the device operator.","In some embodiments, the treatment regimen may be received by the mobile electronic device  from the database  including electronic prescription data , either directly or via the treatment management device . For example, the treatment regimen determination module  may query (via the mobile electronic device ) the database  including electronic prescription data  relative to the identity, and\/or an identifier of, the device operator and relative to one or treatments for the previously identified disease or ailment that have been prescribed to the device operator. The database  including electronic prescription data  may be a database associated with an electronic prescription system, such as that provided by SureScripts-RxHub, LLC.","In some embodiments, the treatment regimen determination module  may receive the exact treatment regimen for the device operator. In other embodiments, the treatment regimen determination module  may receive an indication of one or more prescribed treatments consistent with a treatment regimen. In such an embodiment, the one or more prescribed treatments may be compared, either by the mobile electronic device  or the treatment management device , to multiple possible treatment regimens to identify a correlation between the prescribed treatments and one or more possible treatment regimens. In the event that more than one possible treatment regimen is identified, the device operator may select (e.g., via a user interface associated with the mobile electronic device) a correct treatment regimen from the more than one possible treatment regimens.","The scheduling module  may communicate with an electronic calendar, for example a calendar application, to schedule treatment events within the electronic calendar. The calendar application may include calendar application functionality within the treatment management app, may be a separate calendar application executed by the mobile electronic device , and\/or may be a calendar application that is accessible by the mobile electronic device  and\/or the treatment management app, for example via network . An example of a calendar application that is accessible by the mobile electronic device  and\/or the treatment management app may include GOOGLE Calendar by Google Inc. Each treatment event scheduled by the scheduling module  may include a particular treatment instance consistent with a treatment schedule associated with a treatment component, as determined by the treatment regimen determination module . For example, in an illustrative embodiment in which one treatment component includes a medication to be taken twice daily, two treatment events may be scheduled by the scheduling module  each day, in which one treatment event corresponds to each of the two times the medication is to be taken each day. In the event of a treatment regimen including multiple treatment components (e.g., medications and\/or other treatments), the scheduling module  may schedule treatment events corresponding to each treatment component according to the treatment schedule associated with each treatment component.","Treatment events are generally individual administrations of a treatment component consistent with the treatment regimen and according to the treatment schedule associated with the treatment component. For example, in the illustrative example of an oral medication to be taken twice daily (e.g., BID), each of the twice daily administrations of the oral medication may be a treatment event. Further, in the illustrative example of two medications to be taken twice daily at the same time, each of the twice daily administrations of each of the two medications may be an individual treatment event, giving rise to four individual treatment events per day. In some embodiments, multiple treatment events taking place at the same time may be combined into a compound treatment event, for example that may be scheduled as a single treatment event including multiple parts. In the example of a compound treatment event, the multiple parts of the compound treatment event may correspond to each of the individual treatment events occurring at the same time.","The treatment events based upon each of the treatment schedules associated with each of the treatment components may be scheduled by the scheduling module . The scheduling module  may schedule the treatment events by interacting with a calendar application to create a calendar item corresponding to each treatment event based upon, at least in part, the treatment schedules of the treatment regimen. The calendar application may include integrated features of the treatment management application, may include a calendar application executed by the mobile electronic device , or may include a calendar application executed by another device accessible by, or capable of communicating with, the mobile electronic device. In an embodiment in which the calendar application is a feature of the treatment management application, the calendar interface module may directly communicate with the calendar application. In an embodiment in which the calendar application is a separate calendar application executed by the mobile computing device , the scheduling module  may schedule the treatment events via appropriate application programming interfaces (API's). Further, in an embodiment in which the calendar application is executed by a separate system, the scheduling module  may schedule treatment events via appropriate API's, web services calls, or other suitable communication mechanism.","Scheduling the treatment event may include receiving, in some embodiments, by the scheduling module  an indication of a preferred treatment time. In various example embodiments, the preferred treatment time may be a preferred treatment of the patient, a preferred treatment time of the caregiver, such as physician, or a preferred time based upon the treatment component (e.g., a medication that should be taken with a meal, etc.). The preferred treatment time may include, for example, a day of the week for receiving a once-weekly treatment. In other examples, the preferred treatment time may include preferred treatment times for once daily treatments, twice daily treatments, etc. In some embodiments, in response to receiving the indication of a preferred treatment time, the scheduling module  may modify default treatment time values. For example, a twice daily dosing (e.g., BID dosing) may have default treatment times of 9:00 AM and 6:00 PM. The scheduling module  may receive an indication of 10:00 AM and 7:00 PM as preferred treatment times of the patient. The treatment regimen management subsystem , and\/or a module thereof, may schedule treatment events for twice daily treatments based upon, at least in part, the received preferred treatment times. In some embodiments, modification of the default treatment times may be constrained by treatment timing requirements associated with the medications, or other treatments, of one or more treatment events.","Conflicts arising between a scheduled treatment event and another event, such as a meeting or the like, may be resolved by the scheduling module . For example, a conflict may arise as a result of a treatment event being scheduled at the same time as another event that is scheduled via the calendar application. Further, the conflict may arise at the time that the treatment event is scheduled, or the conflict may arise when the other event is scheduled, subsequent to the treatment event being scheduled. According to an embodiment, the scheduling module may prompt the device operator to resolve the conflict by rescheduling the treatment event and\/or by rescheduling the other event, such that the conflict is eliminated. In another embodiment, scheduling module  may allow the treatment event to be scheduled as a free event that may be scheduled in conflict with another event. In such an embodiment, the treatment event may be scheduled in conflict with another event, but may still be scheduled within the calendar application.","The alert module  may enable a treatment alert to be generated associated with one or more of the treatment events scheduled by the scheduling module  to therefore alert the device operator that a treatment is to occur. In various illustrative embodiments, the alert module  may provide instructions to a calendar application to generate an alert via the calendar application that is perceptible by the device operator. In other embodiments, the alert module  may provide instructions to the calendar application to generate a signal to the treatment management app indicating a treatment event. In such an embodiment, the treatment management app may generate an alert that is perceptible by the device operator.","In still further embodiments, the alert module  may provide instructions to the calendar application to generate an alert signal to another device, such as treatment management device , application provider device , or another external device that may provide a treatment event alert that is perceptible by the device operator, thereby alerting the device operator to the occurrence of the treatment event and\/or an identification of the treatment to be undertaken by the device operator.","In some embodiments, the alert module  may generate a treatment alert in the form of a calendar reminder. For example, related to the scheduling of the treatment event in the calendar application, the alert module  may set an event characteristic of the scheduled treatment event to cause the calendar application to generate a reminder. The event characteristic may be set, for example, by direct communication between the alert module  and the calendar application, via an appropriate API, a web services call, or other suitable mechanism, as discussed above with respect to scheduling treatment events in the calendar application.","In some embodiments, the alert module  may generate a treatment alert in the form of an alert on a mobile device associated with the device operator of the mobile electronic device . The alert on the mobile device associated with the device operator may include an alert generated on the mobile electronic device . The alert may include, for example, an audio alert, a visual alert, such as a dialog box alert, or other alert perceptible by the device operator. In an embodiment, the calendar application may transmit an indication of the treatment event to the alert module . In response to receiving the indication of the treatment event, alert module  may generate an alert via the treatment management app, an operating system or user interface of the mobile electronic device , or another application executed on the mobile electronic device .","In some embodiments, the alert module  may generate an alert on a mobile device associated with the operator of the mobile electronic device  other than mobile electronic device , for example, a cellular telephone, a tablet computer, a netbook, etc. In a similar manner as discussed above, upon the occurrence of a treatment event the calendar application may transmit an indication of the treatment event to the alert module . In response to receiving the indication of the treatment event the alert module  may transmit an alert, or an instruction to generate an alert, to the mobile device. The alert, or the instruction to generate the alert may be transmitted via a suitable mechanism, such as a BLUETOOTH transmission, or a WiFi transmission. The mobile device upon which the alert is to be generated and\/or the mechanism for transmitting the alert may be specified by the operator of the mobile electronic device , for example as a preference setting, or the like.","In some embodiments, the alert module  may generate a treatment alert in the form of a text message sent to a mobile device associated with the operator of the mobile electronic device . The mobile device associated with the operator may include the mobile electronic device  and\/or may include another mobile device, such as a cellular telephone, associated with the operator of the mobile electronic device . For example, upon the occurrence of a treatment event the calendar application may transmit an indication of the treatment event to the alert module . In response to receiving the indication of the treatment event the alert module  may communicate with a text messaging application of the mobile electronic device , for example, via an appropriate API. In an embodiment in which the text message alert is to be transmitted to the mobile electronic device , the alert module  may transmit instructions to the text messaging application to generate an indication of a new received text message including an indicator of the treatment event. In an embodiment in which the text message alert is to be sent to a mobile device other than the mobile electronic device , the alert module  may transmit instructions to the text messaging application to generate an outgoing text message, including the indicator of the treatment event, to a specified recipient telephone number. The recipient telephone number may include a telephone number that was entered as an alert recipient preference of the treatment management app by the device operator of mobile electronic device . As such, a text message alert of the treatment event may be sent to a mobile device other than the mobile electronic device .","The modification module  may enable the device operator to modify one or more aspect of the treatment regimen determined by the treatment regimen determination module . For example, modification module  may enable the device operator to choose, or change, a timing of a treatment, change a dosage of a treatment, or otherwise modify the treatment regimen. Further, the scheduling module  and\/or the alert module  may schedule treatment events and\/or generate treatment alerts based upon, at least in part, the modified treatment regimen.","The compliance module  may receive an indication from the device operator that a treatment associated with a scheduled treatment event has been performed. The compliance module  may, thereby, record and track the degree of compliance of the device operator to the treatment regimen. The compliance module  may generate an intervention and\/or warning message in the event of a detected noncompliance with the treatment regimen and\/or treatment schedule. The noncompliance with the treatment regimen may be based upon, at least in part, a failure of the device operator to input an indicator of compliance. The intervention and\/or warning message may include any variety of warning regarding consequences associated with noncompliance, inquiry messages regarding the reasons for noncompliance, and\/or additional treatment alerts.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","500","102","102","106"]},"A treatment regimen for a patient undergoing treatment is determined at block . The treatment regimen for the patient may include a first treatment component and a second treatment component, and a first treatment schedule associated with the first treatment component, and a second treatment schedule associated with the second treatment component. Additional treatment components (e.g., a third treatment component, etc.) and additional treatment schedules (e.g., a third treatment schedule associated with the third treatment component, etc.) may also be included. Each of the treatment components may include a particular treatment, such as a medication, a treatment procedure such as a lab test to be performed, or other treatment, as well as any dosing of medication, type of lab test to be performed, or other characteristic of a treatment. Each of the treatment schedules may include a frequency and\/or timing with which the treatment with an associated treatment component should occur. For example, an oral medication may have a treatment schedule of twice daily (e.g., BID) for a period of four weeks. In a similar example, lab testing to determine the patient's white blood cell count may have a treatment schedule of once a week for a period of six weeks.","In an embodiment, determining the treatment regimen may include receiving a selection of the treatment regimen from one or more available treatment regimens. For example, a given disease or ailment may have multiple possible treatment regimens. The device operator of the mobile electronic device  may be presented, via a visual display associated with the mobile electronic device , with a listing of possible treatment regimens. The device operator may select, using a selection device such as a touch screen associated with the mobile electronic device , the treatment regimen that has been prescribed for the patient (i.e., the device operator of the mobile electronic device ).","In another embodiment, determining the treatment regimen may include receiving an input indicative of the treatment regimen and querying a treatment regimen database based upon, at least in part, the input. For example, the device operator may input, e.g., into an input field displayed on a display device associated with the mobile electronic device , one or more characteristics of the treatment regimen prescribed for the device operator. The characteristics of the treatment regimen may include a treatment, a treatment history, such as naive, treatment failure, a disease or personal characteristic of the patient, and\/or other relevant information. The patient may be prompted for specific characteristics of the treatment regimen. Upon receiving the input from the device operator, a treatment regimen database, which may include various available treatment regimens for a given disease or ailment, may be queried for treatment regimens matching the input characteristics. The results of the query may be displayed via the mobile electronic device. The device operator may, in some embodiments, select the displayed treatment regimen as confirmation that it is the correct treatment regimen. In the event that more than one treatment regimen is returned based upon the query, the patient may select the one treatment regimen that corresponds to the treatment regimen prescribed for the patient.","In a further embodiment, determining the treatment regimen may include receiving an indication of a treatment regimen from an electronic prescription system. For example, if the prescriber of the treatment regimen utilizes an electronic prescription system, the electronic prescription system may be accessed relative to an identity of the patient. Depending upon the nature of the electronic prescription, the electronic prescription system may include the entire treatment regimen. In other embodiments, the treatment regimen may be determined based upon, at least in part, a comparison of prescribed treatments to a database including available treatment regimens for a given disease or ailment.","The treatment regimen may be modified at block . Modifying the treatment regimen may include modifying one or more of a treatment component and a treatment schedule of the determined treatment regimen. For example, a treatment regimen prescribed for a patient may vary in some manner from the determined treatment regimen. The patient may modify a treatment component and\/or a treatment schedule associated with a treatment component of the determined treatment regimen, such that the modified treatment regimen corresponds to the prescribed treatment for the patient. The treatment regimen may be modified, for example, via the mobile electronic device  using any suitable input device associated with the mobile electronic device , such as a touch screen or other input device.","Treatment events are scheduled in a calendar application at block . The treatment events may include individual instances at which a treatment should occur based upon, at least in part, a treatment schedule associated with a treatment component. The calendar application may include a calendar feature that may be integrated into a treatment management app, which may in an embodiment implement the example method. In other embodiments, the calendar application may include a separate calendar application. Treatment events may be scheduled, for example, using appropriate API's allowing treatment events to be entered as calendar events in the calendar application. In a further embodiment, the calendar application may be executed by a separate device. For example, the calendar application may include a cloud-based calendar application. The treatment events may be scheduled in the cloud-based calendar application using web services interface, API's, and\/or other suitable communication interfaces.","For example, in an embodiment including a multi-component treatment regimen, treatment events may be scheduled for each instance at which a treatment should occur for each treatment schedule associated with each treatment component. As an illustrative example of this scheduling, a treatment regimen may include a first treatment component including a once-weekly injection, a second treatment component including a twice-daily oral medication, and a third treatment component including a three-times daily oral medication. Consistent with this example, a series treatment events corresponding to the first treatment component (e.g., injection treatment events) may be scheduled at one week intervals. A series of treatment events corresponding to the second treatment component (e.g., first medication treatment events) may be scheduled twice daily, for example at 9:00 AM and 6:00 PM. Similarly, a series of treatment events corresponding to the third treatment component (e.g., second medication treatment events) may be scheduled three times daily, for example at 9:00 AM, 1:00 PM, and 6:00 PM. The day and timing of the treatment events may be based upon a default day\/time and\/or may be based upon a selection by the patient.","In an embodiment, scheduling the treatment events may include receiving an indication of a preferred treatment time. For example, and referring to the previous example including a three treatment component treatment regimen, a patient may prefer to take the morning dose of the first medication and the second medication at 8:00 AM. Using an appropriate user interface and input device, the patient may input the desired 8:00 AM timing for the morning treatment events into the mobile electronic device . Similar indications of preferred treatment times may be input for other treatment events.","To the extent that the treatment regimen may have been modified at block , scheduling the treatment events at block  may include scheduling treatment events based upon the modified treatment regimen.","Treatment alerts are generated at block . Treatment alerts may include any alert perceptible by the patient (e.g., as the device operator of the mobile electronic device ) at the time of the scheduled treatment events in the calendar application. Treatment alerts at the time of the scheduled treatment events contemplates the generation of treatment alerts preceding the scheduled treatment event by a reminder period, and\/or treatment alerts after the scheduled treatment event based upon, at least in part, a snooze functionality associated with the treatment alert, and\/or a failure of patient to acknowledge the treatment alert.","In various embodiments, generating the treatment alert may include generating a calendar reminder, as may occur with other events scheduled in a calendar application, generating an alert on a mobile device associated with the patient, and transmitting a text message to a mobile device associated with the patient. Calendar reminders may, for example, be generated by providing instructions to the calendar application, e.g., during scheduling of a treatment event to provide a reminder of the event. Alerts may be generated on a mobile device associated with the patient by, for example, providing instructions for generating a treatment alert through an application executed on the mobile device (such as a treatment management app executed on the mobile electronic device ) and\/or for generating the treatment alert through an operating system or user interface feature of the mobile device. Further, generating the treatment alert on a mobile device associated with the patient may include sending instructions, for example, via a wireless communications channel, to another mobile device associated with the user, such as a cellular telephone, a tablet computer, or a netbook. Moreover, transmitting a text message to a mobile device associated with the user may include transmitting instructions to a text messaging application, for example via a suitable API, to transmit a text message to a telephone number indicated by the patient, e.g., as a preference or set-up parameter of a treatment management app.","An indication of compliance with the treatment schedule may be received at block . For example, attend to the occurrence of a treatment event, a compliance dialog box may be rendered on a display screen associated with the mobile electronic device  requesting that the patient indicate whether the scheduled treatment was undertaken. The patient may indicate whether the treatment was undertaken by selecting a \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d check box within the dialog box, and\/or via other suitable mechanism.","In some embodiments, in the event of a \u201cno\u201d response in the compliance dialog box, an intervention message may be generated. The intervention message may, for example, include information such as warnings of the risks associated with noncompliance, such as decreased treatment efficacy, or other suitable message. Additionally, in some embodiments an intervention message may request that the patient indicate, as by selecting one or more available options, the reason for noncompliance.","In various embodiments, compliance information (i.e., indications of complains or of noncompliance with the treatment schedule), and\/or reasons for noncompliance may be transmitted to a storage system, such as a database, for statistical analysis. The compliance information may be de-identified (i.e., disassociated from the identity of the patient) and\/or otherwise made Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliant.","In some embodiments, treatment diary information may be logged at block . For example, the patient may be enabled to enter information regarding treatment. Information regarding treatment may include, for example, experienced side effects, subjective feelings of well being, lab results, or other information that may be relevant to the treatment of the patient. The treatment diary information may be stored on the mobile electronic device  and\/or may be transmitted to a storage system, such as a database. As with the compliance information, any treatment diary information may be de-identified and\/or otherwise made HIPAA compliant.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0074"},"figref":"FIGS. 6-13","b":["600","1300","600","1300"]},"For the purpose of the following illustrative embodiment, displays are shown relative to the management of a treatment regimen for hepatitis C, in which the treatment regimen includes a multi-component treatment regimen including three treatment components, e.g., in the form of medications, and two modalities of treatment, namely an injectable medication and two oral medications.
