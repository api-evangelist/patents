Technical Field","Example embodiments of the present invention relate in general to a mobile communication system including a 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE)\/Service Architecture Evolution (SAE) system, and more specifically to a data transmission method using machine type communication (MTC) group based tunneling that is related to a processing technique for group tunneling between a base station and a gateway based on a MTC group in data transmission and reception to and from a MTC device, and a mobile communication system using the same.","2. Related Art","MTC or machine-to-machine (M2M) communication is a form of data communication which involves one or more entities that do not necessarily need human interaction. A service optimized for MTC differs from a service optimized for human-to-human communication. In comparison with a current mobile network communication service, the MTC service can be characterized by a) several market scenarios, b) data communications, c) lower cost and less effort, d) a potentially very large number of communicating terminals, e) a wide service area, and f) very low traffic per terminal.","MTC may appear in a variety of service forms, such as smart metering, tracking and tracing, remote maintenance and control, eHealth and the like.","In current 3GPP, evolved Long Term Evolution (LTE)\/Service Architecture Evolution (SAE) systems that are greatly improved in transmission efficiency and use efficiency compared to existing UMTS systems are being developed, and a standardization task for new network architecture for supporting machine type MTC involving MTC devices rather than existing person-friendly terminals and network improvement for MTC (NIMTC) is being conducted.","In 3GPP, an NIMTC task is being conducted in consideration of features of the MTC in existing network architecture. As part of this effort, there are attempts to resolve problems of congestion and overload by eliminating unnecessary signaling and performing group control through group optimization for MTC devices. Currently, the directivity for solutions has only been established, and concrete solutions have not yet been specifically discussed.","Since it is expected that there are about 100 times more MTC devices than existing terminals and MTC devices in a number of MTC applications have a feature of periodic simultaneous access, all MTC devices performing a procedure for access to the same network as a network for general terminals may cause congestion and overload of the network, which not only fatally affects existing person-friendly terminal based services, but also degrades resource efficiency of the network.","Furthermore, in terms of operation in the network, the same procedure as a procedure for general person-friendly terminals being performed for a number of MTC devices having similar service features may cause waste of resources and overload of the overall network.","Accordingly, Example embodiments of the present invention are provided to substantially obviate one or more problems due to limitations and disadvantages of the related art.","Example embodiments of the present invention provide a data transmission method using machine type communication (MTC) group based tunneling that not only reduces additional signaling procedures that are unnecessary for MTC communication, but also conserves resources and reduces overload of a system in actual user traffic transmission by creating a GTP-U tunnel for an MTC device between an S-GW and a base station for each MTC group using MTC group based features, which reduces congestion and overload of the network, in order to resolve a problem that may be caused by a signaling procedure of the MTC device being the same as that of an existing person-friendly terminal (UE) in a Long Term Evolution (LTE) network including MTC entities for MTC communication that uses an existing E-UTRAN, a mobility management entity (MME)\/gateway (GW), and MTC devices, and a mobile communication system using the same.","In some example embodiments, a data transmission method for at least one MTC device constituting a MTC group includes: receiving an attach request from the MTC device; determining whether the attach request is a first attach request from the MTC group; and if it is determined that the attach request is a first attach request from the MTC group, establishing a downlink tunnel and an uplink tunnel to be used for data transmission and reception between a GW and a base station using a MTC group identity.","The establishing of the downlink tunnel and the uplink tunnel may include: transmitting, by a mobility management entity receiving the attach request from the MTC device, a session creation request message including the MTC group identity to the GW; creating, by the GW receiving the session creation request message, a bearer context for the MTC device; and if a session creation request from the MTC device is a first session creation request from the MTC group, allocating, by the GW, a MTC group tunnel identity for uplink data transmission.","The establishing of the downlink tunnel and the uplink tunnel may include: transmitting, by a mobility management entity, a session creation request message to the GW in response to the attach request from the MTC device and receiving a session creation response message from the GW; transmitting, by the mobility management entity, an initial context setup request message including the MTC group identity to the base station; and allocating, by the base station, a MTC group tunnel identity for downlink data transmission using the MTC group identity included in the initial context setup request message.","The data transmission method may further include: receiving, by the mobility management entity, an initial context setup response message from the base station and receiving an attach completion message from the MTC device; if the attach request from the MTC device is a first attach request from the MTC group, transmitting, by the mobility management entity, a bearer modification request message to the GW; and updating, by the GW receiving the bearer modification request message, the MTC group tunnel identity for downlink data transmission and an address of the base station.","The data transmission method may further include: determining, by the mobility management entity receiving an attach request message from the MTC device, whether MTC group tunneling is to be used based on information included in the attach request message or previously set information indicating whether group tunneling is to be used according to the MTC group.","The data transmission method may further include: tunneling use indicator according to whether the MTC group tunneling is to be used; inserting, by the mobility management entity, the set MTC group tunneling use indicator into a session creation request message and a bearer modification message and transmitting the session creation request message and the bearer modification message to the GW; and allocating a MTC group tunnel identity for uplink data transmission or updating a MTC group tunnel identity for downlink data transmission, by the GW, according to the MTC group tunneling use indicator included in the session creation request message and the bearer modification message.","The data transmission method may further include: setting, by the mobility management entity, a MTC group tunneling use indicator according to whether the MTC group tunneling is to be used; inserting, by the mobility management entity, the set MTC group tunneling use indicator into an initial context setup request message and transmitting the initial context setup request message to the base station; and allocating, by the base station, a MTC group tunnel identity for downlink data transmission according to the MTC group tunneling use indicator included in the initial context setup request message.","According to an example embodiment of the present invention, the uplink tunnel and the downlink tunnel may comprise GPRS tunneling Protocol for the user plane (GTP-U) tunnels established between the GW and the base station for each MTC group.","The data transmission method may further include: if it is determined that the attach request is not a first attach request from the MTC group, using a previously set MTC group tunnel identity for the MTC group.","In other example embodiments, a mobile communication system including at least one MTC device constituting a MTC group and providing a MTC service, includes: the at least one MTC device configured to transmit an attach request to a network; a mobility management entity configured to transmit a session creation request message including a MTC group identity to a GW, transmit an initial context setup request message including the MTC group identity to a base station, and transmit a bearer modification request message to the GW if the attach request from the MTC device is a first attach request from the MTC group; and the GW configured to receive the session creation request message from the mobility management entity and allocate a MTC group tunnel identity for uplink data transmission if the session creation request is a first session creation request from the MTC group, and to receive the bearer modification request message from the mobility management entity and update a MTC group tunnel identity for downlink data transmission.","The mobile communication system may further include: the base station configured to allocate the MTC group tunnel identity for downlink data transmission using the MTC group identity included in the initial context setup request message received from the mobility to management entity.","In still other example embodiments, a mobility management entity located in a mobile communication system including at least one MTC device constituting a MTC group and providing a MTC service receives a network attach request from the at least one MTC device, transmits a session creation request message including a MTC group identity to a GW, transmits an initial context setup request message including the MTC group identity to a base station, and transmits a bearer modification request message to the GW if the attach request from the MTC device is a first attach request from the MTC group.","The mobility management entity may set a MTC group tunneling use indicator according to whether the MTC group tunneling is to be used, insert the set MTC group tunneling use indicator in a session creation request message and a bearer modification message to transmit the session creation request message and the bearer modification message to the GW, and insert the set MTC group tunneling use indicator into an initial context setup request message to transmit the initial context setup request message to the base station.","The mobility management entity may determine whether MTC group tunneling is to be used based on information included in the attach request message received from the MTC device or previously set information indicating whether group tunneling is to be used according to the MTC group.","In still other example embodiments, a GW apparatus located in a mobile communication system including at least one MTC device constituting a MTC group and a mobility management entity and providing a MTC service receives a session creation request message from the mobility management entity, and allocates a MTC group tunnel identity for uplink data transmission if the session creation request is a first session creation request from to the MTC group, and the GW apparatus receives a bearer modification request message from the mobility management entity and updates a MTC group tunnel identity for downlink data transmission and an address of a base station.","The GW apparatus may serve as both a serving GW and a packet data network (PDN) GW.","The GW apparatus may allocate the MTC group tunnel identity for uplink data transmission or update the MTC group tunnel identity for downlink data transmission according to the MTC group tunneling use indicator included in the session creation request message and the bearer modification message.","According to the configuration of the present invention, it is possible to perform efficient signaling and reduce overload of a system by establishing and using only one tunnel for an MTC group including at least one MTC device to reduce unnecessary signaling in access procedures for other MTC devices in the group. Further, as a time taken to search for a tunnel for packet transmission in actual user traffic transmission is greatly shortened, it is possible to prevent congestion and overload of the network caused by the MTC devices and conserve resources of the system.","Example embodiments of the present invention are disclosed herein. However, specific structural and functional details disclosed herein are merely representative for purposes of describing example embodiments of the present invention, however, example embodiments of the present invention may be embodied in many alternate forms and should not be construed as limited to example embodiments of the present invention set forth herein.","Accordingly, while the invention is susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms, specific embodiments thereof are shown by way of example in the drawings and will herein be described in detail. It should be understood, however, that there is no intent to limit the invention to the particular forms disclosed, but on the contrary, the invention is to cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the invention. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout the description of the figures.","The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the invention. As used herein, the singular forms \u201ca,\u201d \u201can\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.

It will be further understood that terms, such as those defined in commonly used dictionaries, should be interpreted as having a meaning that is consistent with their meaning in the context of the relevant art and will not be interpreted in an idealized or overly formal sense unless expressly so defined herein.","A \u201cterminal\u201d used in this disclosure may be referred to as mobile station (MS), user equipment (UE), user terminal (UT), wireless terminal, access terminal (AT), terminal, subscriber unit, subscriber station (SS), wireless device, wireless communication device, wireless transmit\/receive unit (WTRU), mobile node, mobile or the like.

The base station may be referred to as node-B, eNode-B, a base transceiver system (BTS), an access point, or the like.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"Referring to , the 3GPP wireless communication network providing a MTC service includes MTC servers  for providing MTC service, MTC devices , and MTC users, in addition to an existing wireless communication network including general terminals.","The MTC servers  may or may not be included in an area of a mobile communication network operator. When the MTC server  is controlled by the network operator, the network operator provides an application programming interface (API) to the MTC server and the MTC user accesses the MTC server  of the network operator via the API.","The MTC device  communicates with the MTC server or the other MTC devices using 3GPP bearer services, SMS and an IP multimedia subsystem (IMS) provided in a mobile network (public land mobile network: PLMN) . The MTC device  is also connected with a 3GPP network (e.g., UTRAN, E-UTRAN or GERAN) via an MTCu interface. The MTC server  performs services for MTC users and is connected with the 3GPP network via an MTCsms or MTCi interface.","An MTC subscriber is an entity that provides services to one or more MTC devices using the network operator, and an MTC user is a user entity that uses the services provided by the MTC server. In 3GPP, an MTCu interface is based on Uu, Um or LTEu, and MTCi to is based on Gi or SGi.","According to TS23.888, it is expected that there are about 100 times more MTC devices than existing general terminals and MTC devices have various application fields. Accordingly, the MTC devices are expected to have a great influence on a mobile communication network mainly with existing person-friendly terminals (or user equipments). Accordingly, in 3GPP, primary features of MTC communication are classified and, for example, network improvement for MTC (NIMTC) is reflected in standardization of each feature.","The MTC feature refers to a function of changing an existing network to optimize the existing network for MTC application service. The primary features of the MTC communication include control of overload due to simultaneous access of a number of terminals, monitoring of MTC devices, group based optimization of the MTC devices, and the like. For other features, refer to TS23.368 to TR23.888.","Specifically, MTC group based optimization is defined in TS22.368 or TR23.888 as follows.","An MTC group refers to a group of MTC devices that belong to the same MTC subscriber and share one or more group based MTC features. The group based MTC features refer to MTC features equally applied to one MTC group.","An operator may differently apply control, management or charging to each group, as necessary. In particular, in order to avoid the congestion and the overload due to a number of MTC devices, which is one primary issue of MTC, unnecessary signaling can be reduced and resources of the network can be conserved through group based optimization. For example, a method of limiting a maximum data transmission rate for each group may be used.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},"That is,  illustrates an example of the PLMN shown in . Architecture of an existing Long Term Evolution (LTE)\/System Architecture Evolution (SAE) network defined in the 3GPP standard is shown.","LTE\/SAE networks may be largely classified into evolved-UTRAN (E-UTRAN) and evolved packet core (EPC).","GERAN and a UTRAN are existing 3GPP systems proposed earlier than the E-UTRAN. The GERAN includes a GSM\/GPRS\/EDGE system and the UTRAN includes a WCDMA\/HSDPA\/HSUPA system. A serving GPRS supporting node (SGSN) is responsible for management and support of packet switching service directed to a wireless access network.","The E-UTRAN is located at end points of a terminal (user equipment) and a base station network and connected to an EPC, which is connected to an external network. Here, the E-UTRAN includes a base station according to an example embodiment of the present invention.","The EPC may include a mobility management entity (MME) for managing mobility of the terminal, and a gateway (GW)  responsible for data traffic transmission between the external network and the E-UTRAN. GWs may be functionally classified into serving GWs (S-GWs) and packet data network (PDN) GWs (P-GWs).","According to the 3GPP standard, the S-GW and the P-GW are defined to be physically embodied in the same entity or different entities. In an example embodiment of the present invention, the S-GW and the P-GW are assumed to be embodied in the same entity for convenience of explanation.","A policy control and charging rules function (PCRF) connected with the GW  is responsible for a PCRF.","Meanwhile, when an MTC service is to be provided using the PLMN network shown in , a subscriber must be registered in the network and a default bearer for user traffic must be set even for the MTC device through an access procedure, which is an initial signaling procedure for an existing person-friendly terminal after being powered on.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},"As shown in , a general terminal  transmits an attach request to an MME  via an eNB  for registration in a network after initially being powered on (S and S).","The MME  receiving the attach request performs an authentication and security procedure on the terminal making the attach request using an international mobile subscriber identity (IMSI) (S). For the terminal determined to be normal through the authentication and security procedure, the MME  creates and stores context information for mobility management of the terminal (S). The MME  then transmits a session creation request (Create Session Request) message to a GW  using GTP-C protocol for default bearer creation (S).","The GW  receiving the session creation request message creates evolved packet system (EPS) bearer context information for the terminal based on the IMSI (S). That is, the GW  allocates a tunnel identity (TEID) of a default bearer for uplink (UL) user traffic transmission between the eNB and the GW, allocates a terminal IP address, and creates a packet filter table (PFT) to create an EPS bearer context for the terminal.","The GW  then transmits a session creation response (Create Session Response) message to the MME  in response to the session creation request from the MME  (S). The MME  receiving the session creation response message receives a downlink tunnel identity using SLAP protocol between the eNB and the terminal, and the eNB delivers a non-access stratum (NAS) message between the MME  and the terminal using RRC protocol (S to S).","In other words, if the MME  receiving the session creation response message from the GW transmits an initial context setup request\/attach acceptance message to the eNB (S), the eNB transmits a RRC re-establishment command to the terminal (S). The eNB  receiving an RRC re-establishment completion message from the terminal (S) transmits an initial context setup response message to the MME  (S). Then, the terminal transmits a direct transmission message including an attach completion message to the eNB  (S), and the eNB  delivers the direct transmission message to the MME  (S).","The MME  receiving the attach completion (S) includes a DL GTP-U tunnel identity of the default bearer and an address of the eNB  received through the initial context setup response message from the eNB  (S) in a bearer modification request (Modify Bearer Req) message, and transmits the bearer modification request message to the GW  (S). Here, GTP-U refers to GPRS tunneling protocol for a user plane and serves to tunnel user data between the eNB and the GW.","The GW  receiving the bearer modification request message updates the downlink tunnel identity of the default bearer and the eNB address that have been previously created by the session creation request message (S) in S. The GW  then transmits a bearer modification response message to the MME  (S).","The access procedure based on person-friendly terminals described with reference to  is an essential procedure for all terminals.","However, of MTC devices for MTC do not have a voice communication function of existing terminals, and there is a feature in which a number of MTC devices performing similar functions simultaneously access a network.","In addition, there are more MTC devices than existing general terminals and there is a feature of periodic simultaneous access of MTC devices in a number of MTC applications (e.g., applications such as, particularly, health monitoring and water metering). Accordingly, the access procedure for the general terminal in  being performed for all the MTC devices causes congestion and overload of the network, which may not only fatally affect existing person-friendly terminal based services, but also degrade resource efficiency of the network.","Further, a method of creating a GTP-U tunnel between the S-GW and the eNB and creating a tunnel for bearer-specific traffic for each of a great number of MTC devices having similar service features, similar to an existing general terminal that is a person-friendly terminal, may cause resource waste in the GW system and overload of the overall network.","Accordingly, in an example embodiment of the present invention, a tunneling processing method as shown in  is proposed as a scheme for resolving such a problem.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0077","num":"0076"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},"As shown in , when an attach request message is received from an MTC device in an access process (S), the MME creates an MTC device context including an MTC group identity included in the attach request message (S).","The MME  determines whether MTC group tunneling is to be used based on information included in the attach request message or a previously set information indicating whether group tunneling is to be used according to the MTC group (S).","If it is determined that MTC group tunneling is not used for the MTC device making the attach request (\u201cNo\u201d in S), the MME  sets the MTC group identity and the MTC group tunneling use indicator to OFF, includes the MTC group identity and the MTC group tunneling use indicator in the session request message and the bearer modification request message, and transmits the messages. The procedure herein is the same as the access procedure for the existing general terminal as described above with reference to .","That is, the MME transmits a session creation request message to the GW and receives a session creation response message (S). The MME transmits and receives an attach acceptance message and an attach completion message to and from the terminal (S). Here, the MTC group identity and the MTC group tunneling use indicator of the session creation request message and the attach acceptance message have been set to OFF.","The MME then transmits a bearer modification request message to the GW and receives a bearer modification response message from the GW (S). Similarly, the MTC group identity and the MTC group tunneling use indicator of the bearer modification request message have been set to OFF. The GW receiving the bearer modification request message from the MME updates a downlink tunnel identity for S1-U downlink traffic transmission and an address of a base station.","If it is determined in the step of determining whether MTC group tunneling is to be used (S) that MTC group tunneling is to be used for the MTC device making the attach request (Yes in S), the MME sets the MTC group identity and the MTC group tunneling use indicator to ON, inserts the MTC group identity and the MTC group tunneling use indicator into the session creation request message, transmits the session creation request message to the GW, and receives a session creation response message from the GW (S).","In order to perform MTC group tunneling for GTP-U downlink tunneling between the base station and the GW, the MME receiving the session creation response message sets the MTC group tunneling use indicator to ON and inserts the MTC group tunneling use indicator into an initial context setup request message.

The base station allocates and uses a downlink group tunnel identity for MTC group tunneling according to the setting of the group tunneling use indicator included in the initial context setup request message received from the MME.","Then, the MME receives an initial context setup response message from the base station and receives an attach completion message from the MTC device (S). The MME determines whether an attach attempt is a first attach attempt from the MTC group (S). If the attach attempt is a first attach attempt from MTC devices in an MTC group to which the MTC device belongs (\u201cYes\u201d in S), the MME transmits a bearer modification request message including the MTC group identity, the GTP-U downlink group tunnel identity and the base station address to the GW (S).","Meanwhile, if the attach request from the MTC device is not a first attach attempt of the group (\u201cNo\u201d in S), the MME does not transmit the bearer modification request message to the GW, and uses an MTC group tunnel identity that is previously set for the MTC group.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0087","num":"0086"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},"A GW operation procedure in  will be understood in association with the operation of the MME shown in , particularly, steps  and .","In an access process of the MTC device, the GW receives a session creation request message including an MTC group identity and a group tunneling indicator from the MME (S).
