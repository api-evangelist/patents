abstract: A system, apparatus, and method for preventing thermal cycling of a ballast coupled to one or more lamps. A monitor circuit is provided to monitor for activation of the ballast's thermal protection mechanism. Such monitoring may include monitoring of the ballast's thermal protection mechanism itself, or monitoring lamp current and ambient temperature in the vicinity of the ballast to determine that the ballast's thermal protection mechanism has been activated. Power to the ballast is temporarily disabled when the ballast's thermal protection mechanism has been activated, thereby preventing thermal cycling of the ballast, and consequently of the lamps, when power to the ballast has been removed.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This invention relates in general to ultraviolet (UV) lamp control, and more particularly to a system, apparatus, and method for preventing premature lamp mortality caused by thermal cycling resulting from high temperatures and thermal protection mechanisms provided in the ballasts that control the lamps.","Ultraviolet (UV) and fluorescent lamps are used in a wide range of applications. For example, such lamps are used in medical, horticultural, and Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) settings, as well as the common and prolific use of fluorescent lamps as sources of visible light. In any of these and other diverse settings, the lamps may be subject to high ambient temperatures depending on their particular use. For instance, lamps may be used in garages, attics, or other specialized locations where ambient temperatures can reach very high levels.","Ballasts are used with UV and fluorescent lamps as a means for starting lamp operation by providing the requisite voltage to establish the arc that initially causes the lamp to turn on. More particularly, the ballast strikes an arc within a UV\/fluorescent lamp at start-up by placing a high potential across the lamp's filaments. Ballasts often come equipped with mechanical thermal protection to shut down in high temperature conditions. For example, the internal thermal protection mechanism in a ballast may shut down ballast operation, thereby opening the circuit, where the ballast temperature reaches a certain cutout temperature of the protection mechanism. The ballast temperature will generally decrease when it is no longer conducting current, and the thermal protection mechanism will therefore allow the ballast to resume current conduction which allows the lamps to be powered on again. The ambient temperature may still be high however, causing the ballast temperature to quickly reach the cutout temperature and again shut down ballast operation. This thermal cycle can continue indefinitely, until the ambient temperature decreases sufficiently to break the cycle.","During this time, both the ballast and the lamps will repeatedly cycle between on and off, while providing less than useful lamp operating time. Moreover, this thermal cycling adversely affects the longevity of the lamp, as these types of products age the most during their start-up cycles. This is largely due to the physics underlying UV\/fluorescent lamp operation. More specifically, UV and fluorescent lamps generally include a sealed glass tube that includes a small amount of mercury and an inert gas. The tube generally includes two electrodes or \u201cfilaments,\u201d one at each end of the tube, which are wired to an electrical circuit coupled to an alternating current (AC) power source. When the lamp is initially turned on, electricity heats up the filaments, which boils off electrons from the metal surface into the gas tube, which in turn ionizes the gas and creates an electrically conductive medium. At this point, the lamp's ballast provides the voltage kick across the filaments to establish an electrical arc through the gas. The resulting collision of free electrons with atoms releases other electrons, which creates ions, and ultimately plasma which establishes a path for an electrical current. Each time a lamp is turned on, the filament boils off electrons from its metal surface to ionize the gas and establish the arc, whereby a small amount of filament material actually evaporates. The number of start-ups that a lamp can undergo is thus limited before the filament ultimately burns out. Today's UV and fluorescent products are currently estimated to withstand approximately 4500 starts before failure. The thermal cycles caused by high ambient temperatures and the ballast's internal thermal protection mechanism cause an excessive number of lamp starts, which degenerates the integrity of the filament, ultimately leading to premature lamp mortality.","Accordingly, there is a need for a system and method for increasing lamp life that otherwise could be degraded due to thermal cycling resulting from high ambient temperatures and the internal thermal protection mechanisms provided by ballasts. The present invention fulfills these and other needs, and offers other advantages over the prior art.","To overcome limitations in the prior art described above, and to overcome other limitations that will become apparent upon reading and understanding the present specification, the present invention discloses a system, apparatus and method for preventing thermal cycling of a ballast coupled to one or more lamps.","In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, a method is provided for preventing thermal cycling of a ballast coupled to one or more lamps. The method includes monitoring for activation of the ballast's thermal protection mechanism. Power to the ballast is disabled when the ballast's thermal protection mechanism has been activated.","In more particular embodiments of such a method, monitoring for ballast thermal protection activation includes determining whether current is flowing through the ballast and\/or lamps, monitoring the ambient temperature proximate the ballast, and comparing the ambient temperature to a predetermined temperature threshold. In one embodiment, the ballast's thermal protection mechanism is deemed activated when it is determined that current is not flowing through the ballast\/lamp(s), and when the ambient temperature is greater than the predetermined temperature threshold.","In other particular embodiments of such a method, disabling power to the ballast involves disabling power to the ballast until at least one predetermined event occurs. In one embodiment, the ambient temperature is monitored in response to the occurrence of the predetermined event(s), and the power continues to be disabled if the ambient temperature is, for example, still greater than the predetermined temperature threshold or has not decreased by a predetermined amount. In other embodiments, the power is restored to the ballast if, for example, the ambient temperature is no longer greater than the predetermined temperature threshold or has decreased by a predetermined amount. In still another embodiment, the ambient temperature in the vicinity of the ballast is repeatedly monitored in response to repeated occurrences of second predetermined events, power is restored to the ballast if the ambient temperature corresponds to a predetermined ambient temperature condition in response to any of the occurrences of the second predetermined events, and power to the ballast continues to be disabled if the ambient temperature fails to correspond to the predetermined ambient temperature condition in response to any of the occurrences of the second predetermined events.","In still other particular embodiments of such a method, monitoring for activation of the ballast's thermal protection mechanism includes monitoring for a signal generated by the ballast in response to the ballast's thermal protection mechanism being activated. In another embodiment, monitoring for activation of the ballast's thermal protection mechanism includes monitoring the ballast's thermal protection mechanism itself, to determine when the ballast's thermal protection mechanism has been activated.","In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, a control system is provided for preventing thermal cycling of a ballast coupled to at least one lamp, where the ballast includes a thermal protection mechanism to disable power to the lamp while the thermal protection mechanism is activated. The control system includes a current monitor coupled to monitor current flow through the ballast to the lamp, and to provide an indication of a state of the current flow. At least one temperature sensor is positioned within a predetermined vicinity of the ballast to measure an ambient temperature proximate the ballast. A controller is coupled to the current monitor and the temperature sensor to determine whether the ballast's thermal protection mechanism is activated based on the indication of the state of current flow and the ambient temperature, and to disable power to the ballast when it is determined that the ballast's thermal protection mechanism is activated.","In a more particular embodiment of such a control system, the controller includes a data processing module configured to compare the ambient temperature to a predetermined temperature threshold, and to determine when the ballast's thermal protection mechanism is activated by determining when the indication of the state of current flow indicates a lack of current flow, and when the ambient temperature is greater than the predetermined temperature threshold.","In other particular embodiments of such a control system, the controller includes at least one timer, where the controller is configured to restore power to the ballast upon expiration of the timer. In another embodiment, the controller includes at least one timer, where the controller is configured to determine whether an ambient temperature condition is met upon expiration of the timer. In such an embodiment, the controller may be configured to continue to disable power to the ballast if the ambient temperature condition is not met. The controller may include a second timer, where the controller is configured to restore power to the ballast upon expiration of the second timer, or to again determine whether the ambient temperature condition is met upon expiration of the second timer.","In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, an ultraviolet (UV) air treatment system for treating air provided by an air handling system is provided. The air handling system includes an air duct arrangement for channeling the air through a targeted space. The UV air treatment system includes at least one UV lamp positionable within the air duct arrangement. A ballast is coupled between a power source and the UV lamp, where the ballast includes a thermal protection mechanism to disable power to the lamp while the thermal protection mechanism is activated. A current monitor is coupled such that it monitors current flow through the ballast to the UV lamp, and provides an indication of a state of the current flow. At least one temperature sensor positioned within a predetermined vicinity of the ballast is provided, to measure an ambient temperature proximate the ballast. A controller is coupled to the current monitor and to the temperature sensor, to determine whether the ballast's thermal protection mechanism is activated, which is based on the indication of the state of current flow and the ambient temperature. The controller disables power to the ballast when it is determined that the ballast's thermal protection mechanism is activated.","In more particular embodiments of such a system, the controller includes a data processing module to compare the ambient temperature to a predetermined temperature threshold. The controller determines when the ballast's thermal protection mechanism is activated by determining when the indication of the state of current flow indicates a lack of current flow, and when the ambient temperature is greater than the predetermined temperature threshold.","In the following description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration particular embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized, as structural and operational changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.","Devices such as UV and fluorescent lamps, or products incorporating such lamps, are often intended for use in spaces that experience high ambient temperatures. For example, UV and fluorescent lamps may be used in attics, garages, or special environments where ambient temperatures can reach levels well above outside ambient temperatures or temperatures in a controlled environment. Products may be subject to specifications or regulations requiring operation as high as 170 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. These lamps and\/or associated components are susceptible to early mortality when subject to such conditions.","In order to address this problem, some components such as ballasts, may incorporate internal protection mechanisms. More specifically, ballasts that control the lamps often incorporate mechanical thermal protection to shut down in high temperature conditions. For example, the internal thermal protection mechanism in a ballast may shut down ballast operation, thereby opening the circuit, where the ballast temperature reaches a certain cutout temperature. The ballast temperature will generally decrease when it is no longer conducting current, and the thermal protection mechanism will therefore allow the ballast to resume current conduction. The lamps will again be powered on. The ambient temperature may still be high however, causing the ballast temperature to quickly reach the cutout temperature and again shut down ballast operation. This thermal cycle can continue indefinitely, until the ambient temperature decreases sufficiently to break the cycle. During this time, both the ballast and the lamps will repeatedly cycle between on and off, while providing less than useful lamp operating time. Moreover, this thermal cycling detrimentally affects the longevity of the lamp, as these types of products age the most during their start-up cycles. More particularly, the ballast strikes an arc within a UV\/fluorescent lamp at start-up by placing a high potential across the lamp's filaments. Each time this occurs, a small amount of filament material actually evaporates. The number of start-ups that a lamp can undergo is thus limited before the filament ultimately burns out. Therefore, the thermal cycles caused by high ambient temperatures and the ballast's internal thermal protection mechanism can lead to premature lamp mortality.","The present invention addresses such issues, and can significantly increase operational lamp longevity. The present invention generally provides a manner of preventing thermal cycling of a ballast coupled to one or more lamps, which includes monitoring for activation of the ballast's thermal protection mechanism, and temporarily disabling power to the ballast when the ballast's thermal protection mechanism has been activated.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","102","100","100","104","106","100","108","102","100","100","108","110","102","110","108","100"]},"As described above, the ballast  used in connection with UV and fluorescent lamps may include a thermal protection mechanism . The thermal protection mechanism  may shut down ballast  operation, thereby opening the circuit, where the ballast temperature reaches a certain temperature. Particularly where the ambient temperature is high, excessive thermal cycling can occur as described above. In one embodiment, the present invention solves this problem utilizing, for example, the monitor circuit , temperature sensor , and control circuit .","The solution of the present invention first includes determining whether current is flowing through the lamp . This can be determined in a number of ways, including directly measuring the current flowing through the lamp  or ballast , measuring an auxiliary current derived from current flowing through the lamp  or ballast , or any other alternate current measuring technique. The monitor circuit  represents the circuit that performs this monitoring function. The manner in which the monitor circuit  is coupled to the ballast  and\/or the lamp(s)  depends on the particular type of monitoring to be performed. In the case where direct lamp current measurements are obtained, for example, by an electronic current meter, the monitor circuit  may be electrically coupled in series with the ballast  and lamp . The monitor circuit  may also be coupled in parallel with the circuit providing voltage\/current to the lamp , where an auxiliary current derived from the lamp current is used for the current measurement. Thus, while the monitor circuit  is illustrated in  as being in parallel with the ballast  and lamp , this need not be the case, as the particular monitoring methodology employed will govern the manner in which it is connected.","In addition to measuring whether current is flowing through the lamp(s) , a temperature reading is obtained. The ambient temperature of the device  or area in which the ballast  resides is obtained. For example, the ballast  and other circuitry may be provided in a common housing, and the temperature within that housing may be used to help determine whether a lack of lamp current flow is due to activation of the ballast's  thermal protection mechanism . The internal device\/area temperature can be determined using a temperature sensor , such as a thermocouple, thermistor, wire resistance temperature detector (wire RTD), integrated circuit (IC) sensor, etc.","In one embodiment of the invention, if a loss of current through the lamp(s)  is detected, and if the internal temperature as measured by the temperature sensor  is greater than a predetermined temperature limit, it may be assumed that the ballast thermal protection mechanism  has shut down the lamp(s) . Based on this supposition, the control circuit  can be configured to process the monitor circuit  output and the ambient temperature provided by the temperature sensor  to arrive at a conclusion whether the thermal protection mechanism  caused the suspension of current flow through the lamp(s) . When the control circuit  makes such a determination, it can temporarily disable power to the ballast  and\/or lamp(s)  to prevent subsequent thermal cycling caused by the high ambient temperature and the thermal protection mechanism  of the ballast . In one embodiment of the invention, the control circuit controls a relay or switch , and opens the switch  to prevent thermal cycling for a certain period of time or until a particular event occurs. Mechanisms other than controlling a relay\/switch  may be used to temporarily prohibit ballast  and lamp  operation. For example, electronic ballasts may include an enable input to receive a signal indicative of whether the ballast is to internally complete the circuit. Therefore, the control circuit  can provide an electronic control signal to such a ballast to temporarily suspend further ballast\/lamp operation. It should be recognized, therefore, that references made herein to controlling a switch  are intended to include any manner of directly or indirectly controlling power to the ballast and\/or lamp(s).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","202","210","202","210","208","200","212","200","200"]},"In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, a current monitor  is used to determine whether current is flowing through the lamp . While any desired manner of monitoring lamp  current may be utilized in accordance with the present invention, a representative example is subsequently described in connection with , and is described generally here. This embodiment involves monitoring for \u201czero crossings\u201d of the current entering the ballast . Monitoring for zero crossings provides an indication of whether current is properly flowing between the filaments ,  of the lamp . In one embodiment, the current monitor  monitors for zero crossings in a standard 60 Hz AC source signal, where the zero crossings occur 120 times per second. However, the current monitor  may be used with any particular source signal frequency. For example, many European countries operate on a 50 Hz source signal frequency, and in such a case, the current monitor  monitors for zero crossings 100 times per second.","Assuming a 60 Hz signal for purposes of discussion, current can be deemed to be flowing properly between the filaments ,  if the current is flowing in each of the 120 time intervals occurring each second. When current is not flowing between the filaments ,  as determined by the current monitor  and the control circuit , a number of reasons are possible. For example, the power source  may have failed, the switch  may be defective, or the thermal protection mechanism  within the ballast  may have triggered and removed power to the lamp  due to high ballast  temperature. In accordance with the present invention, ambient temperature within the product, device, or area in which the ballast  resides can be measured by the thermistor . The control circuit  can then deduce from the current and temperature measurements whether the lamp current failure is likely due to activation of the thermal protection mechanism .","The control circuit  shown in  may be implemented in a variety of manners. In the illustrated embodiment, the control circuit  may be implemented using a microprocessor, microcontroller, or other processing arrangement where at least some of the functions are controlled using a software program(s). In other embodiments, discrete hardware components may be implemented, or a combination of discrete and software-based circuitry. The control circuit  may include, for example, a data processing module . For example, the data processing module  may represent a microprocessor or microcontroller that performs functions as dictated by one or more programs, and associated memory to temporarily and\/or permanently store information during such processing.","Initially, the data processing module  may be used to close a relay or other switching mechanism, such as switch , in order to initially provide power to the lamp(s) . More particularly, an input may be provided to the control circuit  indicating that power to the lamp(s)  is desired. Such an input may be provided via a user interface (not shown) to the control circuit , such as a button, switch, touch screen, voice command, or other user interface mechanism. This input is recognized by the data processing module , which in turn closes the switch  by way of the switch control . This switch control  may take on various forms. For example, the switch control  may simply represent a register storing appropriate data to provide as a signal to an electronic switch  to turn on the switch . Alternatively, the switch control  may represent a driver circuit to drive a signal to a relay or other switch  to turn on the switch. Thus, the switch control  represents any switch control mechanism used to control the operation of a relay, switch, or other mechanism controlling the power to the ballast  and lamp .","When the switch  or other power-enabling mechanism is initially turned on and power is provided to the lamp  in response thereto, a predetermined time period may be established to allow the lamp(s)  to properly start. For example, once the switch  has been turned on, a start timer  may be started, where such a timer  may be implemented in hardware, software, or a combination thereof. In one embodiment, the start timer  is implemented in software operable on a processing device. The start timer  sets a register, flag, memory location, or other indication that the lamp(s) are \u201cON,\u201d as depicted by the LAMPS ON block , upon expiration of the predetermined timer  period. For example, this time period may be on the order of a number of seconds, such as three seconds, five seconds, forty seconds, or other predetermined time in which proper lamp  operation is expected after power has been applied. During this time, the ballast  will be connected to the power source  via the switch , the filament will heat up, strike the arc, and current will begin to flow through the gas between the filaments ,  of the lamp(s) . At the expiration of the start timer , it is expected that current is properly flowing through the lamp(s) , and the LAMPS ON  indicator will be set.","The data processing module  receives information from the current monitor  indicative of the state of the current flow through the lamp(s) . In one embodiment of the invention, the current monitor  identifies whether current is properly flowing through the lamp  during a predetermined number of time intervals separated by zero crossings of the time-varying current signal. This embodiment assumes a standard current signal having both positive and negative amplitudes which has such zero crossings; however any current\/voltage level may be selected as the reference points. For example, a time-varying current signal may be shifted such that the current signal is always positive, in which case zero crossings may not be the reference point but rather a predetermined amplitude greater than zero may be selected (e.g., an amplitude substantially centered about the peaks of the time-varying signal).","In an exemplary embodiment, processing of data provided by the current monitor  will not occur until (and unless) the LAMPS ON  indicator is set. The data processing module  processes this information, and determines whether the number of time intervals in which current is not properly flowing has reached the predetermined number of such time intervals. In one embodiment, if three consecutive time intervals indicate a lack of properly flowing current through the lamp(s)  (e.g., approximately 25 ms for a 60 Hz voltage signal), the data processing module  will not know whether the lack of current flow is due to a power source  problem, a failed switch , activation of the thermal protection mechanism , etc.","Thus, in accordance with the present invention, the internal device or area temperature is sensed by thermistor , and provided to the data processing module . Given this information and the current measurement information from the current monitor , the data processing module  can reasonably deduce whether or not the lack of lamp current flow is due to activation of the thermal protection mechanism . More particularly, when the data processing module  receives information from the current monitor  and determines that no lamp current is flowing, a predetermined temperature threshold  is compared to the temperature sensed by the thermistor . If the temperature sensed by the thermistor  is greater than the predetermined temperature threshold  as determined by the data processing module , it is assumed that the ballast  thermal protection mechanism  was responsible for terminating current flow through the lamp(s) . Therefore, to prevent the thermal cycling problems identified above, the data processing module  and associated switch control  provide a signal to turn off the switch , at least temporarily, to avoid damage to the lamp(s)  during this time of high device temperature.","After a predetermined time in which the power has been removed from the ballast  and lamp(s) , power may again be restored to the lamps . As an example, a first timer  may be initiated when the data processing module  and associated switch control  have disabled power by turning off the switch . The first timer can be set to any desired time, such as three hours for example. At the expiration of the time associated with the timer , power can be restored by turning on switch , and it can again be determined whether the thermal protection mechanism  has been reset to allow lamp current flow to resume.","It is noted that other predetermined events other than expiration of a predetermined time duration may also be used in accordance with the present invention. For example, one or more particular times of the day may be used (e.g., 12:00, 3:00, 6:00, etc.), such that restoring power to the ballast and lamps occur at these specified times. In another example, expiration of a predetermined count value may be employed, such as expiration of a decrementing counter having a particular binary value. In still another example, an event such as the receipt of a particular signal may trigger restoring power to the ballast and lamp, such as recognition of a fan signal indicating that convection cooling has been initiated, or recognition of any other signal that may be relevant to the ballast temperature.","If it is determined that the ballast thermal cycle is still in progress after the predetermined time has elapsed or other predetermined event has occurred, additional temporary power removal cycles may be effected. For example, a second timer  (or alternatively the same timer ) may be initiated if the ballast thermal cycle is still in progress. The second timer can be set to any desired time, such as one hour for example. This process can repeat as many times as is desired or necessary, using one or more timers or event triggers. It should be noted that the timers, such as timers , , may be implemented using software operable on a microcontroller\/microprocessor or other processing device, using discrete electronic components such as frequency dividers or other counters, using analog timing circuits such as resistor\/capacitor (RC) delay circuitry, or any other known timing mechanism. More particular examples of representative power removal and restoration operations are described more fully below.","The present invention prevents the potential ballast thermal cycling from repeatedly turning the lamps on and off, which can severely impact the life expectancy of the lamps.  is a diagram illustrating the manner in which the present invention can provide this protection. As shown in , a ballast temperature Tand an internal (device) temperature Tare shown on temperature graph . As the internal temperature Tincreases, so does the ballast temperature Tdue to the rise of ambient temperature in the vicinity of the ballast. Further, the ballast itself will generate heat as a result of its operation, thereby generally causing the ballast temperature Tto further increase. The ballast includes an internal thermal protection mechanism having an associated ballast thermal protection threshold at which the protection mechanism will trigger. When the protection mechanism triggers, no further current is allowed to pass through the ballast and lamp(s) until the protection mechanism resets due to a temperature decrease. As shown on the temperature graph , the ballast temperature Treaches the ballast thermal protection threshold at a first time t, at which time the ballast thermal protection mechanism triggers, causing the lamp current to stop flowing as shown in graph . It is noted that the graphs  and  represent the on\/off state of current flow, rather than a representation of the actual current signal.","In a conventional system that does not employ the principles of the present invention, the state of the lamp current can repeatedly turn on and off, as illustrated by graph . More particularly, the ballast temperature Tbegins to decrease towards the internal temperature Tafter time t, due to the fact that it is no longer conducting current. At some point, the ballast thermal protection mechanism will reset, again allowing current to flow, as depicted at time t. The ballast will resume conducting current, and the lamp will again turn on. However, the ballast temperature Twill again rise, and if the internal temperature Thas not decreased, the ballast temperature may again reach the ballast thermal protection threshold as shown at times t through t. Each time the ballast temperature Treaches the ballast thermal protection threshold, lamp current will be suspended. Therefore, the lamp current will toggle on and off due to the ballast thermal cycling, as shown in graph .","Implementing a thermal cycle control system in accordance with the present invention provides for a different result, as shown in graph . In accordance with the invention, the lack of lamp current flow due to ballast operation will be detected, and the power to the ballast will be temporarily disconnected. This will prevent the lamps from turning on and off for a predetermined time or until a predetermined event occurs, even if the ballast thermal protection mechanism would otherwise allow current flow to resume. As can be seen from graph , the present invention prevents the repeated lamp start-ups that may otherwise occur in conventional systems as depicted in graph , thereby protecting against premature lamp mortality.","As previously indicated, the present invention makes a determination as to whether the lamps are on, such as by monitoring the current through the ballast and\/or lamps. A number of different current and\/or voltage monitoring schemes may be used to determine whether current is flowing in the ballast and lamps. One embodiment of a current monitoring implementation is illustrated in .  is a schematic diagram of one embodiment of a current monitor circuit used to determine whether current is flowing, which can then be used in conjunction with the device internal temperature to determine whether a ballast thermal cycling condition is present. Again, one or more UV or fluorescent lamps  are provided, which are powered by an AC power source . In the illustrated embodiment, closing relay  establishes an electrical circuit to allow current flow from the power source  through the relay , resistance , ballast , and filaments ,  of the lamp(s) .","In the illustrated embodiment, ballast and lamp current may be monitored for a single lamp , or for a plurality of lamps . Where multiple lamps  are utilized, additional circuitry may be provided to monitor the current through those lamps. For purposes of discussion, the circuit of  one lamp  is assumed. In the illustrated embodiment, one side of the relay  is coupled to a series resistance, illustrated as resistor , which is in turn coupled to the ballast . The relay  is also coupled to an opto-isolator circuit , through another resistor , which is in turn also coupled to the ballast . In one embodiment of the invention, resistor  is significantly larger than parallel resistor , so that most of the current flows through resistor , but a portion of the current flows through the opto-isolator  and resistor  to monitor the current. For example, resistor  is approximately 3.3 ohms and resistor  is approximately 68 ohms in one embodiment of the invention. The resistances may be provided in any desired manner, such as using one or more resistor components, transistor-based resistances such as voltage-controlled resistors, and the like.","When the relay  is on, most of the current (based largely on the voltage division created by the parallel resistances , ) flows through resistor . However, a small portion of the current flows through the opto-isolator  diodes  and through resistor  to the ballast . When the current is at or above a predetermined level, the opto-isolator diodes  will turn on. A photo-transistor  senses when the diodes  are conducting current. Using a pull-up resistance (not shown) at the collector of the photo-transistor , the control circuit  can sense when a sufficient quantity of current is flowing in the ballast  and ultimately in the lamp . Thus, the opto-isolator  turns on during one half of a current cycle of sufficient quantity, turns off during the zero crossing, and turns on again for the next half current cycle of sufficient quantity. This creates a pulse signal at the output of the opto-isolator  that pulses 120 times per second for a 60 Hz signal.","The control circuit  recognizes the pulses, and can determine whether current is flowing through the ballast  and lamp  during each of these half cycles. If a pulse is missing, it indicates that the current through resistance  (and accordingly through resistance , the ballast , and the lamp ) is insufficient or nonexistent, which may ultimately indicate that the thermal protection mechanism  has open-circuited the current path. If a predetermined number of such pulses are missing, the control circuit  provides a signal to the switch driver circuit  to switch the relay  to the off position, thereby removing power from the lamp . In one embodiment of the invention, three consecutive missing pulses are recognized by the control circuit  as a lack of current flow, which triggers the switch driver circuit  to switch the relay  to the off position. This will turn off the lamp , thereby protecting the lamp  from the potentially damaging effects of a ballast thermal cycling condition.","Power can be restored to the lamp  after a predetermined time or in connection with a predetermined event, and in one embodiment can cycle between applying power and disabling power to the lamps. This essentially suspends power to the lamps during periods when ballast thermal cycling may be occurring, and restores power when such thermal cycling has possibly concluded. The suspension and restoration of power to the ballast  as dictated by the control circuit  can continue indefinitely, for a predetermined time, or until a predetermined event(s) has occurred, as is described more fully below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["500","500","502","504","502","504","506","508"]},"At a given time, the ballast thermal protection mechanism may trigger, as depicted at time t. This will discontinue ballast current  flow, as well as lamp current  flow. The current monitor circuit will recognize the suspension of ballast\/current flow, and will stop generating pulses at the current monitor output . More particularly, the opto-isolator associated with the current monitor of  will stop generating pulses, as zero crossings will stop occurring. In one embodiment, if three consecutive pulses  are not recognized such that no proper ballast current  and\/or lamp current  is present for a corresponding amount of time (approximately 25 ms in this example), the control circuit will cause the switch\/relay to open, thereby removing power from the ballast and lamp. It should be recognized that any number of consecutive or non-consecutive unrecognized pulses, including one, may be selected as the criteria for temporarily disabling power to the lamps.","Other current sensing mechanisms may be employed in accordance with the present invention. For example, an electronic current meter may also be employed which directly monitors the current through the ballast and\/or lamp. Any presently known or future current monitoring technique may be used in accordance with the present invention, where such current monitoring technique provides an indication to the processing module (e.g., microprocessor, microcontroller, other software-operable processing device, discrete component processor, etc.) as to when the lamp is conducting current.","Furthermore, techniques other than directly monitoring for current flow may also be used in accordance with the present invention. For example, a ballast may include an output to provide a signal indicating that it has triggered its internal thermal protection mechanism and has therefore opened the circuit to the lamp(s). Such a signal may be directly monitored by the processing module, and the power to the ballast can be controlled depending on the state of this ballast signal. More particularly, the monitor circuit may be implemented as a separate monitor circuit to monitor for such a signal, or the monitor circuit may be implemented integral to the processing module, such as by a software polling or interrupt routine in a microprocessor\/microcontroller implementation. Alternatively, where accessible, the thermal protection mechanism in the ballast may be directly monitored in lieu of (or in addition to) monitoring current flow through the ballast\/lamp. For example, one or more conductors may be coupled to the ballast's thermal protection mechanism and\/or associated circuitry to determine the state of the thermal protection mechanism. A resulting signal transmitted by the conductor(s) may be provided to the processing module for analysis, and power to the ballast can be controlled in response thereto. Thus, in accordance with one aspect of the invention, any indication that the ballast's thermal protection mechanism has been triggered may be utilized to initiate the power interruption mechanism according to the present invention. In other words, monitoring current, monitoring the ballast's thermal protection unit, monitoring a signal provided by the ballast indicating activation of the thermal protection unit, or other indication may be used in connection with the internal\/ambient temperature reading to initiate the thermal cycle prevention methodologies according to the present invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["600","602","600","602","604"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["700","702","704","706","710"],"sub":["I ","I ","I ","L","I ","L"]},"If Tis greater than T, power to the ballast and lamp(s) is disabled , such as by opening a switch that allows power to be supplied to the ballast. Power will be disabled until a predetermined event occurs, as determined at decision block . The predetermined \u201cevent\u201d may include any conceivable event, including expiration of a predetermined time duration, expiration of a count as executed on a counter, recognition of a time of day (including date and\/or time), recognition of an event relating to the possible cooling of the ballast and\/or ambient temperature proximate the ballast (e.g., a signal indicating that a fan, air conditioning unit, or other cooling device has been started which will reduce the temperature), etc. When the predetermined event occurs as determined at decision block , it is optionally determined  whether a predetermined ambient temperature condition is met. For example, the predetermined ambient temperature condition may be that the internal temperature Tmust drop by a predetermined quantity (e.g., drop 15 degrees relative to its initial cutout temperature) or alternatively drop to a predetermined temperature level (e.g., drop to 150 degrees). As another example, the internal temperature Tmay simply be required to drop below the predetermined thermal limit T. Any number of options are possible, and the present invention contemplates any such option.","If the predetermined ambient temperature condition has not been met as determined at decision block , power to the ballast continues to be disabled as shown at block . It is then again determined  whether a predetermined event occurs, where this predetermined event may be the same or a different predetermined event as was used in the previous analysis. For example, the predetermined event associated with decision block  may represent a three hour time duration the first time that power is disabled , and may represent a one hour time duration on subsequent tests of the predetermined ambient temperature conditions. When the predetermined ambient temperature condition is met as determined at decision block , power is restored  to the ballast, and lamp operation is thereby permitted.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 2"],"b":["800","802","804"]},"If the lamps have been running for the predetermined time, a thermal flag is cleared , and an extended lamp status flag is cleared . The extended lamp status flag corresponds to whether a particular timer has been initiated for an extended lamp operation. In one embodiment, the extended lamp status corresponds to whether or not the lamps have run longer than a predetermined time (40 minutes in the illustrated embodiment) at any time over a 72-hour period. If this is the case as determined at decision block , the 72-hour timer is cleared to reset this timer. It is then determined  whether the lamp current is properly flowing. It is noted that proper flow of lamp current may be determined by monitoring the lamp current or the ballast current, as current through the ballast indicates that current is flowing through the lamp. If lamp current is properly flowing, normal operation  continues.","If it is determined  that lamp current is not flowing, the cutout temperature Tstored . The cutout temperature corresponds to the internal temperature at the time that it was determined  that lamp current was not flowing. As previously described, the internal temperature Tcorresponds to the temperature in proximity to the ballast, and includes the external ambient temperature plus the increase in temperature generated by the ballast when conducting current through the lamps. If the internal temperature Tis not greater than a predetermined thermal limit as determined at decision block , then it is assumed that the reason for the lack of current flow is unrelated to the ballast's thermal protection mechanism, and other failure assessment and\/or actions may optionally be performed .","If, on the other hand, it is determined  that the internal temperature Tis greater than the predetermined thermal limit, it is determined  whether the thermal flag is set. If this is the first time through the process since the thermal flag was cleared , then this indicates that the 72-hour timer has not yet been set since it was cleared  when the thermal flag  was cleared. In this case, the 72-hour timer is started . Whether or not the thermal flag is determined to be set at decision block , power is disabled  for a predetermined time period or until some predetermined event occurs. In the illustrated embodiment, the predetermined time period is a three-hour period for which the power is disabled. This disabling of power for the predetermined time period is conducted in anticipation of a decreasing ambient temperature in the vicinity of the ballast. The restart temperature Tat which the restart is attempted three hours later is stored , and the temperature drop Tis calculated . In one embodiment, the temperature drop Tis calculated as the cutout temperature Tminus the restart temperature T. This calculation therefore determines the amount by which the internal temperature has dropped in the three-hour period.","At this point, it is again determined  whether the thermal flag is set. It would not be set, for example, if it had not been previously set and the 72-hour timer had been started  prior to the three-hour time period in which power had been disabled. Where the thermal flag has not yet been set as determined at decision block , it is set , and normal operation  resumes. It is noted that if the lamps do not run for 40 minutes (or other predetermined time) as determined at decision block , neither the thermal flag nor the 72-hour (or other predetermined time) timer will be cleared , . In such a case, the next time the thermal flag is checked at decision block , the 72-hour timer will not be started , as it will already be in progress.","If the thermal flag is determined to be set at decision block , it is then determined  whether the temperature drop Tis greater than a predetermined required change. If so, then the predetermined ambient temperature condition has been met, and normal operation  resumes. On the other hand, if it is determined  that the temperature drop Tis not greater than the required change, power will not be restored at this time, and the temperature drop Tis again calculated after another predetermined time period (e.g., one hour) as illustrated at block . In one embodiment of the invention, this Tcalculation after the predetermined time period can continue until it is determined  that the temperature drop Tis greater than the required change. In another embodiment, the Tcalculation after the predetermined time period can be performed a predetermined number of times, such as once, at which time normal operation  can resume where power is restored, with the caveat that power to the lamps may quickly be shut off again if the internal temperature has not decreased to a sufficient level.","In another embodiment, if the new power on time proved to be relatively short (compared to a predetermined time), the temperature required for return to normal operation can be adjusted. More particularly, the predetermined required temperature change used in the determination  of whether the temperature drop Tis greater than the predetermined required change may be increased in increments until some limit is reached, in hope of attaining a continuous number of minutes (e.g., 40 minutes) of runtime with proper drop in internal temperature.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0068"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["900","902","900","902","904","902","906","908","906","904","902","906","902","904","904","902","902","906"]},"One or more UV lamps operating as a germicide to kill airborne bacteria and surface mold in the air handling system may be positioned within the source air ductwork  as depicted in , or alternatively (or additionally) may be positioned within the return air ductwork . Various numbers of UV lamps may be provided, as depicted by UV lamps , , through . The number and position of UV lamps depends on a number of factors, including the size and wattage of the lamps, size of the area  and\/or ductwork, desired level of germicide protection, etc. Power to these one or more UV lamps , ,  can be controlled in accordance with the principles of the present invention. For ease of description, the following description is described in terms of a single UV lamp , although the principles described herein are equally applicable to multiple UV lamps.","A control circuit  may be used to control various components of the air handling system, such as to control a motor  for the blower , to control a heat exchanger , cooling components (not shown), and the like. The control circuit  may also be used to automatically control power to the UV lamp  during periods of potential ballast thermal cycling, in a manner analogous to that described in connection with FIGS. \u2013. More particularly, the UV lamp  is powered by an AC voltage source  through the switch  and the ballast . A current monitor circuit  is used in connection with the control circuit  to provide protection from premature UV lamp  mortality. In one embodiment of the invention, the current monitor circuit  monitors current from a 120 VAC power source  at the input of the ballast . When the ballast  is on and the UV lamp  is operating, current flows between the filaments and through the gas of the UV lamp . If current through the lamps has been terminated due to the ballast's thermal protection mechanism triggering, this can be detected by the current monitor . Therefore, in accordance with one embodiment of the invention, the AC current at the ballast  is monitored by the current monitor circuit  when the switch  is closed to provide power to the ballast  and UV lamp .","In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, the internal temperature of the housing in which the ballast  resides is monitored. As previously described, the internal temperature may be used in conjunction with the state of current flow to deduce whether the ballast thermal protection mechanism has caused the current to stop flowing and consequently the lamps to turn off.  illustrates an example of such a housing , depicted by dashed lines. The temperature within the housing is monitored by a temperature sensor(s), such as the thermistor . The thermistor  may be placed at any location within the housing, but is preferably positioned proximate the ballast . For example, in one embodiment, the thermistor  is placed very near, but not touching, the ballast . This allows for monitoring of the ambient temperature surrounding the ballast  to be monitored, but does not monitor the ballast temperature itself as it is not in direct contact with the ballast . However, because the temperature within the housing  will likely be substantially the same throughout the housing , the thermistor  may be positioned anywhere within the housing  in accordance with one embodiment of the invention.","The control circuit  is coupled to the current monitor  to receive one or more current monitor signals from the current , and is also coupled to the thermistor  to receive signals corresponding to the temperature within the housing . The control circuit  processes this information accordingly, to determine whether the ballast thermal protection mechanism caused the lamps to turn off. If current is not flowing through the UV lamp , and the temperature is above a predetermined thermal limit, the control circuit  can provide switch control signals to the switch  to temporarily remove power to the ballast  and consequently the UV lamp . Temporary removal of power from the lamp  prevents repeated arcing between the filaments of the UV lamp , that is due to repeated lamp start-ups as a result of ballast thermal cycling, which ultimately prevents premature lamp mortality.","After a desired time or in connection with a desired event, the control circuit  can again turn on switch , thereby restoring power to the UV lamp . The current through the UV lamp  is again monitored by the current monitor  to determine whether current is flowing through the lamp , and the internal housing temperature is again monitored via the thermistor . This cycle of monitoring, removing power to the UV lamp , restoring power to the UV lamp , and repeated monitoring of the UV lamp  current and internal temperature can be performed a predetermined number of times, for a predetermined time duration, or until a predetermined event(s) occurs. Where the lamps were turned off by the thermal protection mechanism of the ballast , normal current flow in the lamp  should resume when the internal temperature decreases to an appropriate level.","The foregoing description of various embodiments of the invention has been presented for the purposes of illustration and description.
