Field","The present subject matter relates to a technique for communication between an information processing apparatus and a printing apparatus.","2. Description of Related Art","Print Service Definition v1.1 for Web Services on Devices (referred to herein as Non-Patent Literature Document 1) discusses a technique by which a client computer requests a specific element from a printer and a technique by which the printer responds with the specific element.","A situation is assumed in which there is a limitation on the size of response data with which an image processing apparatus responds and the image processing apparatus cannot respond or an error occurs if the size of the response data exceeds the size limit.","However, Non-Patent Document 1 does not consider the situations in which the size of response data exceeds the size limit at the time of responding. Thus, when the technique discussed in Non-Patent Document 1 is used in the above situations, responding may be impossible, or an error may occur.","The present subject matter is directed to a technique capable of reducing the possibility that the size of response data exceeds a size limit.","According to an aspect of the present subject matter, an image processing apparatus includes a receiving unit configured to receive a request for first element data and second element data, a responding unit configured to respond with delay data indicating that notification of the second element data is to be delayed and the first element data as response data in response to the request received by the receiving unit if the receiving unit receives the request for the first element data and the second element data, and a notifying unit configured to notify the second element data after the responding unit responds with the response data.","According to another aspect of the present subject matter, an information processing apparatus includes a first requesting unit configured to send a request for element data to an image processing apparatus, a receiving unit configured to receive response data in response to the request after the first requesting unit sends the request, a determining unit configured to determine whether the response data includes information indicating that the element data is to be acquired again, and a second requesting unit configured to send a request for the element data again to the image processing apparatus if the determining unit determines that the response data includes the information indicating that the element data is to be acquired again.","Further features of the present subject matter will become apparent from the following description of exemplary embodiments with reference to the attached drawings.","Various exemplary embodiments, features, and aspects of the subject matter will be described in detail below with reference to the drawings. It is noted that the following exemplary embodiments are in no way intended to limit the scope of the invention according to the claims, and all combinations of features described in the exemplary embodiments are not necessarily essential.","Standardization has been promoted in the field of network printing systems in which a plurality of information processing apparatuses shares a printing apparatus that is an example of an image processing apparatus. An example of a network printing system using Web Services on Devices (WSD) for printing will be described. In the network printing system, an event-based protocol can be used. Furthermore, using an event notified from the printing apparatus to the information processing apparatuses, the information processing apparatuses can execute various controls based on the event. For example, the printing apparatus notifies the information processing apparatuses of the current status of the printing apparatus by using a PrinterElementsChange event, which notifies that the status has been changed.","Meanwhile, if an information processing apparatus that is newly connected to the network only uses event-based information notification processing, the information processing apparatus does not receive notification about the status of the printing apparatus until the status of the printing apparatus is changed after the information processing apparatus is connected to the network. In other words, applications running in the information processing apparatus that is newly connected to the network cannot have information about the printing apparatus until the status of the printing apparatus is changed next. Thus, a unit is provided to enable the information processing apparatus to send an active request for information about the printing apparatus (GetPrinterElementsRequest Operation). When a connection is established between the printing apparatus and the information processing apparatus that is newly connected to the network, the information processing apparatus first requests various types of information about the printing apparatus, so that the information processing apparatus can acquire information about the printing apparatus.","A GetPrinterElementsRequest is designed so that an acquisition request for a plurality of pieces of information can be made at one time. A GetPrinterElementsResponse, which is a response to the acquisition request, is designed so that a GetPrinterElementsRequest sent at one time is responded at one time.","However, with the high-performance of the recent printing apparatuses, the size of information of a printing apparatus has increased. The size of a GetPrinterElementsResponse that can be received by an information processing apparatus is limited. The size of a GetPrinterElementsResponse, which is a response to a GetPrinterElementsRequest, may exceed a data size that can be received by an information processing apparatus. If an information acquisition request is sent one by one so as not to exceed the size limit of received data, the size of received data in response to one request is reduced. However, the responding processing load of the printing apparatus increases, because a plurality of responses needs to be sent in response to a plurality of GetPrinterElementsRequests. A system that can solve the above problem is described below.","Configurations of an information processing apparatus and a printing apparatus according to the present exemplary embodiment will be described below with reference to .","An information processing apparatus  includes an input interface , a central processing unit (CPU) , a read-only memory (ROM) , a random-access memory (RAM) , an external storage device , an output interface , a display unit , a keyboard , a mouse , and a network interface . The network interface  is connected to a network  via a network cable . The ROM  stores an initialization program. The external storage device  stores application programs, an operating system (OS), a printer driver, and various types of data. The RAM  is used as a work memory by various programs stored in the external storage device . Furthermore, the CPU  executes processing based on a program stored in the external storage device , whereby the software configuration of the information processing apparatus  as illustrated in  and processing of each step in flow charts described below are realized.","The printing apparatus  includes a network interface , a RAM , a print engine , a ROM , and a CPU . The network interface  is connected to the network  via a network cable . The RAM  is used as a main memory and a work memory for the CPU , and stores various types of data and a receiving buffer for temporarily storing received print jobs. The print engine  executes printing based on data stored in the RAM . The ROM  stores various types of control programs such as a status management program , and data used by each control program. The CPU  controls each unit of the printing apparatus  according to the control programs. The status management program  is a program for monitoring the status of the printing apparatus  based on information of various types of sensors (not illustrated) in the printing apparatus, generating status information, and storing the status information in the RAM . The printing apparatus  generates response data and event data described below based on the generated status information. Furthermore, the CPU  executes processing based on a program stored in the ROM , whereby processing of each step in the flow charts described below is realized.","While an example of how processing is assigned to the information processing apparatus  and the printing apparatus  is described above, the form of assignment is not particularly limited to the above-described example, and any other form can be adopted.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","100","207","206","204","205","203","321","150","321","202","200","100","201"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["150","301","201","311","311","301","311","312","313","311","312","313","301","100","311","321","313","312","321","313","321","322","313","301","313","322","321","323","313","150","323","313","321","313","331","150","314","313","331","314","150","150","314","324","321","321"]},"The port monitor  may be a standard port monitor preinstalled in the OS or a vendor-specific port monitor.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["100","150","100","150","401","100","150","150","402","150","403","150","100","100","100","404","100","405","100","450"]},"The flow in which when information of the printing apparatus  is changed, the printing apparatus  executes event notification to the information processing apparatus , will be described. In step S, the printing apparatus  detects that information of the printing apparatus  is changed, and then in step S, the printing apparatus  generates event data and issues a PrinterElementsChangeEvent to the information processing apparatus . The PrinterElementsChangeEvent issuing processing is referred to as an event notification, and content of the event notification is referred to as event data. The event notification is different from the information acquisition response in that the event notification can be transmitted even if the information processing apparatus  does not request. Furthermore, there is no ID associated with the event notification. In step S, the information processing apparatus  receives the event notification, and then in step S, the information processing apparatus  updates information stored in the storage area (S) based on the received information.","As used herein, the issuance of an information acquisition response in response to an information acquisition request when the information acquisition request is received is referred to as \u201cresponse\u201d, whereas spontaneous transmission of event data without designating an associated ID as described above is referred to as \u201cnotification\u201d.","A configuration in which the port monitor (WSD port monitor)  of the OS executes processing that is to be executed on the information processing apparatus  side to issue an information acquisition request, receive response data, receive event data, and update the storage area S with received information is described.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 5A","b":["324","324","150","324","501"]},"The relationship between attribute information and an attribute value as used herein will be described with reference to a code  as an example.

An element that begins with ihv such as \u201cihv:Status\u201d and \u201cihv:Capability\u201d is referred to as a private element. Element data that is enclosed in private elements in the XML configuration and with which an information acquisition response or event notification is sent to the information processing apparatus  by the printing apparatus  is referred to as data of a private element. The relationship between the element and the element data will be described below.","When the OS confirms that a connection has been established between the information processing apparatus  and the printing apparatus , the OS sends an information acquisition request to request the printing apparatus  to acquire information of the printing apparatus .

However, the size of information acquisition response data (response data) with which the printing apparatus  responds to the information acquisition request is limited. A possible method to reduce the size of response data and obtain all pieces of information of the printing apparatus  is to simply divide the public elements and the private elements, and then send an information acquisition request for each one of the divided public elements and the divided private elements. However, if all elements are divided to make an information acquisition request for each one of the divided elements, the number of times the information processing apparatus  sends an information acquisition request increases. Furthermore, the load on the printing apparatus  responding with response data to each information acquisition request also increases. Thus, the information processing apparatus  is demanded to request acquisition of as much information of the printing apparatus  as possible at one time. Further, since the OS is also likely to use the data of public elements, it is not desirable to divide an information acquisition request to cause a delay in acquisition of information.

The attribute value \u201ctrue\u201d indicates that the data enclosed in the elements \u201cwsdst:ElementData\u201d is valid. An element  is the start element \u201cwsdst:PrinterStatus\u201d, and the element data \u201cPrinterStatus\u201d is stored between the start element and the end element. The element , which is the start element \u201cwsdst:PrinterStatus\u201d, includes the prefix \u201cwsdst\u201d. This indicates that the element data \u201cPrinterStatus\u201d is a public element.

In the configuration of the fourth exemplary embodiment, since the information processing apparatus  cannot be informed of the size of response data in advance, the information acquisition request is divided in advance and then sent.","In a fifth exemplary embodiment, the configuration will be described in which the information processing apparatus  requests acquisition of information of element data of all elements in a batch, and if, for example, the size of response data exceeds the size limit, the information processing apparatus  requests acquisition of the information again.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0082"},"figref":"FIG. 13","b":["100","1301","100","1302","100","324","1303","100","150","150","1304","100","1303","100","1350","1305","100","1304"]},"The retry identifier is an identifier indicating that the information processing apparatus  is to acquire again the element data to which the retry identifier is added from the printing apparatus . The retry identifier will be described in detail with reference to .  illustrates response data. In a code , the attribute value \u201cretry\u201d is added to the attribute \u201cValid\u201d. The attribute value \u201cretry\u201d indicates that an information acquisition request is required again to acquire the data of the element \u201cihv:Status\u201d.","In the determination in step S, if the information processing apparatus  determines that there is an element to which the retry identifier \u201cretry\u201d is added (YES in step S), then in step S, the information processing apparatus  requests again the element \u201cihv:Status\u201d to which the retry identifier \u201cretry\u201d is added. Specifically, the information processing apparatus  sends the information acquisition request again to realize the processing in step S. In step S, after the information processing apparatus  acquires the response data in response to the processing in step S, the information processing apparatus  stores the acquired response data in the storage area S. In step S, the information processing apparatus  ends the information acquisition request processing.","On the other hand, in the determination in step S, if the information processing apparatus  determines that there is no element to which the retry identifier \u201cretry\u201d is added (NO in step S), then the information processing apparatus  ends the information acquisition request processing.","As described above, according to the present exemplary embodiment, for example, the information processing apparatus  is only required to request again acquisition of information of only the data of the element to which the retry identifier is added if the response data exceeds the size limit. This can minimize the number of times of the information acquisition request.","While the configuration has been described in which the attribute value \u201cretry\u201d of the attribute \u201cvalid\u201d is used as the retry identifier in the present exemplary embodiment, the retry identifier may be expressed by an attribute other than the attribute \u201cvalid\u201d.","It is apparent that an object of the present subject matter can be attained also by supplying to a system or an apparatus a storage medium that stores program codes of software configured to realize the functions of the exemplary embodiments described above and by causing a computer (or CPU or MPU) of the system or the apparatus to read and execute the program codes stored in the storage medium.
