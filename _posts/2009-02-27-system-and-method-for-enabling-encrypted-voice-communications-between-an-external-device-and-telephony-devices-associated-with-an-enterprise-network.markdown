title: System and method for enabling encrypted voice communications between an external device and telephony devices associated with an enterprise network
abstract: A telecommunication system that can selectively establish communications with one of a plurality of telephony devices associated with a particular telephone number for a device in an enterprise network. More particularly, the system is configured to route an incoming telephone call received from an external device, such as a mobile device for example, to one or more of a plurality of telephony devices associated with the telephone number. The plurality of telephony devices may include personal digital assistants and other remote devices. In one embodiment, the system comprises a network server configured to connect the incoming telephone call from an external device to a telephony device, where voice communications are encrypted for transmission by the network server to the external device from which the incoming telephone call is received, and encrypted voice communications received from the external device can be decrypted, re-encrypted and/or stored by the network server if required.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["In an office building or other enterprise establishment, personnel may be assigned to offices with each office having an associated telephone. The office telephones are typically connected to a private branch exchange (PBX) or other exchange or call processing infrastructure. A PBX is a private telephone network that allows each office telephone to have its own telephone extension, typically a three, four or five digit telephone number where station-to-station (i.e., office-to-office) calls can be placed by dialing the three, four or five digit extension. A direct inward dial (DID) telephone number is also typically associated with each office telephone that allows calls initiated outside of the PBX to be placed directly to the office telephone.","Typically, calls made within an enterprise between office telephones are generally considered to be secure. These particular telephony devices are generally coupled to each other within a wired network, which is usually established within a single building or that spans several buildings in close proximity, for example. Certain physical safeguards may be implemented to prevent unauthorized access to the wired network, and accordingly, calls between office telephones are generally considered to take place within a trusted domain. In cases where an enterprise uses wireless networks such as WiFi, as part of its network, physical safeguards such as shielding and wireless range control can also be used to hinder unauthorized access.","In contrast, communications that involve external devices that connect to an enterprise's network from the outside, such as mobile device communications (e.g. cellular telephone communications) established through a mobile carrier's cellular towers, or communications established through a local phone company's network or a Wide Area Network (WAN) such as the Internet, are generally not considered secure, as they typically take place over networks outside an enterprise's control where communications may be more easily intercepted by third parties. Accordingly, many organizations and institutions have instituted policies that govern what information employees should and should not communicate by voice when using an external device, due to internal and regulatory restrictions.","Greater security when using external devices for voice communications may be desirable. In one known system, each of a plurality of external devices may be provided with a client application comprising an encryption module. At one external device, the encryption module is configured to encrypt outgoing voice communication data originating from that external device for transmission to another of the plurality of external devices also equipped with the encryption module. At the other external device, the encryption module is configured to decrypt incoming encrypted voice communication data. Encryption and decryption of voice communication data for transmission in the reverse direction is typically also performed. This system facilitates more secure voice communications between the external devices.","As noted above, in one known system, each of a plurality of external devices may be provided with a client application comprising an encryption module, which facilitates encrypted voice communications between the mobile devices. However, this known system is not configured to facilitate secure voice communications between, for example, one of the external devices and other devices for which the encryption module is not provided. In particular, voice communications between an external device and an office telephone or other telephony device operating within a PBX would not be secured. As a further example, voice communication data transmitted between one external device and another external device that is not directly connected thereto (e.g. where communications are to be routed via a PBX) may also not be secured.","As the demand for and usage of external devices such as mobile devices increase, a system configured to facilitate more secure voice communications between external devices may be desirable. Moreover, a system to facilitate more secure voice communications between telephony devices considered to be within a secure domain (e.g. an enterprise network) and one or external devices outside of the secure domain, for example, may also be desirable.","In one broad aspect, there is provided a method of facilitating encrypted voice communications between an external device (e.g. a mobile device) and at least one telephony device associated with a primary telephone number for a device in an enterprise network, the method comprising: detecting an incoming telephone call from a first external device to the primary telephone number at a network server; and connecting the incoming telephone call to a telephony device associated with the primary telephone number via a first voice connection path between the network server and the first external device and a second voice connection path between the network server and the telephony device associated with the primary telephone number; said connecting comprising receiving first voice communication signals via the second voice connection path at the network server and transmitting the first voice communication signals to the first external device in encrypted form via the first voice connection path, and receiving second voice communication signals from the first external device in encrypted form via the first voice connection path at the network server and transmitting the second voice communication signals to the telephony device associated with the primary telephone number via the second voice connection path.","In another broad aspect, the first and second voice communication signals transmitted via the second voice connection path are in decrypted form.","In another broad aspect, the first and second voice communication signals transmitted via the second voice connection path are in encrypted form.","These and other aspects and features of various embodiments will be described in greater detail below.","It has become relatively common for individuals to possess a number of different devices through which they communicate. For example, a person may have a home telephone, a wireless telephone, a pager, a personal digital assistant (PDA), and an office telephone to name a few. As the population becomes increasingly mobile, making contact with a person through one of these communication devices has become more difficult.","Call forwarding is one method of addressing this problem. Certain telephone systems allow users to enter another number to which a call is forwarded if not answered by a specified number of rings. This should allow an individual with multiple telephone devices to forward the call to such devices until the telephone at which the individual is located finally rings. However, if several telephones are involved, this approach becomes complicated. Moreover, it requires the calling party to remain on the line for a significant period of time if the call is to be forwarded multiple times. Furthermore, it is necessary that call forwarding capabilities exist on each of the individual's telephones. In addition, this approach requires that all telephones involved be reprogrammed each time an individual desires to initiate call forwarding.","A significant drawback to this forwarding strategy is that, in each leg of the forwarded call, the calling party is terminated on the last device or network in the chain. It follows that the final number in the forwarding scheme is responsible for all available enhanced services or voicemail available to the caller. Accordingly, although a call may have been initially placed to an office telephone equipped with voicemail and\/or operator assist, all such enhanced services of the corporate network are lost once the call is forwarded off the corporate PBX (e.g., to the user's wireless telephone).","Travel can also exacerbate the difficulty of establishing communication with an individual having access to multiple telephone devices. Upon checking into a hotel, the telephone in a traveler's hotel room becomes available as yet another potential means of contact. Unfortunately, this forces a calling party to decide whether to attempt to contact the traveler through his or her room telephone or other telephone device (e.g., wireless telephone or pager). If the traveler does not answer the called telephone, the calling party then must decide whether to leave a message (unaware of when, or if, the message will be retrieved) or instead attempt to reach the traveler via his or her other telephone.","Likewise, if the traveler is expecting an important call but is unsure whether it will be placed to his room telephone or wireless telephone, the traveler may feel compelled to remain within his room until the call has been received. In addition, if the traveler's wireless telephone does not support certain types of long distance calls (e.g., to various foreign countries), the traveler may be able to place certain types of calls only from his or her hotel room. The same problems arise when the traveler visits another office or enterprise having their own enterprise telecommunications network.","The office telephone is the primary point of contact of most business people. Typically, corporations invest significantly in their office telephone infrastructure, which often includes voicemail, paging and unified messaging systems. In addition, most corporations have negotiated contracts with their telephone carriers (e.g., local and long distance carriers) to ensure that they obtain the lowest possible rates for calls placed via their corporate network. However, because the corporate workforce is becoming increasingly mobile, more business people are using wireless telephones or devices to conduct their business when they are out of the office. This has resulted in corporations spending a larger portion of their telecommunications budget on wireless communications, with far less favorable negotiated rates than the rates of their corporate network. In addition, wireless communication systems often lack the enhanced conveniences (e.g., interoffice voicemail, direct extension dialing, etc.) that corporate users have come to expect in the office environment.","Embodiments described herein relate generally to a telecommunication system that can selectively establish communications with one of a plurality of telephony devices associated with a particular telephone number, and more particularly, route an incoming call to a plurality of telephony devices including smart phones and other remote devices. The system has a network server configured to send a data signal, via electronic mail or data communication for example, to one or more remote devices without any user interaction. The data signal causes the server and a remote device to execute a series of steps designed to route incoming calls based on user preferences.","In at least one example embodiment, the system further facilitates secure voice communications, particularly where the incoming call originates from an external device (e.g. a mobile device, such as a smart phone for example).","Voice communications between an external device such as a mobile device and an office telephone or other telephony device operating within a PBX are typically not encrypted in known systems, making them more susceptible to a security breach. Accordingly, in at least one example embodiment described herein, the system is configured to establish a secure channel between the external device from which an incoming call originates and a device that is not an external device (e.g. an office telephone), for example, automatically (i.e. without user intervention) after a user of the external device places the call. Other embodiments where voice communication data is transmitted to and\/or received from an external device in an encoded (e.g. encrypted) form are also described herein.","Example embodiments and applications will now be described. Other embodiments may be realized and structural or logical changes may be made to the disclosed embodiments without departing from the spirit or scope of the embodiments described herein. Although the embodiments disclosed herein have been particularly described as applied to a business or office environment, it should be readily apparent that the embodiments may be implemented for any use or application having the same or similar problems.","Embodiments described herein relate generally to a telecommunication system that can selectively establish communications with one of a plurality of telephony devices associated with a particular telephone number (also referred to herein in the description and in the claims as a \u201cprimary telephone number\u201d). Moreover, the system allows remote devices to perform as a functional standard office telephone for both inbound and outbound communications. The system also has a processor configured to send a data signal via electronic mail (email), text messaging, or other forms of data communications to one or more remote devices without any user interaction. The data signal causes a processor and a remote device to execute a series of steps designed to route incoming and outgoing calls based on user preferences and perform PBX functions from the remote device.","A first example embodiment is discussed and illustrated with reference to its implementation within an office building, multiple office buildings or other enterprise establishment. In an office building, for example, personnel are assigned to offices (or cubicles) with each office having an associated telephone. The office telephones are typically connected to a PBX, or other exchange or call processing infrastructure. The PBX allows each office telephone to have its own telephone extension and a direct inward dial (DID) telephone number. As known in the art, a telephone extension is typically a three, four or five digit telephone number where station-to-station (i.e., office-to-office) calls can be placed by dialing the three, four or five digit extension. This is commonly referred to as direct extension dialing. As also known in the art, a DID telephone number allows external calls (i.e., calls initiated outside of the office PBX) to be placed directly to the office telephone. The telephony devices and other devices locally (and typically physically) connected to the PBX, including the office telephones for instance, may be considered to collectively constitute an enterprise network.","However, it will be understood that while reference is made herein to an enterprise network that comprises office telephones in example embodiments, variant embodiments are not to be limited to any particular environment. The embodiments may be implemented, for example, in a hotel, boarding house, dormitory, apartment, or other commercial or residential establishment, where individuals are assigned to a unique extension or DID telephone number. The term \u201coffice\u201d as used herein may encompass a singular room or space within a business, other enterprise, hotel room or similar facility. The term \u201cuser\u201d as used herein may encompass an office employee, hotel guest or other individual associated with a telephone extension and DID telephone number, for example.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 8"],"b":["10","10","70","70","70","800","70"]},"The system  can selectively establish communications with one of a plurality of devices associated with a particular telephone extension or DID telephone number. Moreover, the system  will allow remote devices  such as a mobile device (described below in more detail) to perform as a fully functional standard office telephone , for both inbound and outbound communications. That is, a remote device  will be able to use features of the office network (e.g., direct extension dialing, corporate dialing plan, enterprise voicemail etc.) even though the device is not within the confines of the office or not directly connected to the office PBX. The system  also allows the remote device  to operate as an independent PDA, wireless telephone, etc. if so desired. That is, the remote device  may receive calls placed to its (non-office) DID telephone number even though the system  also routes PBX calls to the remote device . In addition, the system  essentially implements all or part of call management functions typically available on office, enterprise or hotel PBX or other communications network desktop telephone. Some of these features are discussed in detail below.","The system  as particularly illustrated herein includes a conventional office PBX network , also referred to herein generally as an enterprise network. The PBX network  may include a plurality of standard telephones , respectively connected to a conventional PBX\/IP-PBX  via communication lines , . Although PBX network  may use a PBX or IP-PBX , the following disclosure will simply refer to PBX  for convenience purposes. The PBX  is connected to a calling network such as a public switched telephone network (PSTN)  by a primary rate interface (PRI) connection  or other suitable communication line or medium. The standard telephones , can be any digital or analog telephone or other communication device known in the art. As illustrated in , the first telephone is a digital telephone while the second telephone is an analog telephone. For clarity purposes only, two telephones , are illustrated in , but it should be appreciated that any number or combination of telephones or other communication devices can be supported by the system . Moreover, although it is desirable to use digital telephones, embodiments described herein are not to be limited to the particular type of telephone used in the system .","The PBX  is coupled to a network server  (also generally referred to herein as \u201cserver \u201d). The server  is connected to the PBX  in this embodiment by a PRI connection , VoIP connection  (if PBX  is an IP-PBX), or other suitable communication medium (e.g., WiFi connection). The server  is also connected to a PSTN  by a PRI connection or other suitable digital communication medium. The illustrated PRI connection between the server  and the PSTN  includes a first PRI connection , a channel service unit (CSU) , and a second PRI connection . As known in the art, a CSU is a mechanism for connecting a computer (or other device) to a digital medium that allows a customer to utilize their own equipment to retime and regenerate incoming signals. It should be appreciated that the illustrated connection between the server  and the PSTN  is one of many suitable connections, and that other types of connections may be implemented in variant embodiments. The server  is one of the mechanisms that allow the integration of remote devices (e.g., mobile device ) into the PBX network  and its operation will be described below in more detail. Moreover, as will become apparent from the various call flow processes described in detail below, the server  maintains control over inbound, outgoing and in-progress calls and communications.","The server  is preferably connected to a local area network (LAN)  by an appropriate communication medium . Although a LAN  is illustrated, it should be appreciated that any other network could be used. A plurality of computers (e.g., , ) may be respectively connected to the LAN  by any appropriate communication lines , . The computers , can be used by network administrators or others to maintain server  and other portions of the system . The LAN  may also be connected to the Internet  by a suitable communication medium . A firewall  may be used for security purposes. In accordance with an embodiment, Internet  can be used to allow a remote administration device  (e.g., a personal computer) to perform remote administration of server  by office personnel or other authorized users of the system . Remote administration will allow office personnel to set user preferences for particular telephone extensions. Thus, each office telephone extension and associated remote device is individually configurable.","PSTN  is connected in this embodiment to a commercial wireless carrier (or other carrier not co-located with the system ) by a wireless switch  or other wireless carrier equipment by an appropriate communication medium . The wireless switch  is connected to at least one antenna  (by an appropriate communication medium ) for transmitting signals  to a wireless remote device  operating outside of the enterprise network, but integrated with the enterprise network as described herein. The remote device  could be a pager, wireless telephone, cellular telephone, smart phone, or other wireless communication device, for example. It may be desirable for the remote device  to be capable of handling both (or either) digital and analog communication signals. It should be noted that any type of wireless communication protocol (or a combination of different protocols), such as TDMA, CDMA, GSM, AMPS, MSR, iDEN, WAP, WiFi, etc., could be used.","It should be appreciated that the server  is connected to a wireless carrier through a PSTN  and not by unique hardware or an in-office cellular network. As a result, server  only has to interface with conventional components, such as the PBX  and PSTN . Thus, the system  is substantially technology independent. Moreover, special wireless devices are not required, which allows the remote device to function in its conventional manner (e.g., as a separate mobile device) and as part of the PBX network  (if so desired).","The server  and the PBX  may also be connected to an accounting\/billing system . The billing system  may also be connected to the LAN  so that system administrators may access the contents of the billing system . By incorporating a billing system  into the system , it is possible to obtain immediate billing information for calls placed to\/from the remote device  or other remote device. This immediate billing feature is not present in other PBX or enterprise networks and is particularly useful for corporate environments such as law firms and government agencies, and hotel environments, where up to date billing information is essential.","The server  and\/or the PBX  may also be connected to a call recording system . As will be described below, system  may be configured to facilitate encrypted voice communications between an external device (e.g. a mobile device) from which an incoming call originates or to which an outgoing call is placed, via PSTN  for example, and a telephony device (e.g. an office telephone , ) connected to PBX  or a second external device (e.g. a remote device  such as a mobile device) served by server  as noted above. Voice communication data, either in encrypted form or decrypted form, that is processed by server  may be recorded and stored by call recording system  (e.g. within a database [not shown] managed by call recording system ) for quality monitoring or to comply with regulatory requirements.","As noted above, the server  allows for the full integration of remote devices into the PBX network . In accordance with an embodiment, server  is a processor-based stand-alone unit capable of handling communications directed to the PBX network . In a first embodiment, shown in , server  comprises a plurality of receiving and transmitting modules , , , first and second buses , , at least one processor module (Obj) , a network interface card  and a memory module operable to comprise a database  such as for example, a relational database management system (RDBMS). Further, server  can include a web-based user interface (UI) processor module , a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) proxy server module  and a plurality of flop files , , . The processor, UI and SIP proxy server modules , ,  are processor cards (example hardware components of these cards are described below in more detail with reference to ) containing source code, object modules, scripts, or other programming to perform the following functions.","The SIP proxy server module  receives session initiation protocol (SIP) messages from user agents and acts on their behalf in forwarding or responding to those messages. In essence, the SIP proxy server module  is a gateway for IP-based interfaces to the server . The SIP proxy server module  also adds services, features and scalability to SIP networks. The SIP proxy server module  typically includes a registration service and a SIP location database, in addition to the SIP proxy. Server  can receive an incoming call  and\/or place an outgoing call  (described below in more detail). The processor module , among other things, directs and instructs the call processing of the server . The memory module comprising database  is used for storing user preferences and other pertinent information and may be a separate card or included within one of the other modules. The memory module may also be located external to the server , if desired, and connected to the server  by any wired or wireless communication medium.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","250","265","280","400","460","250","451","420","430","440","410","400","410","400","430","440"]},"The processor module  executes one or more computer programs or applications (Obj) stored in one or more memory units within (e.g., as shown in ) or coupled to the processor module . Processor module  can include one or more processes such as a modified VxML  call flow process, business logic process , call service function (CSF) process , and a global application processing interface (API) process . It should be appreciated that processor module  can include one, all, or any combination of the processes described. The processor module  may also contain one or more additional databases and\/or other processing memory used during the overall operation of system .","In one embodiment, the business logic process  can be used for determining whether or not a calling party (incoming or outgoing) is a participant of the server  network and allows the server  to be flexibly configured by providing routing plans and route translations, IVR prompting and announcements, data manipulation, management and control. Business logic process  may also be configured to determine whether voice communications associated with a given incoming or outgoing call is to be secured, depending on whether the endpoints of the call lie within or outside of the network of devices connected to the PBX  ().","The UI module  includes processes that provide an easy, but powerful, user interface to administer, configure and manage applications including the management of system, user, conference, notification, IVR and voicemail applications, to name a few.","The plurality of receiving and transmitting modules , , communicate with and handle incoming and outgoing telephone calls and are connected along bus . In one embodiment, bus  is an H100 or similar bus. The receiving and transmitting modules , , may be telephonic cards such as e.g., Intel Dialogic cards, that communicate with processor module , database  and other components via bus  (for example, a PCI bus), which is bridged to bus  (bridge not shown), and are employed to receive and transmit information to the PBX  and PSTN  during call processing. The modules , , also receive and transmit other information such as administrative information. In another embodiment, the receiving and transmitting modules , , can also be implemented as a processor module  (RIMP) having a memory  comprising a program that, when executed, causes the processor  to perform the desired telephony functions, as shown in .","In one embodiment, the workload performed by the receiving and transmitting modules , , , as well as some of the processing functions of processor module , are implemented using one or more conventional processor-based programmable telephony interface circuit cards (e.g., Intel Dialogic cards) used to interface server  with PBX  and the PSTN . The cards are programmed to perform the conventional telephony services required to place and receive calls, as well as being programmed to perform the call processing functions described below.","The server  preferably contains a database of office extension numbers (also referred to herein as PBX extensions) and DID telephone numbers associated with each existing PBX extension. The database will be stored on a computer readable storage medium, which may be part of (e.g., database ) or connected to the server . The database may also contain a server-to-PBX extension (hereinafter referred to as a \u201cSERVER-PBX extension\u201d) and one or more remote device telephone numbers associated with each PBX extension. In the illustrated embodiment, software running on the telephony modules , , interfaces with the database to perform the various call processing functions discussed below.","In the embodiment illustrated in , the PBX  contains a coordinated dialing plan (CDP) steering table. The CDP steering table will be stored and retrieved from a computer readable storage medium, which may be part of or connected to the PBX . The CDP steering table directs the routing of some or all PBX extensions to the server  over the PRI  and VoIP  connections between the server  and the PBX .

Although the use of encryption is desirable, the decision of whether encryption is to be used may be left up to the end user or system administrator of the remote device , host system  and\/or server . In particular, data communications may be encrypted in a secure data connection established between server  and remote device  (via components of host system ). The established secure connection may be used to exchange encryption keys and other information needed to facilitate the subsequent encryption of voice communication data that may be transmitted to and from the remote device , as will be explained in greater detail later in this description.","Host system  can include a web services connection (i.e., for the Internet) to provide an interface between server  and remote device .

The remote device  will also have at least a basic user input system comprising input devices such as e.g., function keys, reduced or full-size keyboard, and\/or a graphical input capability (e.g., touch screen). The remote device  will further include a data communications interface for one or more of GPRS\/EGPRS, 1XRTT\/EVDO, 802.11A\/B\/G, WiMAX, for example, to name a few. The application running on the remote device  is designed as a generic application that has the capability to utilize the inherent interfaces of the remote device  (e.g., screen, input system and data communications).","The client application utilizes standard application programming interfaces (APIs) and built-in capabilities of the e.g., J2ME environment for the management of data presentation (layer ) & device control (control ). These standard capabilities allow for a level of generic data presentation, data input control and data messaging such as e.g., TCP\/IP, UDP\/IP, SMS, to name a few. In addition, each device manufacturer can also provide device specific APIs, controls and\/or capabilities that allow for greater integration to the device (i.e., device specific presentation layer , device specific device control ). These are typically included as libraries that can be built, linked or packaged with the client application.

In response, the server  will either send a data signal to accept the login request (flow line ) (i.e., sends a session response accept data signal) or reject the login request (flow line ) (i.e., sends a session response reject data signal). If the remote device  is accepted by the server , the user has access to server  and the ability to process calls in any of the methods described below. It should be appreciated that the login request may be performed automatically (e.g., every time the remote device  is powered-up, or periodically), it may happen manually when the user selects a predetermined device application, or it may happen automatically or manually in response to a request from the server .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0069"},"figref":["FIG. 5C","FIG. 5C"],"b":["70","546","547","70"]},"At the end of a session or after a predetermined time period, as shown in scenario , the server  sends a session request logout data signal to the remote device  (flow line ). The remote device  responds with a session response accept data signal accepting the logout request from the server  (flow line ). It should be noted that the server  may be initially programmed to require the remote device  to login about every 24 hours.

Server  will respond by sending an out dial response accept data signal accepting the user's request (flow line ), or by sending an out dial response reject data signal (flow line ) rejecting the outbound call to remote device  depending on the user's rights. If the server  rejects the request (scenario ), the out dial response reject data signal (flow line ) may include the reason for the rejection.","If server  accepts the outbound call request (scenario ), the server  will place an outbound voice call (flow line ) to the remote device  and another voice call (flow line ) to the called party (e.g., party ).

In scenario , the user can accept an incoming call placed to a PBX extension or DID telephone number by a caller (e.g. caller ) at an office telephone (e.g. digital telephone of ), for example. Server  receives the incoming call from the device (flow line ), via PSTN  () for example.","If the call need not be forwarded to the intended recipient user at a remote device  as in this example, voice communication data transmitted between server  and the telephony device within the enterprise network (e.g. an office telephone , ) may be left unencrypted when the telephony devices at which the call might be received are all considered to operate within a secure domain. For example, if all voice communications are transmitted between server  and an office telephone via one or more private networks or connections only, and not via a public network or other shared network infrastructure such as the Internet or a PSTN, then there may be less need to secure the transmitted voice communication data.","It will be understood that other devices may also be considered to operate within a secure domain, and may be used to facilitate voice and data communications even if they may not be strictly considered to be telephony devices in a traditional sense. These may include computing devices equipped with instant messaging clients, for example.","Referring again to the example of , the incoming voice call from Caller  originates from an external device such as a mobile device (not explicitly shown in previous Figures), which may be a device that is similar to a remote device  (described above with reference to the previous Figures) to which server  may route the call, where the remote device  is a mobile device  as described with reference to  for example. The external device from which the voice call originates comprises a client application configured to enable voice communications with a network server to be secured as described below.","As the call originates from an external device such as a mobile device, it may be desirable to ensure that voice communication data is secured at least between the calling party's external device and the server , even where the call may be answered by a receiving party using a telephony device connected directly to PBX  within an enterprise network.","When placing the call that is received at server , caller  may operate his external device to indicate that the call, if answered, should proceed such that the voice communications will be secure. Caller 's external device can be configured so that a menu option is provided that allows him to request that a secure call be made, if so desired. Alternatively, caller 's external device may be configured by an administrator (e.g. through IT Policy) such that all subsequent calls made from caller 's external device are to be secured automatically. As a further example, caller 's external device may be configured by a user and\/or an administrator such that all calls subsequently made to one or more designated phone numbers and\/or to one or more designated contacts are to be automatically secured. Other configurations may similarly require calls received at caller 's external device to be secured. It will be understood that other configurations in variant embodiments are possible.","In this example, when caller  places the call (flow line ), a data signal is transmitted from caller 's external device to server , which indicates that the voice communication data for the call, if answered, is to be secured.","Server  then transmits a data signal back to caller 's external device in response that provides the necessary information required to secure subsequent voice communications. For example, an encryption key for use in encrypting and decrypting voice communication data to be sent from and received by caller 's external device respectively may be transmitted by network server  to caller 's external device (flow line ). Other parameters (e.g. data identifying the encryption algorithm to be used) may also be transmitted by network server  to caller 's external device. Depending on the particular implementation, one or more data exchanges may be required to facilitate the setup of the secure connection. However, in any event, these data transmissions and exchanges are transparent to caller .","The encryption key transmitted by network server  to caller 's external device for use in encrypting and decrypting voice communications may take various forms, depending on the particular implementation. In particular, standard and non-standard encryption or codec obfuscation algorithms may be employed that utilize an \u201cencryption key\u201d.","For example, the \u201cencryption key\u201d may be used to more generally refer to an encoding parameter. For instance, a known bit-shifting, bit swapping, substitution and\/or other encoding algorithm may be employed, where the \u201cencryption key\u201d is a parameter associated with the particular encoding algorithm.","In at least one example embodiment, the encryption key transmitted by server  to caller 's external device is a symmetric session key that is to be used for the particular call being set up (e.g. different session keys are associated with different calls). Voice communication data can subsequently be encrypted using the session key and an appropriate symmetric encryption algorithm (e.g. Triple DES), by server  and caller 's external device. However, prior to use, the session key to be used for subsequent voice communications must be shared, and if exchanged, it must be securely exchanged to avoid unauthorized use by third parties.","In one embodiment, server  is pre-configured to securely communicate with a wireless communication support component such as a message management server, a mobile data server, or other intermediate server also coupled to caller 's external device (see e.g. wireless communication support components  of ). This may be the case, for example, if caller  and the party he is calling belong to the same organization or are otherwise served by the same network or host system . If the data communication channel between the wireless communication support component and caller 's external device has already been secured for other data communications, then server  may transmit the session key to caller 's external device via the wireless communication support component.","Public key encryption may also be used to exchange session keys, or to encode voice communication data directly in variant embodiments. Public key encryption algorithms are known. Generally, data encoded using a private key of a private key\/public key pair can only be decoded using the corresponding public key of the pair, and data encoded using a public key of a private key\/public key pair can only be decoded using the corresponding private key of the pair.","For example, in one variant embodiment, server  may have access to a public key associated with caller  or his external device. The requisite public key may have been obtained by server  from an LDAP server, or possibly from caller 's external device with the data received with the incoming call data (flow line ). In known manner, the session key may be encrypted with caller 's public key at server , and transmitted to caller 's external device, where it can be decrypted at caller 's external device with a corresponding private key that should only be available at that external device. Subsequent voice communication data may be encrypted at caller 's external device with the received session key after it is decrypted. In this embodiment where public key cryptography is employed to securely exchange the session key, a secure path between server  and caller 's external device need not be pre-established in order for the session key to be exchanged.","In another variant embodiment, server  may have access to a public key associated with caller  or his external device, and may simply provide caller 's external device with its own (i.e. a server's) public key to be used to secure subsequent voice communications. The corresponding private key associated with the server's public key is intended to only be accessible by server . Subsequent voice communications to be transmitted to server  may be encrypted at caller 's external device with the server's public key. Conversely, voice communications received at caller 's external device will have been encrypted by server  with caller 's public key, and will be decrypted at caller 's external device with caller 's corresponding private key. In this embodiment where the public keys of both devices are used to directly encrypt voice communication data, a secure path between server  and caller 's external device need not be established, and a session key need not be exchanged.","In a variant embodiment, the encryption key to be used to encrypt voice communication data may be pre-stored on caller 's external device. For example, it may be installed on the external device at the time of manufacture, or subsequently downloaded to the external device from a desktop computer via a physical connection (e.g. during a synchronization process). Other secure methods of pre-exchanging the requisite encryption key may be employed, and the \u201cencryption key\u201d transmitted to caller 's external device from network server  at flow line may simply comprise an appropriate key identifier that indicates the pre-stored or pre-exchanged encryption key at the external device to be used in securing subsequent voice communications.","It will be understood by persons skilled in the art that the key exchange shown at flow line need not be performed immediately after the data associated with the incoming call is received by server  (flow line ). For example, in one embodiment, the key exchange may take place only after the call is actually \u201canswered\u201d or accepted by the party being called (or where a voicemail message is to be left). In this manner, the encryption key need not be exchanged unnecessarily where no voice communications to or from the external device are to take place.","However, exchanging encryption keys (e.g. a session key) at an earlier stage may minimize delays in setting up the secure connection between caller 's external device and network server , from the perspective of the parties associated with the call, particularly caller . In one embodiment, the key exchange depicted by flow line may be performed contemporaneously with at least some of the steps taken to setup the call at the receiving party's endpoint, as described below. This may speed up the connection process, enhancing the user experience.","Referring again to , server  sends a call setup request data signal to the office telephone (flow line ). The call setup request data signal will cause an audible and\/or visual indication on the office telephone (i.e. \u201cringing\u201d). If the party receiving the call answers the office telephone, the call is deemed to be accepted and a call setup response answer data signal is returned to server  (flow line ). In response, the server  will setup a voice call to the office telephone (voice signal flow line ) as well as to caller 's external device (voice signal flow line ).

Alternatively, the server may decrypt encrypted voice communication data received from caller 's external device with the appropriate encryption key (e.g. the session key exchanged at flow line ), and re-encrypt the voice communication data with a second encryption key (e.g. the session key exchanged with remote device  at flow line ) before transmitting the voice communication data to remote device .","Voice communication data originating from the remote device  (flow line ) will also be in encrypted form (e.g. having been encrypted with a session key exchanged at flow line ) when received at server . The server  may then relay the encrypted voice communication data to caller 's external device if the same session key was exchanged by server  with both remote device  and caller 's external device. Alternatively, the server  may decrypt encrypted voice communication data received from remote device  with the appropriate encryption key (e.g. the session key exchanged at flow line ), and re-encrypt the voice communication data with another encryption key (e.g. the session key exchanged with caller 's external device at flow line ) before transmitting the voice communication data to caller 's external device.","In a variant embodiment, the key exchange performed at flow line may be integrated with the call setup functions performed at flow lines and ","In a variant embodiment, peer-to-peer encrypted calls may be established via a different network server other than server  as described herein. For example, the functionality that is required to facilitate encrypted voice communications between an external device and either a remote device  or other telephony device may be implemented in a message management server (e.g. message management server ) or other wireless communication support component, or other computing device.","Where the incoming call originates from an external device such as a mobile telephone and is to be connected to a telephony device associated with a primary telephone number, at least some of the embodiments described herein allows the call to be connected with mobile devices and with non-mobile telephony devices within a secure domain (e.g. devices connected to a PBX in an enterprise network). The re-routing capabilities of embodiments described herein in which the system can selectively establish communications with one of a plurality of telephony devices associated with a particular telephone number, so that a user can take calls at a device deemed to be convenient to him for example, are integrated with the ability to securely communicate voice data for transmission over standard cellular networks.","Accordingly, it will be understood that the scenarios previously described with reference to  (deflecting an inbound call to voicemail),  (outgoing call scenarios), and  (various call-in progress scenarios, including multiple party conferencing) can be modified to accommodate the features of embodiments described herein generally with respect to , in order to facilitate encrypted voice communications with at least one external device. In particular, where a call is to be connected to one or more external devices and voice communication data is to be secured, the data and voice flows of the above-mentioned scenarios can be modified such that at least one additional step of exchanging at least one encryption key with the one or more external devices is performed. Subsequently, voice communication data being sent to an external device by a network server (e.g. server ) is encrypted. Voice communication data transmitted by an external device to the server is also encrypted. Voice communication data received by the network server (e.g. server ) from an external device can be relayed in encrypted form to another device such as a mobile device, or alternatively, decrypted by the server. The decrypted voice communication data may be transmitted in decrypted form if it is being sent to a device that is not a mobile device, and that operates within the secure domain of an enterprise network. However, the server may re-encrypt the voice communication data if it is to be transmitted to a device operating outside of the secure domain of the enterprise network, such as another mobile device. Moreover, in example embodiments, incoming calls received at the network server from an external device may be typically in the form of a data signal, which comprises an indication that voice communications with the external device are to be secured.","Referring to , a flowchart illustrating an example of inbound station-to-station call processing performed in accordance with at least one embodiment is shown generally as . Some details with respect to some of the steps described with reference to  have been previously described with reference to earlier Figures, and have not been repeated here for ease of exposition.","As illustrated in , when an incoming station-to-station call (i.e., a direct extension call from one internal telephone device to another internal device) is received by the PBX  for an existing PBX extension (at ), an encryption key (e.g. a session key), as described with reference to  for example, is exchanged with the caller's external device (at ). The caller's external device may be, for example, a mobile device. Although  is shown to immediately follow  in this example, it will be understood that  may be performed later in method , but prior to the transmission of voice communication data to or from the caller's external device.","The PBX  looks up the PBX extension in the CDP steering table (at ) to determine where the call should be routed. Based on information in the CDP steering table, the call to the PBX extension is routed to the server  instead of being directly routed to an office telephone (step ).","As is known in the art, the incoming call will have automatic number identification (ANI) and dialed number identification service (DNIS) information. The ANI identifies the telephone number of the calling party and is traditionally used for \u201ccaller ID.\u201d DNIS identifies the telephone number of the called party. The server  reads the ANI\/DNIS information from the incoming call to obtain the DNIS information (at ). As noted above, the server  has assigned a new SERVER-PBX extension to each existing PBX extension. The SERVER-PBX extension and user preferences are obtained from database  through processor  by using the DNIS information as an index into the server  database  (at ). Routing information will include caller information, any additional remote telephone numbers or voicemail box numbers, or other identification numbers of communication devices associated with the PBX extension. Examples of user preferences are given below.","At , the server  holds the incoming communication and pulses the PBX  through the PRI connection  between the server  and PBX  with the SERVER-PBX extension obtained in step . This causes the PBX  to ring the associated office telephone (e.g., telephone ). At the same time (if the user preferences indicate the desire), the server  attempts to contact one or more alternative remote communication devices (e.g., by initially sending a data signal to the remote device ). In such an embodiment, the station-to-station call is thus routed to both the office telephone and also to at least one remote device  simultaneously or substantially simultaneously (or as determined by the user preferences).","As shown in , step  comprises multiple steps. When server  attempts to contact remote device  via system , the server  will forward a data signal (e.g., a call setup request) through system  to the remote device  (at ). The data signal carries the DNIS information to the remote device  to alert the receiving party that an incoming enterprise call is present and to provide its associated ANI\/DNIS information. At , remote device  generates identification information to display to a user. The user can then input a selection (at ) to choose to accept the call (at ), divert the call to voicemail (at ) or deny the call (at ). This choice is sent to the server via a data signal (see e.g., ). If the call is accepted, the server  connects the call to the user via the PSTN connection (at ). If the call is diverted to voicemail, the server  forwards the call to the voicemail box associated with the called extension (at ). If the call is denied by the user, the server drops the call path to the PSTN (via a user setting option on the remote device ) (step ). It should be appreciated that the remote device  can be programmed to automatically accept the call, divert the call to voicemail or deny the call based on the received ANI\/DNIS information.","It should be noted that the illustrated processing method  is one example of how an incoming station-to-station call may be handled. Individual user preferences may alter the way the call is processed. It should be noted that in one example embodiment, the server  is signaling (and if accepted, calling) the remote device and pulsing the PBX  with the SERVER-PBX extension. This gives the server  control over the connections to the office telephone and the remote device . It should also be noted that the server  can out dial (once the data signaling has occurred) several remote numbers, if so desired, and that embodiments should not be limited to the dialing of one remote number. One user preference, for example, can be to route the calls sequentially (enterprise phone first, then remote device, or vice versa). Another preference may be to always send the calls only to the remote device .","Referring again to , at step , it is determined if the current ring count (i.e., current number of rings) exceeds the maximum ring count defined by the user. Since the server  is controlling the call at this time it can track the number of rings. This may be done in several ways. For example, the server  may keep track of the number of rings using a timer that corresponds to the typical timing associated with the selected ring count. That is, if the user ring count is two, the server  checks to see if a time equivalent to the time it takes for two rings to occur has elapsed. If this time has elapsed, then the current \u201cring count\u201d exceeds the maximum count defined by the user. The server  can instead, count the rings being sent to the extension if desired.","If the ring count exceeds the maximum ring count, then the server  (if desired and determined by a user preference) forwards the call to the enterprise's voicemail (at ). If the ring count does not exceed the maximum ring count, the server  determines if the call is answered at the PBX extension (at ). The PBX  will issue an off-hook message to the server  if the appropriate office telephone is answered. If it is determined that the call is answered at the PBX extension, the server  drops the call's path to the remote device via the system  and maintains the path to the PBX  (at ).","If at , it is determined that the remote device was answered by the user, the server  drops the SERVER-PBX extension path to the PBX (at ) and initiates the connection between the calling party and the remote device (at ) via the PSTN after exchanging an encryption key (e.g. a session key) with the remote device (at ) to be used to encrypt subsequent voice communications. Server  will substantially seamlessly connect the incoming call to remote device  via the PSTN connection.","The flow of method steps continues to , where the call comprising encrypted voice communications is managed by a network server. Whenever voice communication data is being sent to a mobile device by a network server (e.g. server ), that data is encrypted. In operation, voice communication data that is transmitted by a mobile device (whether it be the caller's external device or the remote device  to which server  routed the incoming call) to the network server will be encrypted. Voice communication data received by the network server from a mobile device can be relayed in encrypted form (e.g. to another mobile device), or alternatively, decrypted by the server. The decrypted voice communication data may be transmitted in decrypted form if it is being sent to a device that is not a mobile device and that operates within the secure domain of an enterprise network (e.g. if the call was determined to be answered at a PBX extension at , or if it is to be forwarded to a PBX voicemail within the secure domain at ). However, the server may re-encrypt the voice communication data if it is to be transmitted to an external device operating outside of the secure domain of the enterprise network, such as another mobile device for example.","In accordance with at least one example embodiment, it may be desired that the call to the remote device is actually answered by the user and not by a service of the wireless carrier. In known systems, wireless carriers often answer a call if there is a bad connection, the wireless channels are overloaded or for other reasons (such as initiating a wireless carrier's answering service). When the wireless carrier answers the call in these situations, the call would appear to server  as an \u201canswered call\u201d even if the remote user did not answer the call itself.","One way to distinguish a user answered call from a wireless service answered call is to prompt the user to transmit an acknowledgement signal such as a dual tone multi-frequency (DTMF) tone to the server  via the keypad of the remote device. Upon detecting the answered call, server  can send a voice message instructing the user to e.g., \u201cpress 1 to complete the call or press 2 to send caller to voicemail.\u201d If the DTMF tone is not received, then the server  presumes that the call was answered by the wireless carrier, or that the user does not want to answer the call which the server  treats as an unanswered call.","If the incoming call is deflected to voicemail, server  will connect the incoming call to an on-server or PBX voicemail box associated with the PBX extension. If the incoming call is denied, the call will be disconnected by server . If the call is not answered at the remote device at , the process flow returns to  to check whether the ring count has exceeded the maximum ring count. It should be noted that, if desired, the server  can play an interactive menu to the calling party, which allows the calling party to page the called party, leave a voicemail message or to transfer to an operator.","In accordance with an example embodiment, the database of server  may also contain numerous system-defined user access rights and user modifiable preferences, which can alter the call processing of the embodiments described herein. An office administrator may use the network computers , or a remote administration device  to set user access rights and priorities. The user may use the remote administration device  to set numerous user preferences. It is desirable that a Web-based or graphical user interface be used so that the user can easily access and set user preferences. The network computers , (or remote device ) may also be used by the user if so desired.","Many enterprises have already provided wireless communications devices to their personnel. These wireless devices already have existing telephone numbers and are external to the enterprise PBX. Since the devices are already in use by personnel and their clients, the enterprise does not want to change their telephone numbers. There is a need to integrate these telephone numbers into the enterprise PBX. One way to integrate these telephone numbers would be to forward their unanswered calls to the voicemail. This can be accomplished by at least some embodiments described herein whether the wireless telephone number is associated with a PBX extension or not.","For example, the enterprise can purchase additional DID telephone numbers from the telephone company (if necessary). These additional DID telephone numbers are stored in the database of the server  together with special routing instructions to route all calls directly to a user's voicemail box (or other destination as desired). The user of a wireless telephone can program the wireless telephone to forward unanswered calls to his associated DID telephone number. Alternatively, the user can have the wireless carrier forward unanswered calls to the DID telephone number as well. This way, any unanswered call to the wireless telephone will be forwarded to the server , which resolves the DID and forwards the call to the appropriate voicemail box. Using this feature, the likelihood is increased that the user will retrieve his messages since he can retrieve all of his messages through the voicemail. This also alleviates the need for the user to have a separate voicemail service from the wireless carrier, which may reduce the cost of the wireless service.","Embodiments described herein may be utilized in any number of different applications. One embodiment, for example, applies to a hotel having a large number of rooms with dedicated phones lines for each room to provide a second or \u201cvirtual phone line\u201d without routing additional telephone lines or other wiring to the room. Each room would have the original hard-wired telephone extension that is connected to the enterprise PBX, as well as a wireless device (e.g., telephone or PDA) associated with the PBX extension serving as a second or virtual telephone line. If, for example, a guest of the hotel were using the hard-wired telephone line for his personal computer, he could still make and receive calls through the PBX with the wireless device. Thus, at least some of the embodiments may allow an enterprise to double its telephone lines without incurring the expense of additional wiring required to install a second line for the hotel rooms.","It should be appreciated that the system could utilize \u201cvoice over IP\u201d communications (i.e., voice over a data network) with appropriate remote devices. Many of today's wireless telephones and PDA's have the ability to place and receive cellular and data (voice over IP) telephone calls and to access the Internet or other data network. It should be appreciated that any conventional remote device could be used with system.","In at least one example embodiment, remote device  can be implemented as mobile device , illustrated in . An external device from which an incoming call is received or to which an outgoing call is placed as previously described may also be a mobile device , as illustrated in .","Mobile device  may be a two-way communication device with advanced data communication capabilities including the capability to communicate with other mobile devices or computer systems through a network of transceiver stations. The mobile device may also have the capability to allow voice communication. Depending on the functionality provided by the mobile device, it may be referred to as a data messaging device, a two-way pager, a cellular telephone with data messaging capabilities, a wireless Internet appliance, or a data communication device (with or without telephony capabilities). To aid the reader in understanding the structure of the mobile device  and how it communicates with other devices and host systems, reference will now be made to .","Referring to , shown therein is a block diagram of an example embodiment of a mobile device . The mobile device  includes a number of components such as a main processor  that controls the overall operation of the mobile device . Communication functions, including data and voice communications, are performed through a communication subsystem . The communication subsystem  may receive messages from and sends messages to a wireless network . In an example embodiment of the mobile device , the communication subsystem  is configured in accordance with the Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) and General Packet Radio Services (GPRS) standards. The GSM\/GPRS wireless network is used worldwide and it is expected that these standards will be superseded eventually by Enhanced Data GSM Environment (EDGE) and Universal Mobile Telecommunications Service (UMTS). New standards are still being defined, but it is believed that they will have similarities to the network behavior described herein, and it will also be understood by persons skilled in the art that the embodiments described herein are intended to use any other suitable standards that are developed in the future. The wireless link connecting the communication subsystem  with the wireless network  represents one or more different Radio Frequency (RF) channels, operating according to defined protocols specified for GSM\/GPRS communications. With newer network protocols, these channels may be capable of supporting both circuit switched voice communications and packet switched data communications.","Although the wireless network  associated with mobile device  is a GSM\/GPRS wireless network in one example implementation, other wireless networks may also be associated with the mobile device  in variant implementations. The different types of wireless networks that may be employed include, for example, data-centric wireless networks, voice-centric wireless networks, and dual-mode networks that can support both voice and data communications over the same physical base stations. Combined dual-mode networks include, but are not limited to, Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) or CDMA2000 networks, GSM\/GPRS networks (as mentioned above), and future third-generation (3G) networks like EDGE and UMTS. Some other examples of data-centric networks include WiFi 802.11, Mobitex\u2122 and DataTAC\u2122 network communication systems. Examples of other voice-centric data networks include Personal Communication Systems (PCS) networks like GSM and Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) systems.","The main processor  may also interact with additional subsystems such as a Random Access Memory (RAM) , a flash memory , a display , an auxiliary input\/output (I\/O) subsystem , a data port , a keyboard , a speaker , a microphone , short-range communications subsystem  and other device subsystems .","Some of the subsystems of the mobile device  may perform communication-related functions, whereas other subsystems may provide \u201cresident\u201d or on-device functions. By way of example, the display  and the keyboard  may be used for both communication-related functions, such as entering a text message for transmission over the network , and device-resident functions such as a calculator or task list.","The mobile device  can send and receive communication signals over the wireless network  after required network registration or activation procedures have been completed. Network access is associated with a subscriber or user of the mobile device . To identify a subscriber, the mobile device  may require a SIM\/RUIM card  (i.e. Subscriber Identity Module or a Removable User Identity Module) to be inserted into a SIM\/RUIM interface  in order to communicate with a network. The SIM card or RUIM  is one type of a conventional \u201csmart card\u201d that can be used to identify a subscriber of the mobile device  and to personalize the mobile device , among other things. Without the SIM card , the mobile device  may not be fully operational for communication with the wireless network . By inserting the SIM card\/RUIM  into the SIM\/RUIM interface , a subscriber may access all subscribed services. Services may include, without limitation: web browsing and messaging such as e-mail, voicemail, Short Message Service (SMS), and Multimedia Messaging Services (MMS). More advanced services may include, without limitation: point of sale, field service and sales force automation. The SIM card\/RUIM  may include a processor and memory for storing information. Once the SIM card\/RUIM  is inserted into the SIM\/RUIM interface , it is coupled to the main processor . In order to identify the subscriber, the SIM card\/RUIM  can include some user parameters such as an International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI). An advantage of using the SIM card\/RUIM  is that a subscriber need not be necessarily bound by any single physical mobile device. The SIM card\/RUIM  may store additional subscriber information for a mobile device as well, including datebook (or calendar) information and recent call information. Alternatively, user identification information can also be programmed into the flash memory .","The mobile device  may be a battery-powered device and includes a battery interface  for receiving one or more rechargeable batteries . In at least some embodiments, the battery  can be a smart battery with an embedded microprocessor. The battery interface  is coupled to a regulator (not shown), which assists the battery  in providing power V+ to the mobile device . Although current technology makes use of a battery, future technologies such as micro fuel cells may provide the power to the mobile device . In some embodiments, mobile device  may be solar-powered.","The mobile device  may include an operating system  and software components  to  which are described in more detail below. The operating system  and the software components  to  that are executed by the main processor  are typically stored in a persistent store such as the flash memory , which may alternatively be a read-only memory (ROM) or similar storage element (not shown). Those skilled in the art will appreciate that portions of the operating system  and the software components  to , such as specific device applications, or parts thereof, may be temporarily loaded into a volatile store such as the RAM . Other software components can also be included, as is well known to those skilled in the art.","The subset of software applications  that control basic device operations, including data and voice communication applications, will normally be installed on the mobile device  during its manufacture. Other software applications include a message application  that can be any suitable software program that allows a user of the mobile device  to send and receive electronic messages. Various alternatives exist for the message application  as is well known to those skilled in the art. Messages that have been sent or received by the user are typically stored in the flash memory  of the mobile device  or some other suitable storage element in the mobile device . In at least some embodiments, some of the sent and received messages may be stored remotely from the device  such as in a data store of an associated host system that the mobile device  communicates with.","The software applications can further include a device state module , a Personal Information Manager (PIM) , and other suitable modules (not shown). The device state module  provides persistence, i.e. the device state module  ensures that important device data is stored in persistent memory, such as the flash memory , so that the data is not lost when the mobile device  is turned off or loses power.","The PIM  includes functionality for organizing and managing data items of interest to the user, such as, but not limited to, e-mail, contacts, calendar events, voicemails, appointments, and task items. A PIM application has the ability to send and receive data items via the wireless network . PIM data items may be seamlessly integrated, synchronized, and updated via the wireless network  with the mobile device subscriber's corresponding data items stored and\/or associated with a host computer system. This functionality may create a mirrored host computer on the mobile device  with respect to such items. This may be particularly advantageous when the host computer system is the mobile device subscriber's office computer system.","The mobile device  also includes a connect module , and an IT policy module . The connect module  implements the communication protocols that are required for the mobile device  to communicate with the wireless infrastructure and any host system, such as an enterprise system, that the mobile device  is authorized to interface with. Examples of a wireless infrastructure and an enterprise system are given in , which are described in more detail below.","The connect module  includes a set of APIs that can be integrated with the mobile device  to allow the mobile device  to use any number of services associated with the enterprise system. The connect module  allows the mobile device  to establish an end-to-end secure, authenticated communication pipe with the host system. A subset of applications for which access is provided by the connect module  can be used to pass IT policy commands from the host system to the mobile device . This can be done in a wireless or wired manner. These instructions can then be passed to the IT policy module  to modify the configuration of the device . Alternatively, in some cases, the IT policy update can also be done over a wired connection.","The IT policy module  receives IT policy data that encodes the IT policy. The IT policy module  then ensures that the IT policy data is authenticated by the mobile device . The IT policy data can then be stored in the flash memory  in its native form. After the IT policy data is stored, a global notification can be sent by the IT policy module  to all of the applications residing on the mobile device . Applications for which the IT policy may be applicable then respond by reading the IT policy data to look for IT policy rules that are applicable.","The IT policy module  can include a parser (not shown), which can be used by the applications to read the IT policy rules. In some cases, another module or application can provide the parser. Grouped IT policy rules, described in more detail below, are retrieved as byte streams, which are then sent (recursively, in a sense) into the parser to determine the values of each IT policy rule defined within the grouped IT policy rule. In at least some embodiments, the IT policy module  can determine which applications are affected by the IT policy data and send a notification to only those applications. In either of these cases, for applications that aren't running at the time of the notification, the applications can call the parser or the IT policy module  when they are executed to determine if there are any relevant IT policy rules in the newly received IT policy data.","All applications that support rules in the IT Policy may be coded to know the type of data to expect. For example, the value that is set for the \u201cWEP User Name\u201d IT policy rule is known to be a string; therefore the value in the IT policy data that corresponds to this rule is interpreted as a string. As another example, the setting for the \u201cSet Maximum Password Attempts\u201d IT policy rule is known to be an integer, and therefore the value in the IT policy data that corresponds to this rule is interpreted as such.","After the IT policy rules have been applied to the applicable applications or configuration files, the IT policy module  sends an acknowledgement back to the host system to indicate that the IT policy data was received and successfully applied.","Other types of software applications can also be installed on the mobile device . These software applications can be third party applications, which are added after the manufacture of the mobile device . Examples of third party applications include games, calculators, utilities, etc.","The additional applications can be loaded onto the mobile device  through at least one of the wireless network , the auxiliary I\/O subsystem , the data port , the short-range communications subsystem , or any other suitable device subsystem . This flexibility in application installation increases the functionality of the mobile device  and may provide enhanced on-device functions, communication-related functions, or both. For example, secure communication applications may enable electronic commerce functions and other such financial transactions to be performed using the mobile device .","The data port  enables a subscriber to set preferences through an external device or software application and extends the capabilities of the mobile device  by providing for information or software downloads to the mobile device  other than through a wireless communication network. The alternate download path may, for example, be used to load an encryption key onto the mobile device  through a direct and thus reliable and trusted connection to provide secure device communication.","The data port  can be any suitable port that enables data communication between the mobile device  and another computing device. The data port  can be a serial or a parallel port. In some instances, the data port  can be a USB port that includes data lines for data transfer and a supply line that can provide a charging current to charge the battery  of the mobile device .","The short-range communications subsystem  provides for communication between the mobile device  and different systems or devices, without the use of the wireless network . For example, the subsystem  may include an infrared device and associated circuits and components for short-range communication. Examples of short-range communication standards include standards developed by the Infrared Data Association (IrDA), Bluetooth, and the 802.11 family of standards developed by IEEE.","In use, a received signal such as a text message, an e-mail message, or web page download will be processed by the communication subsystem  and input to the main processor . The main processor  will then process the received signal for output to the display  or alternatively to the auxiliary I\/O subsystem . A subscriber may also compose data items, such as e-mail messages, for example, using the keyboard  in conjunction with the display  and possibly the auxiliary I\/O subsystem . The auxiliary subsystem  may include devices such as: a touch screen, mouse, track ball, infrared fingerprint detector, or a roller wheel with dynamic button pressing capability. The keyboard  is preferably an alphanumeric keyboard and\/or telephone-type keypad. However, other types of keyboards may also be used. A composed item may be transmitted over the wireless network  through the communication subsystem .","For voice communications, the overall operation of the mobile device  may be substantially similar, except that the received signals are output to the speaker , and signals for transmission are generated by the microphone , for example. Alternative voice or audio I\/O subsystems, such as a voice message recording subsystem, can also be implemented on the mobile device . Although voice or audio signal output is accomplished primarily through the speaker , the display  can also be used to provide additional information such as the identity of a calling party, duration of a voice call, or other voice call related information.","Referring to , an example block diagram of the communication subsystem component  is shown. The communication subsystem  may include, for example, a receiver , a transmitter , as well as associated components such as one or more embedded or internal antenna elements  and , Local Oscillators (LOs) , and a processing module such as a Digital Signal Processor (DSP) . The particular design of the communication subsystem  may be dependent upon the communication network  with which the mobile device  is intended to operate. Thus, it should be understood that the design illustrated in  serves only as one example.","Signals received by the antenna  through the wireless network  are input to the receiver , which may perform such common receiver functions as signal amplification, frequency down conversion, filtering, channel selection, and analog-to-digital (A\/D) conversion. A\/D conversion of a received signal allows more complex communication functions such as demodulation and decoding to be performed in the DSP . In a similar manner, signals to be transmitted are processed, including modulation and encoding, by the DSP . These DSP-processed signals are input to the transmitter  for digital-to-analog (D\/A) conversion, frequency up conversion, filtering, amplification and transmission over the wireless network  via the antenna . The DSP  not only processes communication signals, but may also provide for receiver and transmitter control. For example, the gains applied to communication signals in the receiver  and the transmitter  may be adaptively controlled through automatic gain control algorithms implemented in the DSP .","The wireless link between the mobile device  and the wireless network  can contain one or more different channels, typically different RF channels, and associated protocols used between the mobile device  and the wireless network . An RF channel is a limited resource that must be conserved, typically due to limits in overall bandwidth and limited battery power of the mobile device .","When the mobile device  is fully operational, the transmitter  is typically keyed or turned on only when it is transmitting to the wireless network  and is otherwise turned off to conserve resources. Similarly, the receiver  is periodically turned off to conserve power until it is needed to receive signals or information (if at all) during designated time periods.","Referring to , a block diagram of an example implementation of a node  of the wireless network  is shown. In practice, the wireless network  comprises one or more nodes . In conjunction with the connect module , the mobile device  can communicate with the node  within the wireless network . In the example implementation of , the node  is configured in accordance with General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) and Global Systems for Mobile (GSM) technologies. The node  may include, for example, a base station controller (BSC)  with an associated tower station , a Packet Control Unit (PCU)  added for GPRS support in GSM, a Mobile Switching Center (MSC) , a Home Location Register (HLR) , a Visitor Location Registry (VLR) , a Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) , a Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) , and a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) . This list of components is not meant to be an exhaustive list of the components of every node  within a GSM\/GPRS network, but rather a list of components that may be commonly used in communications through the network .","In a GSM network, the MSC  may be coupled to the BSC  and to a landline network, such as a Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN)  to satisfy circuit switched requirements. The connection through the PCU , the SGSN  and the GGSN  to a public or private network (Internet)  (also referred to herein generally as a shared network infrastructure) represents the data path for GPRS capable mobile devices. In a GSM network extended with GPRS capabilities, the BSC  also contains the Packet Control Unit (PCU)  that connects to the SGSN  to control segmentation, radio channel allocation and to satisfy packet switched requirements. To track the location of the mobile device  and availability for both circuit switched and packet switched management, the HLR  is shared between the MSC  and the SGSN . Access to the VLR  is controlled by the MSC .","The station  may be a fixed transceiver station and together with the BSC  form fixed transceiver equipment. The fixed transceiver equipment may provide wireless network coverage for a particular coverage area commonly referred to as a \u201ccell\u201d. The fixed transceiver equipment transmits communication signals to and receives communication signals from mobile devices within its cell via the station . The fixed transceiver equipment normally performs such functions as modulation and possibly encoding and\/or encryption of signals to be transmitted to the mobile device  in accordance with particular, usually predetermined, communication protocols and parameters, under control of its controller. The fixed transceiver equipment similarly demodulates and possibly decodes and decrypts, if necessary, any communication signals received from the mobile device  within its cell. Communication protocols and parameters may vary between different nodes. For example, one node may employ a different modulation scheme and operate at different frequencies than other nodes.","For all mobile devices  registered with a specific network, permanent configuration data such as a user profile may be stored in the HLR . The HLR  may also contain location information for each registered mobile device and can be queried to determine the current location of a mobile device. The MSC  may be responsible for a group of location areas and store the data of the mobile devices currently in its area of responsibility in the VLR . Further, the VLR  may also contain information on mobile devices that are visiting other networks. The information in the VLR  may include part of the permanent mobile device data transmitted from the HLR  to the VLR  for faster access. By moving additional information from a remote HLR  node to the VLR , the amount of traffic between these nodes can be reduced so that voice and data services can be provided with faster response times and at the same time require less use of computing resources.","The SGSN  and the GGSN  are elements that may be added for GPRS support; namely packet switched data support, within GSM. The SGSN  and the MSC  may have similar responsibilities within the wireless network  by keeping track of the location of each mobile device . The SGSN  may also perform security functions and access control for data traffic on the wireless network . The GGSN  provides internetworking connections with external packet switched networks and connects to one or more SGSN's  via an Internet Protocol (IP) backbone network operated within the network . During normal operations, a given mobile device  must perform a \u201cGPRS Attach\u201d to acquire an IP address and to access data services. This feature may not be present in circuit switched voice channels as Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) addresses are used for routing incoming and outgoing calls. Currently, GPRS capable networks may use private, dynamically assigned IP addresses, thus requiring the DHCP server  connected to the GGSN . There are many mechanisms for dynamic IP assignment, including using a combination of a Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) server and a DHCP server. Once the GPRS Attach is complete, a logical connection may be established from a mobile device , through the PCU , and the SGSN  to an Access Point Node (APN) within the GGSN . The APN represents a logical end of an IP tunnel that can either access direct Internet compatible services or private network connections. The APN may also represent a security mechanism for the network , insofar as each mobile device  may be assigned to one or more APNs and mobile devices  may not exchange data without first performing a GPRS Attach to an APN that it has been authorized to use. The APN may be considered to be similar to an Internet domain name such as \u201cmyconnection.wireless.com\u201d.","Once the GPRS Attach operation is complete, a tunnel may be created and all traffic may be exchanged within standard IP packets using any protocol that can be supported in IP packets. This includes tunneling methods such as IP over IP as in the case with some IPSecurity (IPsec) connections used with Virtual Private Networks (VPN). These tunnels are also referred to as Packet Data Protocol (PDP) Contexts and there may be a limited number of these available in the network . To maximize use of the PDP Contexts, the network  may run an idle timer for each PDP Context to determine if there is a lack of activity. When a mobile device  is not using its PDP Context, the PDP Context can be de-allocated and the IP address returned to the IP address pool managed by the DHCP server .","Referring to , shown therein is a block diagram illustrating components of an example configuration of a host system  that the mobile device  can communicate with in conjunction with the connect module . The host system  will typically be a corporate enterprise or other local area network (LAN), but may also be a home office computer or some other private system, for example, in variant implementations. In this example shown in , the host system  is depicted as a LAN of an organization to which a user of the mobile device  belongs. Typically, a plurality of mobile devices can communicate wirelessly with the host system  through one or more nodes  of the wireless network .","The host system  comprises a number of network components connected to each other by a network . For instance, a user's desktop computer with an accompanying cradle  for the user's mobile device  is situated on a LAN connection. The cradle  for the mobile device  can be coupled to the computer by a serial or a Universal Serial Bus (USB) connection, for example. Other user computers -are also situated on the network , and each may or may not be equipped with an accompanying cradle . The cradle  facilitates the loading of information (e.g. PIM data, private symmetric encryption keys to facilitate secure communications) from the user computer to the mobile device , and may be particularly useful for bulk information updates often performed in initializing the mobile device  for use. The information downloaded to the mobile device  may include certificates used in the exchange of messages.","It will be understood by persons skilled in the art that the user computers -will typically also be connected to other peripheral devices, such as printers, etc. which are not explicitly shown in . Furthermore, only a subset of network components of the host system  are shown in  for ease of exposition, and it will be understood by persons skilled in the art that the host system  will comprise additional components that are not explicitly shown in  for this example configuration. More generally, the host system  may represent a smaller part of a larger network (not shown) of the organization, and may comprise different components and\/or be arranged in different topologies than that shown in the example embodiment of .","To facilitate the operation of the mobile device  and the wireless communication of messages and message-related data between the mobile device  and components of the host system , a number of wireless communication support components  can be provided. In some implementations, the wireless communication support components  can include a message management server , a mobile data server , a contact server , and a device manager module . The device manager module  includes an IT Policy editor  and an IT user property editor , as well as other software components for allowing an IT administrator to configure the mobile devices . In an alternative embodiment, there may be one editor that provides the functionality of both the IT policy editor  and the IT user property editor . The support components  may also include a data store , and an IT policy server . The IT policy server  may include, for example, a processor , a network interface  and a memory unit . The processor  controls the operation of the IT policy server  and executes functions related to the standardized IT policy as described below. The network interface  allows the IT policy server  to communicate with the various components of the host system  and the mobile devices . The memory unit  can store functions used in implementing the IT policy as well as related data. Those skilled in the art know how to implement these various components. Other components may also be included as is well known to those skilled in the art. Further, in some implementations, the data store  can be part of any one of the servers.","In this example embodiment, the mobile device  communicates with the host system  through node  of the wireless network  and a shared network infrastructure  such as a service provider network or the public Internet. Access to the host system  may be provided through one or more routers (not shown), and computing devices of the host system  may operate from behind a firewall or proxy server . The proxy server  provides a secure node and a wireless internet gateway for the host system . The proxy server  intelligently routes data to the correct destination server within the host system .","In some implementations, the host system  can include a wireless VPN router (not shown) to facilitate data exchange between the host system  and the mobile device . The wireless VPN router allows a VPN connection to be established directly through a specific wireless network to the mobile device . The wireless VPN router can be used with the Internet Protocol (IP) Version 6 (IPV6) and IP-based wireless networks. This protocol can provide enough IP addresses so that each mobile device has a dedicated IP address, making it possible to push information to a mobile device at any time. An advantage of using a wireless VPN router is that it can be an off-the-shelf VPN component, and does not require a separate wireless gateway and separate wireless infrastructure. A VPN connection can preferably be a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)\/IP or User Datagram Protocol (UDP)\/IP connection for delivering the messages directly to the mobile device  in this alternative implementation.","Messages intended for a user of the mobile device  are initially received by a message server  of the host system . Such messages may originate from any number of sources. For instance, a message may have been sent by a sender from the computer within the host system , from a different mobile device (not shown) connected to the wireless network  or a different wireless network, or from a different computing device, or other device capable of sending messages, via the shared network infrastructure , possibly through an application service provider (ASP) or Internet service provider (ISP), for example.","The message server  typically acts as the primary interface for the exchange of messages, particularly e-mail messages, within the organization and over the shared network infrastructure . Each user in the organization that has been set up to send and receive messages is typically associated with a user account managed by the message server . Some example implementations of the message server  include a Microsoft Exchange\u2122 server, a Lotus Domino\u2122 server, a Novell Groupwise\u2122 server, or another suitable mail server installed in a corporate environment. In some implementations, the host system  may comprise multiple message servers . The message server  may also be adapted to provide additional functions beyond message management, including the management of data associated with calendars and task lists, for example.","When messages are received by the message server , they are typically stored in a data store associated with the message server . In at least some embodiments, the data store may be a separate hardware unit, such as data store , that the message server  communicates with. Messages can be subsequently retrieved and delivered to users by accessing the message server . For instance, an e-mail client application operating on a user's computer may request the e-mail messages associated with that user's account stored on the data store associated with the message server . These messages are then retrieved from the data store and stored locally on the computer . The data store associated with the message server  can store copies of each message that is locally stored on the mobile device . Alternatively, the data store associated with the message server  can store all of the messages for the user of the mobile device  and only a smaller number of messages can be stored on the mobile device  to conserve memory. For instance, the most recent messages (i.e., those received in the past two to three months for example) can be stored on the mobile device .","When operating the mobile device , the user may wish to have e-mail messages retrieved for delivery to the mobile device . The message application  operating on the mobile device  may also request messages associated with the user's account from the message server . The message application  may be configured (either by the user or by an administrator, possibly in accordance with an organization's information technology (IT) policy) to make this request at the direction of the user, at some pre-defined time interval, or upon the occurrence of some pre-defined event. In some implementations, the mobile device  is assigned its own e-mail address, and messages addressed specifically to the mobile device  are automatically redirected to the mobile device  as they are received by the message server .","The message management server  can be used to specifically provide support for the management of messages, such as e-mail messages, that are to be handled by mobile devices. Generally, while messages are still stored on the message server , the message management server  can be used to control when, if, and how messages are sent to the mobile device . The message management server  also facilitates the handling of messages composed on the mobile device , which are sent to the message server  for subsequent delivery.","For example, the message management server  may monitor the user's \u201cmailbox\u201d (e.g. the message store associated with the user's account on the message server ) for new e-mail messages, and apply user-definable filters to new messages to determine if and how the messages are relayed to the user's mobile device . The message management server  may also compress and encrypt new messages (e.g. using an encryption technique such as Data Encryption Standard (DES), Triple DES, or Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)) and push them to the mobile device  via the shared network infrastructure  and the wireless network . The message management server  may also receive messages composed on the mobile device  (e.g. encrypted using Triple DES), decrypt and decompress the composed messages, re-format the composed messages if desired so that they will appear to have originated from the user's computer , and re-route the composed messages to the message server  for delivery.","Certain properties or restrictions associated with messages that are to be sent from and\/or received by the mobile device  can be defined (e.g. by an administrator in accordance with IT policy) and enforced by the message management server . These may include whether the mobile device  may receive encrypted and\/or signed messages, minimum encryption key sizes, whether outgoing messages must be encrypted and\/or signed, and whether copies of all secure messages sent from the mobile device  are to be sent to a pre-defined copy address, for example.","The message management server  may also be adapted to provide other control functions, such as only pushing certain message information or pre-defined portions (e.g. \u201cblocks\u201d) of a message stored on the message server  to the mobile device . For example, in some cases, when a message is initially retrieved by the mobile device  from the message server , the message management server  may push only the first part of a message to the mobile device , with the part being of a pre-defined size (e.g. 2 KB). The user can then request that more of the message be delivered in similar-sized blocks by the message management server  to the mobile device , possibly up to a maximum pre-defined message size. Accordingly, the message management server  facilitates better control over the type of data and the amount of data that is communicated to the mobile device , and can help to minimize potential waste of bandwidth or other resources.","The mobile data server  may encompass any other server that stores information that is relevant to the corporation. The mobile data server  may include, but is not limited to, databases, online data document repositories, customer relationship management (CRM) systems, or enterprise resource planning (ERP) applications.","The contact server  can provide information for a list of contacts for the user in a similar fashion as the address book on the mobile device . Accordingly, for a given contact, the contact server  can include the name, phone number, work address and e-mail address of the contact, among other information. The contact server  can also provide a global address list that contains the contact information for all of the contacts associated with the host system .","It will be understood by persons skilled in the art that the message management server , the mobile data server , the contact server , the device manager module , the data store  and the IT policy server  do not need to be implemented on separate physical servers within the host system . For example, some or all of the functions associated with the message management server  may be integrated with the message server , or some other server in the host system . Alternatively, the host system  may comprise multiple message management servers , particularly in variant implementations where a large number of mobile devices need to be supported.","Alternatively, in some embodiments, the IT policy server  can provide the IT policy editor , the IT user property editor  and the data store . In some cases, the IT policy server  can also provide the device manager module . The processor  can execute the editors  and . In some cases, the functionality of the editors  and  can be provided by a single editor. In some cases, the memory unit  can provide the data store .","The device manager module  provides an IT administrator with a graphical user interface with which the IT administrator interacts to configure various settings for the mobile devices . As mentioned, the IT administrator can use IT policy rules to define behaviors of certain applications on the mobile device  that are permitted such as phone, web browser or Instant Messenger use. The IT policy rules can also be used to set specific values for configuration settings that an organization requires on the mobile devices  such as auto signature text, WLAN\/VoIP\/VPN configuration, security requirements (e.g. encryption algorithms, password rules, etc.), specifying themes or applications that are allowed to run on the mobile device , and the like.","In a variant embodiment, priority preemption to any device associated with the server  used in the enterprise network may be implemented. This includes any voice, data and\/or satellite devices associated with a telephone number of the enterprise network. This allows priority users to preempt existing communications and communicate with certain individuals even though that individual is using a wireless telephone or other remote device. To implement this priority preemption feature, the server  should be programmed to recognize a special dialing pattern, data message or other input from one of the many devices that the high priority user may be using. This unique pattern whether it is a dialing pattern, data message or other input is referred to herein as the preemption signal. The priority preemption signal precedes a telephone number in which the high priority user wishes to call. If the individual associated with the telephone number is already on another call, then the priority preemption may be invoked as follows.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0210","num":"0209"},"figref":"FIG. 12","b":["1200","1200","1202","1204","1206","30","1210","420","1214","30"]},"If the person attempting to preempt the call does not have the highest priority (at ) or if the preemption signal is invalid (at ), then additional call processing may be performed (at ). This additional processing may be a prompt, voice or text message or other alert to the caller to indicate that the preemption cannot occur at this time. The processing may also include a menu of options in which the caller can choose to leave a message, try again, or merely hang up. It should be appreciated that priority preemption may be implemented in any manner desired by the enterprise and that variant embodiments may employ different steps than those illustrated in .","While various embodiments have been specifically described and illustrated herein, it should be apparent to persons skilled in the art that modifications to the embodiments and implementations might be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the embodiments described herein. For example, while embodiments illustrated herein have been generally directed to the processing of voice (packet or circuit switched) calls, it should be readily apparent that any form of call (e.g., audio, video, data) may be processed through server  to any communication device (e.g., cellular phone, pager, office\/residential landline telephone, computer terminal, personal digital assistant (PDA), other mobile or handheld device, etc.). Certain method steps of the example operational flows illustrated in  might be interchanged in order, combined, replaced or even added to without departing from the scope of the embodiments described herein. Moreover, the method steps may be performed by hardware, software, firmware or any combinations of hardware, software, firmware or logic elements.","The acts of the methods and flows described herein may be provided as executable software instructions stored on computer-readable storage media.","The acts of the methods and flows described herein may be provided as executable software instructions stored on transmission-type media.","In addition, while the illustrated embodiments have demonstrated implementations using PBX-based communication systems, it should be readily apparent that the server module may be connected (directly, indirectly, co-located, or remotely) with any other network switching device or communication system used to process calls such as a central switching office, centrex system, or Internet server for telephone calls made over the public switched telephone network, private telephone networks, or even Internet Protocol (IP) telephony networks made over the Internet. It should be understood by those skilled in the art that the embodiments described herein do not need a PBX to operate or to perform any of the processing illustrated in .","It should be apparent that, where PRI lines (e.g., between PBX  and server , between PBX  and PSTN ) have been illustrated in discussing certain embodiments herein, these communication lines (as well as any other communication lines or media discussed herein) may be of any form, format, or medium (e.g., PRI, T1, OC3, electrical, optical, wired, wireless, digital, analog, etc.). Moreover, although PSTN ,  are depicted as separate networks for illustration purposes, it should be readily apparent that a single PSTN network alone may be employed. For example, it should be noted that the server  could trunk back to the PBX  instead of being directly connected to the PSTN . The use of a commercial wireless carrier network (represented by wireless switch  and antenna ) as described herein may be implemented using one or more commercial carriers using the same or different signaling protocols (e.g., Sprint\/Nextel, etc.) depending on the communication devices registered with the system.","The modules described herein such as the modules making up server , as well as server  and PBX  themselves, may be one or more hardware, software, or hybrid components residing in (or distributed among) one or more local or remote systems. It should be readily apparent that the modules may be combined (e.g., server  and PBX ) or further separated into a variety of different components, sharing different resources (including processing units, memory, clock devices, software routines, etc.) as required for the particular implementation of the embodiments disclosed herein. User interface devices utilized by in or in conjunction with server  may be any device used to input and\/or output information. The interface devices may be implemented as a graphical user interface (GUI) containing a display or the like, or may be a link to other user input\/output devices known in the art.","Furthermore, memory units employed by the system may be any one or more of the known storage devices (e.g., Random Access Memory (RAM), Read Only Memory (ROM), hard disk drive (HDD), floppy drive, zip drive, compact disk-ROM, DVD, bubble memory, etc.), and may also be one or more memory devices embedded within a CPU, or shared with one or more of the other components."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["For a better understanding of embodiments of the systems and methods described herein, and to show more clearly how they may be carried into effect, reference will be made, by way of example, to accompanying drawings in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 5A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":["FIG. 5B","FIG. 5A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":["FIGS. 5C-5E","FIG. 5B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIGS. 6A-6H"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIGS. 6I-6J"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 7A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 10","FIG. 8"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 12"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
