Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to an electroconductive material and a method of producing thereof.","2. Description of the Related Art","In recent years, an image display device (display) represented by a liquid crystal display (LCD), a plasma display panel (PDP), an electroluminescence (EL) element and the like have become used widely in various fields such as television sets, computers, various kinds of mobile devices and others that have recently become popular. On the other hand, a solar cell has been focused as an energy source replaceable for fossil energy, and a solar cell with high-performance or the like has been requested to be developed in order to meet further popularization thereof. In these display devices and solar cells, an electroconductive film is used.","Generally, electroconductive films using a metallic material, such as ITO-based electroconductive films, are produced by forming, on a glass substrate, a film from a metallic material by a vapor phase method such as a vacuum deposition method or a sputtering method. Display devices such as portable telephones and mobile instruments have been becoming lighter in weight, and it has been demanded that a display device substrate be shifted from glass to plastic. The introduction of a plastic substrate has reduced the weight of display devices to become half or less in comparison to the convectional products, and a plastic substrate has been remarkably improved in strength and impact resistance.","There, however, is a problem with regard to ITO-based electroconductive films in that the substitution of glass substrates with plastic films results in a decrease in adhesiveness, and making a substrate and a formed electroconductive film prone to easily peel apart from each other. Moreover, metallic materials, such as ITO, are ordinarily formed into a film by using a vapor phase method such as sputtering, so that an expensive production apparatus needs to be used.","As an electroconductive material replaceable for these, a coating type electroconductive material including a \u03c0-electron conjugated polymer that is an electroconductive polymer, a silver nano-wire, and a carbon material such as a carbon nano-tube or a grapheme is known. The use of an electroconductive polymer allows a conductive thin film to be formed by coating and offers the advantage that a conductive thin film may be inexpensively produced. Moreover, an electrode made of an electroconductive polymer is more flexible and less brittle than ITO electrodes, and it therefore is less prone to break even though it is used for flexible items. Accordingly, it is advantageous to apply an electrode made of an electroconductive polymer to touch panels that specifically require high flexibility, since lifetime may be extended in view of durability and reliability of apparatuses.","As such an electroconductive polymer, polythiophene containing polyanion has been developed, and a technique for forming an electroconductive film by using this polymer is disclosed in the specification of European Patent No. 440957. It, however, has become clear that this electroconductive film is slightly weaker in durability than ITO films and the like and that it may not achieve a durability sufficient for practical use in some applications. In particular, when the electroconductive films are used for a display device, durability against light is important, that is, transparency or electrical conductivity is required not to be lowered even after the films are irradiated with light of a certain level or more. In addition to that, the electrical conductivity has been found to be also lowered by an action of humidity or heat.","Further, these electroconductive films are poor in adhesion in some cases and have been found not to have practically sufficient adhesion in a certain application. Therefore, an attempt of improving the adhesion by using the electroconductive films in combination with an adhesive layer is disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (JP-A) No. 2007-510807.","However, also in this case, practically sufficient adhesion and durability have been found not to be attained in a certain application.","A first aspect of the present invention provides an electroconductive material, having: a support; at least one electroconductive layer on or above the support; and an adhesive layer containing at least two binder resins between the support and the electroconductive layer.","A second aspect of the present invention provides a method of producing an electroconductive material according to claim , the method including: biaxially drawing process in which a support made of polyester; an adhesive layer forming process in which an aqueous coating liquid for forming an adhesive layer is coated by coating on at least one face of the support after the drawing, and dried; and drying; and an electroconductive layer forming process.","Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in detail. The denotation \u201cto\u201d in this specification means the numerals before and after \u201cto\u201d, both inclusive as the minimum value and the maximum value, respectively.","In the related arts so far disclosed, adhesion has been improved by combining the electroconductive layer with an adhesive layer. However, an electroconductive film is expected to have a still improved adhesion in practical applications. Durability is also expected to be improved.","In particular, in an application such as touch panels, a high adhesion is requested to be secured even at the time when pressing force is applied repeatedly by fingers or the like. Further, the electrical conductive material is sometimes placed outside of the room, so that durabilities against light, humidity and heat are expected to be improved.","Considering the above circumstances, the present inventors have made extensive studies and reached an unexpected finding that a specific configuration of an adhesive layer has a large influence on the durabilities of the conductive material. Base on this finding, with further studies, the present invention has been accomplished.","The electroconductive material of the present invention has at least one electroconductive layer on or above a support, and an adhesive layer which contains at least two binder resins between the support and the electroconductive layer.","By incorporating, between the support and the electroconductive layer, the adhesive layer that contains at least two binder resins, the electroconductive material exhibits more excellent adhesion and durabilities as compared with conventional electroconductive materials. Further, \u201cdurability\u201d in the present invention refers to such a property that the change in the surface resistance is small after the material is exposed to light or experiences humidity or heat.","A specific example of a layered configuration of the electroconductive material is shown in .","The electroconductive material shown in  has an electroconductive layer  on a support , and between the support  and the electroconductive layer , an adhesive layer .","In , the electroconductive material having one electroconductive layer on a support is shown, but two or more electroconductive layers may be incorporated therein. Also, an electroconductive material having one adhesive layer  is shown, but two or more adhesive layers may be incorporated therein. Further, an UV-light absorbing layer or an electroconductive layer may be incorporated, also plural layers thereof may be incorporated. Still further, a protective layer or an intermediate layer may be incorporated, also plural layers thereof may be incorporated. From the viewpoint of improving durabilities, the UV-light absorbing layer or the protective layer (overcoat layer) may be preferably incorporated.","Hereinafter, the configuration of each component of the electroconductive material according to the present invention will be described.","<Electroconductive Layer>","The electroconductive material used in the present invention is a material that exhibits an electrical conductivity of 10S\u00b7cmor higher.

In particular, a biaxially drawn film that is drawn in longitudinal and lateral directions by from 2 to 5 times respectively is preferable. When the draw ratio is in the above range, sufficient mechanical strength and uniform thickness may be obtained.","The thickness of the support is, from the viewpoint of the handling ability of the support and the miniaturization or weight saving of display devices, and further considering cost, preferably from 30 \u03bcm to 500 \u03bcm and more preferably from 100 \u03bcm to 300 \u03bcm.","The support  is preferably subjected to corona discharge treatment, ozone treatment or the like in order to have a higher adhesion to the adhesive layer .","<Adhesive Layer>","The adhesive layer is a layer that is laminated on or above the support .
