abstract: An antifuse apparatus can include a cantilever extending from a first electrode portion to terminate in a distal end. A second electrode portion can be spaced apart from the cantilever by an air gap. In response to a program voltage across the first and second electrode portions, the cantilever can be adapted to move from an unprogrammed condition, corresponding to an open circuit condition where the cantilever is spaced apart from the second electrode portion, to at least one permanent programmed condition, corresponding to a short circuit condition between the first and second electrode portions where the cantilever engages the second electrode portion.

The United States government has certain rights in the invention.","This disclosure relates to nanoelectromechanical antifuses and related systems.","Antifuses are one-time-programmable (OTP) two-terminal interconnect devices. An antifuse has high initial resistance (e.g., open circuit) condition until a programming signal changes it irreversibly to a low resistance condition. It has been extensively employed as an economical and convenient solution in complex logic integrated circuits (ICs) for improved functionality and flexibility, and thus widely used in non-volatile memories and OTP secure field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). For example, antifuse-based FPGAs offer higher security stemming primarily from their non-volatility. It secures a design due to piracy and difficulty in determining the state of an antifuse that protects against direct physical attack. While many existing antifuse-based FPGAs provide desired security, there exist limitations and challenges relating to high leakage power, increasing security requirements (e.g., against potential attack in the form of reprogramming), and scalability to advanced technology nodes. For instance, many mission critical applications (e.g., military and aerospace) require devices with high programming speed, low power, tolerance to radiation and harsh environment, and high resistance to attacks.","This disclosure relates to nanoelectromechanical antifuses and related systems.","As an example, an antifuse apparatus can include a cantilever extending from a first electrode portion to terminate in a distal end. A second electrode portion can be spaced apart from the cantilever by an air gap. In response to a program voltage across the first and second electrode portions, the cantilever can be adapted to move from an unprogrammed condition, corresponding to an open circuit condition where the cantilever is spaced apart from the second electrode portion, to at least one permanent programmed condition, corresponding to a short circuit condition between the first and second electrode portions where the cantilever engages the second electrode portion.","As another example, a system can include an arrangement of logic blocks. A matrix of interconnects can extend between the logic blocks, at least some of the interconnects intersecting with each other interconnects in the matrix to define intersections. A plurality of nanoelectromechanical antifuses can be implemented at some of the intersections to provide a one-time programmable connection or open circuit between respective interconnects depending on the state of the nanoelectromechanical antifuse at each respective intersection. In some examples, the system can be a field programmable gate array and other examples it can be a memory device.","This disclosure relates to a nanoelectromechanical (NEMS) antifuse and to systems that can utilize such antifuses. The NEMS antifuses can serve as interconnect building blocks for making secure integrated circuits, such as one-time programmable (OTP) memory cells and OTP field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). As disclosed herein, the NEMS antifuse is based on electrostatically actuated nanocantilevers, such as can be fabricated from silicon carbide (SiC). The NEMS antifuse can include two or more terminals according to the desired function to be employed. For example, a two-terminal antifuse can provide an OTP connection between a pair of interconnects in an integrated circuit. As another example, a three terminal antifuse can provide an OTP connection to set a state of a memory cell while also providing another terminal to read the state value of the cell. As compared to metal-metal antifuses, NEMS antifuses can exhibit very low programming voltage, high current density, abrupt switching, small footprints and long term stability. Thus, NEMS antifuses provide new opportunities for designing low-power, high security and harsh environment operable logic circuits and systems.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIGS. 1A and 1B","b":["10","10","12","14","12","16","18","20","16","12","12"]},"The cantilever  can extend along a central axis  in its unprogrammed condition shown in , and have a contact surface  that is substantially planar. The contact surface  is located opposite a corresponding surface  of the second electrode portion . The contact surface  cantilever  thus can be spaced apart from the surface  by an air gap, demonstrated at  in its unprogrammed condition. In the example of , the first electrode portion  can correspond to a source terminal and the second electrode portion can correspond to a gate terminal of the two-terminal antifuse apparatus .","The cantilever  can be adapted to move from its unprogrammed condition, corresponding to an open circuit where the air gap  spaces apart the cantilever from the gate electrode portion . The resistance between the gate and source terminals in the unprogrammed condition can be greater than about 10 G\u03a9. In response to applying a program voltage demonstrated at Vto the gate electrode  electrostatic forces can generate between the gate electrode portion  and the cantilever  to cause the cantilever  to move out of its axis , and into permanent contact with the surface  of the gate electrode portion , as shown in . That is, a corresponding end portion of the cantilever  remains in contact with the gate electrode portion  after the program voltage Vhas been removed. The cantilever remains in contact with the gate electrode portion  because the adhesion force between the surface  and the surface  exceeds the mechanical restoring force.","As an example, the adhesion force between two contact surfaces  and  is proportional to the contact area (e.g., a first order equation can be given by Fa=(Ha*Area)\/(6*pi*d), where Ha, pi are constants and d is the distance between two surfaces). The restoring force of the cantilever  depends on the spring constant k (which depends on the cantilever dimensions: length, width and thickness) for a given material and the beam displacement. The NEMS AF device  is thus designed to have a large contact area and a thickness that sufficient to create adhesion force that exceeds the restoring force. This is in sharp contrast to typical NEMS logic switches where there usually is a very small contact area to reduce the adhesion force.","The apparatus  can also include control block  that is configured to control the application of the program voltage Vto the electrode portion  for programming the antifuse apparatus  from its open circuit condition () to its closed short circuit condition (). The control block can activate the gate voltage to provide a pull-in voltage (V) that is sufficient to create an electrostatic force to urge the distal end portion of the cantilever  into permanent contact with the gate electrode portion .","By way of example, a SiC NEMS antifuse can be fabricated starting with an Si wafer that has a layer (e.g., about 500 nm thermally-grown) of SiO. A layer of polycrystalline SiC (poly-SiC) can be deposited using LPCVD or another deposition technique. A mask (e.g., applied via sputtering PMMA) can be employed to define the pattern with wafer-scale electron beam lithography (EBL). The pattern can be transferred to the SiC layer using reactive ion etching. The suspended cantilever can then be released via an etching of the patterned SiO(e.g., etching with vapor HF) to provide the OTP NEMS antifuse apparatus .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"sub":["G ","PI ","G","PI","G ","G","PI"],"b":["10","12","14","16","14"]},"Referring back to , in the device operation, the movable cantilever  can be grounded at its clamping point via the source electrode  to provide a voltage potential reference with respect to the program electrode .

One potential attack an antifuse may encounter is reprogramming. For instance, since conventional antifuses that have two states (open circuit or conductive ON), there exists an opportunity for hardware attackers to reprogram one or more unprogrammed antifuses, which can compromise the circuitry implementing the antifuses. The NEMS antifuse design in  addresses this issue by introducing a third state (e.g., having an open circuit unprogrammed state, a programmed short circuit state and a programmed open circuit state). Thus, the example NEMS antifuse  can increase hardware security since it can include one unprogrammed state and two different programmed states. In particular, the NEMS antifuse  provides one programmed state that provides a permanently short circuit between the interconnects and another programmed state that provides a permanent open circuit between a pair of interconnects. As demonstrated in the example of , the antifuse  includes two gates for programming in both directions. Thus, if a given antifuse in an IC should remain open (e.g., unprogrammed), the given antifuse can be programmed to permanently connect to the electrode on the other side to provide a permanently open circuit. This can prevent reprogramming attacks for the given antifuse since the programmed open circuit condition is connection is irreversible.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 7"],"b":["200","200","200","202","204","204","206","200","208"]},"It is understood that each of the antifuses  in the example of  can be implemented according to any of the examples shown and described herein (e.g., antifuses ,  and ).

For instance, a read sweep voltage VD1 can be applied across the drain electrode  and source electrode  to determine the state of the cell. Depending on the dimensions of the respective contact areas and the thickness of the cantilever, the cell  can also be used to implement a one-time or multiple-time programmable nonvolatile memory for regular or harsh environment applications, depending on choice of materials. For instance, SiC beams can be used for harsh environment application. In this case, the gate electrode G  can be used for active pull-off after the cantilever encounters stiction to the top electrode(s)  and .","It will be appreciated that a NEMS antifuse has the intrinsic advantage of near-zero leakage or off-state current due to the air gaps in the device structure. For example, the measured off-state current can as low as 10 fA or lower, which is the noise floor of the measurement system. This indicates that the ultimate leakage or off-state current is well below this level. The programming voltage can be further adjusted to a desired level such as by scaling the actuation gaps between the gate electrode and the cantilever. The active area for NEMS antifuses is estimated by including the actuation gaps, G and cantilever beam width but no connecting pads, which are only needed for accessing individual devices in the characterization stage. For large network of antifuses the pads can be eliminated to achieve large scale integration. The device volume is calculated by multiplying the active area and the SiC film thickness.","In view of the foregoing, the NEMS antifuse provides robust antifuse structure. The NEMS antifuse can as interconnect building blocks for secure OTP FPGAs as well as OTP memory devices. The NEMS antifuses can have very low programming voltage, high current density, abrupt switching, small footprints and long term stability. NEMS antifuses can also offer significant improvement in power consumption relative to other antifuse-based systems (e.g., metal-metal antifuse FPGA circuitry). NEMS antifuses further will facilitate designing low-power, high security and harsh environment operable logic circuits and systems.","What have been described above are examples.
